    "content": "The United States is a global leader in energy production, consumption, and technology. Its energy market is sophisticated, with prices determined by supply and demand. The country produces oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear power, and renewable energy. Since the 21st century, the U.S. energy sector has shifted from declining to growing production, with rising exports and falling imports. Changes in prices, technology, and regulations have influenced the energy mix. This report offers an overview of U.S. energy issues and serves as a resource for related information. Energy policy in the United States focuses on ensuring a secure energy supply, keeping costs low, and protecting the environment. Government programs aim to improve energy efficiency, promote domestic energy production, and develop new energy sources like advanced nuclear and renewables. Controversies arise due to differing priorities in implementing these programs. Energy policy in the United States is controversial due to varying stakeholder priorities, such as dependence on energy imports and the use of fossil fuels. Debates also revolve around government intervention in the energy sector. Legislation like the Energy Policy Act of 2005 addresses these issues in comprehensive bills. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set new fuel economy standards and expanded the renewable fuels standard. In the 114th Congress, energy legislation was considered, including the Energy Policy and Modernization Act and the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act. In the 114th Congress, energy legislation included bills addressing energy efficiency, water conservation, nonfederal hydropower, electric grid cybersecurity, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In the 115th Congress, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was opened to oil and gas development under the 2017 tax revision. In the 115th Congress, energy-related bills have been introduced, including S. 1460, which covers energy efficiency, supply, and infrastructure. Other bills focus on coordinating federal agencies for energy-efficient IT, assisting states with emergency energy planning, and storing nuclear waste temporarily. The United States ranks second in energy production and consumption globally, after China. The United States ranks second in energy production and consumption globally, behind China. U.S. primary energy consumption has remained steady since 2000, with changes in the fuel mix. Electric power generation in 2017 came from coal, natural gas, nuclear, renewables, and petroleum. Industrial energy use has also seen some changes, but not as significant as in the electricity sector. Energy production in the United States has increased by 23% between 2000 and 2017, with renewable energy showing the largest growth at 83%. Petroleum still dominates transportation fuel at 92%, down from 97% in 2000. Oil and natural gas production have also increased significantly, while coal production has declined by 31%. Coal production has declined by about 31% during the time period. Federal lands contribute significantly to U.S. energy production, with 24% of crude oil, 13% of natural gas, and 40% of coal coming from federal lands in 2017. The balance between energy production and other resource values on federal lands has been a longstanding issue for Congress. Many federal lands are open to energy exploration and development, but certain areas like National Parks and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are withdrawn from such activities. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was opened to oil and gas development under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Energy resources on federal lands are governed by various acts, including the Mineral Leasing Act and the Geothermal Steam Act. Solar and wind energy development on BLM and FS lands is regulated under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Offshore federal resources are also available for exploration and development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages energy resources on federal lands, including offshore areas, under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA). BLM oversees solar, wind, and geothermal energy programs on millions of acres, with geothermal capacity on federal lands accounting for 40% of U.S. total capacity. While oil production on federal lands increased by 47% from 2008 to 2017, the share of total U.S. crude oil production from federal lands decreased due to higher production on nonfederal lands. U.S. crude oil production from federal lands decreased to about 24% in 2017, while natural gas production on federal lands fell by nearly 32% to 4.3 TCF since 2008. The share of gross natural gas withdrawals from federal lands also decreased to 13% in 2017. Shale gas plays have primarily been on nonfederal lands, attracting significant investment for natural gas development. The Mineral Leasing Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to lease subsurface rights on BLM and FS lands for fossil fuel development. In 2017, BLM recorded production on 12.8 million acres of federal land leased for oil and gas development. Offshore oil and gas leasing programs are specified by OCSLA, administered by BOEM with 2,700 active leases on over 14 million acres. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) administers an energy leasing program for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf (OCS), with approximately 2,700 active leases covering over 14 million acres. The current five-year leasing program (2017-2022) includes 11 lease sales in 6% of the OCS planning areas, accounting for 80% of the undiscovered technically recoverable resources (UTRR). The Trump Administration's new 5-Year Leasing Program proposal for 2019-2024 aims to have 47 lease sales covering 90% of the acreage and 98% of the UTRR in the OCS planning areas. The U.S. OCS contains significant undiscovered oil and gas resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. Alaska's Chukchi and Beaufort Seas also have substantial reserves. Congress debates issues regarding offshore oil and gas exploration, including access to ocean areas. The federal coal leasing program on public domain lands has been a significant source of coal production in the U.S., accounting for about 40% of total production. President Obama implemented a moratorium on federal coal leasing in 2016 to evaluate the program's modernization. The Secretary of the Interior directed BLM to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) of the coal leasing program for a comprehensive review. The Trump Administration lifted the moratorium on federal coal leasing, drawing both support and opposition in Congress. Secretary of the Interior Zinke revoked Secretarial Order 3338, ending work on the PEIS and directing BLM to continue processing coal leasing applications on federal land. Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source. Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source managed by BLM on federal lands, representing 40% of U.S. total geothermal capacity. Wind and solar projects may require large land tracts and new transmission capacity. Congress faces issues on how to prioritize solar and wind project applications and manage the leasing process. In 2016, BLM finalized amendments to regulations governing the process. In December 2016, BLM finalized amendments to regulations governing solar and wind energy development, including competitive right-of-way leases. Woody biomass removal for energy production on federal lands has potential for widespread availability and is a focus for energy and wildfire management. Past efforts focused on policy principles, research, infrastructure, and capacity building. FS and BLM award research grants for woody biomass utilization, with programs like stewardship contracting and collaborative forest restoration enabling implementation. BOEM manages renewable ocean energy resources. BOEM manages renewable ocean energy resources, estimating resources for offshore wind, thermal power, and ocean tides/waves. 13 offshore wind energy leases have been issued in various coastal areas. The Block Island Wind Farm off Rhode Island is a successful 30-MW wind farm. Congress considers supporting offshore wind with grants, loan guarantees, tax credits, and regulatory oversight. The federal government collects revenues from onshore and offshore energy development through various laws, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, providing revenue-sharing with coastal states. Companies pay bonus bids, rents, royalties, and fees for energy development rights. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) provides revenue-sharing with Gulf coastal states, giving them 37.5% of revenues on qualified leases up to $375 million annually. Additionally, federal offshore oil and gas revenues are directed to specific programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act and the Historic Preservation Fund. GOMESA also allocates 12.5% of revenues to the LWCF state assistance program, up to $125 million annually. Remaining offshore revenues go to the U.S. Treasury, while the State of Alaska receives 90% of onshore fossil energy lease revenues under the Mineral Leasing Act. The Mineral Leasing Act allocates revenue from federal onshore fossil energy leases, with Alaska receiving 90% (excluding ANWR) and other states receiving 50% (minus 2% cost-sharing deduction). For geothermal energy, states receive 50%, counties receive 25%, and the U.S. Treasury receives 25%. Wind and solar energy revenues on federal land are deposited entirely in the U.S. Treasury. Production of oil in the United States increased from 2000-2017, mainly from unconventional formations. Petroleum is primarily used in transportation, industry, residential/commercial sectors, and electric power generation. Transportation heavily relies on petroleum, making fuel efficiency crucial for energy policy. Energy independence and security are closely tied to petroleum. The refining industry processes crude oil to produce transportation fuels. The United States is the top producer of refined petroleum products, with transportation fuels making up most of the product mix. Despite a decline in the number of refineries, refining capacity has increased by 13% since 2000 due to capital investment in new technologies. Refineries are becoming larger and more efficient, with high utilization rates in the industry. The oil and natural gas industries, including production and refining, supported about 10.3 million jobs and accounted for 8% of U.S. gross domestic product in 2015. The refining industry draws on crude oil supplies from around. The U.S. refining industry relies on crude oil from global and domestic sources. Data from 2000 to 2008 shows a decline in U.S. crude oil production and an increase in imports, particularly from OPEC. However, starting in 2009, U.S. production began to rise, leading to a decrease in imports from OPEC and an increase in energy security. This shift prompted calls to lift restrictions on oil production. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 lifted restrictions on crude oil exports, leading to a rise in exports. The U.S. refining industry also exports refined products, making the U.S. a net exporter of petroleum products since 2011. U.S. dependence on the world market for petroleum products has been declining since 2007. The U.S. refining industry allocates over 28% of its capacity to supply buyers in the world market. U.S. dependence on imported oil is distorted due to crude oil imports entering the refining industry and re-entering the world market as petroleum product exports. Changing U.S. tariff policy could impact the refining industry, affecting imports, exports, consumer prices, and risking retaliation. Oil prices and availability are also influenced by these factors. Oil prices have fluctuated significantly over the years, impacting the refining industry's economic performance. Prices peaked at over $140 per barrel in 2008, dropped to below $40 in 2009, rose above $100 in the early 2010s, and hit a low of less than $30 in 2016. As of September 2018, the price was around $70 per barrel. Refiners require a predictable oil price to make pricing decisions, balancing profitability for producers and encouraging consumption. Environmental concerns, such as pollution, also affect the industry. Environmental concerns impact the refining industry, leading to slow and expensive permitting processes for new refineries. The United States became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, with increased production due to advancements in technologies like hydraulic fracturing. Shale gas has become economically competitive, enabling large-scale exports. The United States became a net exporter of natural gas in 2017, with increased production due to advancements in technologies like hydraulic fracturing, making shale gas economically competitive for large-scale exports. U.S. consumption of natural gas grew over 16% from 2000 to 2017, but exports became necessary as production outpaced consumption. Production and imports of natural gas exceeded consumption and exports in 2017, with the U.S. being the world's largest producer of natural gas. The United States saw a decline in natural gas production in 2016, the first since 2005. The increase in production from 2005 to 2017 was mainly due to shale gas development in the Marcellus and Utica formations. The U.S. is the largest consumer of natural gas globally, with significant usage in electric power generation. Low prices and policies promoting lower emissions have led to a rise in natural gas use for power generation, with demand growing by nearly 80%. Demand for natural gas for power generation has grown nearly 80% since 2000 and is expected to continue increasing through 2050. The U.S. industrial sector has also increased its consumption of natural gas by 16% between 2010 and 2017, with the majority of growth in consumption expected to come from this sector. The expansion of the U.S. natural gas resource base will provide the industrial sector with more fuel and feedstock choices, potentially leading to further growth in manufacturing industries. The rise in natural gas prices incentivized bringing more domestic gas to market, reducing the need for LNG import terminals, with imports in 2017 being 34% below their peak in 2007. The U.S. natural gas industry has seen a shift towards export terminals due to increased production. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) have gained importance as dry gas prices dropped, leading to more wet gas production. NGL products have historically been priced against oil. Natural gas is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, producing fewer emissions of greenhouse gases than coal. Its combustion does not produce sulfur oxides or other hazardous air pollutants, except for NOx. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) have been priced against oil historically, driving an increase in wet gas production. The release of methane from natural gas production is a significant concern due to its potent greenhouse gas effects. As the use of natural gas expands in the US, policymakers are focusing on reducing methane emissions. The electric power industry is undergoing transformation with aging infrastructure, uncertainty about modernizing the grid, and concerns about cybersecurity threats and renewable energy sources. Environmental regulations and rising electricity prices further complicate reliability issues. The electric power sector in the United States faces challenges with reliability and electricity prices due to environmental regulations and the increasing use of unconventional resources like shale gas. Congress and states play significant roles in shaping policies, including tax credits for renewable energy and renewable portfolio standards. The sector consists of power plants, transmission lines, and distribution systems that deliver electricity to end-users. Demand for electricity is immediate as it is rarely stored in bulk. Approximately two-thirds of U.S. electricity consumers live in regions with competitive wholesale electricity markets, while the remaining third are served by utilities under a traditional model. The dominant sources of electric power generation in the United States are combustible fossil fuels like natural gas and coal, along with nuclear power. The major sources of electricity in the United States are nuclear power, wind turbines, hydropower, solar panels, and geothermal energy. Fossil fuels like coal and natural gas have historically been the cheapest options for electricity generation, accounting for about two-thirds of electricity production since 2000. Large-scale energy storage technologies are not widely available yet, so electricity must be used as soon as it is produced. Since 2000, fossil fuels have dominated electricity generation in the United States, with coal and natural gas accounting for about two-thirds of production. Natural gas surpassed coal in 2016 due to changing economics and advancements in technology, leading to the decline of older coal plants. Regional resources and state policies have also influenced the shift in power generation. The use of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling technology since 2008 has increased the supply of natural gas, leading to cheaper prices and a shift away from coal for power generation. Energy efficiency improvements have decoupled electricity demand from economic growth over the last 60 years, with projections showing a continued decline in electricity use relative to GDP. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) does not expect a return to the past trend where electricity use growth exceeded economic growth due to factors like slowing population growth and improved efficiency of appliances. Demand for electricity has been flat for years, delaying the need for new power plants. Projections show declining demand growth in most regions of the United States. The electric power sector in the United States is a significant source of air pollution, emitting pollutants like mercury, sulfur dioxide, and greenhouse gases. In 2016, it accounted for 28% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions, down from 34% in 2008. The Clean Air Act amendments have led to evolving environmental regulations to limit emissions and reduce health and environmental impacts. The Trump Administration has proposed regulatory changes to previous rules. The EPA under President Trump has proposed changes to regulations impacting electric power sector emissions, including the replacement of the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. The ACE rule focuses on improving plant efficiency and allows states more flexibility in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The ACE rule aims to give states more control over reducing GHG emissions from power plants and revises the New Source Review permitting process. It is suggested that the replacement of the CPP with the ACE rule may result in more coal-burning plants staying open, but doubts exist about its impact on coal plant retirements. The EPA estimates a slight decrease in CO2 emissions under the ACE rule by 2030. Some states may see an increase in CO2 emissions due to the ACE rule potentially leading to more coal plant operation. Utilities are increasing renewable energy use to address environmental concerns, but challenges exist with integrating variable sources like wind and solar into the grid. Nuclear power is seen as a carbon-free option. The Trump Administration aims to support the coal industry. The Trump Administration aims to revive the U.S. coal industry by rolling back regulations. Factors like higher coal prices and lower inventories could make coal more competitive for electricity generation. The U.S. has the largest coal reserves in the world, with about 254 billion short tons of recoverable domestic coal reserves. The role of coal in the U.S. energy supply remains uncertain. The federal government owns one-third of U.S. coal reserves, with over half located in the West. Wyoming and Montana account for 42% of reserves. Top producing states are Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Coal production peaked in 2008 at 1.17 billion short tons but has since declined due to competition from natural gas. Production fell by 28% in 2015 and 2016. Short-term projections show production below 800 million tons in 2018 and 2019. Demand for coal has softened due to utilities choosing low-cost natural gas and renewable energy options, along with regulatory costs for coal-fired power plants. In 2017, coal exports increased significantly to 96.9 million short tons, driven by higher demand from Asian countries like India. Coal mining employment has fluctuated, declining from 169,300 in 1985 to 51,796 in 2016. The number of coal mines and coal mining firms in the United States has significantly decreased over the years. Coal consumption peaked in 2007 but has been declining since 2012, reaching a low of 729 million short tons in 2016. The EIA projects further decline in coal consumption to be below 700 million short tons through 2019. Power generation remains the primary market for coal. The EIA projects a long-term decline in coal consumption for power generation in the U.S., with natural gas and renewable energy replacing coal. In 2016, natural gas surpassed coal as the top energy source for power generation. Coal consumption is expected to range from less than 400 million to about 800 million short tons per year by 2050. The coal industry in the U.S. is projected to have a declining or flat trend in the future, with coal being a smaller part of the energy mix. There is a focus on penetrating the overseas coal market to offset declining domestic demand. Coal exports are expected to decrease in the short term but increase to 85 million tons annually by 2040. Export growth may be hindered by infrastructure bottlenecks. Key factors influencing future coal exports include the construction of export terminals, especially for coal from the Powder River Basin. The Powder River Basin (PRB) in Wyoming and Montana is a major source of met coal for steel production. The European market for coal has seen a recent uptick in imports from the United States. PRB coal is exported from Canadian terminals but capacity is limited. Producers are looking for new export links to the Asian market through the Pacific Northwest, with three port terminal projects in Washington and Oregon facing permit applications. Several coal export terminal projects in Washington and Oregon have faced permit applications with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Two projects, Gateway Pacific Terminal and Coyote Island Terminal, were cancelled due to permit denials. The Millennium Bulk Terminal's application for a Clean Water Act Certification was rejected by Washington State's Department of Ecology. The U.S. coal industry is concentrated with major producers in five states. In 2016, the top five coal mining companies in the U.S. were responsible for 53% of coal production, led by Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal, Inc. Three of the top producers filed for bankruptcy between 2015 and 2016, with over 50 coal producers filing for bankruptcy in total. The top two largest producers, accounting for 33% of U.S. coal production, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2016, Arch Coal, ANR Inc., and Peabody Energy emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, shedding substantial debt. The coal industry faces challenges in securing financing for new projects and becoming profitable. Congressional interest remains in the role of coal in meeting energy needs, alongside debates on U.S. energy policy and environmental regulations. Nuclear power supplied 20% of U.S. electricity in 2017, behind coal and natural gas. The U.S. nuclear industry supplied 20% of electricity in 2017, with 98 reactors operating at 59 plant sites. Nuclear power generated electricity at 92.2% capacity in 2017. Despite strong operational performance, the industry has faced challenges with seven reactors permanently closed since 2013. Since 2013, seven reactors have permanently closed, with 12 more set to close by the mid-2020s. The cancellation of two new reactors at the Summer plant site in South Carolina in 2017 has contributed to the financial challenges faced by nuclear power plants that sell electricity at competitive market prices. These plants have seen falling wholesale power prices and stagnant demand, leading to concerns about the viability of operating in power markets. Nuclear power is undervalued in electricity markets, despite its importance in diversifying power supply and reducing CO2 emissions. States like New York and Illinois are providing incentives to preserve nuclear plants, while federal incentives like investment tax credits are also being proposed and extended. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the energy production tax credit. Some argue that drawbacks of nuclear power, such as accident risk and high costs, outweigh its benefits. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are seen as more effective in reducing carbon emissions. Most nuclear power reactors in the US began operating before 1990 and have been issued 20-year license renewals, extending their operating life to at least the 2030s. Federal policies supporting renewable energy date back to the mid-1970s, following the 1973 oil embargo. While originally focused on energy security, the current debate now centers on environmental policies, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy consumption in the US has increased significantly since 2000. Renewable energy consumption in the US has increased significantly since 2000, with a 113% increase between 2001 and 2017. The contribution of renewable energy to total primary energy more than doubled during this period, rising from 5.4% to approximately 11.3%. Different forms of renewable energy, such as hydroelectric, biofuels, wind, solar, and geothermal, are used in various sectors including electric power, industrial, transportation, residential, and commercial. Each renewable energy source has unique market and policy considerations. The contribution of different renewable energy sources to each sector varies, with hydro mostly consumed in the electric power sector and biomass energy generation dominating the industrial sector. Renewable energy consumption has grown significantly since 2001, mainly in the electric power and transportation sectors. The industrial sector is the second-largest consumer of renewable energy, primarily biomass-generated. The report does not provide detailed descriptions or analysis of each renewable energy source or consumption sector, focusing instead on renewable transportation fuels and electricity. Renewable transportation fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, have seen growth in production and consumption in the United States over the last 16 years. This growth is attributed to the establishment and expansion of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates that U.S. transportation fuel contain renewable sources. Ethanol is primarily used as a blending component in motor gasoline, while biodiesel serves as a direct substitute for diesel fuel refined from petroleum. The Renewable Fuel Standard has led to a significant increase in U.S. ethanol and biodiesel production and consumption. Ethanol production grew from 1.8 billion gallons in 2001 to nearly 16 billion gallons in 2017, while biodiesel production increased from 9 million to 1.6 billion gallons during the same period. Renewable electricity generation in the U.S. doubled between 2001 and 2017, with renewables contributing 17% to the power sector in 2017. Renewable electricity generation in the U.S. has seen significant growth, with non-hydro renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass driving the increase. State and federal policies, along with tax incentives, have played a key role in making renewable energy financially attractive for investors and power purchasers. This, combined with technology cost declines and efficiency improvements, has led to the widespread adoption of non-hydro renewable sources for electricity generation. Between 2001 and 2017, non-hydro renewable energy sources in the United States, such as wind and solar, significantly increased their contribution to total electric power generation. Wind energy generation grew by a factor of 37, while solar energy generation increased by a factor of 97 during this period. Non-hydro renewable electricity installations, mainly solar and wind, have surpassed coal in new utility-scale electric power capacity additions. The growth of non-hydro renewable energy sources like wind and solar in the United States has outpaced coal and natural gas combined since 2014. In 2017, half of new capacity additions were from non-hydro renewables, attributed to factors like tax credit incentives, cost reductions, and a mature electricity market. The U.S. electric power sector is experiencing slow growth due to flat demand, leading to decreased need for new power generation capacity. Renewable electricity, including solar energy, is making significant contributions to annual capacity additions. Distributed solar generation has grown rapidly, driven by policy and market factors. The rapid growth of distributed solar generation in the U.S. is attributed to state-level policies, federal tax incentives, decreasing costs of solar equipment, price competition with retail prices, and solar leasing business models. The U.S. government agencies involved in overseeing energy infrastructure include the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other relevant departments. The U.S. government agencies involved in overseeing energy infrastructure include the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
