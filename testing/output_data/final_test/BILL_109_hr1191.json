The National Marine Scholarship Program, established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, aims to recruit and prepare students for careers in marine fields. The National Marine Scholarship Program, established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, awards scholarships for academic programs in marine science. Recipients must fulfill an employment obligation by serving as full-time employees of the Administration in a needed position for a specified period. The scholarship recipient must fulfill an employment obligation by working full-time in a Federal agency related to the marine environment. To be eligible, the individual must be a full-time graduate student in a relevant academic program, a US citizen or permanent resident, and not an employee of the Administration at the time of the award. Eligible academic programs and fields of study are specified in a list provided by the program. The Administrator will publish a list of eligible academic programs and fields of study for the scholarships. Scholarships will be awarded based on academic merit, with consideration for promoting diversity and financial need. The scholarship application process requires submission of necessary information to the Administrator. Scholarship limits include a maximum of 2 academic years for a master's degree and 4 academic years for a doctorate program, with a waiver option available. The scholarship amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance. The cost of the scholarship is determined according to the Higher Education Act of 1965. Scholarship funds can only be used for tuition, fees, and other authorized expenses. The Administrator can make direct payments to the institution for these expenses. The period of service for employment obligation is specified, except in certain circumstances. The Administrator determines the obligated service for scholarship recipients, which must begin within 60 days of obtaining the educational degree. The Administrator can defer the start of service if deemed appropriate, with regulations outlining the terms for deferral. The scholarship recipient's service obligation can be deferred under certain circumstances. Failure to meet academic requirements, disciplinary dismissal, or voluntary termination of academic training before graduation constitutes a breach of the contractual agreement. The scholarship recipient must repay all amounts received if they breach the contractual agreement, and they will not have to fulfill any employment obligation. Failure to fulfill the employment obligation constitutes a breach of the agreement. The scholarship recipient must repay all amounts received if they breach the contractual agreement by failing to begin or complete their employment obligation or comply with deferment terms. The penalty for breach is repayment of the total scholarship amount within 3 years. The scholarship recipient must repay all amounts received if they breach the contractual agreement by failing to begin or complete their employment obligation or comply with deferment terms. The penalty for breach is repayment of the total scholarship amount within 3 years. Any obligation of an individual incurred under this section for service or payment shall be canceled upon the death of the individual. The Administrator shall provide for the waiver or suspension of any obligation. The Administrator may waive or suspend employment or payment obligations if compliance is impossible or would cause extreme hardship, or if enforcement would be against the Government's best interests. A report to Congress is required every 2 years on the effectiveness of the National Marine Scholarship Program in increasing marine science-related professionals. The National Marine Scholarship Program aims to prepare scholarship recipients for temporary jobs within marine-related Federal agencies. The Administrator must issue necessary regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment. $5,000,000 from NOAA's budget for fiscal years 2005-2010 is allocated to the program."
