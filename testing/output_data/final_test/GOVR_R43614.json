    "content": "Membership in the United Nations (U.N.) has been a focus for Congress, with 193 members and two non-member observer states. The U.N. system's 15 specialized agencies have different criteria for membership. The U.N. Security Council and General Assembly handle U.N. membership applications under Article 4 of the U.N. Charter. The U.S., as a P-5 member, influences U.N. membership decisions. In specialized agencies, each member has one vote without veto power. The executive branch represents the U.S. in U.N. matters, while Congress focuses on supporting or opposing specific membership applications. The report discusses the process for attaining membership in the United Nations and its specialized agencies, highlighting key steps, capacities, criteria, and implications. It also examines U.S. legislation and recent actions by Congress and the Obama Administration. For country-specific aspects of U.N. membership, see other CRS reports. The criteria for admitting new U.N. members were established in 1945 by the original 51 members in the U.N. Charter. Membership decisions are made by the General Assembly based on the Security Council's recommendation. Membership is open to \"peace-loving states\" willing to fulfill Charter obligations. The vague criteria have allowed political considerations to influence membership decisions. The pace of new member admissions reflects geopolitical circumstances, such as Cold War tensions limiting new members. During the Cold War, tensions limited new member admissions to the UN. Membership more than doubled from the mid-1950s to the 1970s with former European colonies in Africa joining. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia in the 1990s and early 2000s also led to new members. Recent additions include Switzerland, Timor-Leste, Montenegro, and South Sudan. Debate continues on the UN's role in determining statehood. The United Nations does not recognize states but states recognize states. U.N. membership acknowledges that an entity has met the requirements of statehood, providing legitimacy internationally and domestically. Membership allows countries to have an equal voice in U.N. bodies and advocate for national and foreign policy. Obtaining U.N. membership is a priority for new entities aiming for statehood. The process varies, with original members from World War II and others accepted based on Charter criteria. Some states obtained U.N. membership after secession or partition from existing members, such as Barbados, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Tunisia, Nigeria, Germany, Korea, and Vietnam. The process for admitting new U.N. members after secession or partition has been flexible. Examples include the partitions of Pakistan and India, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joining after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and the merging of East and West Germany and Yemen Arab Republic and People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. Indonesia withdrew and re-entered the United Nations in the mid-1960s, with the General Assembly and Security Council treating it as a temporary inactive membership. Indonesia reactivated its U.N. membership without reapplying. U.N. membership criteria include being a state, peace-loving, and accepting obligations. To apply for U.N. membership, a state must accept obligations in the U.N. Charter, be willing to fulfill international obligations, and maintain friendly relations with other states. The Security Council and General Assembly evaluate membership applications based on these criteria. The process of applying for U.N. membership involves submitting an application to the U.N. Secretary-General, who forwards it to the Assembly and Council. The time for approval varies, and the Council Committee on the Admission of New Members reviews the application before the Council makes a decision. Membership decisions can be vetoed. The Council reviews membership applications and can be vetoed by any of the P-5. If recommended, a resolution is sent to the General Assembly for consideration. If not recommended, a special report is submitted. The General Assembly then decides on membership with a two-thirds majority vote. The U.N. Charter outlines the process for membership admission, suspension, and loss. Approval from the Security Council and General Assembly is required for these actions, making them difficult to implement. Membership becomes effective upon General Assembly adoption of the resolution. If the Security Council does not recommend an application, it can be sent back for further consideration. Suspension of a state from U.N. membership requires a two-thirds majority decision by the General Assembly, based on Security Council recommendation. Expulsion for persistent violations of U.N. Charter principles also needs a two-thirds majority decision by the General Assembly, recommended by the Security Council. No state has been suspended or expelled to date. Loss of U.N. membership requires a two-thirds majority decision by the General Assembly, based on Security Council recommendation. Expulsion results in a permanent loss of membership, with alternative measures such as enforcement powers under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter and rejection of credentials in the General Assembly being utilized instead. The practice of inviting entities and \"non-member states\" to observe U.N. work has also developed over time. The practice of inviting entities and \"non-member states\" to observe U.N. work has evolved over many years, with some states eventually applying for and obtaining U.N. membership. Currently, there are two non-member observer states: the Holy See (Vatican) and \"Palestine.\" The process and criteria for membership in U.N. specialized agencies vary, with 15 specialized agencies in the U.N. system. Each agency is a legally independent intergovernmental organization with its own constitution, rules, membership, organs, and financial resources. The United States is a member of most specialized agencies in the United Nations, with membership requirements varying among agencies. Some agencies grant membership automatically to UN members, while others require a voting process for admission. UNWTO, for example, requires a two-thirds vote for membership, with a potential amendment to allow open membership to all states. The IMF and World Bank Group have different membership processes. IMF members are assigned quotas based on their position in the world economy, affecting their financial commitment, voting power, and access to financing. The US, with 16.75% of IMF votes, can block new member admissions. World Bank Group membership requires IMF membership, specifically for the IBRD. IBRD membership is necessary for access to other Group parts. IBRD membership is required for access to other parts of the World Bank Group, including the International Development Association and the International Finance Corporation. Some specialized agencies offer \"associate membership\" for territories not responsible for international relations. Examples include FAO, UNESCO, and WHO. Palestine's observer status change and U.N. membership efforts have gained attention. Palestine's ongoing initiative for U.N. membership and recognition has garnered domestic and international attention. In September 2011, Palestine applied for U.N. membership, which remains pending and is unlikely to be considered by the Security Council. The Obama Administration has indicated that the United States would veto any proposed Security Council action on the matter. The Obama Administration has stated that the United States would veto any proposed Security Council resolution recommending Palestinian membership. In November 2012, the U.N. General Assembly voted to change Palestine's observer status from \"entity\" to \"non-member state.\" Palestine has maintained many capacities as a non-member state, including the right to vote, call for a vote, or put forward candidates in the General Assembly. In October 2011, the UNESCO General Conference admitted Palestine as a member. The General Conference admitted Palestine as a member with 107 in favor, 14 against (including the United States), and 52 abstaining. Palestinians submitted letters of accession to various international treaties. The United States plays a key role in determining membership in the United Nations and a limited role in specialized agencies. Membership decisions are made by the entire membership with each member having one vote. The decision to vote for or against membership in the United Nations and its specialized agencies lies with the U.S. executive branch. Some Members of Congress have tried to influence U.S. policy on this issue through legislation. In the mid-1990s, Congress passed laws to restrict funding to the United Nations under certain conditions. The United States restricts funding to UN organizations that grant full membership to entities lacking internationally recognized statehood attributes. This includes withholding contributions to UNESCO for admitting Palestine as a member. Congress has passed laws to influence U.S. policy on UN membership. The Obama Administration has stated that the United States does not intend to withdraw from UNESCO despite funding restrictions. The 113th Congress has focused on U.N. membership in relation to specific countries, particularly Palestinian membership efforts. The FY2014 foreign operations appropriations bill prohibits U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority if they gain U.N. membership outside of an agreement with Israel. The 113th Congress is considering issues related to U.N. membership, including restrictions on U.S. funding tied to Palestinian membership decisions and support for Taiwan's participation. U.S. decisions on membership in one U.N. entity can impact membership in related agencies. The 113th Congress is discussing U.N. membership issues, including U.S. funding restrictions linked to Palestinian membership decisions. Palestine's admission to UNESCO in 2011 made it eligible for membership in IFAD, UNIDO, and WIPO without a vote. The U.S. is a member of IFAD and WIPO. The United States is a member of IFAD and WIPO but not a member of UNIDO. It is uncertain if the U.S. would withhold funding to these organizations as it did with UNESCO. Membership decisions in the United Nations are influenced by political factors, individual member states' national interests, and relationships among member states. These relationships can impact membership decisions in the Security Council and General Assembly. Members of Congress may face questions regarding U.N. and specialized agency membership, including whether to support or oppose entities pursuing membership, such as the Palestinians. They must decide on specific steps to take, including addressing the Obama Administration's requests to waive legislative restrictions on U.S. funding for UNESCO. The extent of their actions depends on various factors, such as the Palestinians seeking membership in other U.N. entities. The table below outlines membership provisions for U.N. specialized agencies and related organizations, including criteria for membership, withdrawal processes, and the impact of arrears. This information is relevant for Members of Congress considering whether to support entities like the Palestinians seeking membership in other U.N. entities."
