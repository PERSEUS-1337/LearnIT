    "content": "The House of Representatives has rules for considering bills, but can temporarily set them aside to expedite legislation through special rules or by suspending the rules. Special rules are for complex or contentious legislation, while suspension of the rules is for broadly supported measures. Most bills in the House are considered under suspension of the rules, allowing nonprivileged measures to be raised without special procedures. The suspension procedure in the House of Representatives allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without special rules, waives points of order, and requires a two-thirds vote for bills and resolutions. Decisions to schedule bills for consideration under suspension are based on support, debate time, and floor amendments, not necessarily related to the measure's subject matter. Measures brought up under suspension cover a wide range of policy areas, often addressing government operations. The suspension procedure in the House of Representatives allows nonprivileged measures to be raised without special rules, waives points of order, and requires a two-thirds vote for bills and resolutions. Measures considered under suspension during the 114th Congress (2015-2016) are analyzed in terms of prevalence, sponsors, committee consideration, floor debate length, voting, and resolution of differences between chambers. The procedure, established by House Rule XV, allows various types of business to be considered under suspension, including bills, resolutions, amendments, and conference reports. Suspension motions in the House of Representatives are allowed on designated days as per Rule XV. These motions can be considered on other days by unanimous consent or under a special order of business. A motion to suspend the rules is a compound motion to suspend the House rules and pass a bill or agree to a resolution. The House rules that are suspended include those that would impede an action. The House rules that are suspended under this procedure include those that would impede an immediate vote on passage of a measure. A measure considered under the suspension procedure is not subject to floor amendment but may be passed in an amended form. Suspension motions are debatable for 40 minutes, with speakers mostly expressing support for the measure. During debate time, floor managers control the discussion and may yield time to other Members. A single vote is held on the motion to pass the measure, requiring approval by two-thirds of Members present. If the vote falls short, the measure can be reconsidered before the end of the Congress.
