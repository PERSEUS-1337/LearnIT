    "content": "The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" aims to enable small businesses and individuals to sell surplus electric energy, promote energy resource diversification, stimulate investment in renewable energy, remove regulatory barriers for net metering, and establish national technical standards for electricity generation facilities. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" aims to promote net metering by amending the Federal Power Act to include a new section on net metering. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" defines terms related to net metering, such as customer-generator and qualified generation unit, which involves measuring electricity supplied and generated at the same point of interconnection. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" defines terms related to net metering, where customer-generators can generate electricity using renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal. The act specifies the generating capacity limits for residential and commercial consumers, the location requirements, and the need to operate in parallel with the retail electric supplier. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" defines terms related to net metering, where customer-generators can generate electricity using renewable sources like solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal. The act specifies the generating capacity limits for residential and commercial consumers, the location requirements, and the need to operate in parallel with the retail electric supplier. Retail electric suppliers must comply with specific requirements within one year of enactment and notify customers quarterly. The \"Home Energy Generation Act\" allows customer-generators to use renewable sources for electricity generation. Retail electric suppliers must provide net metering options and install additional meters if needed for monitoring electricity flow. Rates and charges for customer-generators are the same as those without a qualified generation unit. Retail electric suppliers must calculate the net energy measurement for customers with net metering systems by comparing electricity produced and consumed during the billing period. If the electricity supplied exceeds what is generated and fed back to the system, the supplier can bill the customer for the difference. The retail electric supplier can only bill the owner of an on-site generating facility for charges applicable without a net metering system if the generated electricity exceeds the supplied electricity. The excess kilowatt-hours generated will be credited to the owner in the following billing period. After one year of participating in net-metering, a customer-generator can sell any unused kilowatt-hour credits to an electric supplier. If no purchase is made, the retail electric supplier from the previous year can buy the credits at the avoided cost. The customer-generator can sell unused kilowatt-hour credits to an electric supplier, who can purchase them at the avoided cost of electricity. If no action is taken, the credits will continue to accumulate. There are percentage limitations on the total generating capacity of customer-generators with qualified generation facilities and net metering systems that a local distribution company must serve. A local distribution company retail electric supplier is not required to provide service to additional customer-generators using a single type of qualified energy generation system once the total generating capacity of all customer-generators with similar facilities served by the company reaches 2.5 percent of the capacity needed to meet the company's peak demand for that year. Retail electric suppliers must maintain records of customer-generators' generating capacity and make them public. Retail electric suppliers must notify the Commission when customer-generators' total generating capacity using net metering reaches 2% of peak demand. Safety and performance standards must be met by qualified generation units and net metering systems. The Commission may establish additional safety and reliability standards for customer-generators after consulting with regulatory authorities and local distribution systems. The Commission may prohibit additional charges for safety or performance equipment by electric suppliers and local distribution systems. States can still impose extra incentives or requirements for qualified generation. The Commission will publish model standards for physical connections within 6 months. The Commission will publish model standards for physical connections of qualified generation units with a generating capacity of more than 100 kW but not more than 250 kW. States must adopt these standards within 1 year and can modify them if necessary for local conditions. The Commission will enforce model standards in any State that has not approved standards within 1 year. The standards will ensure safety and reliability of equipment and distribution systems, aligning with national safety standards. The Commission will enforce model standards to ensure safety and reliability of equipment and distribution systems, including automatic isolation of generation units during power outages and allowing interruptions for maintenance or emergencies. The model standards prohibit additional charges for interconnection equipment or services. Connections meeting the standards can be made by the owner or operator at their expense or by the local distribution system with reimbursement. The Commission will ensure simplified contracts are used for interconnection of electric energy by systems and facilities with a power capacity not exceeding 250 kilowatts, with work performed by certified electrical personnel."
