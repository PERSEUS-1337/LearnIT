    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act\" and includes findings. Since the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, Americans with pre-existing conditions have better access to health insurance, the rate of uninsured Americans has decreased significantly, and healthcare costs have seen the slowest growth in over five decades. The Act prohibits denial of insurance or higher charges based on health status, leading to more Americans having insurance and improving healthcare quality. Starting in 2016, independent organizations have found that the individual health insurance markets have stabilized and improved. The cost-sharing reduction payments in the Affordable Care Act lower insurance premiums by nearly 20% and benefit around 6 million people with lower incomes. Risk mitigation programs, like the reinsurance program for Medicare Part D, also contribute to market stability. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program has provided stability to health insurance markets, restrained premium growth, and lowered taxpayer costs by helping insurers manage healthcare costs. The temporary reinsurance program under the Affordable Care Act stabilized insurance marketplaces and reduced premiums by up to 10%. The President promised reduced uninsured rates, lower costs, and higher quality care. The goal of health care legislation is to expand coverage, make health care more affordable, and improve market stability. The President promised better health care, access to preferred doctors, and lower costs for all. SEC. 3. INDIVIDUAL MARKET REINSURANCE FUND.
