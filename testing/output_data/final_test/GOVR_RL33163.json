    "content": "The United States has been supporting drug crop eradication programs in the Andes since the 1980s, with Colombia being a major recipient. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) is a key part of U.S. counternarcotics policy, supporting various missions including drug trafficking interdiction, crop eradication, alternative development, and rule of law promotion. Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru are the main cocaine producers, with Colombia also producing high-quality heroin. Colombia became the main coca and cocaine producer in the Andean region in 1997. In 1997, Peru was the top producer of coca and coca paste in the Andean region, which was then sent to Colombia for cocaine processing. The United States has provided significant financial and material support to combat drug trafficking in the Andean region since 2000, with a total of about $4.3 billion from the Andean Counterdrug Initiative account from FY2000 to FY2005. Additionally, the Department of Defense spent approximately $1.2 billion on counternarcotics efforts during the same period. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative received $1.2 billion from FY2000 to FY2005, managed by the U.S. Army Southern Command. The State Department's INL bureau oversees the ACI account for countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela, with a focus on Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Additional funding for the Andean region comes from the FMF and IMET programs, aiming to strengthen national authority in areas prone to drug trafficking. The FMF and IMET programs provide funding and training for foreign militaries in the Andean region to improve defense capabilities and support democratic governance. The U.S. Drug-Related Foreign Assistance to the Andean Region from FY2000 to FY2006 totaled $1.2 billion, with a focus on countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Funding has been used for infrastructure protection of oil pipelines and to combat drug trafficking activities. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) funding for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru includes programs for eradication, interdiction, alternative development, and democratic institution building. Interdiction programs support national police and military forces, aerial eradication aircraft, and infrastructure for counternarcotics activities. Alternative development programs focus on development in drug crop growing areas, including infrastructure and support for alternative crops. The ACI funding for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru includes assistance for alternative crops, internally displaced persons, rule of law promotion, and judicial capabilities. In 2003, coca cultivation in the Andes was 428,595 acres, down 22% from 2001. Colombia saw a 32% decline in coca cultivation since 2001. Colombian coca cultivation remained steady in 2004, with a significant decrease in opium poppy cultivation. Legal coca cultivation is allowed in Peru and Bolivia for cultural and medicinal purposes. Bolivia permits nearly 30,000 acres, while Peru allows about 28,000 acres. In Peru, legal coca cultivation is permitted on 28,000 acres, while in Bolivia it is allowed in the Yungas region and parts of Chapare. Growers must sell to licensed intermediaries or state-owned firms. There are no clear demarcations for legal cultivation areas in either country. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime outlines eradication programs in the Andean region, including aerial fumigation with glyphosate in Colombia and manual eradication in Bolivia and Peru. U.S. support for these programs is managed by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Spray missions are conducted by U.S.-hired contractors in Colombia. Colombia has no legal market for coca leaf, all of it is processed into cocaine. Coca cultivation has spread to over 20 regions. Opium poppy is grown in mountainous regions, making detection and eradication difficult. Aerial eradication with glyphosate herbicide is a key part of efforts to reduce illegal drug supply. The United States supports Colombia in aerial eradication of illegal drug crops using spray operations conducted by the Colombian National Police. The U.S. provides technical advice, herbicide, aircraft, and escort helicopters for the missions. Currently, there are 17 fixed-wing and 26 helicopters dedicated to spraying operations in Colombia. Reductions in coca and opium poppy cultivation in Colombia began in 2003, with some areas experiencing decreases due to aerial eradication. However, other areas saw increases in cultivation. Manual eradication in certain regions had slower rates of reduction compared to aerial programs. The United States Agency for International Development supports voluntary agreements with coca-growing communities. The government of Colombia supports voluntary agreements with communities in coca-growing regions for eradication programs. Peru has historically varied in its support for eradication efforts, with a decrease in coca cultivation since 1995. Opium poppy cultivation is increasing in northern Peru. Peru's reduction in coca cultivation since 1995 is attributed to various factors, including the appearance of a soil fungus in the Huallaga Valley, Colombia's decreased dependence on Peruvian coca, and the dismantling of Colombia's drug cartels. President Fujimori's government emphasized alternative development and incorporated coca farmers into the formal economy, leading to a collapse in coca prices in the early 1990s. During Fujimori's administration, military authority in drug matters increased, leading to a combination of counterinsurgency and drug control missions. Forced eradication was reintroduced in 1996 and intensified towards the late 1990s, sparking resistance from coca growers. Fujimori banned chemical or biological defoliants in 2000. Under the Toledo government, voluntary alternative development programs are prevalent, but forced eradication continues for non-compliant growers. In 2004, approximately 18,500 acres were forcefully eradicated. In 2004, about 18,500 acres were forcefully eradicated in Bolivia, with another 6,000 acres part of alternative development/voluntary eradication program. Political instability has led to uneven counternarcotics policy application. Despite some success in reducing cultivation, social unrest has been a concern. Coca cultivation has decreased in Chapare but increased significantly in Yungas, exceeding legal limits. Indigenous Bolivians view coca as a cultural right for spiritual, cultural, and medical purposes. Total coca cultivation in Bolivia has decreased from its peak. In 2004, coca cultivation in Bolivia increased to nearly 61,000 acres, despite laws prohibiting chemical eradication methods. Political instability and coca growers' mobilization have raised doubts about the government's commitment to counternarcotics efforts. The State Department and UNODC reported a rise in coca cultivation, highlighting the need for alternative crop cultivation programs. Alternative development programs in the mid-1970s in Bolivia and early 1980s in Peru aimed at providing alternatives to drug crop cultivation. Managed by the U.S. Agency for International Development, these programs offer technical support, marketing assistance, and infrastructure strengthening for farmers transitioning away from drug crops. The United States and UNODC have been key donors and supporters of these efforts, with a legal framework in Peru outlawing coca cultivation except for registered farmers. Colombia saw increased U.S. investment in alternative development starting in 2000 as part of Plan Colombia. Bolivia's Law 1008 allows legal coca cultivation only in traditional areas, with alternative development programs supporting farmers transitioning from illicit to legal crops. USAID's initiatives focus on eradicating coca crops and promoting the growth of alternative crops to integrate farmers into the legal economy. Infrastructure improvements are also part of the projects to enhance the affected areas. USAID works to improve infrastructure in coca and poppy growing regions in Colombia, providing education and health services to support economic activities. They aim to help farmers transition to legal crops by establishing legal crop areas, forest land, and completing infrastructure projects. Additionally, USAID supports agribusiness and commercial forestry development activities. Since 2000, the United States has allocated about $976 million for agribusiness and commercial forestry development activities in Peru. USAID's programs focus on improving local governance, strengthening the rule of law, and increasing economic competitiveness in coca-growing areas. They provide temporary income to growers who eradicate their crops voluntarily, support basic services, promote community organization, and aim for sustainable economic and social development in primary coca-growing areas through infrastructure projects and technical assistance. The United States has supported over $330 million in alternative development programs since 2000, with USAID reporting voluntary eradication of coca crops and support for various infrastructure projects in Peru. In Bolivia, USAID has made significant investments in alternative development programs, with a focus on sustainable economic and social development in coca-growing areas. In the Andes, USAID has invested $323 million in development programs, focusing on strengthening licit livelihoods, community development, legal land tenure, and access to justice in coca-growing areas like the Chapare region. They are now emphasizing sustainability and increased municipal participation. In 2004, USAID assisted 28,290 rural families, creating 9,300 licit jobs and increasing licit cultivation by 21,000 acres. Similar programs are conducted in the Yungas, including support for coffee cultivation and rural electrification projects. Congress has expressed concerns about eradication methods. Congress has expressed concerns about the health and environmental effects of aerial spraying in eradication programs, especially in Colombia's national parks. The aerial spray program in Colombia, using Roundup Ultra Herbicide, water, and Cosmo Flux411F, must be certified by the U.S. State Department to pose no unreasonable risk to the environment or health. Congress mandates that spraying in national parks align with Colombian law and have no other viable alternatives. The herbicide mixture targets coca plants and opium poppy, with less glyphosate needed for poppy eradication. Roundup Ultra Herbicide is widely used in the United States and considered safe. Studies show no significant health or environmental risks from spraying in Colombia. The EPA and State Department certify that the herbicide poses no unreasonable risk to health or the environment. Unintentional spraying may affect legal crops and natural vegetation. The State Department argues that damage from spray drift on legal crops and natural vegetation is reversible and a necessary cost for drug eradication. Chemicals used by coca growers include pesticides, herbicides, kerosene, sulfuric acid, ammonia, and acetone. The 2005 certification is supported by a recent study by the Organization of American States (OAS) on the environmental effects of glyphosate. The report concluded that glyphosate and Cosmo Flux 411F do not pose significant risks to human health. However, spray drift poses moderate risks to aquatic organisms in certain circumstances. Glyphosate has less environmental impact compared to cocaine and poppy production, but further testing of additives is recommended to reduce risks to aquatic life and understand potential adverse effects on human health and the environment. The State Department and CICAD study have faced criticism from environmental groups and researchers regarding the herbicide mixture used in Colombia. EPA has approved the ingredients in Cosmo Flux 411F for use on food. State Department's certification mentions the application rate is within manufacturer's recommendations. Data provided includes six acute toxicity studies and information on health complaints, with half of complaints rejected as invalid due to lack of spraying in claimed areas. The State Department and CICAD study faced criticism for not conducting studies on the effects of herbicide spraying on Colombian forests and wildlife. Some argue that toxicity data from the United States may not be applicable to a tropical environment. A study conducted along the Ecuador-Colombian border reported no harm to human health or wildlife from spraying. Blood samples from 22 women along the Ecuador-Colombian border showed genetic damage, significantly higher than control groups. Recent studies suggest that the surfactant in Roundup\u00ae, POEA, may pose health risks, particularly to human placental cells. The effects of Roundup\u00ae were found to be greater than glyphosate alone, indicating adjuvants had their own toxic effects. Studies showed POEA in Roundup\u00ae was more toxic to aquatic life than glyphosate. Research also suggested Roundup\u00ae could be lethal to amphibians, with high mortality rates in tadpoles and toxicity in young adult frogs and toads. Drug crop cultivation in national parks has increased, with estimates of 28,000 acres of coca grown in Colombia's national parks. Colombia's national parks have seen a significant increase in coca cultivation, with 49 parks now hosting crops, more than double the amount from three years ago. The government is considering lifting the ban on spraying in these parks, but critics are concerned about the potential harm to plant and animal species. Proponents argue that coca cultivation and processing have already caused significant environmental damage, including the destruction of millions of acres of rainforest. The processing of coca leaf into cocaine base involves harsh precursor chemicals that contaminate the environment. Traffickers have dumped over one million tons of chemicals since the mid-1980s. Alternative methods of crop eradication may be more benign to prevent further ecosystem destruction. Alternative methods of crop eradication, such as biological controls using living things or their byproducts, were discussed in a 1993 report to Congress. These methods aim to reduce the target plant pest to a tolerable level by establishing biological agents in proximity to the targeted plants while ensuring they do not harm non-targeted native plants and animals. The development of potential biological controls for drug crops like coca and poppy may require significant investments in research and field testing. One form of biological control being considered is the use of mycoherbicides, naturally occurring fungi that infect and kill plants. The mycoherbicide Fusarium oxysporum (species erythroxyli) has received attention as a possible means of controlling drug crops, with a study authorized by the Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drugs and Human Resources in the 109th Congress. The mycoherbicide Fusarium oxysporum (species erythroxyli) was discovered on diseased coca plants in the 1980s. Some advocate its use in Colombia as a non-toxic alternative to glyphosate, but concerns exist about its potential to mutate and affect non-target plants. The Colombian government has not approved its use due to uncertainties in estimating illegal crop cultivation levels. The GAO report highlighted discrepancies in methodology between the ONDCP and the State Department's Office of Aviation, particularly in identifying drug crop fields. The report raised concerns about the reliability of both surveys due to lack of rigorous accuracy assessment and inadequate technologies. US government data often differs from the UNODC's, with the US estimating a 16% reduction in coca cultivation in Colombia from 2000 to 2004, while the UN reports higher eradication rates. The United Nations reported a 51% reduction in coca cultivation from 403,000 acres to 198,000 acres in 2004. Colombia's cultivation remained stable according to US figures, but the UNODC reported a 7% decrease. Bolivia and Peru saw increases of 17% and 14% respectively, while the US reported decreases. The UN uses satellite imagery and aerial surveillance to estimate cultivation, with potential errors due to resolution and missed areas. Opium poppy cultivation in Colombia is challenging to monitor due to high altitudes and cloud cover. Growers are adapting by reducing crop sizes and planting among food crops to avoid detection. Aerial eradication efforts have faced debate on effectiveness, with officials arguing that even unsuccessful programs lead to decreased drug production. The eradication program in Colombia has led to a 7% decrease in potential cocaine production in 2004, down to 430 metric tons from a peak of 700 metric tons in 2001. Regional cocaine production in the Andes has also fallen by 5% in 2004, estimated at 640 metric tons, a 30% drop from its peak in 2001. Potential heroin production decreased by 51% in 2004. However, concerns remain about farmers quickly replanting coca and poppy crops, indicating a lack of lasting change in preferences despite eradication efforts. The EPA states that glyphosate has no residual effect, allowing for quick replanting of susceptible plants. Observers note shifts in cultivation areas due to eradication efforts, with evidence of some movement across borders. In Bolivia and Peru, cultivation is influenced by price fluctuations, leading to abandonment or reactivation of crops. In Peru, the price of coca leaf has increased due to the aerial eradication campaign in Colombia. The price, purity, and availability of cocaine and heroin have remained stable since 2000, but cocaine prices were starting to rise in 2005. Some studies question the impact of eradication on drug prices, as even if coca prices doubled, the retail price of cocaine would likely not be affected significantly. Since the mid-1990s, cocaleaf prices in the Andes have increased, while the retail price of cocaine has not. Cocaleaf represents a small fraction of the street price, with challenges in eradication efforts in Colombia due to armed conflict and control by illegal armed groups. Some Members of Congress suggest the Colombian government take over eradication programs currently supported by the United States. Difficulties in aerial eradication in Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia include criticism of the compensation system for accidental spraying of food crops. Indigenous movements in Peru and Bolivia are pushing for an end to eradication and legalization of cultivation. Colombia faces complaints about food crops and alternative development sites being sprayed due to aerial eradication of drug crops. The State Department acknowledges occasional errors but emphasizes efforts to minimize mistakes. Spray drift is supposedly minimized with high precision targeting and electronically documented areas sprayed. The Colombian government makes efforts to minimize mistakes during spray missions, avoiding areas with wind speeds above 10 m.p.h., humidity below 75%, and temperatures over 90 degrees. However, reports show spray drift affecting licit crops and forestland, with complaints of spraying in areas without coca cultivation. The Comptroller's Office reported in 2004 that forests near targeted areas had been damaged by spray drift, affecting crops in Ecuador. The U.S. Congress requires evaluation of complaints of harm from aerial eradication, with provisions for fair compensation. Colombian law also allows for compensation in cases of harm to licit crops. Colombian government investigates complaints, with some cases eliminated after verification, while others are verified through field visits. According to the State Department's March 2005 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, the Colombian National Police Antinarcotics Directorate (DIRAN) has received complaints of accidental food crop and pastureland spraying during aerial fumigation operations. Only 12 out of approximately 5,500 complaints received since 2001 resulted in compensation, totaling around $30,000. Most complaints were from residents of remote rural areas, with two-thirds rejected due to late filing or proximity of coca plantings to food crops. Peasants also filed complaints in no spray zones. Critics argue that the few claims for restitution accepted do not fully represent the extent of the problem, citing security risks and expenses for farmers filing claims. Colombia's Ombudsman's Office and the Comptroller General's Office question the advisability of DIRAN reviewing compensation claims while also responsible for eradication. Public opposition to eradication has fueled indigenous political movements in Peru and Bolivia. The growth of indigenous political movements in Peru and Bolivia has been fueled by public opposition to eradication efforts. In Bolivia, coca growers have organized protests and formed their own political party, the Movement toward Socialism (MAS), with Evo Morales as a prominent candidate in the upcoming election. Protests in Bolivia led by coca growing unions and supporters caused the resignation of two presidents, resulting in ongoing instability. Interim president Eduardo Rodriguez pledged not to increase eradication until a study on coca leaf use is completed. Conflict with growers led to fatalities between 1998 and 2003. In Peru, there is a movement to decriminalize cultivation beyond legal limits, with Cuzco passing an ordinance in 2005 allowing legal coca cultivation, followed by Puno and Hu\u00e1nuco. In 2004, the Peruvian drug agency released a study on traditional uses of coca leaf, finding that approximately 2 million Peruvians use coca leaf habitually or occasionally. Demand for coca leaf can be satisfied with about 9,000 metric tons, requiring about 24,700 acres for cultivation, slightly smaller than current legal limits. This study may influence new legislation limiting coca cultivation to meet demand. In Colombia, conflict among various groups has led to large numbers of displaced persons, with drug crop areas being highly contested. The Colombian Human Rights and Displacement Consulting Office and the Ombudsman's Office believe eradication efforts are linked to the increase in internally displaced persons. The U.S. and Colombian governments attribute displacement to the drug trade and armed conflict it fuels. Eradicating drug crops is seen as a way to remove the profits that drive conflict and displacement. The effectiveness of alternative development programs in promoting economic development and reducing drug crop cultivation is difficult to assess due to various factors. Without sustained alternative development efforts, eradication programs may ultimately fail as farmers may replant drug crops. Alternative development programs are crucial for achieving counternarcotics goals by providing incentives for farmers to permanently eradicate illicit crops. However, some observers argue that alternative development must be combined with intelligent law enforcement and community-based eradication for effectiveness. Sustainability of these programs is a concern, with analysts emphasizing the need for comprehensive and long-term funding. Foreign aid policy analysts emphasize the need for comprehensive alternative development programs with a long-term commitment. U.S. programs target various issues like infrastructure, health, and education, focusing on poverty reduction through agricultural and non-agricultural income generation. Challenges in the Andes include isolated production sites and poor transportation. Critics argue that the U.S. prioritizes eradication over alternative development in Colombia. The Government Accountability Office reported obstacles in AD programs in Colombia, including marketing difficulties, poor soil conditions, security constraints, and lack of established markets. Individual projects reach a small group of families and may not be sustainable. Aerial spraying is seen as a prerequisite for alternative development in Colombia, with growers showing more interest after involuntary spraying in Putumayo. Some observers argue that forced eradication and alternative development programs are contradictory. They believe educating farmers on the negative impacts of illegal crop production is more effective. U.S. alternative development programs require growers to eradicate all coca before receiving assistance, leading to complaints that AD has not kept pace with eradication efforts. Complaints have been raised about USAID's lack of coordination in Colombia and Bolivia's struggles with implementing alternative development programs due to a lack of coordination between community organizations and local governments. The 1998 Plan Dignidad in Bolivia emphasized the need for alternative development alongside forced eradication of illicit crops. Critics argue that insufficient resources are allocated to alternative development programs compared to eradication efforts in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Spending on eradication surpasses that on alternative development, with a total of $3 billion spent on eradication and $1.6 billion on alternative development in the three countries combined. In Colombia, eradication significantly outweighs alternative development programs. The cost of aerial eradication programs in Colombia differs from Peru and Bolivia due to funding constraints. USAID estimated a program for 136,600 families could cost up to $4 billion, but only $1.6 billion has been allocated since 2000. Both proponents and critics believe continued financial and technical support is necessary for sustainable momentum. Some observers question the viability of crops recommended for alternative development programs, citing issues with acidic land in Peru. The Peruvian agriculture minister criticized the failure of programs to replace coca crops with unprofitable alternatives like papayas and pineapples. He suggested finding more profitable crops instead. Similar issues were reported in Bolivia, where falling global prices and lack of export assistance affected alternative development sites."
