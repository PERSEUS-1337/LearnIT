    "content": "The United States has 130,000 troops in Iraq and 30,000 support troops in Kuwait, straining combat capabilities. The Bush Administration wants NATO countries to send forces to Iraq to reduce demands on U.S. forces and share costs. Key allies are open to a NATO role but want a new U.N. mandate and more decision-making power. Some allies prefer a force with a significant U.N. role over a U.S.-led NATO force. Unresolved issues from earlier disputes among allies also impact the debate over NATO involvement. The text discusses the causes of the war in Iraq, the role of NATO in out-of-area operations, military capabilities of allies, and the effects of Iraq's evolution on the Middle East. It also touches on the dispute over allied assistance to Turkey before the war with Iraq, NATO's debate on missions outside Europe, and the disagreement over reasons for war with Iraq affecting European contributions to stabilize Iraq. Additionally, it examines the Administration's objectives for post-war Iraq, necessary force levels, and the availability of European forces for Iraq. In 2002, NATO members agreed that allied forces could be deployed beyond Europe to combat threats to member states' security. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld emphasized the need to address global terrorist networks where they are located. He also expressed the Administration's desire for NATO assistance in stabilizing Iraq. Supporters of a NATO role in Iraq point to the precedent of allied forces in Afghanistan. NATO's involvement in Iraq was supported by some Administration officials who highlighted NATO's experience in leading stabilization forces in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. The International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, under NATO command, aimed to bring stability to Kabul. The U.N. headquarters bombing in Baghdad suggested ongoing violent resistance to external entities. The bombing in Baghdad on August 19 may indicate continued violent resistance to outside entities like NATO or the U.N. Some allied governments feel NATO should have been more involved in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq before sending troops. There are concerns about the Administration's handling of WMD inspections and building international coalitions. The Administration rushed into war without solid evidence of WMD or Al Qaeda links in Iraq. Allies resisted U.S. efforts to involve NATO in defending Turkey, fearing it implied NATO support for the conflict. Allies now demand more decision-making power and U.N. authority in Iraq before committing troops. President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld believed U.S. forces in Iraq were sufficient to stabilize the country. Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz believe that current force levels in Iraq are adequate for security. The goal of the U.S. occupation is to establish a free, democratic, and peaceful Iraq that does not pose a threat to other nations. President Bush also emphasized the potential for a democratic Iraq to inspire positive change in the Middle East. The United States Army may struggle to maintain current force levels in Iraq without activating more National Guard and Reserve units or calling upon foreign forces. General John Abizaid stated that the U.S. could not sustain 130,000 troops without rotating active duty, reserve, and National Guard forces by spring 2004. The United States may struggle to maintain current force levels in Iraq without additional international forces. Estimates suggest that several hundred thousand troops may be needed for stability, with a focus on civilian training and establishment of civil institutions. NATO is providing assistance in Iraq to Poland, leading a multinational force of 9,000 troops from various countries. The bombing of a mosque in Najaf delayed Poland's takeover of the city. The United States will pay Poland $250 million for logistics and communication costs for its force in Iraq. NATO SACEUR General James Jones suggested the Polish-led force could become a NATO-led force with approval from all allies. Some NATO countries may have limited forces available due to contributions in other regions. NATO Secretary General George Robertson mentioned a maximum of 80,000 troops from European NATO countries for potential deployment. NATO Secretary General George Robertson mentioned that a more realistic figure for troops from European NATO countries available for Iraq could be around 40,000-50,000 due to limited deployability and sustainability of forces. Cost is a major factor in stabilizing Iraq and involving allied governments, with the hope that an Iraqi government could eventually take on more of the expense of reconstruction. The U.S. forces in Iraq have operational costs of $4 billion per month, with additional reconstruction costs. The Administration requested $20.3 billion for Iraq's reconstruction and $51 billion for military operations in FY2004. Initially, officials believed Iraq could finance its own reconstruction, but the reality was different. The World Bank estimated Iraq would need $36 billion through 2007 for rebuilding, in addition to $20.3 billion requested by the Administration. Iraqi oil revenues may reach $14 billion annually. A donors' conference in Madrid on October 23-24 will pledge an estimated $2 billion. European companies are hesitant to enter Iraq until stability returns and a legitimate government is in place. International oil executives are doubtful of investing $30-40 billion in Iraq's petroleum industry without a legitimate government in Baghdad. Administration views on sending European forces to Iraq differ from most allied governments. Key European governments, such as France and Germany, want a strong U.N. role in Iraq and a new U.N. resolution outlining that role. Some NATO allies oppose the U.S. decision to use force in Iraq and prefer continuing U.N. inspections. Most European governments have different objectives from the Administration, not believing in building democratic institutions in Iraq as a model for peace in the region. Key European governments, such as France and Germany, advocate for a strong U.N. role in Iraq and a new U.N. resolution. Some NATO allies support the U.S. decision to use force in Iraq and seek a long-term strategic partnership. Administration officials oppose any resolution that would weaken U.S. military authority in Iraq. Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz is open to a new U.N. resolution as long as it does not limit the actions of the U.S. official heading the Coalition Provisional Authority. The Administration has drafted a new resolution before the UNSC, calling for a U.S.-led U.N. stabilization force in Iraq. The resolution also involves Iraq's Governing Council and Ambassador Bremer in creating a timetable for constitution writing and elections. Secretary Powell stated that Bremer would maintain a significant political role. The Governing Council could oversee constitution drafting by spring 2004, with elections by the end of 2004. The U.N. Security Council, including France, Russia, and Britain, supports the Iraqi Governing Council as a step towards empowering the Iraqi people. The Iraqi Governing Council was chosen by the CPA and praised by France, Germany, and Russia for involving the U.N., placing actions under international law, and monitoring oil revenues. They called for increased U.N. involvement, a legitimate administration, competitive bidding for reconstruction contracts. The British government's perspective on governing Iraq is evolving. The British government's perspective on governing Iraq is evolving, with a force of approximately 11,000 troops in the southern part of the country. They are open to a greater U.N. role and a rapid turnover of power to Iraqis. Prime Minister Tony Blair faces political pressure over a dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Public support for Blair and Britain's involvement in Iraq has decreased since the conflict ended. France has specific requirements for supporting a new U.N. resolution, including the U.N. taking the lead in humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. France also wants Secretary General Annan to replace Ambassador Bremer as the main political authority for Iraq. Iraq must establish a legitimate and pluralist government with a new constitution under U.N. supervision. A legitimate and pluralist government in Iraq must be established under U.N. auspices. The Governing Council and cabinet could lead to a provisional government, with a phased transfer of authority advised by a personal representative of Secretary General Annan. A new constitution could be drafted by the end of 2003, with elections in spring 2004. International military forces, under U.N. supervision, could bring stability to Iraq, with international oversight of Iraqi oil production to protect the country's resources. France and Germany prefer a U.N.-mandated force in Iraq over a NATO operation. France offers to train Iraqi military and police but will not send forces or contribute to donors' conference without transparent funding mechanism. Germany may send troops for civilian reconstruction but not under UNSC 1483 due to concerns about being seen as an \"occupying power.\" Other countries have varying views on involvement in Iraq. Germany and Norway prefer involvement in civilian reconstruction projects in Iraq, such as institution-building and infrastructure development. Turkey has agreed in principle to send forces to Iraq, but faces opposition from the Governing Council due to historical reasons. U.S.-Turkish relations have been strained since the Turkish parliament refused to allow U.S. forces to deploy from Turkish territory in 2003. Turkey has 5,000 troops in northern Iraq under Turkish command to combat Kurdish elements. Tension exists between Turkish and U.S. forces in the region. Spain supports the war in Iraq but criticizes U.S. policy, urging a constitutional process in Iraq. Foreign Minister Palacio urges immediate efforts for a constitutional process in Iraq, emphasizing the need for Iraqi involvement and the intervention of a third party, preferably the United Nations. NATO members, including Italy, are sending troops to Iraq for security purposes and to search for weapons of mass destruction. European allies prioritize strategic relations with the United States over a stronger U.N. role, seeking a new U.N. resolution that encourages multilateral involvement in Iraq. Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are among the countries willing to lead a NATO force in Iraq. The Senate passed an amendment urging NATO to deploy a force in Iraq similar to missions in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Kosovo. The bill also calls for UN military and police forces to promote security and stability in Iraq. The Senate passed a bill urging NATO to deploy a force in Iraq, with calls for UN military and police forces to promote security and stability. Members in both houses and parties have called for more U.S. troops in Iraq, with Senator Lugar emphasizing the need for further internationalization of coalition efforts. The debate over an enhanced European role in Iraq poses significant problems with important implications. Administration officials seek international troop contributions while preserving U.S. political and military control over Iraq. European allies, including Britain, seek a strong U.N. voice for an international force in Iraq. They doubt the Administration's goals of democratizing Iraq and moderating Middle Eastern politics. European governments prefer multilateral solutions and criticize the U.S. for cutting short U.N. inspections in Iraq and going to war. They aim to restore a multilateral framework for international problem-solving. Some NATO governments are hesitant to send troops to operate under U.S. leadership in Iraq due to conflicting positions with the Bush Administration. Poland, Norway, and candidate states for NATO membership support key elements of Administration policy in Iraq to forge a strategic partnership with the United States. They do not believe the European Union or the U.N. can provide for their security. Many central European leaders seek close ties with the United States due to past negative experiences with security guarantees. France and Germany advocate for a strong U.N. presence in Iraq and aspire for a multipolar world with the EU as a balancing pole against U.S. power. President Chirac aims for an EU with military capabilities for defense. France and Germany believe that aligning with U.S. leadership in Iraq could harm relations with a future Iraqi government and alienate Arab states. They advocate for a \"pluralistic\" government in Iraq, which is more acceptable to European and Arab governments. However, there are voices in Europe that still support U.S. efforts to bring stability and representative government to Iraq. Several gains for European governments could result from a moderate Iraq aligned with the United States: a weakened Iran and Syria, a peaceful Arab-Israeli peace process. Failure in Iraq could lead to disaffection with U.S. leadership, a resurgence of radical Islam, and increased tensions in the Middle East. European critics of the U.S. should seek an accommodation with the Bush Administration over Iraq. Several European officials are seeking a compromise with the Bush Administration over Iraq. Options include US leadership with allies in command of different sectors, elements of the French position like a timetable for elections, and an economic development regime for reconstruction contracts. This compromise could free up US forces, give European governments a voice in Iraq's future, and provide legitimacy through a UN approval. The Bush Administration may face a disadvantage in surrendering some political objectives in Iraq, such as establishing a democratic government as a model for the region. This compromise with European officials could shift the financial burden for reconstruction from the US government to other governments and the private sector."
