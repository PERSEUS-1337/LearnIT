    "content": "MEDICARE DSH REPORT AND PAYMENT ADJUSTMENTS made in response to coverage expansion, not PPACA and HCERA revisions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2016, on Medicare DSH, considering the impact of health care reforms under the Affordable Care Act. The report will include recommendations on the appropriate amount and distribution of Medicare DSH to address higher Medicare costs, Medicaid reimbursement shortfalls, and uncompensated care for low-income beneficiaries. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will adjust Medicare DSH payments based on the national rate of uninsurance decrease due to the Affordable Care Act, starting in fiscal year 2018. Medicare DSH payment will be determined based on a report's recommendations and hospital characteristics, including bed size. Additional payments will be made to hospitals for uncompensated care, excluding bad debt. The national rate of uninsurance decrease due to the Affordable Care Act will be considered significant. The Affordable Care Act will lead to a decrease in the national rate of uninsurance, with additional payments to hospitals for uncompensated care. The national rate of uninsurance is defined as the rate for the under-65 population as determined by the Census Bureau. The Secretary will estimate the reduction in uncompensated care for each fiscal year starting in 2018. The Secretary will estimate the reduction in Medicare DSH payment resulting from the adjustment, with additional payments to hospitals based on a formula that ensures higher levels of uncompensated care receive a greater increase, not exceeding 50% of the reduction in Medicare DSH. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to Medicare DSH and the correction of the PPACA. It also mentions the elimination of a provision in the Social Security Act. The curr_chunk involves amending subsection (r) by replacing ''for'' with ''For'' and removing subsection (r). MEDICAID DSH REVISIONS: Amends the Social Security Act to update timeframes for Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments from 2014-2020 to 2018-2024."
