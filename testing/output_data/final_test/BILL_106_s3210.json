    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights\". The Act, known as the \"Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights,\" amends Chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, by adding a section defining consumer and employment contracts. Consumer contracts refer to standardized agreements in consumer transactions, while employment contracts are uniform plans covering all employees in a company. The \"Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights\" amends Chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, by defining consumer and employment contracts. Consumer contracts are standardized agreements in consumer transactions, while employment contracts cover all employees in a company. The arbitration clause in these contracts must have a bold heading, state if participation is mandatory or optional, provide contact information for additional details, and exclude individually negotiated executive employment agreements. The \"Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights\" ensures that parties in consumer and employment contracts have the right to competent and neutral arbitrators, as well as the option to resolve disputes in small claims court for claims under $50,000. The \"Consumer and Employee Arbitration Bill of Rights\" guarantees parties the right to a competent, neutral arbitrator who complies with ethical standards and has no personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The arbitration process requires the appointment of a neutral arbitrator who must disclose any potential biases or conflicts of interest. The administration of the arbitration is overseen by an independent organization to ensure fairness and prevent communication between parties and the arbitrator. The arbitrator must adhere to the same substantive law in resolving disputes. The arbitrator in the arbitration process must follow the same substantive law as would apply in a court where the consumer or employee resided when the contract was made. Each party has the right to legal representation at their own expense, and a fair arbitration hearing with adequate notice and opportunity to be heard is guaranteed. The arbitrator may conduct hearings electronically or by phone to reduce costs, but each party has the right to request a face-to-face meeting at a convenient location. Each party also has the right to present evidence during the hearing. During the arbitration hearing, each party can present evidence and provide access to relevant information to the other parties. Prehearing depositions may be conducted if deemed necessary by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will make efforts to maintain privacy and consider claims of confidentiality. During the arbitration hearing, parties have the right to cross-examine witnesses and request a stenographic record of the proceeding, with costs covered by the requesting party. The arbitrator will consider claims of privilege and confidentiality in addressing evidentiary issues. The arbitrator sets a date for inspection of documents, with a 30-day deadline for the respondent to file an answer. The hearing must be held within 90 days of the answer, with a possible extension. A written decision is provided within 30 days after the hearing, explaining the factual and legal basis. The arbitrator provides a written decision explaining the factual and legal basis, with the decision being final and binding. The arbitrator has the authority to reimburse arbitration fees and waive fees in cases of extreme hardship. Each party has the option to opt out of small claims. Each party has the right to opt out of binding arbitration and choose small claims court if the court has jurisdiction over the claim. No court with jurisdiction over claims exceeding $50,000 is considered a small claims court. During arbitration, a party can file a motion if they believe the other party has deprived them of rights granted by this section. The arbitrator can then determine if the movant has been deprived of a right. The arbitrator may award the movant a monetary amount not exceeding reasonable expenses incurred in filing the motion, including attorneys' fees, if it is found that the other party deprived the movant of a right granted by this section. Exceptions include situations where the motion was filed without a good faith effort to obtain discovery, the opposing party's actions were justified, or circumstances make an award unjust. The losing party in an arbitration can file a petition in the district court if they believe the arbitrator violated their rights. The court must find clear evidence of actions or omissions by the arbitrator that resulted in a deprivation of the party's rights. If proven, a rehearing before a new arbitrator will be ordered as the exclusive remedy. The losing party in an arbitration can seek judicial remedy if they believe the arbitrator violated their rights. A rehearing before a new arbitrator will be ordered as the exclusive remedy if clear evidence of violations is found. Additionally, a technical and conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code. Consumer and employment contracts entered into after 6 months from the enactment of this Act are subject to the amendments. The Act does not serve as a basis for any claim in law or equity."
