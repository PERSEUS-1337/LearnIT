    "content": "The Commercial UAS Modernization Act is cited as the short title. It introduces an interim rule for the operation of small unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes under the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act allows commercial operation of small unmanned aircraft without an airworthiness certificate in the US, subject to requirements and restrictions. Liability insurance and registration are mandatory for commercial operation during this period. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act requires registration of small unmanned aircraft for commercial use and mandates passing an aeronautical knowledge test. The Commercial UAS Modernization Act mandates passing a proficiency test and demonstrating the ability to fly the aircraft in accordance with operating restrictions before a small unmanned aircraft can be operated for commercial purposes. During the period set forth in subsection (a), small unmanned aircraft operated for commercial purposes must adhere to operating restrictions such as flying under visual line of sight rules, not exceeding 500 feet above ground level, obtaining prior authorization for certain airspaces, and complying with model aircraft operating standards. The Federal Aviation Administration issued Advisory Circular 91-57 on June 9, 1981, outlining model aircraft operating standards. Small unmanned aircraft for commercial purposes must comply with these standards, operate only in daylight, yield right of way to others in the airspace system, not be operated by individuals with conditions that may interfere with safe operation, and undergo a preflight inspection. The Secretary of Transportation can enforce these regulations through civil actions in district courts. The Federal Aviation Administration requires the owner or operator of a small unmanned aircraft involved in an accident causing injury or property damage to report it to the FAA within 2 days. Additionally, the FAA can enforce regulations through civil actions in district courts. SEC. 338. DEPUTY ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR FOR UNMANNED AIRCRAFT. This section adds a Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft to the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration appoints a Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft, who will develop procedures for registering small unmanned aircraft and collect fees from owners or operators as part of the registration process. The Deputy Associate Administrator is tasked with creating a research and development plan for integrating unmanned aircraft into the National Airspace System, considering work from other agencies and identifying gaps. Additionally, they will address unmanned aircraft spectrum issues. The Deputy Associate Administrator will address unmanned aircraft spectrum issues and work on resolving barriers to unmanned aircraft operations, payload carriage, and utilizing automated systems. Exemptions from operating restrictions may include beyond line of sight operations and programmatic exemptions based on analysis. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 is amended to include provisions for extended visual line of sight, marginal visual flight rules weather conditions, and heavier unmanned vehicles. SEC. 4 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 includes provisions for a Joint Aircraft System Research and Development Data Collection and Analysis Program. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration will establish a joint aircraft system research and development program at the William J. Hughes Technical Center. The program will prioritize data collection, analysis, and research on safety standards for autonomous aircraft systems and air traffic management. It will utilize the FAA's unmanned aircraft system test sites for research, data collection, and development of quarterly milestones. The Federal Aviation Administration will implement an air traffic management pilot program with NASA to test new regulations for small unmanned aircraft below 1,200 feet. The program aims to expedite commercial drone operations and collaborate with various stakeholders for implementation. The Center will partner with a third party to test management of small unmanned aircraft in controlled and uncontrolled airspace below 1,200 feet. A report summarizing actions taken must be submitted every 180 days to specific Senate and House committees."
