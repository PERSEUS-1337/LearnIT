The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution caused by ineffective wastewater treatment and nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading in the Great Lakes System. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as a reliable method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. The Act authorizes the EPA to provide financial assistance for these efforts. The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" authorizes the EPA to provide financial assistance for upgrading public wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes System with nutrient removal technologies to restore water quality for human health and aquatic life. SEC. 701. SEWAGE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY GRANT PROGRAM under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act provides financial assistance for upgrading public wastewater treatment plants with nutrient removal technologies. The Administrator will establish a grant program to upgrade facilities with nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities. Priority will be given to facilities that would produce the greatest nutrient load reductions and environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System.

Priority will be given to facilities that would produce the greatest nutrient load reductions and environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System. Upon receiving an application, the Administrator will transfer the necessary assistance to carry out the facility upgrades outlined in the application. The Administrator will establish a grant program for upgrading facilities with nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities. Grants must be used to upgrade eligible facilities with nutrient removal technologies to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater. The Federal share of the cost for upgrades shall not exceed 55 percent. The grant program will provide funds for upgrading facilities with nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities. Funds can be provided from various sources, including other provisions of the Act or other Federal or State laws. The term '2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement' refers to the agreement signed in 2012 to improve water quality in the Great Lakes. The eligible facility for the grant program must have a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day and be located within the Great Lakes System in any of the Great Lakes States. The Great Lakes States and Great Lakes System are defined in section 118 of the agreement. The Program Office refers to the Great Lakes National Program Office established by section 118(b).
