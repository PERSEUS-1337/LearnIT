    "content": "Congress relies on various mechanisms and procedures to protect classified national security and sensitive information. Accessibility to this information is crucial for the legislature to oversee the executive branch and legislate public policy. Safeguards include eligibility for access, availability of information, and rules for use. House and Senate security offices and committee rules play a key role in setting and implementing standards for safeguarding classified information. The mechanisms and procedures in Congress for protecting classified national security and sensitive information include rules for access, availability, and use. This involves classified information, rules for handling it, establishment of special congressional groups, security clearances, and procedures for investigating security violations. These requirements are based on public laws, House and Senate rules, and committee rules, as well as custom and practice. The two chambers have adapted these measures over time to meet the changing needs of the legislative and executive branches. The Senate and House of Representatives have different approaches to their security programs. The Senate established an Office of Senate Security in 1987 to handle classified and sensitive information. The Security Office sets and enforces standards for safeguarding information, covering staff, officers, consultants, and contract personnel. These standards are detailed in the Senate Security Manual and are binding on all Senate employees. Members are not included in these requirements. The Senate established an Office of Senate Security in 1987 to handle classified information, covering staff, officers, consultants, and contract personnel. Regulations include physical security requirements, procedures for storing materials, security clearances, and investigations of security violations. In 2005, the House created the Office of House Security (OHS) under the House Sergeant at Arms, responsible for developing a security program for the House. The House Office of Security (OHS) is responsible for managing classified information, coordinating security breach investigations, and providing relevant services for security clearances. Unlike the Senate, the House OHS does not have an official security manual but offers instructions and forms for safeguarding classified information. Prior to OHS, individual committee and Member offices set security requirements based on chamber and committee rules, internal manuals, and custom. Legislative branch staff must have security clearances and nondisclosure agreements to access classified information, with requirements specified by each panel. The House Office of Security manages classified information and coordinates security breach investigations. Requirements for security clearances and nondisclosure agreements are set by each panel for staff to access classified information. Senators and Committee Chairmen determine which staff positions require security clearances. Individual Member offices may also require clearances and nondisclosure agreements for staff to access classified information. Each chamber's office of security directs requirements and limitations. Security clearance requirements are managed by the House Office of Security and may be limited in individual Member offices. Congressional staff seeking access to classified information may need a need-to-know requirement. The House and Senate differ in secrecy oaths for Members and staff, with the House requiring a secrecy oath starting from the 104th Congress. The House of Representatives requires an oath for individuals to access classified information, including Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioners, officers, and employees. This oath ensures that they will not disclose any classified information unless authorized by the House or its Rules. The oath was initially required only for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but has since been expanded to all individuals with access to classified information. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Homeland Security both require an oath or affirmation for access to classified information. Procedures for sharing classified information within Congress vary, with rules setting conditions for access and sharing among panels, Members, and staff. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has strict rules for access to classified information, including requirements for what information can be shared, in what form, and under what restrictions. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has strict rules for access to classified information, including a multi-stage process for non-committee Members to obtain access, with varying levels of access granted. The Committee on Intelligence shares classified information with other panels or non-members, who must follow the same rules. The House Armed Services Committee ensures access to Secret or higher classified information for any member who requests it. The executive branch notifies the House and Senate select committees on intelligence about intelligence activities, but in urgent or sensitive situations, full panels may be bypassed. The \"Gang of Eight\" and \"Gang of Four\" are notified about covert operations and sensitive intelligence activities to protect the interests of the United States. The \"Gang of Eight\" consists of key members from the House and Senate intelligence committees, while the \"Gang of Four\" is made up of the chairs and ranking minority Members of the House and Senate select committees on intelligence. This system aims to prevent the disclosure of intelligence sources and methods. The controversy arose over the existing arrangements for notifying the \"Gang of Eight\" and \"Gang of Four\" about covert operations and intelligence activities. Congress modified notification procedures to allow more communication between the \"Gangs\" and their respective intelligence committees, which raised concerns within the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Community expressed serious concern over changes in the law, leading to a threatened presidential veto. The Senate and House Offices of Security investigate security violations, while the Ethics Committees handle breaches of security. The Senate Ethics Committee is responsible for investigating improper conduct, law violations, and Senate Code of Official Conduct violations. The Senate and House Committees investigate security breaches and unauthorized disclosures of intelligence information. Measures are in place to protect classified information, including physical security and guidelines for individual conduct. Some security measures for protecting classified information in Congress include stationing Capitol Police officers, conducting security sweeps, safeguarding controlled information, setting up procedures for handling classified information, and reporting foreign travel and contacts. Various proposals suggest changes to handling classified information in Congress, focusing on uniform standards and increased security measures. Proposals to require security clearances for Members of Congress have been suggested since the late 1980s, following concerns over unauthorized disclosure of classified information. A bill introduced in 2006 aimed to mandate security clearances for certain committee members, but details on who would conduct background checks were not specified. The broad mandate for security clearances for Members of Congress could apply to different groups, including all Senators and Representatives or only those seeking access to classified information. Background investigations could be conducted by various entities, such as executive branch agencies, legislative branch offices, or private investigative firms under contract. The proposed change in security clearance for Members of Congress aims to tighten standards and ensure access only for those deemed \"trustworthy\" to limit leaks and safeguard classified information. Adjudicators could include leaders, special panels, or executive branch officers, with the goal of making recipients more conscientious about safeguarding sensitive information. Opponents argue that security clearance requirements for Members of Congress could compromise legislative independence, even if the process is under legislative control. Concerns include fairness, impartiality, and the potential negative impact on a Member. Opponents argue that adding security clearance requirements for Members of Congress could have adverse effects on legislative independence and fairness, potentially impacting Members negatively. The proposal to require security clearances for Members of Congress could hinder their participation in legislative proceedings and slow down the legislative process. It would involve a secrecy oath for Senators and staffers, similar to the current requirement for House counterparts. This proposal was previously attempted in 1993 but was unsuccessful. The proposal includes a secrecy oath for Senators and staffers to prevent disclosure of classified information, potentially aiding in detecting financial misconduct. Some concerns include added burdens on staff, costs, and doubts about its effectiveness in preventing leaks or espionage. Drug tests or polygraph exams could be required for personnel with access to classified information. Drug tests or polygraph exams could be required for personnel with access to classified information, despite objections due to costs and questioned reliability."
