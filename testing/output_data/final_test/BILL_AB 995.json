    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34501.12 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require motor carriers to identify all terminals in California where vehicles can be inspected by the department. Failure to provide vehicles and records for inspection will result in an unsatisfactory terminal rating issued by the department. The department will select vehicles for inspection at terminals based on fleet size, with different sample sizes for varying fleet sizes. Lessors must make vehicles available for inspection upon request, regardless of their relationship with the carrier lessee. Compliance with inspection requirements does not imply an employee-employer relationship. The department may inspect any terminal of a motor carrier operating specified vehicles. The department will establish a performance-based truck terminal inspection selection priority system, incorporating methodologies used by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. This system will analyze safety-related motor carrier performance data, including driver fatigue, fitness, vehicle maintenance, and substance/alcohol use. A database will be created to store all specified performance data. The department will prioritize motor carrier terminals for inspection based on specified performance data, including those never previously inspected, identified by the selection system, and operating certain vehicles. Terminals may not be inspected more often than once every six years if compliant or not exceeding inspection selection system thresholds. Any motor carrier with a compliance rating below satisfactory or below the selection priority system threshold will undergo periodic inquiries and inspections based on violation severity. In Section 34505.6, vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating over 10,000 pounds are included, excluding pickup trucks and those never used commercially. Section 34500(g) includes vehicles transporting hazardous materials requiring placards, licenses, or hazardous waste transporter registration. Division 16 vehicles in the pilot program or owned by the federal government are exempt from this section and Section 34505.6. It is illegal for a motor carrier to operate a vehicle subject to specific sections without being knowledgeable and compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. It is unlawful for a motor carrier to contract with another carrier unless the contracted carrier complies with regulations. Certification of compliance must be provided in writing and maintained for inspection upon request. An inspected terminal with an unsatisfactory compliance rating must be reinspected within 120 days. If a carrier's permit is suspended, reinspection for reinstatement is only done upon request. Carriers can request a review of the rating within five days and the department must evaluate it within 10 days. Performance-based inspection data is published for public review. The Basic Inspection of Terminals program, known as the BIT program, amends Section 34501.12 of the Vehicle Code to specify the vehicles subject to inspection, excluding agricultural vehicles. Motor carriers must identify all terminals in the state where vehicles can be inspected by the department. Vehicles and records must be made available for inspection upon request. The number of vehicles selected for inspection at a terminal is based on fleet size. The lessor of any vehicle must make them available for inspection upon request. The department may inspect any terminal of a motor carrier operating vehicles described in the subdivision. The department must establish a performance-based truck terminal inspection selection priority system, incorporating methodologies used by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. This system will analyze safety-related motor carrier performance data, including driver fatigue, fitness, vehicle maintenance, and substance use. A database will be created to store all specified performance data. The department will create a database to store performance-based data for motor carriers, prioritizing terminals for inspection based on various criteria. Terminals may not be inspected more frequently than once every six years if they meet certain compliance criteria. Motor carriers with unsatisfactory compliance ratings or below the selection priority threshold will undergo periodic inquiries and inspections based on violation severity. The curr_chunk explains the specific criteria for vehicles included in certain sections related to weight ratings and transportation of hazardous materials. It excludes certain types of vehicles and specifies requirements for displaying placards and obtaining licenses. Vehicles in Division 16, except those in a pilot program or owned by the federal government, are not subject to certain sections regarding weight ratings and hazardous materials transportation. It is illegal for a motor carrier to operate any vehicle under specific sections unless they are knowledgeable and compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. It is unlawful for a motor carrier to contract with another carrier unless the contracted carrier complies with regulations and provides certification of compliance. The certification must be maintained for the duration of the contract and presented upon request for inspection. An inspected terminal with an unsatisfactory compliance rating must be reinspected within 120 days. If a carrier's permit is suspended due to the rating, reinstatement requires a request from the appropriate authority. Carriers can request a review of the rating within five days and the department must evaluate it within 10 days. Performance-based inspection data will be published for public review. The Basic Inspection of Terminals program, also known as the BIT program, is established. Section 34622 of the Vehicle Code is amended to exclude certain vehicles from this chapter. Section 36103 is added to the Vehicle Code for vehicles operating in a pilot program. Section 36103 of the Vehicle Code establishes a pilot program in Fresno, Kings, and Madera Counties for exempting certain agricultural vehicles from registration if used exclusively for farming operations within 20 air miles. Requirements include non-commercial use and displaying a special identification plate. The pilot program in Fresno, Kings, and Madera Counties exempts certain agricultural vehicles from registration if used exclusively for farming operations within 20 air miles. Requirements include displaying a special identification plate, obtaining a carrier identification number, a motor carrier permit, and conducting periodic inspections of vehicles. The employer enrolls in the DMV pull-notice system to receive reports on the driver's record for vehicles requiring specific licenses. Owners or family members driving the vehicle are also enrolled. The California Highway Patrol and Department of Motor Vehicles must report to the Legislature by July 1, 2018, on the pilot program's status and effectiveness, including vehicle enrollment, impact on registration funding, collisions, enforcement, and safety issues. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2020, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 36305 of the Vehicle Code is amended. Section 36305 of the Vehicle Code is amended to require drivers of implements of husbandry to possess a valid class C driver's license when operating at speeds over 25 miles per hour or towing specified equipment. Additionally, individuals participating in the pilot program established in Section 36103 must have the appropriate driver's license for the vehicle type. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Vehicle Code, contingent on the enactment of Assembly Bill 1960. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act."
