    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Encouraging Mortgage Modifications Act of 2008\". Congress finds that mortgage modifications are crucial in avoiding foreclosures and providing sustainable solutions for homeowners. However, the process of reaching agreements with homeowners has been slow, leading to rising foreclosure rates. Servicers must consider the interests of investors when offering modifications, even though the best course of action for the investor pool as a whole may not always benefit individual investor classes. Without liability protection, servicers may be reluctant to approve mortgage modifications or repayment plans, leading to increased foreclosure rates. The net present value of a modified mortgage loan typically exceeds the amount recouped from foreclosure. SEC. 3. LEGAL SAFE HARBOR FOR ENTERING INTO CERTAIN LOAN MODIFICATIONS OR WORKOUT PLANS. Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 is amended to include a new duty for servicers of pooled qualified residential mortgages regarding loan modifications or workout plans. The servicer must determine if modifying the loan will result in greater value than foreclosure for all investors and parties involved in the pooled loans or securitization vehicle. The servicer of pooled qualified residential mortgages must act in the best interests of all investors and parties involved in the securitization vehicle when implementing loan modifications or workout plans. If these efforts fail, the servicer should take other reasonable loss mitigation actions. If the servicer complies with these duties, they will not be held liable under any US law or regulation. The servicer of pooled qualified residential mortgages must act in the best interests of all investors and parties involved in the securitization vehicle when implementing loan modifications or workout plans. They will not be held liable under any US law or regulation for entering into a qualified loan modification or workout plan based on ownership or obligations related to residential mortgages or securitization vehicles. The term 'qualified loan modification or workout plan' refers to a contract or plan for a residential mortgage loan where payment default is likely, the property is the owner's primary residence, and recovery through modification is expected to be better than through foreclosure. The term 'qualified residential mortgage' refers to a consumer credit transaction secured by the borrower's principal dwelling.

The term 'servicer' refers to the person responsible for servicing a loan, including entities listed in subsection (j)(2). This subsection applies only to qualified loan modification or workout plans. The subsection allows for qualified loan modification or workout plans within a 6-month period. It does not limit servicers from entering into other types of plans."
