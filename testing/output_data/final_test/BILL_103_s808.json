    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Volunteer Protection Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that in certain States, volunteers are deterred by the perception of personal liability risk, leading to a decline in volunteer participation in various organizations. This has resulted in diminished community contributions and higher program costs. The Act aims to promote the interests of social service program beneficiaries and sustain the availability of programs and nonprofit organizations by encouraging reasonable reform of State laws to provide protection from personal financial liability to volunteers serving with nonprofit organizations. The Act aims to protect volunteers serving with nonprofit organizations and governmental entities from personal financial liability for actions taken in good faith on behalf of these organizations. SEC. 3. NO PREEMPTION OF STATE TORT LAW. This Act does not preempt state laws on tort liability actions. SEC. 4. STATE STATUTES LIMITING LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS. An allotment may be increased for a State under section 5 if the State statute includes provisions protecting volunteers from personal financial liability for tort claims, as long as they were acting in good faith and within their official duties, and the damage was not caused by willful misconduct. The section provides protection for volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities from civil actions. It also outlines conditions and exceptions for liability, including risk management procedures and mandatory training for volunteers. The organization or entity is liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers. The protection from liability for volunteers of nonprofit organizations or governmental entities extends to the same extent as employer liability for employees, except in cases involving motor vehicle operation or suits by government officers. The organization must provide a secure source of recovery for affected individuals. A financially secure source of recovery is required for individuals injured by a volunteer's actions on behalf of an organization. This can be in the form of insurance, risk pooling, assets, or other arrangements to cover losses up to a specified amount. Different liability exposures may have separate standards. SEC. 5. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT AND ADJUSTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT ALLOTMENTS. SEC. 5 outlines the certification requirement for states to increase their Social Services Block Grant allotments by 1 percent if they comply with certain state laws. The increase remains in effect if the state continues to certify compliance annually. The Act defines key terms such as \"volunteer,\" \"nonprofit organization,\" \"damage or injury,\" and \"State.\" The term \"State\" in the Act includes various states, territories, and political subdivisions of the United States."
