    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Russian Fissile Materials Disposition Loan Guarantee Act of 2001\". Key findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons poses a national security risk to the United States. Countries seeking nuclear capabilities need technical expertise and materials, which the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons complex possesses. Current programs address the potential loss of expertise and materials. Progress on agreements like the Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and Plutonium Disposition Agreement will enhance US security against nuclear proliferation. Additional progress in securing and disposing of nuclear materials would further enhance US security. A program could enhance the economy of the Russian Federation and achieve the interest of nations worldwide in providing for the security of nuclear weapons materials that are not currently under international safeguards. SEC. 3. LOAN GUARANTEES. The Secretary of Energy, with the President's approval, can guarantee loans to the Russian Federation for specific purposes. The total guaranteed loan principal at any time cannot exceed $1 billion. The guarantee covers both principal and specified interest, excluding interest over 3% per year. Eligible loans are those from private lenders to the Russian government for specified purposes. The Government of the Russian Federation can utilize guaranteed loans for purposes like retiring sovereign debt, supporting nuclear nonproliferation programs, and developing energy infrastructure. Loans cannot be used for activities under the Plutonium Disposition Agreement. Loan terms include specific principal increments. The loan terms include specific principal increments of $20,000,000, a minimum term of 15 years, and a payment schedule with a 5-year grace period before any payments are required. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Russian Federation. In case of default, the lender can exercise an option. The Government of the Russian Federation must provide security by placing 1.00 metric tons of something for each $20,000,000 loan principal increment. The Russian Federation must place 1.00 metric tons of weapons-usable plutonium and 1.00 metric tons of weapons-usable highly enriched uranium under IAEA safeguards as security for a $20,000,000 loan increment. The materials must remain under safeguards indefinitely, even after the loan is repaid. In case of default, the lender has the option to take action. The lender may use materials placed under safeguards as security for a loan repayment, following IAEA guidelines. These materials are not part of the weapons-grade plutonium to be used by the Russian Federation. The guarantee of any loan under this section is not considered a contribution to the Russian Federation under the Plutonium Disposition Agreement. The Secretary is prohibited from imposing or collecting any fees for loan guarantees. SEC. 4. SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY MATERIALS SAFEGUARDS. Not more than $15,000,000 each fiscal year shall be available for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to implement safeguards on materials securing loans guaranteed under section 3. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 5. Authorization of Appropriations. Appropriations are authorized for loan guarantees under this Act for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. $10,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary of Energy in fiscal year 2002 for activities under this Act. Amounts appropriated shall remain available until expended. The Act defines terms such as Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement, Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Plutonium Disposition Agreement. The United States signed the Plutonium Disposition Agreement on September 1, 2000, designating plutonium as no longer required for defense purposes. The Secretary of Energy's authority to guarantee loans under the Act will end on December 31, 2004, but guarantees made before that date will remain valid."
