    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Listbroker Privacy Act.\" The Congress finds that commercial list brokers sell detailed information on children for marketing purposes, including names, addresses, ages, and other data. These databases can cover millions of children and include information on ethnicity, family income, and hobbies. Marketing to children is a $12 billion per year industry. Several Federal statutes, such as the No Child Left Behind Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, restrict the collection and disclosure of information about children or students. However, when data on children is collected outside of these statutes, Federal law does not significantly limit the commercial sale or resale of such data. This creates an economic incentive to find new ways to collect and sell children's information, potentially circumventing existing regulations. Marketers and list brokers use various means to gather data about children, including names and addresses. Restriction on sale or purchase of children's personal information. Restriction on sale or purchase of children's personal information prohibits selling or buying personal information about a known child without parental consent or violating certification terms. Exceptions include parental consent and certification for certain cases. Certification is required for the sale of personal information about a child, ensuring that the purchaser specifies the purpose of use and agrees not to use it for marketing to the child or allow others to do so.
