The Cooperative Units of Research in Infectious Disease (CURID) of 1994 was established due to new threats to public health despite advancements in technology and research efforts in AIDS. The development of powerful technology for detecting new infectious agents has led to new concepts of infectious diseases. Advances in scientific understanding of human body's defense mechanisms and genetic characteristics suggest that some chronic diseases may be caused by infectious agents. Chronic illnesses like lung and arthritis diseases are increasing rapidly, with arthritis alone estimated to affect 54.9 million people in the US by 2020. Economic losses from these diseases will continue to cost billions of dollars. Investing in essential research initiatives to detect new infectious agents and investigate the causes of chronic diseases like lung disease and arthritis could lead to early diagnosis and treatment, reducing medical costs and mortality. Sustained funding for collaborative research groups is needed to address the potential role of infectious agents in chronic diseases. Establishment of cooperative research units in infectious diseases is a specific provision outlined in the document. Infectious Disease Research and Clinical Units of Excellence will be established jointly by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Infectious Diseases. These units will focus on chronic inflammatory diseases of suspected infectious origin, prioritizing research on diseases like arthritis and chronic lung disease. The establishment of these units will be based on past research performance of researchers working on specific microorganisms. The units will be responsible for evaluating patient specimens. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Center for Infectious Diseases will establish Infectious Disease Research and Clinical Units of Excellence. These units will focus on chronic inflammatory diseases of suspected infectious origin, such as arthritis and chronic lung disease. Personnel for these units will be selected based on their track record in using molecular diagnostic techniques and clinical experience. The units will provide laboratory support for a network of Clinical Units for patient enrollment and management. The National Center for Infectious Diseases will provide oversight for these units. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide epidemiological and investigative skills for a network of Clinical Units, with grant funding for up to ten years. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases will lead the coordination of research programs and the establishment of no more than 10 research and clinical units at any given time, in consultation with the National Center for Infectious Diseases and expert scientists. The directors of the research and clinical units will be responsible for developing the research plan. Authorization of appropriations for $25,000,000 annually from 1996 to 2006 for research will be evaluated after 10 years. Recommendations will be made by National Advisory Councils to Congress."
