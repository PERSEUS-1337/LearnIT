Article 7 (Section 34390) of the Health and Safety Code requires the Department of Housing and Community Development, in collaboration with the California Housing Finance Agency, to submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018. The report will focus on increasing homeownership opportunities for extremely low, very low, and low-income households by surveying the number of housing authorities and single-family properties available for lease to these families. The report required by Article 7 (Section 34390) of the Health and Safety Code must include information on single-family homes converted to ownership, homes purchased using federal funding, housing authorities with Homeownership Plans, and those administering the Family Self-Sufficiency Program. Collaboration with housing authority associations in California is essential for an accurate survey response rate. The report required by Article 7 of the Health and Safety Code must identify barriers to homeownership for low-income individuals, provide best practices from successful housing authorities, strategies to target low-income individuals, and funding programs for homeownership. The report must be submitted in compliance with Government Code Section 9795 and will be repealed on January 1, 2022. Government Code 13. Pathway To Home Ownership 50295. Defines terms like \"Local government agency,\" \"Purchaser,\" and \"Single-family residence.\" Requires local government agencies to create a mortgage program by January 1, 2018, allocating 10% of single-family residences for purchase by tenants. The mortgage program for tenants of single-family residences includes an informational session, property valuation by the county assessor, and a waitlist if the 10% threshold is met. Local government agencies must adopt regulations for program administration. The mortgage program for tenants of single-family residences has eligibility requirements based on income levels and a maximum mortgage length of 30 years. Local government agencies can reduce payment requirements for purchasers with extremely low income. The local government agency may decline program use if a prospective purchaser can't make on-time payments. Reapplication is allowed if declined. Reimbursement for state-mandated costs will be made to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
