Within 180 days of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will expand the number of certified laboratories for analyzing seafood to ensure compliance with Federal law. These laboratories can be Federal, State, or private facilities, with a list of certified labs to be published in the Federal Register and updated annually. The Secretary of Commerce may increase NOAA laboratories' number and capacity to carry out testing under this Act as necessary. The Secretary of Commerce, with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, can send inspectors to assess seafood practices in exporting countries. A report will be prepared for the Secretary, shared with the country or exporter for feedback within 30 days. The Secretary of Commerce will publish the report in the Federal Register within 60 days after the inspection team's final report. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 is set at $15,000,000 annually to carry out the Act."
