    "content": "The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, established in 1975, aims to secure financial support for children from their noncustodial parent and help families remain self-sufficient. Initially focused on reimbursing states and the federal government for welfare payments, the program now emphasizes obtaining consistent child support and promoting self-sufficiency. The CSE program has evolved over the years to focus on service delivery to both welfare and non-welfare families. The \"family first\" policy established in the 1996 welfare reform legislation aims to help former welfare recipients stay off TANF rolls by prioritizing child support arrearage payments to families. Since the late 1990s, the CSE program has effectively improved the well-being of families by ensuring child support as a reliable source of income. The CSE program provides services to welfare and non-welfare families, offering seven major services including locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and collecting child support payments. All 50 states and four jurisdictions operate CSE programs at the county level, with about 60 tribal nations also running CSE programs. The CSE program is administered by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) within the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The federal government reimburses states for 66% of allowable expenditures on CSE activities, with funding being \"open-ended\" and no upper limit. States collect child support for families receiving TANF to reimburse themselves and the federal government for TANF cash payments. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program requires families receiving TANF to cooperate with the state in establishing paternity and securing child support. States receive incentive payments from the federal government for operating effective CSE programs, which must be reinvested back into the program. Child support collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, liens against property, and suspension of driver's licenses. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program allows agencies to withhold or suspend licenses and seize assets of parents who owe support. Federal law also allows for passport restrictions and criminal penalties. States must follow UIFSA and full faith and credit procedures for child support enforcement. The program served 16.3 million children in FY2014. In FY2014, the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program served 16.3 million children, collecting $28.2 billion in child support payments. Child support represented 49% of income for poor custodial families. The program collected $5.25 for every $1 spent and has been crucial in helping families escape poverty. Congress periodically examines the program's effectiveness and efficiency. The initial CSE law in 1975 led to changes and reforms in subsequent laws with CSE provisions. By the early 1970s, Congress realized the need for child support had shifted from father's death to separation, divorce, or unmarried parents. The federal government and states had a debate over child support until the CSE program was signed into law in 1975 by President Ford. This program aimed to reduce welfare expenditures by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents. The CSE program, signed into law in 1975, aimed to reduce welfare expenditures by obtaining child support from noncustodial parents. It also sought to establish paternity for children born outside of marriage to obtain child support. Senator Russell Long was the chief sponsor of the legislation, emphasizing the importance of not burdening taxpayers with the responsibility of supporting children abandoned by their fathers. President Ford expressed reservations when signing the CSE program into law, citing concerns about federal government involvement in domestic relations and privacy issues. Despite this, subsequent changes to the program aimed to hold parents accountable for financially supporting their children. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, P.L. 98-378, were passed with wide support from various groups and signed into law by President Reagan on August 16, 1984. Representative Barbara Kennelly noted that both traditionalists and feminists agreed on the importance of parents taking responsibility for their children. Reagan signed the Child Support Enforcement Amendments into law on August 16, 1984, emphasizing the importance of parents taking responsibility for their children. He later signed the Family Support Act of 1988, stating it was the culmination of efforts for real welfare reform. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton to improve support from absent parents and reduce welfare dependency. The legislation included tough child support enforcement measures and aimed to move people from welfare to work. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 was signed by President Clinton to crack down on parents who fail to pay child support, with measures such as garnishing wages and revoking driver's licenses. This aimed to reduce welfare dependency and reinforce parental responsibility. President Clinton signed the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 into law, addressing the issue of unpaid child support as a threat to children's education and health. The Act allows for federal charges and up to 2 years in jail for parents who evade child support by fleeing across state lines. President Clinton signed the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 into law, imposing tough penalties on states that fail to automate their child support systems and rewarding states for meeting key child support goals. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 focuses on key child support goals, including paternity establishments and medical support for children. It has undergone multiple changes since its enactment in 1975, with nearly 50 laws modifying the program over time. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 has evolved over time with various changes to the program, including provisions incorporated in omnibus budget bills and legislation amending Social Security Act programs. The first federal child support enforcement legislation was P.L. 81-734, the Social Security Act Amendments of 1950. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 added Section 402(a)(11) requiring state welfare agencies to notify law enforcement about abandoned or deserted children receiving AFDC. This provision shifted the responsibility of pursuing noncustodial parents who deserted their families to prosecutors. Additionally, the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) was approved in 1950 as a model state law for enforcing child support. The Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) was approved as a model state law in 1950 and enacted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. It was amended in 1952, 1958, and revised in 1968. URESA allowed for interstate enforcement of child support orders without the need for the person seeking support to go to the state where the noncustodial parent resided. P.L. 89-97 in 1965 and P.L. 90-248 in 1967 further facilitated the process by allowing welfare agencies to obtain the address and employment information of absent parents who owed child support. The 1967 amendments gave the newly established organizational unit the responsibility of establishing paternity and collecting child support, with federal reimbursement at a 50% rate. The Social Services Amendments of 1974 created part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, with key child support enforcement provisions. The Department of Health and Human Services was given primary responsibility for the program, including establishing a Federal Parent Locator Service and certifying cases for referral to federal courts for support enforcement. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program's responsibilities include certifying cases for referral to federal courts, IRS for support collections, and garnishing moneys due to federal employees. States are primarily responsible for operating the program, with requirements such as designating a unit for administration, establishing paternity, and collecting child support payments for distribution. The program also involves providing technical assistance, maintaining records, and submitting annual reports to Congress. The Child Support Enforcement program requires states to provide support enforcement services, make child support payments to the state for distribution, enter into cooperative agreements with courts and law enforcement, establish a State Parent Locator Service, cooperate with other states in locating absent parents and securing support, and maintain records of collections and disbursements. New eligibility requirements for the AFDC program include making an assignment of support rights to the state, cooperating in establishing paternity, and providing Social Security numbers. The 1975 law required states to offer Child Support Enforcement (CSE) services to individuals not receiving AFDC, allowing for application fees and cost recovery from child support payments. Child support for AFDC recipients had to be paid to the state, enabling states and the federal government to recoup some AFDC expenditures. P.L. 93-647 incentivized states to collect child support payments for AFDC recipients, allowing for reimbursement of AFDC expenditures by using the collected child support. Financial incentives were provided to localities that collected child support payments on behalf of state CSE agencies. The payment incentive for states collecting child support payments was based on the timing of collections, starting at 25% for the first 12 months and then dropping to 10%. The incentive payments came from the federal government's portion of child support collections, with no cost to the states. P.L. 93-647 required the Secretary of HEW to reimburse states 75% of their CSE expenditures, excluding non-AFDC families after June 30, 1976. P.L. 93-647 mandated that states would lose 5% of their AFDC reimbursement if found non-compliant with the CSE state plan. P.L. 94-46 delayed the CSE program's effective date to August 1, 1975, due to identified problems. P.L. 94-88 allowed states to obtain waivers from certain program requirements until June 30, 1976, and receive federal reimbursement at a reduced rate of 50%. P.L. 94-88 allowed states to obtain waivers from program requirements until June 30, 1976, and receive federal reimbursement at a reduced rate of 50%. P.L. 94-365 extended funding for CSE services for non-AFDC families for one year. P.L. 94-566 required state employment agencies to provide absent parents' addresses to state CSE agencies. P.L. 95-30 made amendments to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. In 1977, amendments to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act included provisions for garnishment of federal employee wages for child support, expanded to include District of Columbia employees. It specified procedures for serving garnishments on federal agencies, authorized garnishment regulations by federal branches and DC, and required bonding for employees handling cash. Incentive payment rate under Section 458(a) of the Social Security Act was changed to 15% of AFDC collections. P.L. 95-59 extended CSE funding for non-AFDC families, P.L. 95-142 established a medical support enforcement program under Medicaid, and P.L. 95-598 repealed a section of the Social Security Act. P.L. 95-598 repealed Section 456(b) of the Social Security Act, allowing child support debts assigned to a state to be discharged in bankruptcy. P.L. 96-178 extended federal financial participation for CSE services, and P.L. 96-265 increased federal matching funds for child support management information systems. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-272) made federal matching funds available for child support enforcement duties, authorized the IRS to collect child support arrearages for non-AFDC families, and provided access to wage information for establishing and enforcing child support obligations. It also allowed states to receive incentive payments on all AFDC collections and imposed a two-year deadline for claiming reimbursement for expenditures. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-35) amended Title IV-D of the Social Security Act in several ways. It authorized the IRS to withhold federal income tax refunds for delinquent child support, allowed CSE agencies to collect spousal support for AFDC families, required fees from delinquent absent parents, made child support obligations non-dischargeable in bankruptcy, and mandated withholding of unemployment benefits for noncustodial parents behind on support payments. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) made changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, including reducing the Federal Financial Participation (FFP) from 75% to 70% and incentives from 15% to 12%. It also repealed provisions for reimbursement of court costs exceeding 1978 levels, eliminated mandatory fees for CSE services in non-AFDC cases, and allowed states to establish application fees for custodial parents not on AFDC. Beginning October 1, 1982, states were allowed to collect spousal support in certain non-AFDC cases and reimburse themselves for AFDC grants paid to families when child support collections made them ineligible for AFDC. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (P.L. 97-252) authorized the division of military retirement pay in divorce proceedings and allowed for child and spousal support payments from this pay. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 allowed for the disclosure of information obtained under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to state CSE agencies. The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1983 made child support debts non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 required states to pass through the first $50 of monthly child support payments collected on behalf of an AFDC family. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 allowed for the disclosure of information obtained under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 to state CSE agencies. The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1983 made child support debts non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 required states to pass through the first $50 of monthly child support payments collected on behalf of an AFDC family. P.L. 98-369 included provisions to disregard income for AFDC families and allocate the $1,000 dependency exemption for children of divorced or separated parents. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required states to improve enforcement mechanisms, including income withholding, expedited processes for support orders, tax refund interceptions, liens on property, and reporting delinquency information. Paternity actions could be brought before a child's 18th birthday, and support orders after October 1, 1985, had to include wage withholding provisions. Federal matching funds were reduced to 66% by 1990 to incentivize performance-based outcomes. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required states to enhance enforcement mechanisms, such as income withholding and expedited support order processes. Federal matching funds were reduced to 66% by 1990. State incentives for AFDC and non-AFDC collections were set at 6%, with potential increases for cost-effective states. Audits were conducted every three years to evaluate program effectiveness and compliance, with penalties for noncompliance ranging from 1% to 5% of the federal share of AFDC funds. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required states to enhance enforcement mechanisms, such as income withholding and expedited support order processes. States were required to apply enforcement techniques to interstate and intrastate cases, with federal audits focusing on effectiveness in establishing and enforcing obligations across state lines. Special demonstration grants were authorized in 1985 for innovative methods of interstate enforcement and collection. Mandatory practices had to be available for both AFDC and non-AFDC cases, including the interception of federal income tax refunds for non-AFDC cases. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required states to enhance enforcement mechanisms, such as income withholding and expedited support order processes. Incentive payments for non-AFDC cases became available for the first time. States were required to continue child support services to families terminated from welfare without charging an application fee. States were required to publicize the availability of CSE services for non-AFDC parents and establish state commissions to study the operation of the state's child support system. The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 required states to enhance enforcement mechanisms and establish guidelines for determining child support obligations. It also allowed families to remain eligible for Medicaid after receiving child support payments and provided waiver authority for research projects. The Federal Parent Locator Service was improved to locate absent parents more effectively. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1986 and 1987, along with the Family Support Act of 1988, strengthened child support enforcement by prohibiting retroactive modifications, expanding services to families with absent parents on Medicaid, and emphasizing parental responsibility for child support as a means to reduce welfare dependence. The Family Support Act of 1988 emphasized child support enforcement as a way to reduce welfare dependence. Key provisions included using state guidelines for child support, reviewing awards every few years, establishing paternity, and determining the Paternity Establishment Percentage. The Paternity Establishment Percentage (PEP) compares paternities established during the fiscal year with the number of nonmarital births in the preceding fiscal year. States had to meet federal requirements for PEP, including a minimum percentage and increasing by 3% annually. Genetic testing in contested paternity cases was mandated, with a 90% federal matching rate for laboratory testing. Child support enforcement disregard was clarified under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The Secretary of HHS set time limits for states to respond to requests for assistance in establishing support orders and distributing child support payments. States without automated tracking systems had to submit a planning document by October 1, 1991, and have an approved system by October 1, 1995. A Commission on Interstate Child Support was created to address enforcement reform. The Commission on Interstate Child Support was tasked with recommending improvements in the system and revisions in the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act. States were required to exclude amounts spent on interstate demonstration projects from incentive payments. The Secretaries of Labor and HHS had to provide prompt access to wage and unemployment information for locating absent parents. States had to implement immediate wage withholding for CSE cases unless good cause was shown. The court found good cause not to require wage withholding if there was a written agreement between parties. Prior law required immediate wage withholding for support orders not subject to it. States had to implement immediate wage withholding for all support orders issued after January 1, 1994. The Secretary of HHS was required to grant waivers for states to provide services to noncustodial parents under the JOBS training program. No new power was given to states to require participation by noncustodial parents. The Secretary of HHS had to collect state-by-state statistics on paternity establishment and locating absent parents. The new law required states to collect statistics on paternity establishment, locating absent parents for support obligations, enforcing child support, and modifying established obligations. Each parent had to provide their Social Security number for birth records, with restrictions on its use. States were mandated to inform AFDC families of support collected monthly, with an option for quarterly notification. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts of 1989 and 1990 extended Medicaid benefits for families losing AFDC eligibility due to child support payments. The federal provision allowing states to collect child support arrearages from federal tax refunds was also made permanent. The IRS offset for child support could be used for spousal support as well. The Interstate Child Support Commission's existence was extended, and P.L. 102-521 imposed a federal criminal penalty for willful failure to pay past-due child support obligations. The Ted Weiss Child Support Enforcement Act of 1992 amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require consumer reporting agencies to include information on overdue child support in credit reports. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the percentage of children for whom paternity must be established, with financial penalties for non-compliance. The Ted Weiss Child Support Enforcement Act of 1992 amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to include overdue child support in credit reports. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 raised the paternity establishment percentage to 75% with financial penalties for non-compliance. P.L. 103-383, the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, required states to enforce child support orders from other states. P.L. 103-383, the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act, impacted interstate processing of child support cases by requiring states to enforce child support orders issued by courts of other states under certain conditions. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-394) stated that bankruptcy does not stop child support or alimony proceedings. Child support and alimony payments were given priority in bankruptcy proceedings. The Small Business Administration Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-403) made parents who didn't pay child support ineligible for small business loans. The Social Security Act Amendments of 1994 (P.L. 103-432) required states to report debtor parents to credit agencies periodically. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 made major reforms to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, with nearly 50 significant changes to child support law. This included requiring states to report debtor parents to credit agencies periodically and extending the deadline for implementing automated data processing systems for the CSE program. The rules for distributing child support collections among the federal government, state governments, and families on welfare were changed. The pass-through of the first $50 in child support to welfare families was no longer a federal requirement. States had to distribute current support and arrearages to families before being reimbursed for welfare costs. States also had to distribute arrearages to families before receiving welfare reimbursement. These rules did not apply to tax refund intercepts. States were required to pay a higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families. The new law required states to pay a higher fraction of child support collections on arrearages to families first before the state, with federal reimbursement for any losses. It also included clarifications on ''fill-the-gap'' policy, safeguards against unauthorized use of information, and requirements for informing parents of proceedings and providing them with updated child support orders. States received investments to improve information systems. States were required to establish a registry of all child support cases, including specific data elements, and create a centralized automated disbursement unit for payments. This information was used to enforce and update child support orders by conducting matches with other data systems. The CSE State Disbursement Unit handled child support payments and enforced cases with income withholding orders. Employers were required to report new hires to a centralized State Directory of New Hires within 20 days, with matches against the State Case Registry using Social Security numbers. Within two days of data entry in the Registry, employers had to be notified of the amount to be withheld and where to send the money. Within three days, new employee information had to be reported to the National Directory of New Hires. New hire information had to be shared with state agencies for various programs. States using private contractors could share new hire information with contractors. Laws clarified that child support orders not subject to income withholding would become subject to income withholding without a hearing if arrearages occur. Rules were established for income withholding in interstate cases and a uniform definition of income was set. Employers had to remit withheld income to the State Disbursement Unit within seven days. The new law expanded the functions of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) to include establishing parentage, enforcing support orders, and enforcing custody or visitation orders. The FPLS had to match information from state case registries with new hire directories every two days and report matches to state agencies promptly. All federal agencies were required to report information as well. The new law expanded the functions of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS) to include establishing parentage, enforcing support orders, and enforcing custody or visitation orders. State and federal agencies had to report information to the FPLS for matching against state child support cases. The HHS Secretary ensured information sharing with relevant agencies and established fees for FPLS usage. States were required to record Social Security numbers. The law required all states to record Social Security numbers in various records and enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. States could use other interstate procedures if deemed more effective. The law also clarified definitions and provisions for interstate cases. The Uniform Interstate Family Support Act required states to have laws allowing them to send and receive child support orders from other states. States had to match cases against their databases within five days, take action if a match occurred, and send collections to the initiating state. The HHS Secretary issued forms for withholding income and imposing liens in interstate cases. States had to adopt laws giving the CSE agency authority to expedite procedures without obtaining orders from other tribunals, including genetic testing and issuing subpoenas. The actions required under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act included ordering genetic testing, issuing subpoenas, obtaining various records, directing payments to the CSE agency, securing assets for arrearages, and increasing monthly support payments. States were mandated to have laws permitting these actions. States were required to have laws promoting paternity establishment, including genetic testing in contested cases at state expense. They had to create a civil process for voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and issue an affidavit based on a form by the HHS Secretary. The father's name was not to appear on the birth certificate if the parents were unmarried. State laws required paternity establishment through genetic testing in contested cases at state expense. A paternity acknowledgment had to be signed for the father's name to appear on the birth certificate. Genetic testing results were admissible in court without additional testimony, establishing a presumption of paternity. Temporary support orders had to be issued based on genetic testing or clear evidence, with bills for related expenses admissible in judicial proceedings. Genetic testing for paternity had to be admissible in court without foundation testimony, constituting evidence of costs incurred. Fathers had the right to initiate paternity actions, with voluntary acknowledgments and adjudications filed in state birth registries for matching with child support orders. States were required to promote voluntary establishment of paternity and child support. Applicants for public assistance had to provide noncustodial parent information and participate in legal proceedings. States could make exceptions based on the child's best interests. The HHS Secretary was tasked with developing a new child support incentive system and reporting details to Congress by March 1, 1997. States were given the option to calculate the paternity establishment rate relative to all out-of-wedlock births in the state. The mandatory paternity establishment rate was increased from 75% to 90%, with states required to annually review and report compliance to the HHS Secretary. The HHS Secretary had to report information to determine state compliance with federal requirements for expedited procedures, timely case processing, and performance indicators. States had to use uniform definitions, and the Secretary used this data to calculate incentives, penalties, and review compliance. Audits were conducted at least once every three years to assess data quality and financial management. States had to establish an automated data system to meet federal reporting requirements and calculate performance indicators. The legislation required states to meet data requirements by October 1, 1997, with federal funding available at a 90% matching rate. $400 million was allocated to states for meeting these requirements, with the HHS Secretary determining the distribution. Technical assistance and operation of the FPLS could be funded using a portion of federal child support collections. The legislation allowed up to 2% of federal funding to operate the FPLS. The HHS Secretary had to report child support collection amounts, costs to governments, and support due and collected. States were given flexibility in reviewing child support orders every three years. Consumer credit agencies had to release information on parents owing child support to CSE agencies. Child support enforcement for federal employees, retirees, and military personnel was strengthened, with agencies ensuring privacy and immunity for financial institutions. Unauthorized disclosures of financial records could result in civil actions and a $1,000 penalty per disclosure. Federal agencies had designated agents to handle child support cases, with responsibilities similar to private businesses. The Secretary of Defense established a central personnel locator service for the Armed Services to locate members. Each branch of the military had to grant leave for child support hearings and withhold support from retirement pay. States had laws to void transfers to avoid child support payments. States were required to have procedures for voiding transfers to avoid child support payments, issue orders for repayment, report to credit bureaus, establish liens on property for overdue child support, and withhold licenses from individuals owing child support. The state CSE agencies had to partner with financial institutions to develop a data match system for collecting past-due child support. Financial institutions were required to surrender assets of delinquent parents in response to state liens or levies. The Internal Revenue Code was amended to prevent additional fees for adjustments to certified amounts. The Secretary of HHS could request the State Department to restrict passports for individuals owing over $5,000 in child support arrears. The U.S. amended laws to establish reciprocity with foreign countries for enforcing support orders, ensuring free access to services in nations with agreements. State child support plans had to treat international requests like interstate cases. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code was changed to prevent discharge of child support debt owed to a state. States with Indian country could partner with tribes for child support enforcement. The U.S. amended laws to establish reciprocity with foreign countries for enforcing support orders and prevent discharge of child support debt in bankruptcy. The HHS Secretary could make direct payments to tribes with approved CSE plans. Orders enforced by state CSE agencies must include health care coverage provisions. P.L. 104-193 guaranteed funding for access and visitation programs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made technical changes to the 1996 welfare reform law related to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. It exempted certain families from paying an application fee for CSE services and modified child support requirements. States were required to monitor, evaluate, and report on their programs in accordance with regulations issued by the HHS Secretary. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made technical changes to the 1996 welfare reform law related to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. It included provisions on distribution of collections, civil penalties for failure to report required information, uses of the Federal Parent Locator Service, collection and use of Social Security numbers, availability of funds for the Federal Parent Locator Service, authority to collect child support from federal employees, direct federal grants to Indian tribes, state retention of child support amounts, and high-volume automated administrative enforcement. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established new felony offenses for evading child support obligations, including traveling across state lines to evade payment. It also included provisions for suspending certain licenses for non-payment, protecting information from the Federal Parent Locator Service in cases of domestic violence or child abuse, and making technical changes to the enforcement procedures. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a revised incentive payment system for states based on their collections, with specific annual caps and reinvestment requirements. The Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 established a revised incentive payment system for states based on their performance levels compared to other states. States had to meet data quality standards to avoid federal financial penalties. P.L. 105-200 imposed penalties for not meeting deadlines for implementing CSE automated systems and included provisions for medical support and privacy protections. P.L. 105-306 made technical amendments to P.L. 105-200. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 provided penalties and alternative options for states not in compliance with child support requirements, including a reduction in federal child support funding for non-compliant states. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 imposed penalties on states for noncompliance with child support requirements, reducing federal funding by varying percentages for each year of noncompliance. It also allowed access to the National Directory of New Hires for the Department of Education to improve collection on defaulted student loans and grant overpayments. The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 limited the hold harmless requirement of current law. The Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 limited the hold harmless requirement of current law by stipulating conditions for states to receive hold harmless funds. P.L. 106-169 repealed this provision in 2001. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 and subsequent acts granted access to the National Directory of New Hires to various government agencies for verifying employment and income of individuals receiving federal assistance. This included state workforce agencies and the Department of the Treasury to collect nontax debt owed to the federal government. P.L. 109-171, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, made changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, including reducing federal matching rates, ending federal matching of state expenditures reinvested back into the program, and requiring states to assess a $25 annual user fee for child support services. It also simplified CSE distribution rules and extended incentives to states to allow more child support to go to former welfare families and families still on welfare. States that passed through some collected child support to TANF families did not have to pay the federal government its share of such collections. P.L. 109-171, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, made changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, including provisions to lower the threshold amount for denial of a passport to noncustodial parents who owe past-due child support, use federal income tax refund offset program to collect past-due child support, compare information of noncustodial parents with insurers' data, and establish CSE interstate cases based on other states' requests for assistance.

Indian tribes were granted access to the Federal Parent Locator Service. Indian tribes or tribal organizations operating a CSE program can be considered a state for conducting experimental projects under Section 1115 waiver authority. P.L. 113-183 emphasized the importance of establishing parenting time arrangements alongside child support orders, with strong family violence safeguards. It also mandated data standardization within the CSE program to enhance information exchange between systems and entities. The CSE program required states to use electronic processing for child support payments and mandated data standardization to enhance information exchange."
