    "content": "This report discusses the definition of drought, its classification, past drought periods in the US, future climate prospects, and policy challenges for Congress. It also provides answers to frequently asked questions about drought. Drought is defined as a lack of precipitation over an extended period, usually a season or more. Severe and extended droughts are part of natural climate cycles, with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean being a key factor. Regional predictions for drought remain limited to a few months in advance. The future of drought in the United States is uncertain, with the possibility of extended droughts and more arid conditions in some regions. This could pose challenges to federal programs and water projects designed based on 20th-century climate conditions. The American West may transition to a more arid climate due to greenhouse gas buildup, potentially leading to increased extreme droughts. Despite significant drought impacts, there is currently no comprehensive national drought policy in place. Developing such a policy is crucial for addressing future drought challenges. The absence of a comprehensive national drought policy poses challenges due to federal and nonfederal responsibilities, existing patchwork of programs, and regional differences. Recommendations from the National Drought Policy Commission in 2000 have not all been implemented by Congress. Reviewing federal responses and programs for drought mitigation and preparedness may be necessary given current conditions. The potential for severe droughts similar to historical periods raises concerns about the adequacy of existing federal measures. The severe drought periods in the United States raise issues for Congress on how to respond, prepare for future droughts, and coordinate federal agency actions. Drought impacts agriculture, power production, navigation, water supplies, and natural resources. Addressing these impacts is a recurring issue for Congress, with emergency responses being costly. Millions or billions of dollars in federal assistance may be needed to address the social consequences of drought. Drought has historically impacted North America for thousands of years, leading to societal disintegration in various regions. Severe droughts in the 20th century, such as the Dust Bowl era in the 1930s, caused widespread economic disruption and population displacement. Drought conditions are categorized into five levels, with significant implications for agriculture, power production, water supplies, and natural resources. Coordination among federal agencies is crucial to efficiently prepare for and mitigate future drought impacts. Since 2000, drought conditions in the United States have varied from 6.6% to 55% of the land area affected by at least moderate intensity drought annually. On average, 26% of the country's land area has been impacted by moderate-intensity drought. Since 2000, extreme and exceptional drought conditions have affected a significant portion of the United States, with Texas experiencing the largest land area affected by exceptional drought in 2011. In 2012, over 20% of the country was under extreme drought. The year 2013 is expected to have widespread drought conditions, especially in the Great Plains and eastern Midwest. Exceptional drought conditions persist in central and western parts of the United States during spring 2013, with over 60% of the land area affected. The drought varied in intensity across the country, leading to lower crop yields in the Midwest and Great Plains in 2012. In 2012, the U.S. experienced a severe drought, leading to lower crop yields and crop insurance indemnities totaling $16 billion. The drought continued into 2013, affecting wheat, other crops, and livestock conditions. Exceptional drought conditions were seen in Texas, Florida, and Georgia in 2012, while in 2013, the drought intensified in the central U.S. from Texas to the Canadian border. Nearly 12% of the contiguous United States experienced exceptional drought conditions from late June 2011 through October 2011, compared to approximately 6% the following year. The 2012-2013 drought affected broader agricultural regions than in 2011, with exceptional drought persisting over nearly 6% of the country from mid-August 2012 through mid-February 2013. The extent, timing, and specific features of areas affected by drought are crucial, as shown in Figure 2 depicting drought conditions in North America from 2010-2013. The 2012-2013 drought in North America raised questions about its origin and connection to climate change. A March 2013 analysis concluded that the intense drought was a discrete extreme event, not a continuation of the prior year's conditions. The drought developed suddenly, with near-normal precipitation during winter. The 2012 summer drought in the Great Plains was a climate surprise, with the driest summer on record due to a lack of precipitation. This extreme event was not linked to rising sea surface temperatures or greenhouse gases. Changes in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere led to the anomalously dry conditions over the central Great Plains in 2012. Drought is defined as a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period, relative to long-term average conditions. It is important to differentiate between drought, which has a beginning and end, and aridity, which is a permanent feature of low rainfall regions like deserts. Drought is a relatively permanent feature of an area's climate, with higher demand for water increasing severity. Policy issues arise when there is a water supply deficiency for various needs like irrigation and energy production. Impacts include decreased rainfall affecting farming and low reservoir levels reducing allocations for multiple purposes. Drought impacts various sectors such as energy production, recreation, and fish and wildlife needs, leading to low stream flows and water quality issues. The U.S. Drought Monitor tracks drought conditions nationally, impacting phenomena like fires and heat waves. Regional variations in drought severity are evident, with areas like southern Texas facing challenges like water restrictions. The U.S. Drought Monitor highlighted extreme to exceptional drought in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, in early April 2013. Despite both cities facing drought, Corpus Christi receives more precipitation on average than Albuquerque. Meteorologists use the term meteorological drought to assess dryness relative to normal conditions, which vary by region due to different atmospheric conditions. The U.S. Drought Monitor uses experimental designations \"S\" and \"L\" instead of \"A\" and \"H\" to indicate short-term effects of drought on agricultural and hydrological impacts. The U.S. Drought Monitor uses designations \"S\" and \"L\" to indicate short-term and long-term effects of drought on agriculture, topsoil moisture, streamflows, wildfire danger, reservoir levels, groundwater, and lake levels. The intensity of drought is classified from abnormally dry to exceptional drought. Drought indices are used to assess intensity and trigger responses at local, state, and federal levels. The U.S. Drought Monitor uses five key indicators and expert opinion to classify drought intensity from D0 to D4. This classification triggers responses at local, state, and federal levels, leading to relief funding for drought-stricken regions. The intensity scheme may not reflect local drought conditions accurately. In early April 2011, over 80% of Texas was experiencing severe to extreme drought, with nearly 10% in exceptional drought. Drought conditions worsened through October 2011, with 88% of the state in exceptional drought. Conditions improved later in the year, but large portions of Texas were still affected by drought. In 2011, Texas experienced severe to extreme drought, with nearly 10% in exceptional drought. By early 2012, the eastern portion of the state recovered to normal conditions due to above-normal rainfall. In April 2012, the drought had eased somewhat, with 50% of the state in severe drought. However, by April 2013, approximately 70% of Texas was experiencing severe drought, with extreme and exceptional drought affecting 30% and 12% respectively. Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon stated that 2011 may have been the worst one-year drought on record for the state. The effects of abnormally low precipitation in Texas led to a significant increase in summer temperatures, with the 2011 drought causing water supply and agricultural deficiencies. The severe drought from 1950 to 1957 had lasting impacts on water supplies, influencing current municipal water systems. Long-term precipitation patterns in Texas are influenced by sea surface temperatures like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The 2007-2009 California drought was influenced by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and was the 12th driest three-year period in California history. Dry conditions persisted from 2007 through 2009, with tensions over water supply deliveries and conservation efforts for endangered species. Despite some improvement in hydrological conditions in 2010 and 2011, the 2012 water year was classified as below normal for the Sacramento River basin and dry for the San Joaquin River basin. In 2012, the drought severity increased in California, leading to water delivery restrictions for state and federal water project contractors. The dry conditions from 2007-2009 worsened the water supply situation, with restrictions due to legal actions to protect species and water quality requirements. Some federal agricultural water supply contractors are projected to receive only 20% of their water allocation for 2013. Some federal agricultural water supply contractors in California are projected to receive only 20% of contract water supplies from the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project as of April 5, 2013, due to severe drought conditions. The Colorado River basin, spanning multiple states, is over-allocated, leading to supply and demand imbalances that are expected to worsen in the future. The forecast for Lake Powell in 2013 is below average due to dry conditions, with inflow anticipated at 5.3 million acre-feet. The Bureau of Reclamation will release 8.2 million acre-feet for downstream purposes, leading to a net drop in the lake level. Storage levels are predicted to be near historic lows, with Lake Powell at 44% of capacity. Reclamation predicts Lake Powell storage levels will be 44% of capacity in 2005 due to drought in the upper basin, leading to tensions over water sharing among various uses. Water allocation within states is determined by state water law, federal and state laws, and court decisions, with apportionment among the seven basin states based on the Colorado River Compact and the \"Law of the River.\" Low water availability in the Colorado River basin has wide-ranging effects. Low water availability in the Colorado River basin has effects beyond the basin boundaries, with water being transported to different regions for agricultural and municipal uses. Drought is caused by sinking air motion leading to high pressure, inhibiting cloud formation and precipitation. Regions under semi-permanent high pressure often become deserts. Predicting prolonged droughts is challenging due to various factors like air-sea interactions, topography, and soil moisture. Scientists aim to improve forecasting abilities beyond a season or two in advance. In the tropics, sea surface temperatures play a significant role in atmospheric variability. Drought in the United States has been linked to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures since the mid- to late 1990s. Scientists have linked drought in the United States to cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This correlation has been shown to be associated with persistent drought conditions, particularly in the Western part of the country. Studies have connected these cooler sea surface temperatures to past droughts, including the 1998-2004 western drought and precolonial \"megadroughts\" that were more extreme and longer-lasting than any droughts since 1850. Modeling studies suggest that the western United States may face increased aridity similar to the period between 900-1300 A.D. in the coming decades. Improved understanding of global linkages between weather systems like El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has shown connections between La Ni\u00f1a conditions and simultaneous drought in various regions. Drought is influenced by multiple factors, making accurate prediction challenging beyond a few months or seasons. The relationship between cooler eastern tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures and drought is becoming more established, with historical evidence suggesting increased aridity in the western United States similar to the 900-1300 A.D. period. Severe drought has been a recurring natural disaster in North America for over 1,000 years, affecting regions like the coterminous United States, including the western states and the East. Tree-ring records show multidecadal drought in the American Southwest during the 13th century, impacting Pueblo society. Additionally, severe drought occurred in the central and lower Mississippi Valley during the 14th to 16th centuries. Severe droughts in the central and lower Mississippi Valley during the 14th to 16th centuries possibly led to societal disintegration. In the 19th century, severe droughts occurred in 1856-1865, 1870-1877, and 1890-1896. The 1856-1865 drought was the most severe in the Great Plains and Southwest. The 1890-1896 drought coincided with federal efforts to irrigate western states. In the 20th century, the 1930s \"Dust Bowl\" drought was significant. The 20th century saw severe droughts like the \"Dust Bowl\" in the 1930s and the Southwest drought in the 1950s. Studies show that these droughts were less severe compared to the megadroughts of 900 to 1300 A.D. Climate change's impact on future drought trends is complex and not fully understood. Climate change and future trends in droughts are complex and evolving. The IPCC's 2007 Fourth Assessment Report stated that very dry areas globally have more than doubled since the 1970s due to ENSO events and global warming. However, the IPCC's 2012 report noted uncertainties in observed global-scale trends in droughts, highlighting the need for further research. The 2012 IPCC report found that trends in drought duration, intensity, and severity were predominantly decreasing in North America, with regional variations. It noted a slight wetting trend with increasing soil moisture and runoff, and stated that recent droughts were not unprecedented compared to severe megadroughts in the past. The 2012 IPCC report concluded that while there is limited evidence to attribute observed changes in drought patterns, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic influence has contributed to changes in the second half of the 20th century. Some regions like southern Europe and West Africa have experienced more intense and longer droughts, while others like central North America and northwestern Australia have seen less frequent or intense droughts. The impact of the 2011-2012 drought in the central United States on this assessment in the forthcoming IPCC report (2014) is still uncertain. The 2014 IPCC report is still uncertain about the impact of the 2011-2012 drought in the central United States. Recent simulations of past megadroughts have shown discrepancies in timing, indicating a lack of understanding in the dynamics that drive large droughts. Federal responses are triggered when a drought is declared, leading to alerts, recommendations, activities, and possible restrictions at the local, regional, or state level. Ultimately, a drought could prompt a federal response. Before drought severity reaches a level triggering a federal response, many states take action. The National Drought Mitigation Center provides online copies of drought management plans for states. Some states have water banks and transfer mechanisms to address water supply shortages. State governors can request drought disaster assistance from the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, who can declare an agricultural disaster and provide low-interest loans and emergency assistance to farmers and ranchers. Under a new streamlined process by the Farm Services Agency (FSA), counties experiencing severe drought for eight consecutive weeks can receive automatic USDA disaster declarations. Over 1,400 U.S. counties in 33 states were designated as drought disaster areas by the Secretary. Additionally, if a portion of a county is identified as undergoing severe drought, it may also be declared a disaster area. More than 1,180 counties were designated as drought disaster areas for crop loss purposes in 2013. The President can provide assistance if state or local resources are overwhelmed by the effects of a drought. The President can issue disaster declarations under the Stafford Act for droughts, but domestic declarations are rare. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture typically leads in responding to droughts and declaring eligibility for assistance, although congressional interest extends beyond the USDA. The 2012 drought raised interest in federal agencies' drought assistance authorities. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation have limited emergency drought authorities and funding. The frequency, impact, and coordination of their use with other federal and state drought efforts have not been monitored and assessed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has authority to assist with well construction and water transport to drought-affected areas, with federal funding available for transport costs. Congress has granted Reclamation broader authorities for drought response in 17 western states and Hawaii. Other federal agencies are also taking actions to address drought impacts, including convening a White House Rural Council to assess federal agency activities and capabilities in response to the 2012 drought. The federal government is taking various actions to address the impacts of the 2012 drought, including providing waivers for trucking regulations and emergency funding for crop and livestock producers. Federal water resource facilities, such as reservoirs behind dams, play a crucial role in meeting water supply needs during droughts but can also be vulnerable to droughts. Dams in the West were built to provide multi-year storage for variations in precipitation, but sustained hydrological droughts can affect the operations of federally managed water infrastructure. Numerous Corps reservoirs have drought management plans that prioritize certain benefits, like maintaining water quality, over others, such as navigation and hydropower. During droughts, federal water resource facilities face operational challenges due to conflicts among water users. For example, in California from 2007 to 2009, Reclamation facilities had to reduce water deliveries to contractors, impacting millions of people. Similarly, the Corps' operations in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system during 2007-2008 show management tradeoffs to maintain various benefits like in-stream flows and water supplies. During drought, federal water resource facilities face operational challenges due to conflicts among water users. In the Klamath River basin, severe drought conditions exacerbated competition for scarce water resources among various stakeholders. Reclamation's decision to withhold water for endangered fish species sparked congressional debate. The basin experienced drought conditions in 2010 and 2012, leading to water flow halts and a cholera outbreak among migrating birds. The droughts in California, the Southeast, and the Klamath River basin have led to challenges in managing federal reservoirs to meet water needs. Low lake levels and inflows have caused delays in water deliveries, impacting wildlife and federally listed species. Future droughts may pose even greater difficulties in managing water resources. The ACF basin and Klamath River basin's influence on federal infrastructure management in California may impact short-term actions by Reclamation and the Corps, with long-term consequences for congressional oversight and funding. Predicting severe droughts in advance is challenging due to various factors, but some studies suggest a shift towards a drier climate in the American West. Human-induced climate change may play a role in this trend. Higher temperatures in the West could lead to increased evapotranspiration, reduced precipitation, and decreased spring runoff. This could result in more frequent droughts and floods, but these changes would not be uniform across the United States. Observations show decreasing runoff and streamflow in the Colorado and Columbia River basins, less ice in mountain glaciers, and lower annual precipitation in the Southwest. Understanding hydrologic extremes like drought is complicated by factors such as land cover changes, dam operations, and groundwater extraction. Forecasting drought at a regional scale is challenging due to the limitations of current climate models. However, it is crucial for water managers to anticipate potential changes in long-term trends to address water allocation and project operations effectively. Deviations from historical hydrological trends can pose significant challenges for water management at all levels. The Colorado River basin faces challenges due to low reservoir levels and flows, raising questions about future water allocation policies. If reduced runoff predictions hold true, allocation policies may need to be revisited. The Colorado River basin states have negotiated \"shortage criteria\" and \"interim guidelines\" for managing water supplies during shortages. A new study in December 2012 examined future water supply and demand scenarios. Drought can cause economic harm and water competition, but national drought policy faces challenges due to the gradual nature of drought, split federal and nonfederal responsibilities, lack of coordination, and regional differences in drought risk. Drought conditions develop slowly and are challenging to forecast beyond 30 to 90 days, making it difficult to mitigate or prevent impacts. Adjusting water use during severe droughts can be challenging, as they can increase demand on water supplies. The unpredictability of drought location, duration, and severity complicates preparation for responses. The lack of flexibility in existing water access arrangements can hinder drought responses. Water resource decisions are made by federal, state, and local authorities amidst conflicting laws and objectives. State laws determine how water access and competition are managed, as well as how reductions in water supply are handled. State and local laws also dictate the ease of water transfer among users. State and local laws play a crucial role in determining water transfer arrangements among users, impacting behavior and opportunities during droughts. While federal action is limited in changing these arrangements, federal policies can indirectly influence state decisions. Stakeholders must anticipate drought impacts and plan accordingly, with the federal government offering monitoring and response programs to assist. The federal government provides drought planning assistance primarily focused on the West, with emergency funding aimed at easing economic impacts. However, federal relief programs lack incentives for state and local planning to reduce vulnerability. State and local decision makers face challenges in determining demand management tools during droughts, influenced by water distribution among competing uses. The lack of a cohesive national drought policy at the federal level further complicates the situation. The lack of a cohesive national drought policy at the federal level has led to the development of several federal programs in response to specific droughts. These programs, overseen by different congressional committees, aim to address the complexity of preparing and responding to droughts for various stakeholders. Debate surrounds the effectiveness of these programs in managing the nation's drought risk and determining who bears the consequences of drought. The 2012 drought in Australia highlighted the importance of water access and transfer arrangements in shaping drought resilience. Congress has been discussing the impact of human actions on climate change and the need for a national drought policy. Legislative action has focused on coordinating drought planning and mitigation activities among federal agencies. In 1998, Congress passed the National Drought Policy Act (P.L. 105-199) to create the National Drought Policy Commission. The commission submitted a report with policy recommendations in 2000, some of which have been enacted, such as the National Integrated Drought Information System. Congress also considered but did not pass legislation for a National Drought Council in 2008. Recent deliberations have focused on the 2012 farm bill reauthorization. The National Drought Policy Act of 1998 created the National Drought Policy Commission to address drought emergencies and improve preparedness, mitigation, and risk management at the federal level. The commission was tasked with studying federal laws and programs related to drought, as well as state, tribal, and local laws to enhance response to drought emergencies. The National Drought Policy Commission was created in 1998 to study federal, state, tribal, and local laws related to drought. In May 2000, the commission recommended the enactment of a National Drought Preparedness Act to establish a federal-nonfederal partnership through a National Drought Council. The report provided 29 specific recommendations for achieving national drought policy goals. The National Drought Policy Commission recommended the enactment of a National Drought Preparedness Act to establish a federal-nonfederal partnership through a National Drought Council. Various bills were introduced in Congress to address drought programs, but no single federal agency leads or coordinates these efforts. The 2008 farm bill included a section creating a National Drought Council to develop a national drought policy action plan. The 2008 farm bill included a new $3.8 billion trust fund for agricultural disaster assistance over four years, reauthorized in 2013 with no funding. The 113th Congress is expected to consider reauthorization. The 113th Congress is expected to consider reauthorization of an omnibus farm bill, including agricultural disaster programs. The National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Act of 2006 was passed to improve drought monitoring and forecasting abilities. A NIDIS reauthorization bill has been introduced in the 113th Congress to address the significant economic, social, and ecological consequences of drought. Severe and extended droughts are inevitable and shaped societies in North America for centuries. Current understanding links drought in the United States to sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Studies project long-term drought impacts on regional climate patterns. Forecasting specific droughts remains limited to a few months in advance. Extended droughts challenge existing public policy responses and federal water resource projects. The National Drought Policy Commission recognizes the challenges in crafting a broad drought policy that encompasses various congressional committees. The fragmented approach to drought programs can be costly to taxpayers, as localities often look to the federal government for relief during disasters. This mirrors the situation with flood and water policy at the national level. Increased federal investment in drought preparation, mitigation, and coordination may not necessarily lead to more economically efficient outcomes. The costs of extreme drought to the federal government and the nation are challenging to assess due to the broad impacts of drought, including water restrictions, decreased hydropower generation, navigation limitations, harm to species, and increased fire risk. Congress may need to reconsider the commission's recommendations and evaluate if current federal practices should be supplemented. Congress may need to consider proposals to manage drought impacts, such as assisting localities, industries, and agriculture with developing water supplies through various means like reservoir construction, water reallocation, promoting alternative water sources, and water conservation. Additionally, Congress should examine how federal water management agencies plan for and respond to severe drought. The 2000 National Drought Policy Commission recommended the enactment of a National Drought Preparedness Act to establish a federal-nonfederal partnership through a National Drought Council. The council would promote cooperation, evaluate regional needs, assess drought-related assistance, and address post-drought impacts. The 2000 National Drought Policy Commission recommended five national policy goals and various recommendations to achieve them. Congress has already acted on some goals, such as improved observation, insurance, and financial strategies. The commission suggests prioritizing preparedness, insurance, and incentives over relief and regulation, and coordinating federal services. Goals of the National Drought Policy Commission include incorporating planning, proactive mitigation measures, improving collaboration among scientists and managers, developing comprehensive insurance and financial strategies, maintaining emergency relief, and coordinating drought programs effectively and efficiently. The National Drought Policy Commission aims to improve collaboration among scientists and managers, develop comprehensive insurance and financial strategies, and coordinate drought programs effectively. Recommendations include adequately funding existing drought preparedness programs, directing federal agencies to meet planning needs in underserved areas, studying program impacts on drought, and implementing drought management plans for federal facilities."
