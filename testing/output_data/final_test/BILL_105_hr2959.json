    "content": "The \"Bias Crimes Compensation Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title. It pertains to civil rights. The Congress finds that bias-motivated crimes of violence violate victims' rights based on race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. State and Federal laws do not adequately address bias elements in these crimes, leading to unequal protection and redress for victims. Bias-motivated crimes of violence have a significant adverse impact on interstate commerce by deterring victims from traveling, working, and engaging in business across state lines. Federal civil rights claims are necessary to ensure equal protection under the law and mitigate the negative effects of these crimes on interstate commerce. Victims of bias-motivated crimes have the right to equal protection under the law. All individuals in the US are entitled to be free from such crimes. Those who violate this right can be held liable in civil court for damages. Victims of bias-motivated crimes have the right to seek damages in civil court, including punitive damages, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief. The section also outlines limitations, procedures, and rules of construction for such claims, including the requirement that acts must be bias-motivated crimes of violence to qualify. Federal and State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over these actions. The section outlines limitations and rules for bias-motivated crimes, excluding jurisdiction for certain State law claims related to divorce, alimony, and child custody. Definitions include \"bias-motivated\" and \"crime of violence.\" The section defines bias-motivated crimes as acts that would constitute a State or Federal offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, excluding offenses against property with no serious risk of harm. It also includes actions that would be considered offenses if not for the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, regardless of criminal charges or location. The Bias Crimes Compensation Act of 1993 defines bias-motivated crimes and limits the removal of civil actions in State courts to district courts of the United States. It also allows for the award of attorney's fees in cases related to this Act."
