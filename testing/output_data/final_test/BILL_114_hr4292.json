    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Synchronization & Nonadherence Correction (SYNC) Act of 2015\". Congress finds that nonadherence to medication among patients with chronic diseases in the United States leads to higher healthcare costs, reduced treatment effectiveness, negative health effects, and thousands of annual deaths. Improving medication adherence could reduce hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and save over $100 billion in healthcare costs each year, while also enhancing patient health outcomes and productivity gains. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"applicable individual\" for those prescribed multiple chronic care medications, \"medication adherence\" for following prescribed dosage, \"medication wastage\" for switching medications prematurely, \"persistence\" for continuing treatment, and \"primary nonadherence\" for not picking up a newly prescribed medication. The term \"synchronization\" refers to coordinating medication refills for patients taking multiple chronic medications to refill them on the same schedule. SEC. 4. NATIONAL RESEARCH AND REPORTING STRATEGY FOR IMPROVED MEDICATION ADHERENCE. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with various healthcare agencies, will conduct research to improve medication adherence in Federal health programs. This includes developing statistics on medication adherence and persistence for patients with chronic diseases. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a biennial report to Congress on medication adherence and persistence for patients with chronic diseases covered under Medicare, Medicaid, and FEHBP. The report will include statistics and recommendations to improve medication adherence. The Secretary will take action to improve medication adherence and persistence as deemed appropriate. SEC. 5. TESTING MODELS FOR IMPROVING MEDICATION ADHERENCE. The Secretary will test innovative health care delivery models to improve medication adherence and persistence for chronic care conditions by synchronizing prescription drug medications for enrollees. Enrollees eligible for participation must take part in the model testing, which aims to determine cost avoidance and improve outcomes. The Secretary will test models of synchronization for prescription drug medications to improve adherence and persistence for chronic care conditions. Three models will be evaluated, including synchronization with medication reconciliation, compliance-based packaging, and pharmacist counseling upon patient request. The Secretary will evaluate models for prescription drug synchronization by analyzing plan and enrollee data, including enrollment rates, medication adherence, demographic characteristics, and plan benefits impact on eligible enrollees. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration comparing 90-day first fills of prescriptions at retail pharmacies or through mail-order for maintenance medications against 30-day first fills for applicable enrollees under part D of the Social Security Act to assess the impact on health spending and patient outcomes. The Secretary will conduct a demonstration comparing 90-day first fills of maintenance drugs for chronic diseases against 30-day first fills for applicable enrollees under part D of the Social Security Act. The model will focus on medication persistence, cost avoidance, and improving outcomes for enrollees in subsequent refill periods. The drugs tested will include those treating cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, COPD, and mental health conditions. The evaluation of the demonstration will be done by the Comptroller General of the United States using relevant plan and enrollee data provided by the Secretary. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate a demonstration comparing 90-day first fills with 30-day first fills for part D enrollees. The evaluation will focus on medication adherence, cost differentials in pharmacy costs, and overall health spending impact. The Comptroller General will evaluate a demonstration comparing 90-day first fills with 30-day first fills for part D enrollees, focusing on medication adherence, cost differentials in pharmacy costs, prescription drug claims data, and medication wastage. A report will be submitted to the Secretary and Congress on the evaluation."
