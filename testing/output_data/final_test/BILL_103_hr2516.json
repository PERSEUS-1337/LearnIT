    "content": "The Act titled \"Green Technology Promotion Act of 1993\" is established for the purpose of promoting green technology. The Congress finds that pollution prevention at the source is a key national policy, offering industry cost-effective opportunities to reduce pollution and protect the environment. Businesses can achieve significant waste reduction by implementing source reduction techniques. Private sector studies show that industry sectors can reduce waste by up to 80% through source reduction techniques, which often do not require new equipment. A recent study found that 25% of source reduction activities require no capital investment, and 50% of capital expenditures are recouped in savings in less than 18 months. Large companies are taking the lead in waste reduction efforts. Many large companies are working with consultants to reduce pollution in their processes. Source reduction is preferred over waste management and pollution control, and Federal agencies should promote it. The government can help small and medium-sized companies with pollution prevention techniques to modernize manufacturing and improve the environment. The EPA and DOE can support Manufacturing Technology Centers. The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy have conducted numerous assessments and audits to help manufacturers reduce waste and energy consumption, saving companies millions of dollars. Assisting small- and medium-sized companies in waste reduction can lower disposal, compliance, raw material, and liability costs, improving their competitiveness. The purpose of this Act is to incorporate environmental concerns into technology programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, aiming to assist companies in reducing liability costs associated with transport and disposal, and identifying areas of inefficiency in their production processes. SEC. 3. DISSEMINATION OF SOURCE REDUCTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES. The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 is amended to include a new section focused on disseminating source reduction and energy efficiency technologies. Each Regional Center for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology conducts energy efficiency and source reduction assessments for client companies to identify conservation opportunities. Training is provided to employees to facilitate these assessments. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, will provide a software assessment package to assist client companies in improving energy efficiency and source reduction. Eligible organizations can apply to be designated as Manufacturing Outreach Centers for technology and manufacturing extension activities. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will designate Manufacturing Outreach Centers for technology and manufacturing extension activities, with eligibility criteria for various organizations. The Secretary will establish standards for designation and qualification of these centers. The term 'source reduction' is defined in accordance with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990."
