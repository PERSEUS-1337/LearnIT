    "content": "The report provides background information on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Congress, highlighting the US as the largest contributor. IMF lending has increased since the 2008 financial crisis, with loans to countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Potential policy issues for Congress include the IMF's role as a lender of last resort, resource adequacy, and surveillance effectiveness. Before World War II, there was no international monetary regime in place. The Bretton Woods conference in July 1944 aimed to create a cooperative framework for the global economy, leading to the establishment of the IMF and the World Bank in December 1945. The IMF and World Bank were formally created in December 1945 following the Bretton Woods conference. The IMF's purpose was to facilitate trade, create monetary stability, and provide short-term financing to member countries. The GATT was established in 1947 to govern international trade, later succeeded by the WTO in 1995. The U.S. Congress has veto power over major decisions at the IMF and World Bank. From 1946 to 1971, the IMF regulated compliance with a two-tiered currency system using gold and the U.S. dollar. The Bretton Woods monetary system allowed countries to peg their currency to gold or the U.S. dollar, with a 1% band around the exchange rate. IMF provided short-term financial support for currency imbalances, and countries could devalue or revalue their currency if needed. The Bretton Woods monetary system combined exchange rate stability with some aspects of floating exchange rates, allowing countries to pursue domestic economic policies for full employment. The system faced challenges in the early 1960s due to the slow growth in gold supplies, leading to an increase in central bank holdings of gold and the U.S. dollar. Global foreign dollar holdings exceeded U.S. gold holdings, requiring countries to settle their balance of payments in U.S. dollars. The international community responded to the challenge of settling balance of payments in U.S. dollars by creating the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as a new international reserve currency. Initially based on gold, the SDR's value is now determined by a basket of major currencies. As of March 9, 2018, $1.00 was equivalent to 0.69 SDRs. In 1970, the U.S. balance-of-payments deficit led to currency instability and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. This ended the IMF's original purpose of maintaining fixed exchange rates. In 1973, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system led to the end of fixed exchange rates. The IMF adapted by enacting a comprehensive rewrite of its Articles, allowing member countries to freely determine their exchange rates and use private capital flows. The IMF was given new functions to oversee the international monetary system and ensure compliance with new obligations. The IMF transformed itself post-Bretton Woods collapse to oversee compliance with new obligations, broadening its responsibilities to include financial markets, regulation, and sovereign debt resolution. It relied more on lending powers due to increased financial crises. The IMF has been involved in various global financial crises, including the oil crisis of the 1970s, Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, and the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. It has a three-tiered governance structure with a Board of Governors, an Executive Board, and a Managing Director. The Board of Governors is the highest policymaking authority, with representation from all countries, including the United States. Meetings are held annually at the fall IMF meetings, with the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) meeting twice a year to discuss major policy issues. The International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) meets twice annually to discuss major policy issues affecting the international monetary system and makes recommendations to the Board of Governors. The Development Committee, a joint committee of the IMF and World Bank, also meets to consider development policy issues. The Board of Executive Directors has day-to-day authority over operational policy and lending. The IMF Executive Board oversees and supervises IMF activities. In 2015, a governance reform package led to all-elected executive directors. The Managing Director, elected for a five-year term, is selected by the Executive Board. The board also approves the selection of the Managing Director's principal assistants. The Managing Director of the IMF oversees the Fund's operations, staff, and policy papers for approval by the Executive Board. The European candidate is traditionally elected as Managing Director, while the U.S. appoints the First Deputy Managing Director. Leadership selection based on nationality is a contentious issue among emerging economic powers. During the transition from Dominique Strauss-Kahn to Christine Lagarde, non-European countries failed to agree on a candidate, securing the position for a European. Lagarde was selected for a second term until July 2021. Calls for a non-European director from emerging economies highlight divisions hindering unity behind a credible candidate. The influence of emerging economies in international financial institutions may lead to shifts away from Europe's dominance. Zhu Min, a Chinese national, was promoted to Deputy Managing Director in 2011 under Lagarde's leadership. In August 2016, Zhu Min was replaced by Tao Zhang as Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. The IMF is actively involved with various groups like the G-7, G-20, and G-24. IMF's main financial sources include member subscriptions and multilateral borrowing arrangements. The IMF's financial sources include member quotas, multilateral borrowing arrangements, and bilateral borrowing arrangements, totaling around $1.35 trillion. The IMF's available lending capacity is $320.3 billion as of March 2, 2018. Quotas are the primary national contribution to the IMF, with the U.S. quota at $117 billion. IMF quotas were doubled in 2010 to a combined $677 billion. The IMF reviews quotas every five years. The IMF reviews quotas every five years, with the fifteenth review delayed to be completed by fall 2019. The IMF maintains multilateral borrowing arrangements like the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) and General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) to supplement quota resources. The NAB involves credit arrangements with 38 member countries and institutions for temporary loans to eligible countries. The New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) is a facility used by the IMF to supplement its quota resources, with commitments totaling around $254 billion as of FY2017. The NAB was reduced from $536 billion to $263 billion after a quota increase in 2016 and is set to expire in 2022 unless renewed by Congress. The General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) is an earlier borrowing arrangement of around $25 billion. The General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), established in 1962 with SDR 17 billion (around $25 billion), is set to be abolished at the end of 2018. In 2012, the IMF entered into bilateral borrowing agreements with members or their central banks for four-year terms. The 2016 framework for bilateral borrowing agreements expire at the end of 2019 and can be extended for another year with creditors' consents. The United States does not have a bilateral borrowing relationship with the IMF. As of March 2018, bilateral agreements worth $435 billion were signed and effective. Trust funds are another form of IMF borrowing. The IMF's Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust allows grants for debt relief in vulnerable countries hit by disasters. The Executive Board can approve decisions by majority vote, with supermajority needed for major decisions like new member admission and quota increases. The IMF's decision-making process involves key aspects such as admitting new members, increasing quotas, allocating SDRs, and amending Articles of Agreement. The United States holds significant power with a 16.52% voting share and the ability to veto major decisions. It also wields informal influence due to its large quota share and the IMF's location in Washington, DC. The IMF's main goals are to promote international cooperation on monetary issues and facilitate trade growth, employment, and income levels. The IMF aims to promote international monetary stability by facilitating trade, employment, and income growth among member countries. Its functions include surveillance of financial conditions, promoting exchange rate stability, providing temporary loans with repayment safeguards, and helping correct balance of payments maladjustments. The IMF has three main functions: surveillance of financial and monetary conditions, financial assistance for balance-of-payments problems, and technical assistance to member countries. Members agree to collaborate for orderly exchange arrangements and stable exchange rates, avoiding manipulation for competitive advantage. Main duties are outlined in Articles IV and VIII. The IMF has main duties outlined in Articles IV and VIII, which include commitments related to convertibility and exchange arrangements. Countries breaching these obligations can face punishment such as ineligibility for loans, suspension of voting rights, or expulsion from the Fund. Argentina and Czechoslovakia are examples of countries facing consequences for not meeting their obligations. IMF requires countries to provide information and consult with them when requested. IMF staff meets annually with each member country to discuss fiscal and monetary policies, economy, and exchange rates. The IMF conducts annual consultations with member countries to discuss fiscal and monetary policies, economy, and exchange rates. Reports on these consultations are presented to the IMF Executive Board, along with staff recommendations for improving economic policies. The IMF also publishes reports on global economic conditions, financial markets, and public finances in member countries. Additionally, the Fund prepares regional economic outlooks and various analytical outputs across all departments. The IMF is required to publish annual reports on its operations, transactions, and resources, as well as other reports deemed necessary. Member countries must provide information on their economic and monetary conditions, but the IMF cannot publish information on internal conditions without their consent. The IMF can make loans to member countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties to help stabilize their international payments situation and adopt policy changes. IMF executive board requires a 70% vote before publishing reports on economic conditions without a country's consent. The IMF provides loans to prevent financial crises in developing countries by restoring confidence in the international financial markets and facilitating capital inflows. The IMF's financial structure is similar to a credit union, where member countries deposit hard currency to draw other currencies in times of balance of payments difficulties. The IMF provides loans to countries facing balance of payments problems. It ensures loans are temporary and repaid, imposing conditionality to correct deficits. There are debates on the effectiveness of IMF austerity conditions in promoting economic growth. The IMF provides loans with conditions to countries facing balance of payments issues. Studies show that while IMF programs initially lower growth rates, countries tend to grow faster after leaving the program. Recent research supports the positive impact of IMF programs on economic growth for up to two years. IMF has reformed its conditionality guidelines and offers various loan programs with different financial terms. The IMF offers different lending facilities with varying financial terms. The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) addresses short-term balance-of-payments issues, while the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) focuses on longer-term problems requiring economic reforms. Concessional loans are provided to the poorest countries with less emphasis on spending cuts and more on growth-enhancing reforms. Low-interest loans are available through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The IMF offers various lending facilities with different financial terms, including the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) for short-term balance-of-payments issues, the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for longer-term problems requiring reforms, and concessional loans for the poorest countries. Debt relief is provided through initiatives like the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust Fund. The Policy Support Instrument (PSI) offers macroeconomic advice to low-income countries, while the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) provides credit to countries with strong economic fundamentals without imposing new conditionalities. The Policy Coordination Instrument (PCI) was created in 2017 for IMF members seeking a \"seal of approval\" for their economic policies. The IMF offers various lending facilities like the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for different financial needs. The Flexible Credit Line (FCL) provides credit without new conditionalities, while the Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL) is available for countries ineligible for the FCL. Colombia, Mexico, and Poland have used the FCL, while Macedonia and Morocco have utilized the PLL. A 2017 study recommended more countries seek precautionary lending from the IMF. In 1970, advanced economies accounted for over 75% of IMF credit, dropping to zero by 1990 before increasing again in the late 1990s and after the recent financial crisis. In 2010, lending to advanced economies made up 17% of total lending due to European programs. Loans to Latin America rose in the 1970s, peaking in 1990, with increases after 2000 for Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. Greece has been a persistent challenge for the IMF, rooted in public debt and financial concerns, revealing broader issues with its banking sector. The IMF approved financial assistance programs for Greece in 2010 and 2012, co-financed with European creditors. The programs were among the largest in IMF history, with Greece being the first advanced economy to borrow from the IMF in decades. IMF loans have been increasing in size compared to a country's quota, with countries often borrowing multiples of their quota. The conditionality and performance standards attached to loans have become more rigorous. The IMF provides technical assistance to member countries in areas such as macroeconomic policy, tax policies, and financial sector sustainability. Loans from the IMF have been increasing in size compared to a country's quota, with some countries receiving much larger loans than allowed under normal guidelines. Greece received a loan in 2010 that was 3,212% of its quota, while Ireland received a loan in 2011 that was 2,322% of its quota. The IMF assists member countries in managing economic policy and financial affairs, strengthening resources, and designing appropriate policies. The United States plays a leading role in shaping IMF operations and appointing key positions. The Department of the Treasury directs U.S. representatives and implements congressional mandates for the IMF. Congress authorizes and oversees U.S. participation in the IMF. The United States plays a key role in shaping IMF operations and appointing key positions. Congress authorizes U.S. participation in the IMF, with the Senate having authority over nominations. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1945 authorizes U.S. participation. U.S. representatives at the IMF are appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Secretary of the Treasury is typically nominated as the U.S. Governor at the IMF. The IMF's Executive Board, delegated authority by Governors, oversees day-to-day operations. U.S. Executive Directors represent the U.S. government at the IMF. The National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems (NAC) initially instructed the U.S. IMF representative but was abolished in 1965 due to inefficiency. The NAC was abolished in 1965, transferring its responsibilities to the President who then delegated the task to the Treasury Department. The NAC was later reconstituted as a forum for advising the Treasury Department on policy concerns regarding U.S. participation in international financial institutions. Congressional proposals for IMF policy changes are directed to the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the IMF. The U.S. Executive Director in the IMF is instructed to promote desired changes through \"voice and vote\" amendments, which have increased over the years. These amendments can be categorized into \"policy,\" \"directed vote,\" and \"reporting\" mandates to advocate specific policies at the IMF. The U.S. Executive Director at the IMF is directed to use their \"voice\" and \"vote\" to advocate for worker rights, women's integration, and environmental protection. They are also required to oppose IMF loans based on specific criteria. Increased attention to the IMF since the financial crisis has revived debates about its role in the global economy and U.S. support. Congress requires Treasury to report on economic conditions in countries receiving IMF assistance. Some analysts argue for abolishing the IMF post pegged-exchange rate system, while others suggest restructuring or expanding its role in the international monetary system due to global economic risks. Many countries relied on central bank swap arrangements rather than IMF resources during the 2008 financial crisis. During the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve provided over $600 billion in global liquidity through central bank swap arrangements, surpassing the IMF's resources. The European Central Bank also set up \u20ac250 billion in swap lines, with a significant portion with the U.S. Fed. Additionally, the Fed authorized swap lines to four emerging economies. Other countries in Asia relied on foreign exchange reserves to prevent economic collapse. The liquidity crisis led to the collapse of economies, with central bank swap lines and reserve accumulation helping to restore global liquidity. However, the costs of these mechanisms are high, and there are concerns about their effectiveness in the future. Foreign exchange reserves are expensive and can contribute to systemic instability by creating excessive demand for reserve currencies. Some analysts suggest improving the IMF's lender of last resort function with automatic triggers and prequalification during Article IV consultations. Concerns about moral hazard have been raised due to increased IMF lending post-financial crisis, especially to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. The IMF's emergency financing during financial crises may inadvertently encourage risky behavior by government officials. Critics argue that IMF programs may not stabilize crises and can lead to further indebtedness. Residents of IMF-recipient countries often suffer from painful consequences of forced economic adjustments. The policy question revolves around whether external financial support mitigates economic pain. Another concern is whether the existence of emergency financial mechanisms encourages private investors to take on excessive risks. Some worry that emergency financial mechanisms may incentivize risky behavior by government officials. Critics argue that IMF programs may not stabilize crises and can lead to further indebtedness. The IMF's role can be improved by implementing pre-qualification processes to address moral hazard concerns."
