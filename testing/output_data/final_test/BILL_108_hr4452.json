Many new Americans maintain ties to their countries of origin, sending over $70 billion in remittances annually to support loved ones abroad. Naturalized citizens and permanent residents should use their skills to help their countries of origin develop, especially in light of new security concerns post-9/11. The US government needs to engage with foreign countries on various levels for national security reasons. The text chunk discusses the importance of involving naturalized citizens and permanent residents from recipient countries in leadership roles in foreign assistance projects to promote democratic values, establish cross-border relationships, reduce project transition costs, and encourage sustainable development. The text highlights the challenges of not involving individuals from recipient countries in leadership roles in foreign assistance projects, leading to a lack of skill transfer and increased costs due to cultural adjustments. This is exacerbated by the bundling of projects under \"Mega\" contracts, making it difficult for smaller US organizations to participate. To promote skill transfer and sustainable development in foreign assistance projects, special preferences should be given to naturalized US citizens or permanent residents from recipient countries. This aims to reduce transition costs and allow smaller US organizations to compete effectively. SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FUNDS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES THROUGH UNITED STATES ENTITIES OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY INDIVIDUALS FROM THOSE FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Up to 10 percent of funds for US development and humanitarian assistance programs must go through US organizations owned or controlled by naturalized citizens or permanent residents from recipient countries. SEC. 3. REPORT. The President must submit an annual report to Congress by January 1 detailing the implementation of section 3 in the previous fiscal year, including the number and value of contracts, grants, and agreements awarded. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate. \"United States development assistance or humanitarian assistance programs\" include programs under major budget category 150 for providing aid, such as those outlined in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The curr_chunk specifies various chapters of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 related to assistance programs for different regions and funds, such as the Development Fund for Africa, assistance for the former Soviet Union, South Caucasus, Central Asia, Economic Support Fund, and the Support for East European Democracy Act of 1989."
