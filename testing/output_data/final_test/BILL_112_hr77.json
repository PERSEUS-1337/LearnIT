The \"Border Security, Cooperation, and Act Now Drug War Prevention Act of 2011\" includes emergency deployment of Border Patrol, DEA, and ATF agents, as well as provisions for equipment, vehicles, and grants for border relief. In 2008 and 2009, Mexican drug gangs caused high levels of violence, resulting in thousands of deaths, including police officers and soldiers. Mexico increased its military presence at the border to combat drug cartels. Over 200 US citizens have been killed in the drug war, involving various illegal substances like marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Mexico serves as a major conduit for cocaine trafficking. Mexico is the main conduit for cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and meth into the United States. Mexican cartels smuggle the majority of cocaine across the US-Mexico border and are increasingly trafficking meth due to high profits. The cartels earn over $25 billion annually and send more than $10 billion in cash back to Mexico from the US. According to the 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment, Mexican drug trafficking organizations pose the greatest threat to the United States. These cartels have grown in power due to the decline of Colombian cartels and the closure of trafficking routes through Florida. The DEA states that Mexican cartels now control the drug trade in the US, operating through organized crime structures with distinct cells and subordinate gangs. The 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment reveals that Mexican cartels dominate drug distribution in most US cities, with a presence in at least 230 cities, including Alaska and Hawaii. Local law enforcement along the border struggles with limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other border security crimes. The Federal Government assists states and local governments in covering costs related to fighting drug cartels and prosecuting drug cases. The United States shares 1,989 miles along its border with Mexico, requiring federal assistance for local law enforcement in combating drug trafficking, human smuggling, and other border security crimes.
