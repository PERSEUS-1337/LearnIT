    "content": "The Act titled \"Two-Midnight Rule Delay Act of 2013\" delays enforcement of the Medicare Two-Midnight Rule to allow for the development of a new payment methodology for short inpatient hospital stays. The \"Two-Midnight Rule Delay Act of 2013\" postpones enforcement of the two-midnight rule for Medicare hospital admissions before October 1, 2014. The rule defines amendments to 42 CFR Chapter IV in the IPPS FY 2014 Final Rule. Amendments to 42 CFR Chapter IV in the IPPS FY 2014 Final Rule include additions and revisions related to admissions, medical review requirements, conditions of payment, and requirements for inpatient services of hospitals. Amendments in the IPPS FY 2014 Final Rule include revisions to requirements for inpatient psychiatric facilities and critical access hospital services. The IPPS FY 2014 Final Rule includes changes for inpatient psychiatric facilities and critical access hospital services. Medicare review contractors are also subject to payment denial restrictions for inpatient hospital services under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act specifies criteria for medical necessity and documentation requirements for inpatient hospital services before a certain date. A Medicare review contractor is defined as any entity contracted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for these purposes. The Medicare program reviews claims for items and services under the Social Security Act. This includes Medicare administrative contractors and recovery audit contractors. The Secretary can continue the Medicare probe and educate program for inpatient hospital admissions. The Secretary can continue the Medicare Probe and Educate program for hospital admissions, with limits on prepayment review sample sizes set as of November 4, 2013. The Medicare Probe and Educate program, established by the Secretary as of November 4, 2013, involves prepayment patient status reviews for inpatient hospital claims with specific dates of admission. The Secretary shall develop a payment methodology for short inpatient hospital stays under the Medicare program, which may involve reduced payment amounts or alternative payment methods. This will be part of the annual regulations implementing the Medicare hospital payment system, following prepayment patient status reviews conducted as part of the Medicare Probe and Educate program. The annual regulations for the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system for fiscal year 2015 define a short inpatient hospital stay as a stay shorter than the 2-midnight benchmark. The Secretary will develop a payment methodology for short inpatient hospital stays, including a crosswalk of ICD-10 codes and CPT codes. The Secretary will develop general equivalency maps (crosswalks) linking ICD-10 codes to CPT codes for comparing inpatient and outpatient hospital services payment under the Social Security Act. This includes procedure and diagnostic codes. The Secretary will develop a proposed ICD-10-to-CPT crosswalk for public comment for at least 60 days through various notices including Federal Register publication and CMS website announcement. The Secretary will announce the availability of the proposed ICD-10-to-CPT crosswalk on the CMS website and through a Listserv. The ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee will convene a meeting to gather public input on the crosswalk. The Secretary will publish a final ICD10-to-CPT crosswalk based on comments received, and update it annually. Additionally, a DRG-to-APC crosswalk will be developed using the ICD10-to-CPT crosswalk. The Secretary will develop a DRG-to-APC crosswalk for inpatient and outpatient hospital services using claims data from fiscal year 2015 onwards. The crosswalk will be published by June 30, 2017, defining hospitals as acute care facilities under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Hospitals defined under title XVIII of the Social Security Act include acute care hospitals, critical access hospitals, long-term care hospitals, and inpatient psychiatric facilities."
