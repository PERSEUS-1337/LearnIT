    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ticket Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that sponsors and promoters of major events are increasingly controlling ticket resale in the secondary market, hindering interstate commerce, driving up prices, and limiting choices for consumers. Eliminating these restrictions would promote a competitive marketplace for event tickets. Encouraging a competitive marketplace for event tickets is essential for the healthy growth of electronic commerce and benefits ticket purchasers, fans, and the general public. Purchasers should have consumer protection standards, including the right to full refunds. Congress needs to preempt state or local laws that restrict ticket resales to achieve a nationwide free market while still allowing regulation to prevent fraud and maintain public order. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Trade Commission. The term \"event\" includes concerts, performances, sports events, exhibitions, or shows with over 1,000 attendees, open to the public, with an admission fee, and promoted in interstate commerce.

A person with a right to enter an event venue or occupy a specific seat, or the entitlement to purchase such rights for future events.

The term \"venue\" refers to the location where an event takes place, such as a theater, stadium, field, or hall. It can also include a sports team, theater company, musical group, or agent participating in the event. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION. It is unlawful for ticket issuers to restrict the resale of event tickets by lawful possessors. Prohibited activities include imposing terms that limit resale or price, requiring buyers not to resell tickets, and taking legal action against resale restrictions. Legal action can be taken against individuals who resell event tickets without permission or in violation of restrictions imposed by the ticket issuer, as well as against those who facilitate or provide services for such resale. Penalties cannot be imposed on ticket purchasers for reselling tickets without permission. The legislation prohibits reselling event tickets without permission or in violation of restrictions imposed by the ticket issuer, treating resellers unfavorably, employing technological means to restrict resale, and seeking to limit the price at which tickets can be resold. Consumer protection minimum standards are outlined in Section 5 of the legislation. It is unlawful to engage in event ticket sales without complying with consumer protection standards. This applies to ticket issuers, ticket resellers (except for individuals selling less than 25 tickets per year), and those providing marketplaces for ticket sales. Compliance can be achieved by using a physical or electronic marketplace.

The refund must cover the full price paid by the consumer, including any associated fees. Consumer protection standards for event ticket sales require full refunds for various reasons, such as counterfeit tickets, canceled events, or tickets not matching the description. Refunds must include all fees charged for the purchase, and may be subject to conditions like timely ticket return and safeguards against abuse. Entities can exceed these minimum requirements with compliant policies. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.
