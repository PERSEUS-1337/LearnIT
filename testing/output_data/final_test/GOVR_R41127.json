    "content": "The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and federal student financial assistance programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965. It also extended mandatory appropriations for existing HEA programs and provided funding for a program authorized under the Trade Act of 1974. In recent years, various Higher Education Act (HEA) programs have been amended and extended through budget reconciliation measures in Congress. Changes were made to the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) program, Federal Pell Grant program, and federal need analysis formula. Emergency changes were also implemented in 2008 under the Ensuring Continuing Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA). The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) was enacted to amend, extend, and authorize new programs under the HEA. The SAFRA Act, part of the HCERA, amends the Higher Education Act (HEA) by terminating the FFEL program and transitioning federal student loans to the DL program. New borrowers of DL program loans after July 1, 2014, will have their monthly payments limited to 10% of discretionary income under the amended income-based repayment (IBR) plan. New borrowers under the amended IBR plan will repay 10% of discretionary income and may have remaining loan balance forgiven after 20 years. Pell Grant program receives indefinite mandatory appropriations to increase maximum award. Pell Grant award increases indexed to CPI-U from AY2013-2014 to AY2017-2018. Additional $13.5 billion in mandatory appropriations for Pell Grants available until September 30, 2012. Mandatory funding for HEA College Access and Completion Grant program provided for FY2010 through FY2014. Mandatory funding for HEA programs serving HBCUs and other Minority-Serving Institutions provided from FY2010 to FY2019. P.L. 111-152 includes funding for Community College and Career Training Grant Program from FY2011 to FY2014. The report summarizes legislative history, cost savings, and education-related provisions of P.L. 111-152, detailing changes to FFEL, DL, and Pell Grant programs approved by the House and Senate. The House and Senate approved H.Rept. 111-89, the conference report to accompany S.Con.Res. 13, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2010, on April 29, 2009. The FY2010 budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions to House and Senate committees, directing changes in laws to reduce the deficit. The House Education and Labor Committee received two instructions related to \"Health Care Reform\" and \"Investing in Education.\" H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, aimed to increase student aid through loan reform, improve college access, invest in educational facilities, and early childhood education. The House passed H.R. 3221 on September 17, 2009, which included amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 and established new programs and benefits. H.R. 3221 aims to increase student aid through loan reform and establish new programs. It includes terminating the FFEL program, transitioning all student loans to the DL program, offering a new Federal Direct Perkins Loan, providing indefinite mandatory appropriations for the Federal Pell Grant program, and simplifying the federal student aid need analysis methodology. Mandatory funding for HEA programs serving Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions would be provided for FY2010 through FY2019. Additionally, mandatory funding would be allocated for programs promoting success in postsecondary education, improving employment outcomes, and assisting states in developing data systems. Funding would also support the modernization, renovation, and repair of K-12 and postsecondary school facilities, as well as construction projects in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Mandatory funding was provided for various education programs in FY2010-FY2019, including the Early Learning Challenge Fund and the American Graduation Initiative grant program. The \"Defund ACORN Act\" aimed to restrict federal funding for organizations violating campaign finance laws. The Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872) combined education and health care reconciliation instructions. The Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) in December 2009. The Congressional Budget Office revised estimates of savings from eliminating the FFEL program in March 2010. The House Rules Committee made public an amendment to H.R. 4872 due to lower savings estimates and potential violations of Senate rules. The House Rules Committee released an amendment to H.R. 4872 on March 18, 2010, proposing changes to controversial elements in H.R. 3590. On March 21, 2010, the House passed H.R. 4872 by a vote of 220 to 211, after passing H.R. 3590. H.R. 3590 was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The Senate removed two provisions from H.R. 4872 on March 25, 2010, due to violations of the Senate Byrd rule. The Senate removed two provisions from H.R. 4872 on March 25, 2010, as they violated the Senate Byrd rule by being extraneous and having no effect on federal outlays and revenue. One provision would have eliminated a requirement regarding Pell Grants, while the other would have established a new rule for determining Pell Grant award amounts. The House passed H.R. 4872 on March 25, 2010, signed into law as P.L. 111-152. The SAFRA Act will reduce mandatory spending by $29 billion over FY2010-FY2014 and $61 billion over FY2010-FY2019. It will increase discretionary spending by $1.3 billion over FY2010-FY2014 and $5.0 billion over FY2010-FY2019. Mandatory appropriations for Pell Grants will increase spending by $21 billion over FY2010-FY2014 and $36 billion over FY2010-FY2019. The CBO estimates that the SAFRA Act will reduce mandatory spending by $5 billion over the FY2010-FY2014 period, and by $19 billion over the FY2010-FY2019 period. The FFEL program, DL program, and Federal Perkins Loan program are federal student loan programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA. Under the FFEL program, private lenders provide capital for loans, guaranteed by the federal government against losses from borrower default. The federal government provides subsidies to private lenders to ensure availability of capital for FFEL program student loans. In response to difficulties in raising capital during the financial crisis in 2008, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act was enacted to facilitate lending under the FFEL program. Approximately 80% of new FFEL program loans in FY2009 were financed through this act. In FY2009, approximately 80% of new FFEL program loans were financed through ECASLA programs. Around 3,900 institutions of higher education participated in the FFEL program during AY2009-2010. In FY2010, an estimated 8.2 million new FFEL program loans, averaging $4,309 each, totaling $35.4 billion, will be made, a decrease from the previous year. By the end of FY2010, outstanding FFEL program loans are estimated to reach $497 billion. The DL program was authorized in 1993 to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings, with the intention to gradually replace the FFEL program. The DL program was authorized in 1993 to replace the FFEL program, but provisions for a \"phase-in\" were repealed in 1998. Under the DL program, the federal government acts as the lender, with schools or contractors originating loans. Loan servicing and collections are also handled by contractors. In AY2009-2010, over 2,000 IHEs participated in the DL program. Many IHEs in the FFEL program are transitioning to the DL program, with most already approved. By March 2010, 47% were \"DL ready,\" 40% were in transition, 11% used COD but hadn't transitioned, and 2% hadn't taken any steps. ED estimates 15.2 million new DL loans totaling $88.4 billion in FY2010, a significant increase from FY2009. Outstanding DL loans are projected to reach $207 billion by the end of FY2010. The SAFRA Act terminates new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010, transitioning to the DL program. It projects $207 billion in outstanding DL loans, with 24.8 million loans totaling $134 billion in FY2011. Both programs offer similar loans for students, including Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. The SAFRA Act terminates new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010, transitioning to the DL program. This shift is projected to result in a reduction of $28.6 billion in mandatory spending over the period from FY2010 through FY2014, and of $61.0 billion in mandatory spending over the period from FY2010 through FY2019. The savings are expected due to the transfer of administrative costs from mandatory to discretionary spending under the DL program. The SAFRA Act transitions new loans from the FFEL program to the DL program, resulting in significant savings in mandatory spending. The Act also provides funding for FFEL servicers to retain jobs in the United States. Additionally, it extends DL program loans to eligible students enrolled in IHEs located outside the United States. The SAFRA Act extends DL program loans to eligible students in foreign schools and allows borrowers to consolidate multiple federal student loans into a single loan. To qualify for a Consolidation Loan, borrowers must have an outstanding balance on a FFEL or DL program loan. Applicants must be in repayment status, in the grace period, or in default but have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. Additionally, applicants for DL program Consolidation Loans must have borrowed eligible loans under the DL program. The SAFRA Act allows borrowers with multiple types of federal student loans to consolidate them into DL program Consolidation Loans without rounding up the interest rate, during a specific one-year period. Borrowers must have at least two of the following three types of federal student loans: DL program loans, FFEL program loans. The SAFRA Act amends the DL program for awarding service contracts to ensure qualified entities provide origination, servicing, and collections on DL program loans. ED awarded contracts to four entities in 2009 for servicing federal student loans, including those under the Direct Loan program. The servicing of DL program loans is considered an administrative expense, funded through annual appropriations acts. The SAFRA Act establishes a separate category of contracts for not-for-profit servicers to service DL program loans. Eligible not-for-profit servicers must meet specific requirements and will be compensated at competitive rates. The Secretary is required to contract with eligible not-for-profit servicers to service 100,000 borrower loan accounts each, with the ability to adjust based on performance. Mandatory funding is provided for administrative costs for not-for-profit servicing contracts from FY2010 through FY2019. The SAFRA Act provides $50 million for technical assistance to IHEs participating in the DL program. It amends the income-based repayment plan for new borrowers, reducing the threshold and maximum monthly payment amounts. The IBR plan for federal student loans under the FFEL and DL programs reduces the repayment period to 20 years and limits monthly payments based on discretionary income. Borrowers qualify based on a partial financial hardship. The IBR plan for federal student loans under the FFEL and DL programs limits monthly payments based on discretionary income. Payments are credited to interest, fees, and principal in that order. If the required payment doesn't cover accruing interest on certain loans, the Secretary pays the interest for up to three years. Accrued interest continues to accrue during a partial financial hardship. The IBR plan for federal student loans limits monthly payments based on discretionary income. Accrued interest is only capitalized once a borrower no longer demonstrates a partial financial hardship or exits the IBR plan. Monthly payments increase when the borrower's AGI no longer shows a partial financial hardship. The IBR plan limits monthly payments based on discretionary income. If a borrower has federal student loan balance after 25 years on IBR plan, remaining balance is forgiven. Making 120 payments on DL program loans while in public service forgives remaining balance. SAFRA Act amends IBR plan for new borrowers, reducing thresholds by 33\u2153%. The SAFRA Act reduces the thresholds for borrowers with a partial financial hardship to qualify for the IBR plan, allowing more borrowers to be eligible. It also shortens the repayment period from 25 years to 20 years for new borrowers on the IBR plan. The SAFRA Act reduces thresholds for IBR plan eligibility, shortens repayment period to 20 years for new borrowers, enabling loan forgiveness after 20 years. Lower monthly payments may also help public service employees qualify for loan forgiveness after 10 years. Federal Pell Grant program provides aid to low-income students. The Federal Pell Grant program is the largest source of federal grant aid for low-income undergraduate students, providing over $32 billion in aid to approximately 8.3 million students. Pell Grants are need-based and eligibility is limited to undergraduates, with no set income threshold but primarily benefiting those with low incomes. In the most recent data available, a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients had family incomes below $40,000 for dependent students and below $30,000 for independent students. The Federal Pell Grant program, funded with discretionary and mandatory appropriations, has received increased funding in recent years. The program's total funding level from FY2007 to FY2017 is approximately $113.6 billion. The maximum Pell Grant award amount is specified in annual appropriations measures. The program was reauthorized by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. The Federal Pell Grant program receives increased funding through annual appropriations. The maximum Pell Grant award amount for AY2010-2011 is $5,550, with a mandatory add-on of $690. The SAFRA Act changes how future additional mandatory award amounts are determined and increases mandatory spending. The SAFRA Act increases mandatory spending for the Pell Grant program by $36 billion from FY2010 to FY2019, with provisions affecting future funding and determination of additional mandatory awards. The Pell Grant program receives indefinite mandatory appropriations starting March 30, 2010, supplementing annual discretionary appropriations. The additional mandatory amount of $690 per year, authorized in the CCRAA, will be provided to eligible students until AY2011-2012. Beginning in AY2012-2013, the additional mandatory Pell Grant amount authorized in the CCRAA will be reduced by $400 to $690. A new formula will be established for determining the additional mandatory award amount starting in AY2013-2014. This formula includes steps such as adjusting the maximum award amount based on CPI-U changes and rounding to the nearest $5 increment. For AY2014-2015 through AY2017-2018, a new formula is established to determine the additional mandatory Pell Grant award amount. The formula includes adjusting the previous year's total maximum award based on CPI-U changes, subtracting the greater of the previous year's maximum award or $4,860, and rounding to the nearest $5 increment. For AY2018-2019 and beyond, the additional mandatory Pell Grant award amount remains the same as AY2017-2018. The SAFRA Act introduces changes to Pell Grant award rules, eliminating specified maximum award amounts for AY2009-2010 through AY2014-2015 and the additional mandatory award amount for AY2012-2013. Starting in AY2013-2014, total maximum award levels will be determined by revised formulas. Future award amounts are uncertain due to factors like discretionary maximum award and CPI-U changes. The SAFRA Act changes Pell Grant award rules, now basing qualification on the total maximum award amount instead of a minimum award. This could increase the number of recipients but reduce the minimum award amount. Effective March 30, 2010, implications may arise for students applying for Pell Grants. The SAFRA Act changes Pell Grant award rules, now basing qualification on the total maximum award amount instead of a minimum award. This could increase the number of recipients but reduce the minimum award amount. Effective March 30, 2010, implications may arise for students applying for Pell Grants, with some now qualifying for a minimum Pell Grant award under the new rule. Additionally, Pell Grant awards calculated from the current payment schedule could be different under the new rule established in the SAFRA Act. The SAFRA Act will lower the Pell Grant award for full-time students from $1,176 to $555. It will provide an additional $13.5 billion in mandatory appropriations for Pell Grants, with funds available until September 30, 2012. These funds will cover a funding shortfall in AY2010-2011 and may offset costs for AY2011-2012. The College Access Challenge Grant Program (CACG) fosters partnerships between federal, state, and local governments to increase low-income students' access to postsecondary education. It was enacted under the CCRAA with mandatory funding of $66 million for FY2008 and FY2009. The program faces increasing discretionary costs averaging $32.0 billion annually from FY2012 to FY2019. The HEOA amended the CACG program to authorize discretionary appropriations for FY2009 through FY2014, but no discretionary appropriations were received in FY2009 or FY2010. The SAFRA Act provided mandatory funding of $150 million for each of FY2010 through FY2014 and increased the minimum state grant to 1.0% of the appropriation. The authority to award grants under the CACG program expires at the end of FY2014. Title IV, Part J of the CCRAA provided mandatory appropriations for new programs supporting minority-serving institutions such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and Alaska Native- and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions. The programs aimed to improve academic programs, provide professional development, maintain educational facilities, strengthen institutional management, and encourage fiscal stability. The non-federal share may be awarded to a philanthropic organization in the state if capable of providing it. The CCRAA provided mandatory funding for programs supporting minority-serving institutions like Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and others. The funding was $255 million for each fiscal year from FY2008 through FY2019. The authority to award grants under these programs expired at the end of FY2019. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities (TAAC) Program, part of the Trade Act of 1974, offers assistance to trade-impacted communities. TAAC, established within the U.S. Department of Commerce, provides funds for strategic planning and implementation activities to diversify and strengthen the local economy. The Community College and Career Training Grant (CCCT) program, administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, supports community colleges in addressing education and skills deficiencies in trade impacted communities. The Industry or Sector Partnership Grants program aims to address training and employment gaps in targeted industries in trade impacted communities. The CCCT program authorizes DOL to award funds for educational development and improvement. The CCCT program authorizes the Department of Labor to award funds for educational or career training options for workers eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. Eligible recipients include institutions of higher education, and eligible programs are two-year and less-than-two-year educational and training programs. $500 million in mandatory funding per year is provided for the program, with each state receiving no less than 0.5% of the funds appropriated. The program is implicitly authorized through appropriations, despite the termination of the program authorization under ARRA. The stipulation that no eligible institution could receive more than one grant or a grant exceeding $1,000,000 under the CCCT program has been repealed. Funds are no longer required to supplement other federal, state, and local public funds."
