    "content": "Recent improvements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have enabled the generation of high-resolution images based on natural language descriptions. Conditional GANs offer control over image generation through labels or descriptions, but fine-grained control of object layout remains challenging. A new approach introduces an object pathway in both the generator and discriminator to control the location of multiple objects in an image using bounding boxes and labels. This pathway focuses on individual objects without requiring a detailed semantic layout. The object pathway allows for controlling object locations within images and modeling complex scenes with multiple objects at various locations. It focuses on individual objects and learns relevant features, while the global pathway focuses on overall image characteristics and background. Adversarial training on image data aims to learn powerful representations from complex distributions, despite current GAN models primarily focusing on high-resolution image generation. Current GAN models mainly focus on single-object images or images from specific domains, leading to low variance in training data. Real-life images often contain multiple objects at different locations, requiring models that can handle complex relationships. To achieve this, we need models that can generate images with multiple objects at distinct locations and control over the types of objects generated. Generating images with multiple objects at distinct locations and controlling the types of objects generated is a challenging task. Current approaches often use a semantic layout for object placement, but this can be burdensome. Our proposed model only requires object locations and identities, with a global pathway for image layout and an object pathway for generating object features based on labels and locations. The generator creates a scene layout encoding from a natural language description, object locations, labels, and noise vector. It combines global and object pathways to generate the final image. The discriminator uses global and object pathways with image, bounding boxes, object labels, and textual description as input. The GAN model proposed enables scene layout control without using a scene layout. It combines global and object pathways to generate images focusing on relevant objects at specified locations. The discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images based on these features. The object pathway in the GAN model learns features of different object categories, allowing control over object identity and location in a scene. The discriminator evaluates image realism, object location, and category alignment. This approach enhances image quality and enables semantic image manipulation. Generative Adversarial Nets, Refinement Networks, recurrent attention-based models, autoregressive models, and memory networks contribute to image generation. Using natural language descriptions like image captions can control image layout. Semantic layout from image captions allows fine-grained control over object placement in the final image. Some approaches use scene layout to generate images with specific objects. In image generation, various models like Generative Adversarial Nets and autoregressive models contribute. Using image captions allows control over object placement. Some approaches use scene layout for detailed image control, while others focus on object characteristics like color and shape. The model tested on the synthetic SHAPES data set focuses on generating images with multiple objects at various locations using a global and object pathway in both the generator and discriminator. It utilizes image captions and bounding box labels for object modeling. Our approach aims to generate objects at arbitrary locations within a scene while maintaining overall scene consistency using a conditional GAN framework. The generator receives input including a noise vector, bounding box information, and labels for each object. The generator in the conditional GAN framework receives input such as a noise vector, bounding box information, and labels for each object. It constructs labels for individual bounding boxes by combining image caption embeddings with provided labels, potentially creating more meaningful labels with additional information from the image caption. The generator in the conditional GAN framework combines image caption embeddings with provided labels to create labels for individual bounding boxes. It consists of a global pathway responsible for creating a general layout of the global scene and an object pathway for generating features of objects within the bounding boxes. The pathway creates a feature map using convolutional layers with input label i. The feature map is transformed with a Spatial Transformer Network to fit into the bounding box on an empty canvas. Convolutional layers are applied to each label, and the outputs are concatenated to generate the final image using GAN procedures. The generator in the final resolution makes specific changes compared to standard architectures, including an object pathway for additional features based on labels and a layout encoding for global pathway input. These extensions can be easily added to existing architectures. The discriminator also has global and object pathways, with the global pathway using convolutional layers to represent the whole image, while the object pathway uses a Spatial Transformer Network to extract objects. The object pathway utilizes a STN to extract features from bounding boxes and combines them with bounding box labels. These features are then added to an empty canvas based on the bounding box coordinates. The outputs from both the object and global pathways are concatenated and processed further to obtain a merged feature representation. In the object pathway, features from bounding boxes are extracted using a STN and combined with labels. These features are added to a canvas based on box coordinates. The merged feature representation is obtained by concatenating outputs from object and global pathways. The discriminator and generator in our proposed approach optimize an objective function considering conditional information like image captions. In experiments using image captions (MS-COCO), conditioning augmentation is utilized to enhance training and image quality. The evaluation focuses on generalization capabilities and specific model contributions across different datasets: Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and MS-COCO. The Multi-MNIST dataset is used to test the model's basic functionality, generating 50,000 images of 64x64 resolution with three objects. The study generated 50,000 images of 64x64 resolution with three MNIST digits in non-overlapping locations on a black background. The model successfully learned to control digit identity, size, and location in the images. The study created a dataset with images containing two to five digits of various sizes and bounding box configurations. Another dataset had digits 0-4 in the top half and 5-9 in the bottom half. The model could generalize the position but sometimes altered digits towards others seen during training. The study created a Multi-MNIST dataset with digits only in the top half of the image, leaving the bottom half empty. The model could control object identity and location within an image but struggled to generate digits in the bottom half. Ablation studies were conducted to test the impact of model extensions on the dataset. Ablation studies were conducted on the Multi-MNIST dataset to test the impact of disabling certain model components. Results showed that disabling the layout encoding in the generator led to minor imperfections in digit images, while disabling the object pathway in the discriminator resulted in a higher error rate in digit identity. Disabling the object pathway in the discriminator led to a higher error rate in digit identity, while disabling it in both the discriminator and generator resulted in a loss of control over image location and digit identity. This shows that the layout encoding alone is not sufficient to control digit identity and location. In the second experiment, complex images with multiple objects of different characteristics were used to evaluate the generalization ability of the object pathway. The CLEVR dataset was employed, which includes objects with various properties such as shape, color, and size. 25,000 images with 2-4 objects per image were rendered, with object shape serving as the label for each bounding box. The model was tested on controlling object characteristics, size, and location using images with 2-4 objects per image. Results showed the model's ability to manipulate object shape, color, and location accurately. The model could generate images with an arbitrary number of objects, even though it was trained on a maximum of four objects per image. The CLEVR dataset was used to test the model's generalization capability. The model's generalization capability was tested using the CLEVR dataset, where colors were reversed between cylinders and cubes during testing. A second data set of 25,000 training images was created for testing. Results showed that the model could transfer colors to novel shape-color combinations, but some artifacts were observed. Overall, the experiment confirmed the model's ability to control object characteristics and locations. The authors tested the model's generalization capability on the CLEVR dataset, demonstrating its ability to transfer colors to novel shape-color combinations. The Inception Score (IS) increases to 11.94 \u00b1 0.09 when using ground truth bounding boxes at test time. The Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) score was 25.89 \u00b1 0.47, but using the pretrained model provided by the authors resulted in an IS of 23.61. The updated source code yielded an IS of 10.62 as the baseline model. Our model's IS and FID values may not be directly comparable to other models due to the additional input of up to three bounding boxes and object labels at test time. The final experiment used the MS-COCO dataset to evaluate the model on natural images. Evaluation was done on a 2014 train/test split with images rescaled to 256 \u00d7 256 px. Training utilized the three largest objects' bounding boxes and labels per image, considering objects covering at least 2% of the image. The Inception Score (IS) was used for quantitative evaluation. The Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) are used to evaluate the diversity and recognizability of objects in generated images. Images with multiple objects were generated to test object placement control. Our approach was tested with StackGAN and AttnGAN architectures for text-to-image synthesis. The StackGAN training process involves two steps: generating images with a resolution of 64 \u00d7 64 px based on captions, and then using these images and captions to generate higher resolution images. The study tested object placement control in generated images using StackGAN and AttnGAN architectures for text-to-image synthesis. The StackGAN model was enhanced with object pathways, resulting in improved Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) values compared to the original model. The study enhanced the StackGAN model with object pathways, resulting in improved Inception Score (IS) and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) values. The AttnGAN model, on the other hand, consists of only one model trained end-to-end on image captions. The AttnGAN model is trained end-to-end on image captions using multiple discriminators at different resolutions. It implements an attention technique to focus on specific areas of the image for words in the caption. Additionally, an object pathway is added to the generator and discriminator to improve image generation. Adding the object pathway to the AttnGAN model improves the IS score from 23.61 to 24.76, while the FID remains similar. Visual inspection confirms that the StackGAN+OP generates images with objects at correct positions. Disabling the pathways during generation process alters the output, as shown in Figure 5. Disabling the object pathway during image generation results in images with mostly background information and less detailed objects in bounding boxes. Conversely, disabling the global pathway leaves areas outside bounding boxes empty but still generates images resembling appropriate objects within the boxes. Adding the object pathway to AttnGAN allows for control over object location and identity. The AttnGAN+OP allows for control over object location and identity, generating desired objects at specified locations but may also place the same object at other locations within the image. The StackGAN+OP generates images with object pathways enabled or disabled, allowing for control over object location. Object detection tests using YOLOv3 confirm the quality of the generated images. The results show that adding an object pathway to GAN models like StackGAN and AttnGAN improves object detection accuracy by YOLOv3. StackGAN places objects at given bounding boxes with high IoU values, while AttnGAN spreads object features throughout the image leading to higher detection rates but lower average IoU. This study on MS-COCO dataset demonstrates the feasibility of integrating object pathways into existing GAN models without altering the architecture or training process. Adding object pathways to GAN models allows for more control over image generation without changing the model architecture or training process. This results in improved image quality and the ability to manipulate the identity and location of objects within images based on bounding boxes. The division of work between global and object pathways enhances image quality subjectively and quantitatively, as shown by metrics like Inception Score and Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance. The global pathway focuses on overall image statistics, while the object pathway pays more attention to specific object details. The object pathway in GAN models enhances image generation by focusing on specific object details, while the global pathway handles overall image statistics. However, sub-optimal images may result if objects are too small to be labeled with bounding boxes. The object pathway in GAN models may not capture small objects like individual sheep, leading to sub-optimal images with missing objects. Overlapping bounding boxes can also cause local inconsistencies in the generated images. A more sophisticated merging procedure could potentially improve this issue. The merging procedure could enhance bounding box layout by predicting object shapes within each box. The model currently requires manual input of bounding boxes and labels at test time, limiting unsupervised image generation. Despite this, the model outperforms others tested with ground truth bounding boxes. Future improvements could involve extracting relevant bounding boxes and labels directly from image captions. With the goal of gaining more control over image generation in GANs, an additional object pathway was introduced to differentiate between scene and object representations. This allows for control over object identity, location, and size without strong overlap. The object pathway generates features for each object based on an object label and places them at specified locations using bounding boxes. This iterative process results in representations of individual objects and the overall image layout. The object pathway is an extension added to common GAN architectures for better image quality. It generates features for each object based on object labels and places them at specified locations using bounding boxes. This process results in representations of individual objects and the overall image layout. The object and global pathway features are concatenated to generate the final image output. The generator in the object pathway creates feature representations for individual objects by replicating bounding box labels and applying upsampling blocks. These features are added to a tensor at the location of the bounding box using a spatial transformer network. In the global pathway, a layout encoding tensor is created before concatenating with object pathway features for the final image output. The layout encoding is obtained by creating a tensor with one-hot labels at bounding box locations. This tensor goes through convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions before being reshaped and concatenated with noise. After passing through dense layers and upsampling blocks, the object and global pathway outputs are combined and further processed to generate the final image. The object pathway of the discriminator involves creating a zero tensor to hold feature representations of objects, extracting image features at bounding box locations, and applying convolutional layers and activations. The global pathway combines outputs from object pathway and further processes them to generate the final image. The global pathway of the discriminator involves applying convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activations to combine object pathway outputs with conditioning information. The discriminator is trained to classify real images with correct labels as real and generated images with correct labels as fake. The Stage-I generator and discriminator for training use image captions as additional description. Bounding box labels are obtained by concatenating image caption embedding and one-hot encoded bounding box label, followed by a dense layer with 128 units. In the final step of the discriminator, the feature representation is concatenated with the generated label. In the final step of training the Stage-II generator, the image encoding is used as a conditioning vector without bounding box labels. The training process involves generating images with a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels using input images of 64 \u00d7 64 pixels and image captions. A new discriminator is trained to differentiate between real and generated images. The Stage-II generator undergoes modifications similar to the Stage-I generator to obtain bounding box information. The Stage-II generator undergoes modifications to obtain bounding box information by using convolutional layers and spatial replication of bounding box labels on an empty canvas before applying more convolutional layers to obtain the final image embedding. The Stage-II generator utilizes a spatial transformer network to extract features from bounding boxes and merge them with the global pathway. The object pathway of the Stage-II discriminator also incorporates bounding box information. The Stage-II discriminator's object pathway utilizes a spatial transformer network to extract features from bounding boxes and reshape them for processing. The features are then concatenated with bounding box labels and passed through convolutional layers for further processing. This process is repeated for each bounding box within the image. The Stage-II discriminator's global pathway in StackGAN consists of standard layers for processing images. The object and global pathways merge outputs at a resolution of [\u22121, 32, 32] before further processing with convolutional layers. Modifications in AttnGAN are made at lower layers of the generator and discriminator for images of 64 \u00d7 64 pixels resolution. Bounding box labels are obtained in a similar way as in StackGAN. In the generator, bounding box labels are obtained by concatenating image caption embeddings with one-hot vectors and applying a dense layer with 100 units, batch normalization, and a ReLU activation. The generator uses the gated linear unit function for convolutional layers. In the object pathway, a zero tensor is created to hold feature representations of objects, and bounding box labels are spatially replicated and upsampled before being added to the tensor. The generator obtains layout encoding and combines it with noise tensor and image caption embedding to form a tensor. This tensor goes through dense layer, batch normalization, and ReLU activation before reshaping. Two upsampling blocks are applied to get a tensor of shape (192, 16, 16). The object and global pathways' outputs are concatenated and further upsampled to obtain a tensor. In the object pathway of the discriminator, a zero tensor is created to hold feature representations of objects. A spatial transformer network extracts image features at bounding box locations, reshaping them to a tensor. The one-hot label of each bounding box is replicated and concatenated with features, followed by a convolutional layer with 192 filters, batch normalization, and activation. A spatial transformer network resizes the output. In the global pathway of the discriminator, convolutional layers with varying filter sizes and batch normalization are applied to the tensor, followed by concatenation with the object pathway output. Additional convolutional layers and spatially replicated image caption embedding are processed to obtain the final output. The discriminator utilizes a layer with one filter to generate the final output shape of (1). The training parameters and architecture remain consistent with the original implementation. The training set includes three normal-sized digits in the top half of the image for systematic testing. The model fails to generate recognizable digits when their location is too far in the bottom half of the image, as this was not observed during training. Failure cases include missing bounding boxes for foreground objects, resulting in only the background being generated. Different bounding box positions were tested, with some showing success and others showing failure. The text discusses placing bounding boxes in unusual locations for image synthesis using the AttnGAN architecture on the MS-COCO dataset. Results show images with objects placed in different halves of the image. Failure cases include missing bounding boxes for foreground objects. The last block of examples in the study demonstrates failure cases where the model places the same object at multiple locations within the image. The images generated by AttnGAN show objects placed in uncommon positions, such as sandwiches with the plate in the top half, dogs in the top half, and a human on the left half with a motorbike on the right. A test on object detection using YOLOv3 network pretrained on MS-COCO dataset was conducted to evaluate the quality of location and recognizability of the generated objects. The study evaluated object detection using a YOLOv3 network pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset. The Pytorch implementation was used to obtain bounding box and label predictions for images. The evaluation focused on how often the network recognized specific objects in generated images based on captions. The study evaluated object detection using a YOLOv3 network pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset. Specifically, the evaluation focused on how often the network recognized specific objects in generated images based on captions. The study only used captions that clearly implied the presence of a given label to allow for a fair comparison of the resulting presence or absence of objects. Images were generated for each caption with different models, and the number of images in which the given object was detected by YOLOv3 was counted. The ratio of images for each label and each model in which the object was detected was shown in Table 4. Additionally, the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the bounding boxes was calculated for models that received them as input. The study evaluated object detection using a YOLOv3 network pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset. The Intersection over Union (IoU) between ground truth and predicted bounding boxes was calculated for each object in the images. The results were summarized in Table 4 for the 30 tested labels. The study evaluated object detection using a YOLOv3 network pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset. Table 4 summarizes the results for 30 tested labels, showing that the StackGAN with object pathway outperforms the original StackGAN in recall. The IoU is consistently high for every label, indicating control over object location and identity in generated images. Compared to StackGAN, AttnGAN achieves a much greater recall for the tested labels. The study compared the performance of AttnGAN with object pathway to the original AttnGAN, showing higher recall values but lower average IoU. The AttnGAN tends to place recognizable object features randomly in images, leading to higher recall but lower IoU. The addition of the object pathway to different models improves image quality, as shown by higher Inception Score, lower Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, and better YOLOv3 network performance in detecting objects in generated images."
