The agreement must be in place by a specified deadline to allow for timely completion of the services. The Secretary will prepare and submit a study on retrofitting existing passenger motor vehicles with technology to address children left in rear seating positions after vehicles have been deactivated. The study will evaluate aftermarket technology solutions for children left in rear seats after vehicle deactivation. Recommendations will be made for manufacturers to ensure functional safety. During a 180-day period, the Secretary of Transportation will submit the results of a study evaluating aftermarket technology solutions for children left in rear seats after vehicle deactivation. Recommendations will be provided for manufacturers to ensure functional safety of products under various real-world conditions. Additionally, consumers will receive guidance on selecting technology or products to retrofit existing vehicles. The study results will be submitted to the Senate and House committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Energy and Commerce."
