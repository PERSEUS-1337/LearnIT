    "content": "Recent estimates suggest that the unauthorized alien population in the United States exceeds 11 million, leading to renewed attention on this issue. The 107th and 108th Congresses considered legislation regarding unauthorized alien children brought to the US by their parents. A 1982 Supreme Court case struck down a state law denying unauthorized alien children free public education. However, obstacles remain for unauthorized aliens graduating from high school and seeking postsecondary education benefits due to a provision in the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act prohibits unauthorized aliens from receiving postsecondary education benefits, including in-state tuition rates and federal student financial aid. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for state financial aid and cannot work legally. Legislation in the 107th and 108th Congresses aimed to provide relief to unauthorized alien students by repealing IIRIRA \u00a7505 and granting them greater access to postsecondary education. These bills also sought to enable certain unauthorized students to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status, allowing them to live and work indefinitely in the United States. Several bills were introduced in the 107th and 108th Congresses to support unauthorized alien students in accessing postsecondary education and adjusting to legal permanent resident status. These bills include H.R. 1563, H.R. 1582, H.R. 1918, S. 1291, S. 1265, and Title III, Subtitle D of S. 8. In the 108th Congress, the Excellence for All Learners Act of 2003 was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported an amended version of the DREAM Act, representing a compromise between different bills. Senator Hatch introduced a new version of the DREAM Act (S. 1545) in the same Congress. Four bills (H.R. 84, H.R. 1684, S. 8, and S. 1545) aimed to grant eligible unauthorized students LPR status through cancellation of removal, a relief authorized by the INA. H.R. 84 and H.R. 1684 proposed permanent amendments to make students eligible, while S. 8 and S. 1545 suggested temporary authorities for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status. The bills H.R. 1684, S. 8, and S. 1545 proposed allowing aliens to apply for relief without being placed in removal proceedings. H.R. 3271 and H.R. 1830 aimed to grant eligible unauthorized alien students LPR status through temporary adjustment of status authority. H.R. 1684 sought to add an exception to the numerical limitation for cancellation of removal/adjustment of status, while S. 8 and S. 1545 had no numerical limit. S. 1545 proposed a two-stage process for aliens to obtain LPR status, starting with conditional permanent resident status. Other bills would adjust eligible aliens directly to LPR status, all requiring continuous physical presence in the US for a specified number of years. The bills proposed different requirements for aliens to obtain LPR status, including continuous physical presence for a specified number of years, age restrictions, good moral character, and educational status. Some bills required enrollment in higher education, while others mandated a high school diploma or equivalent credential for LPR status. The Senate Judiciary Committee marked up S. 1545 on October 16 and October 23, 2003. The Committee voted in favor of an amendment proposed by Senator Hatch and Senator Durbin, amending various provisions of the bill, including changes to the confidentiality of information section. The substitute amendment stated that information furnished by applicants could not be used to initiate removal proceedings against individuals identified in the application. At the October 23 meeting, the Judiciary Committee considered amendments to S. 1545 proposed by Senator Charles Grassley. One amendment aimed to change the process for aliens seeking LPR status, while another sought to limit federal student financial aid for aliens eligible for LPR status adjustment under the bill. The Judiciary Committee approved Grassley's amendments to S. 1545, limiting federal student financial aid for aliens eligible for LPR status adjustment. The bill would require beneficiaries to be registered in SEVIS and undergo further discussion and modification before being reported. Under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, LPRs and eligible noncitizens may receive federal student financial aid. S. 1545 would restrict eligibility for federal student financial aid for aliens adjusting to LPR status, limiting them to student loans, work-study programs, and services. Other bills like H.R. 84 and H.R. 1684 did not have these restrictions, allowing LPRs to access federal financial aid under Title IV. H.R. 84 and H.R. 1684 aimed to extend federal financial aid eligibility to unauthorized students awaiting cancellation of removal/adjustment of status."
