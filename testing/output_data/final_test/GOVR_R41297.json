    "content": "The report provides an overview of the role of environmental considerations in federal procurement, addressing questions about agencies' consideration of environmental factors, legal authorities, and implementation of provisions. It does not cover green building initiatives, energy-savings contracts, policy documents, agency-specific laws, or general environmental laws shaping available products. The Obama Administration has promoted environmental factors in federal procurement through Executive Order. Initiatives include considering greenhouse gas emissions and biobased products in procurement decisions. Controversies have arisen, such as restrictions on biofuel purchases by the Department of Defense. Some criticize the use of the LEED rating system by GSA. Federal procurement involves various agencies. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) aims to deliver the best value products or services while fulfilling public policy objectives, including environmental goals. The May 2011 amendments introduced a sustainable acquisition policy requiring agencies to prioritize sustainable practices in 95% of new contract actions. The May 2011 amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) introduced a sustainable acquisition policy requiring federal agencies to prioritize the purchase of energy-efficient, water-efficient, biobased, environmentally preferable, non-ozone depleting, and products made with recovered materials in 95% of new contract actions. The May 2011 amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) introduced a sustainable acquisition policy for federal agencies to prioritize purchasing environmentally friendly products in 95% of new contract actions. The amendments do not specify which specific products to buy, but rather rely on existing legal authorities. Questions may arise regarding the implementation of the policy and the selection of sustainable products when multiple options are available. Various legal authorities currently require or allow contracting officers to consider environmental factors when procuring goods or services. These authorities can be categorized into attribute-focused authorities and general contracting authorities, which guide agencies in avoiding or acquiring products based on their environmental attributes. Small businesses participating in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the federal supply chain have expressed concerns about appearing less environmentally friendly compared to competitors with shorter travel distances or more fuel-efficient vehicles. Numerous statutes, regulations, and executive orders since the mid-1970s authorize agencies to prefer products with environmental attributes, requiring them to purchase these products over competing ones lacking such attributes. The preference varies by product and does not represent a holistic approach due to the development over time and actions of different branches of the federal government. The federal government has preferences for products with environmental attributes in procurement, but these preferences are not consistently applied across agencies. Some products have narrow definitions for eligibility, while others have broader preferences outlined in Part 23 of the FAR. The federal government has preferences for products with environmental attributes in procurement, outlined in Part 23 of the FAR. Definitions for preferred products may differ from everyday or environmentalists' usage. \"Green\" products are not currently defined for federal procurement preferences, but may fall under \"environmentally preferable products.\" The federal government has preferences for environmentally preferable products in procurement, outlined in Part 23 of the FAR. Agencies may be required or encouraged to purchase products with desired environmental attributes, avoid certain attributes, draft specifications to maximize use of preferred products, develop affirmative procurement plans, insert clauses in contracts, use environmental considerations in bid evaluations, meet procurement goals, and report on acquisition performance. The federal government has preferences for environmentally preferable products in procurement, outlined in Part 23 of the FAR. Agencies may be required to purchase products with desired environmental attributes, avoid certain attributes, and report on acquisition performance to executive branch authorities, Congress, or the public. Agencies are also required to use contract terms that obligate contractors to certify designated products or disclose information about environmental impacts. Preferences for preferred products are not always absolute due to conditional requirements and exemptions allowing agencies to purchase products without desired attributes in certain circumstances. Any preferences for alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in federal procurement must be \"cost-effective.\" Agencies can purchase products without biobased content if biobased products are not available competitively or do not meet performance standards. Certain exemptions apply for procurements related to intelligence, law enforcement, or national security activities. Preferences for environmentally preferable products in procurement are outlined in Part 23 of the FAR, with agencies required to use contract terms that certify designated products or disclose environmental impacts. The May 2011 amendments to the FAR and Executive Order 13514 emphasize environmental considerations in service acquisition. The FAR requires contracting officers to specify EMS directives for contractors and ensure compliance. Executive Order 13514 allows reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through changes in contractors' processes, services, transportation, or supply chain. The FAR and Executive Order 13514 emphasize environmental considerations in service acquisition, requiring contracting officers to specify EMS directives for contractors and ensure compliance. Agencies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by implementing changes in manufacturing processes, transportation, and supply chain activities. Attribute-focused authorities do not violate vendors' rights and do not deprive them of due process or equal protection under the U.S. Constitution. The purchase requirements for products listed in Table 1 are outlined in the Appendix. Contractors do not have property rights in prospective government contracts, so they are generally not deprived of due process when the government chooses to buy goods and services from other vendors. Distinctions between vendors based on environmental attributes do not violate equal protection rights unless involving suspect classifications or fundamental rights. Challenges to government programs on equal protection grounds must show the program is not rationally related to a legitimate government objective. Regulations mandating preferential treatment for products based on environmental considerations could potentially violate procurement integrity regulations and the Competition in Contracting Act. The FAR and CICA require impartiality and full and open competition in government business dealings. Regulations mandating preferential treatment for products based on environmental considerations may conflict with procurement integrity regulations and the Competition in Contracting Act. The FAR and CICA emphasize impartiality and full and open competition in government procurement. The government can promote cost-effective waste reduction in contracts without violating procurement integrity regulations or the Competition in Contracting Act. Agencies can purchase environmentally preferable products based on their needs, as long as it does not favor specific products or vendors in the source selection process. Agencies have statutory authority to define their requirements for products, including specific environmental attributes. This authority allows them to draft solicitations to obtain products that meet their needs. Agency specifications form the basis for selecting contractors, with only bids that conform to these specifications considered \"responsive.\" Some suggest that negotiated procurement may be more suitable for considering environmental attributes than sealed bidding. Agencies can use evaluation factors based on environmental considerations in negotiated procurements to select contractors. The Government Accountability Office has upheld awards that consider vendors' environmental stewardship, recycling programs, green delivery vehicles, and environmental management systems. Agencies can use evaluation factors tied to environmental considerations in procurement, but these factors must be related to the goods or services being acquired. Additionally, agencies must also consider price, past performance, and quality as evaluation factors. Environmental factors would be one of many factors considered in the award process. The focus on \"best value\" in federal procurements may lead to preferences for products with desirable environmental attributes. However, \"best value\" is not a special legal authority but rather the goal of all federal procurements. The cost/technical tradeoff process in negotiated procurements aims for \"best value,\" but it is subject to limitations such as evaluation factors representing key areas of importance. The focus on \"best value\" in federal procurements may lead to preferences for products with desirable environmental attributes. Agencies are required to avoid dealings with environmentally irresponsible contractors, as they are prohibited from contracting with vendors debarred by the EPA for violations of environmental laws. Debarments last until the EPA certifies corrections, with waivers possible only in the \"paramount interests of the United States\" and with congressional notification. Debarments for environmental violations apply only to vendors' operations at specific facilities, not all federal contracts. Contractors must be deemed \"responsible\" for federal awards, considering technical skills and environmental factors. Some contractors may be found nonresponsible for certain contracts due to environmental concerns. The implementation of attribute-specific and general authorities for preferring products or vendors based on environmental considerations involves two components: identifying prospective products and contractors, and using various purchasing methods. Contracting officers typically rely on third-party designations of eligible products rather than making individual determinations. Orders providing authority require one agency to designate eligible products, such as the EPA for recovered-content products, and another agency to purchase them. Program managers communicate requirements to contracting officers for inclusion in solicitations. Excluded parties are listed in the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and responsibility determinations are made on a case-by-case basis by contracting officers using information from the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information (FAPIIS). When purchasing products or services, agencies use various methods like bilateral contracts, Federal Supply Schedules, and government-wide commercial purchase cards. Contracting officers consider factors such as the nature of requirements, cost, and complexity when deciding which option to use. Bilateral contracts are the most common procurement vehicle, creating a legal relationship between the seller and buyer for the supply of goods or services. Contracts are the end result of a process that begins when agencies identify their requirements and craft solicitations to procure goods or services meeting these requirements. Solicitations identify what agencies want to buy and include information related to packaging, inspection, contract administration, contract clauses, and evaluation factors for award, including environmental considerations. The General Services Administration's Federal Supply Schedules offer agencies a way to procure goods or services with specific environmental attributes. These schedules cover various categories of goods and services, and agencies can use GSA Advantage!\u00ae to shop and order from them. Special buying programs, including \"Environmental,\" are available through GSA Advantage!\u00ae. The General Services Administration's Federal Supply Schedules offer agencies a way to procure goods or services with specific environmental attributes through GSA Advantage!\u00ae. Prospective buyers can use a separate Web page to select environmentally based criteria or filters for their purchases. Vendors are responsible for determining and identifying the environmental attributes of the products or services they provide. Schedule contractors are requested to identify items with recycled content, energy/water-saving features, or reduced pollutants. Customers should verify environmental claims with contractors. Vendors' misrepresentation on GSA Advantage!\u00ae may not lead to liability under the False Claims Act. Government personnel can use purchase cards for buying green products/services. The government encourages the purchase of green products and services using purchase cards, even for acquisitions below the micro-purchase threshold. Federal environmental policies on energy, water efficiency, and renewable energy apply to all acquisitions. The government's policy aims to increase energy security, protect the environment, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Federal activities through sustainable acquisitions. This includes promoting markets for sustainable technologies, products, and services in all procurement processes. Personnel have discretion in choosing environmentally friendly goods or services, even if not required to do so."
