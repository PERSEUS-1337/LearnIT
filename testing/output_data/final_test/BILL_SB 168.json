    "title": "SB 168",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 43.101 of the Civil Code states that an emergency responder is not liable for damage to an unmanned aircraft if the damage occurred while the responder was providing emergency services and the aircraft was interfering with those services. The definition of an emergency responder includes paid or unpaid volunteers and private entities authorized to provide emergency services. Terms such as public employee, public entity, and unmanned aircraft have the same meanings as defined in the Government Code. Chapter 4.5 of the Government Code provides immunity for public entities and employees from liability for damage to unmanned aircraft or systems if the damage occurred while they were providing emergency services such as medical transport, firefighting, or search and rescue. In Chapter 4.5 of the Government Code, immunity is granted to public entities and employees for damage to unmanned aircraft or systems during emergency services. The definitions of \"unmanned aircraft\" and \"unmanned aircraft system\" are provided in this chapter. Section 402.5 is added to the Penal Code. Section 402.5 of the Penal Code prohibits the operation of unmanned aircraft that interfere with firefighting efforts. Violators face up to six months in jail or a fine of up to $5,000. \"Unmanned aircraft\" refers to aircraft operated without direct human intervention. \"An unmanned aircraft system includes an unmanned aircraft and its associated elements necessary for safe operation in the national airspace system.\" The definition of \"recklessly\" in relation to interfering with firefighting efforts includes consciously disregarding a substantial risk that hinders extinguishing a fire. This includes risks that deviate greatly from what a reasonable person would do, even if the person is unaware of the risk due to voluntary intoxication. SEC. 4. This act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. SEC. 5. This act is an urgency statute for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety. To address the interference of unmanned aircraft with firefighting efforts during a historic drought and protect emergency responders from liability, this act must take effect immediately."
