The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish labeling standards for genetically engineered foods to inform consumers and prevent confusion. Congress recognizes the importance of disclosing factual information on food labels to help consumers make informed decisions. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" highlights the importance of disclosing information about genetically engineered food on labels. Over 60 countries have laws mandating such disclosure, and the Codex Alimentarius allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. The cultivation of genetically engineered crops can have adverse effects on the environment, including cross-pollination of native plants, increased herbicide usage, and impacts on non-target organisms like the Monarch butterfly. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear labeling of genetically engineered foods, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear labeling of genetically engineered foods, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. This paragraph outlines the criteria for foods that require labeling due to genetic engineering, including the use of genetically engineered processing aids or enzymes, and the percentage of genetically engineered materials in packaged foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving in vitro nucleic acid techniques or fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to organisms produced through intentional genetic engineering, including their progeny. Genetically engineered ingredients are derived from organisms that have been genetically engineered. The term 'natural' on food labels is restricted if the product has been produced using genetic engineering or contains genetically engineered ingredients. This amendment aims to prevent misleading claims to consumers. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision stating that no penalties will be imposed for misbranded food if the recipient provides a guaranty signed by a person in the United States from whom the food was received. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision stating that no penalties will be imposed for misbranded food if the recipient provides a guaranty signed by a person in the United States from whom the food was received. The guaranty must state that the food is not genetically engineered or does not contain genetically engineered ingredients, and the exclusion from penalties applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food. No person can avoid responsibility for misbranded food by transferring liability through a contract. Food not produced with genetic engineering can be labeled as 'organic' without penalty. The curr_chunk discusses the criteria for food to be labeled as 'organic' or non-genetically engineered, following specific testing procedures recommended by international standards organizations. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding genetically engineered foods and false guaranties. It also addresses unintended contamination of food and the penalties for misbranded products. The curr_chunk discusses the exemption for agricultural producers from penalties under section 403(z) if contamination is unintentional and not due to negligence. Regulations must be promulgated within one year. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within one year for labeling requirements under section 403(z) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."
