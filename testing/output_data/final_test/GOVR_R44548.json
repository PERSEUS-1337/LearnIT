    "content": "The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 sets minimum age requirements for employment in the United States, with a general minimum age of 16 for non-hazardous jobs and 18 for hazardous occupations. Certain exceptions exist for children under 16, and rules vary for agricultural and nonagricultural work. Some types of child labor are not prohibited under the FLSA, such as child entrepreneurs and volunteers for charitable organizations. Certain occupations, like newspaper delivery, are also excluded from coverage. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets minimum age requirements for employment in the US. The FLSA child labor provisions, along with Department of Labor regulations, make up federal child labor law. States have their own child labor laws, which may provide greater protections than the FLSA. The FLSA includes four child labor provisions, two of which address oppressive child labor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) prohibits the employment of youth under 16 or under 18 in hazardous occupations. Section 12(c) directly bans oppressive child labor, while Section 12(a) restricts the shipment of goods produced with oppressive child labor. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits oppressive child labor by restricting the interstate shipment of goods produced with such labor. This provision protects child workers even if they are not directly employed by the establishment. The FLSA child labor provisions apply to individual children, enterprises, or establishments near child labor, requiring oppressive child labor to be avoided. The Fair Labor Standards Act prohibits oppressive child labor by restricting the interstate shipment of goods produced with such labor. The FLSA child labor provisions apply to individual children, enterprises, or establishments near child labor, requiring oppressive child labor to be avoided. The child must be employed by an employer, and certain occupations and work arrangements are exempt from the child labor provisions. Section 12(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act covers individuals or enterprises engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, with specific criteria for child labor provisions. Enterprises with at least two employees involved in interstate commerce and annual sales of $500,000 are subject to the FLSA child labor regulations. Certain establishments like hospitals, schools, and government agencies are also covered by the act. The Fair Labor Standards Act covers establishments involved in interstate or foreign commerce, including government agencies. Section 12(a) of the act prohibits the shipment of \"hot goods\" produced with oppressive child labor. The act excludes children working for a parental employer from certain provisions, allowing them to work at any age and for any number of hours in non-hazardous occupations. Children of any age may be employed in various roles such as actors, newspaper delivery persons, and evergreen wreath producers. The Fair Labor Standards Act relaxes restrictions on child labor in certain industries, allowing children as young as 14 to work in agriculture outside of school hours. Additionally, 16- and 17-year-olds can now engage in activities involving scrap balers and paper box compactors. The Fair Labor Standards Act allows children as young as 14 to work in agriculture outside of school hours. 16- and 17-year-olds can engage in activities with scrap balers and paper box compactors, drive cars and trucks, and work with power-driven woodworking machines. The act defines oppressive child labor and includes exemptions that depend on the child's age, nature of work, parental involvement, and other factors. The Fair Labor Standards Act sets rules for children's employment, with different minimum ages for hazardous and non-hazardous occupations. Children under 14 can only work if their employment is excluded from oppressive child labor definitions or exempt from FLSA provisions. The Fair Labor Standards Act sets rules for children's employment, with different minimum ages for hazardous and non-hazardous occupations. Children under 14 can only work if their employment is excluded from oppressive child labor definitions or exempt from FLSA provisions. The act directs the Secretary of Labor to establish a list of occupations for children aged 14 and 15 that do not interfere with schooling or health, including office work, creative work, sales, retail, advertising, and certain errand and delivery work. Certain errand and delivery work performed by foot, bicycle, or public transport; building cleaning (e.g., vacuuming); maintenance of grounds without power-driven equipment; limited kitchen work including food preparation and serving, cleaning fruits and vegetables, and kitchen equipment; loading and unloading personal items and non-power tools from vehicles; dispensing gasoline and oil; cleaning cars by hand; some work involving riding in motor vehicles, subject to restrictions. Minors aged 14 and 15 are restricted in the type of work they can perform, with certain exceptions. For example, those excused from compulsory schooling may work in wood processing establishments without operating machinery. Additionally, 15-year-olds with lifeguard certification can work at swimming pools. The Department of Labor prohibits any job not explicitly permitted for this age group and also specifies forbidden tasks, such as using ladders. Children aged 14 and 15 are restricted from certain types of work, including using ladders. The Department of Labor prohibits them from working in manufacturing, mining, hazardous occupations, and operating power-driven machinery. Children aged 14 and 15 are restricted from certain types of work, including using ladders, operating motor vehicles, and working in occupations related to transportation, warehousing, construction, and public utilities. Children aged 14 and 15 are restricted from certain types of work, with exceptions for office and sales work. DOL regulations limit the number of hours and times of day children can work, with specific rules for school days and non-school days. Work hours are generally from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., extending to 9 p.m. during the summer. Exceptions include sports attendants at professional events. Children aged 14 and 15 are restricted from certain types of work, with exceptions for office and sales work. DOL regulations limit work hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., extending to 9 p.m. in the summer. Exceptions include sports attendants at professional events. Work-experience and career exploration program participants can work up to 3 hours per day on school days and up to 23 hours per week when school is in session. Work-study program participants can work up to 18 hours per week during school sessions. High school graduates and children excused from compulsory schooling have specific work regulations. Children aged 16 to 18 who have been excused from compulsory schooling or expelled are exempt from work hour regulations during school sessions. The Secretary of Labor has identified 17 hazardous occupations for this age group, prohibiting employment in these jobs with limited exemptions. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) sets minimum age thresholds and hazardous occupation rules for child labor, with exemptions for agriculture. Minimum age for agricultural jobs is 16 for hazardous work, 14 for non-hazardous work outside of school hours, and 12-13 with parental consent. Written consent is not needed if the child's parent also works on the farm. Children can work on farms owned or operated by their parents without restrictions. For non-hazardous agricultural jobs, children aged 10-11 can work for up to eight weeks outside of school hours with parental consent and a waiver from the Secretary of Labor. Children under 12 can work on small farms with parental consent. There are restrictions on working during school hours until the age of 16, but no limits on the number of hours worked per day or week in agriculture. Children under the age of 16 may work in agriculture outside of school hours, with restrictions on hazardous occupations. The Secretary of Labor enforces child labor provisions and conducts workplace inspections. The Secretary of Labor enforces child labor provisions through the DOL Wage and Hour Division, which oversees workplace enforcement. Violations of the FLSA child labor provisions can result in civil money penalties of up to $11,000 per employee or $50,000 for serious violations. Civil penalties collected are deposited in the U.S. Treasury. Employers may request exceptions to penalty determinations. Since FY2007, the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division has concluded over 9,700 cases involving violations of FLSA child labor provisions, totaling more than 176,000 violations. Full-service restaurants, limited-service restaurants, and eating places accounted for a significant portion of these cases. Civil money penalties for these violations ranged from no penalty to $287,980, with U.S. district courts having the authority to enjoin violations of child labor provisions under the FLSA. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) imposes penalties for child labor violations, including fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to six months. Courts have clarified the application of child labor provisions, particularly regarding goods moving in commerce. The early cases under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) focused on whether employers were transporting goods produced by minors, not directly employing minors. In a 1945 case, Western Union Telegraph v. Lenroot, the Supreme Court considered if Section 12(a) applied to a telegraph company employing messengers under 16, who were transporting telegraphic messages produced in establishments with oppressive child labor. The Court in Western Union Telegraph v. Lenroot determined that while telegraphic messages were considered \"goods\" under the FLSA, Western Union was not a producer of these goods as they simply transmitted the messages. The Court also clarified that the term \"ship\" did not apply to intangible messages. In Tobin v. Grant, a federal district court in California further examined the meaning of \"ship or deliver for shipment in commerce\" under Section 12(a). The court in Tobin v. Grant concluded that the employer's delivery of goods, even if primarily intrastate, was prohibited by Section 12(a) of the FLSA. The employer's knowledge of the goods' ultimate destination being in interstate commerce made it liable for violating the law. The FLSA covers transactions where goods' ultimate destination is in interstate commerce to prevent manufacturers from violating the law by selling goods within the state of manufacture. Recent cases have examined Section 12(c) regarding the direct employment of minors, such as in McLaughlin v. Stineco where a framing contractor violated Section 12(c) by employing minors in hazardous occupations. Regulations defined roofing work as hazardous for minors. The court found that the framing contractor violated Section 12(c) and DOL's child labor regulations by employing a 15-year-old for more than 40 hours per week, which is prohibited for minors aged 14-16. The minor worked for three to five weeks, starting at 7:00-7:30 a.m. and ending at 4:30-5:00 p.m. with a lunch break. Minors aged 14-15 are restricted to work no more than 40 hours per week when school is not in session and 18 hours per week when school is in session. In Martin v. Funtime, a federal court found that an amusement park operator violated child labor laws by employing 14- and 15-year-olds for more hours than allowed by the Secretary of Labor. The court rejected the operator's claim of difficulty in monitoring hours and ordered them to stop further violations. In Martin v. Funtime, an amusement park operator violated child labor laws by employing 14- and 15-year-olds for excessive hours, leading to strict liability for the employer. Recent FLSA cases show a steady investigation of child labor violations, with the Department of Labor alleging violations of Section 12(c) and FLSA provisions in a 2015 case. In Perez v. Cathedral Buffet, DOL is seeking $207,975 in back wages and liquidated damages for wage and hour violations, as well as a permanent injunction against future FLSA violations. In Perez v. Moranto, DOL alleges child labor, minimum wage, and overtime violations, including minors working excessive hours and operating hazardous equipment."
