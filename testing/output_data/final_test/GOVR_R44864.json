    "content": "The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) authorized the FDA to collect fees from the pharmaceutical industry to support drug application reviews. It has been renewed multiple times, with the most recent extension through September 2022. PDUFA revenue contributes significantly to the FDA's budget, including the Human Drugs Program and Biologics Program. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was first passed to supplement the FDA budget with industry fees to expedite new drug application reviews. PDUFA I amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to establish fee collection and usage procedures. It aimed to reduce FDA approval time for new drugs and enhance industry earnings. The report discusses the origin of prescription drug user fees, current law under PDUFA VI, the impact on FDA review times and budget, and the reauthorization process. In the late 1980s, FDA approval for new drug applications took 29 months. The FDA approval time for new drug applications was 29 months, which was considered too long by industry, consumer groups, and FDA. Patient advocates argued that delays in drug reviews could be life-threatening, while manufacturers claimed it affected their ability to recoup research costs. FDA needed more scientists for reviews but lacked funding, leading to discussions about implementing user fees, opposed by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry initially opposed user fees for drug reviews, fearing funds would reduce federal debt. FDA commissioner David Kessler's compromise on performance goals and funding reassured industry, leading to the authorization of prescription drug user fees in PDUFA I-VI. Prior to marketing a drug, a manufacturer must submit a new drug application (NDA) to FDA demonstrating safety and effectiveness. FDA reviews NDAs for safety, effectiveness, labeling appropriateness, and manufacturing methods. PDUFA authorizes FDA to use fee revenue for drug application reviews and has been expanded by Congress over time. The research and development path of a new drug includes basic research, preclinical development, clinical trials, FDA review of the NDA, and approval. The FDA uses PDUFA revenue to support activities related to drug application reviews, including letters outlining deficiencies, facility inspections, and research monitoring. PDUFA I (FY1993-FY1997) funded necessary review activities, while PDUFA II (FY1998-FY2002) expanded these activities. PDUFA III (FY2003-FY2007) extended FDA's use of prescription drug user fee revenue to include postapproval and marketing activities, allowing for increased monitoring of drug side effects and database development. PDUFA IV (FY2008-FY2012) removed the three-year limitation on postapproval activities and further expanded postmarket safety efforts. PDUFA IV removed the three-year limitation on postapproval activities and expanded postmarket safety efforts, including developing adverse-event data-collection systems and implementing new FFDCA requirements. PDUFA V and VI maintained the scope of activities supported by fees. PDUFA IV codified requirements for goals letter, consultation, and fee revenue distribution. Each five-year reauthorization sets total fee revenue for first year with annual adjustments based on inflation and workload changes. PDUFA VI establishes a new user fee. PDUFA VI introduces a new user fee structure, eliminating product and establishment fees while adding a program fee. The application fee remains, providing 20% of total fee revenue, with the program fee contributing 80%. FDA aims to enhance the program fee structure for increased predictability and efficiency. The current PDUFA fee structure and fee setting process, established in 1992, are recognized by both FDA and industry for needing updates to enhance administrative efficiency, predictability, stability, and revenue. Fee revenues under PDUFA I-V were adjusted for inflation and changes in FDA's workload for human drug application reviews. PDUFA VI introduces modifications to inflation adjustments. PDUFA VI modifies the inflation adjustment calculation for FDA personnel costs and benefits, replacing the workload adjustment with a capacity planning adjuster to align fees with workload and staff capacity. PDUFA VI establishes a new methodology for assessing resource and capacity needs for human drug application reviews. It eliminates final-year adjustment provisions and introduces an annual operating reserve adjustment to increase fee revenue. PDUFA VI introduces a provision to adjust fee revenue to maintain a 14-week operating reserve for the review of human drug applications. It also includes a direct cost adjustment of $8.7 million for FY2018, with subsequent adjustments based on the CPI for FY2019 through FY2022. Total revenue for each fiscal year is calculated based on the annual base revenue of $878.6 million. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) requires the total revenue for each fiscal year to include the annual base revenue, inflation adjustment, capacity planning adjustment, operating reserve adjustment, additional direct cost adjustment, and specified additional dollar amounts. User fees are meant to supplement congressional appropriations, not replace them, with three limiting conditions to enforce this goal. FDA can only collect and use fees if certain criteria are met. PDUFA VI maintains the conditions for fee amounts provided in appropriations acts and requires agencies to spend at least as much as in FY1997, adjusted for inflation. Approval times for NDAs and BLAs measure PDUFA's effectiveness in reducing review time. FDA established goals for standard and priority review times under PDUFA I, with priority review aiming for action within 6 months for drugs treating serious conditions with significant improvements in safety or effectiveness. The FDA has met or exceeded performance goals for new drug applications in recent years. User fee revenue has significantly increased, accounting for 63% of the Human Drugs program by FY2017. The PDUFA VI reauthorization process began in July 2015 with a public meeting and included meetings with industry and advocacy groups. FDA published a notice in July 2016 announcing the availability of the proposed PDUFA VI Commitment Letter. The PDUFA VI reauthorization process started in July 2015 with meetings with industry and advocacy groups. Legislation was introduced in the Senate and House to reauthorize PDUFA and other user fee programs. The bill was approved by committees and passed by both chambers, becoming law as FDARA (P.L. 115-52) on August 18, 2017. FDARA (P.L. 115-52) was signed into law on August 18, 2017, reauthorizing PDUFA to collect fees for FDA activities. The legislation includes provisions for medical devices, generic drugs, biosimilar products, pediatric drugs, inspections, regulatory improvements, generic drug access, and miscellaneous provisions."
