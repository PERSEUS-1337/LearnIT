Successful completion of drug court programs leads to long-term arrest-free periods for participants. Drug courts are more effective in keeping offenders in treatment, resulting in cost savings for taxpayers. In 2007, Federal investment in drug courts leveraged $9 in State funding, saving taxpayers up to $3.36. SEC. 2. DRUG COURTS. Part EE of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to establish grant authority for drug courts. The Attorney General may provide grants for various types of drug courts, including adult, juvenile, family, and tribal drug courts. These courts involve judicial supervision over individuals with substance abuse issues, coordination with relevant authorities, and the administration of sanctions and services, such as mandatory drug testing. The Attorney General may provide grants for different types of drug courts, including adult, juvenile, family, and tribal drug courts. These courts offer judicial supervision for individuals with substance abuse problems, along with sanctions and services like mandatory drug testing. Additionally, participants in these programs may receive substance abuse treatment, offender management, aftercare services, and support services as needed. The offender may be required to pay for treatment costs, restitution to victims, and undergo mandatory drug testing as part of economic sanctions imposed by the court. These sanctions should not hinder the offender's rehabilitation. Mandatory drug testing is required for drug courts, with guidelines set by the Attorney General for accurate and practical testing of controlled substances abused by participants. Approval for drug testing may be necessary. The Attorney General may require approval of the drug testing regime to ensure adequate testing in drug courts. Mandatory sanctions for drug court participants failing a drug test include incarceration, increased program time, termination, increased screening, court appearances, supervision, and electronic monitoring. The options for mandatory sanctions for drug court participants failing a drug test include increased supervision, electronic monitoring, in-home restriction, and community service. The Attorney General consults with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and other officials, may use Department of Justice components, and has regulatory authority to issue necessary guidelines. To request funds under this part, the chief executive or judge of a government entity must submit an application to the Attorney General with a detailed plan for the drug court program and certification of the need for Federal assistance. To request funds under this part, the chief executive or judge of a government entity must submit an application to the Attorney General with a detailed plan for the drug court program. The application must certify that the Federal support will supplement existing funding, identify related initiatives, ensure consultation with affected agencies, have designated judges for supervision, plan for ongoing support post-Federal funding, and certify statements made by offenders. Federal support for drug court programs includes certifying that statements made by offenders regarding drug use will not be used as evidence in criminal proceedings outside of the drug court program. Admission criteria must be broad to ensure access for all drug-dependent, high-risk individuals. The drug court program for drug-dependent, high-risk individuals under the court's jurisdiction who are not violent offenders must not discriminate based on various factors and must be established by a panel with broad representation. The program must have a policy for selecting non-violent offenders based on approved admission criteria. The drug court program must ensure that the individual circumstances of offenders are considered, meet public safety needs, protect offenders' right to competent counsel, and provide access to the program. The drug court program must ensure access for high-risk offenders with long sentences and drug dependency. The evaluation methodology should include research on alternative sentences for drug-dependent offenders. Substance abuse treatment services must be licensed and meet state standards of care. The term 'sex offender' refers to an individual who has committed sexual assault, as defined in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Federal grants under this part cannot exceed 75% of total program costs unless the Attorney General waives the matching contribution requirement. In-kind contributions can count towards the non-Federal share of a grant. Distribution and allocation of funds are governed by Section 2955. The Attorney General ensures equitable distribution of grants to States, State courts, local governments, and Indian tribal governments. Technical assistance and training are provided to States and eligible applicants to enhance their competitiveness for future funding under this program. The Bureau of Justice Assistance provides technical assistance and training to enhance competitiveness for future funding under this program, considering the unique needs of rural States, areas, and communities. The Bureau of Justice Assistance provides technical assistance, training, and evaluation for entities receiving funds under this program. They are required to submit a report on the effectiveness of the program to the Attorney General. The Attorney General may provide technical assistance, training, and evaluations for programs receiving support under this part through direct implementation or collaboration with other entities. Reauthorization of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 includes amendments related to evaluations and program effectiveness reporting. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended to authorize appropriations for part EE, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2011 to 2017. The Attorney General must reserve a percentage of funds for research and evaluation of the program."
