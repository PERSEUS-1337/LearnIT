    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA) is the primary legislation for providing social and nutrition services to older individuals. Enacted in 1965, it offers a variety of services such as nutrition programs, community service employment, and programs to prevent elder abuse. Amendments in 2006 reauthorized all programs under the act through FY2011. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, including S. 3570 and H.R. 6197, were passed in September 2006. This report summarizes changes made by P.L. 109-365, provides background on the act, discusses major provisions, and outlines recent funding for its programs. Tables show authorization of appropriations and appropriations history for FY1999-FY2006. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, under P.L. 109-365, expanded the focus of services and programs to include older people at risk for institutional care, in addition to those with the greatest social or economic need. The act previously required targeting services towards specific groups, such as low-income older people and those in rural areas. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, P.L. 109-365, added provisions focusing on older people with mental illness and elder justice activities. It authorized the Assistant Secretary on Aging to designate individuals responsible for mental health services and elder abuse prevention programs. The law defined elder justice as efforts to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It also required a national study on the incidence and prevalence of elder abuse in all settings. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, P.L. 109-365, expanded the role of AoA and state agencies on aging in promoting home and community-based long-term care services. It also added provisions for elder justice activities, including funding for competitive grants to states. The law required research on innovative strategies for long-term care and the development of comprehensive systems for home and community-based services. The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, P.L. 109-365, authorized state and area agencies to assess the preparedness of local communities for demographic changes in the elderly population. It revised the distribution formula for Title III grant allotments to ensure states receive at least the same amount as in FY2006 for supportive services. Additionally, the law required new demonstration programs under Title IV, including projects to help older people \"age in place.\" The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006, P.L. 109-365, aimed to help older people \"age in place\" and improve access to mental health services. It revised the Title V community service employment program to focus on training older individuals and transitioning them to unsubsidized employment. The law also required the Secretary of Labor to conduct a national competition for Title V funds every four years. Title I of P.L. 109-365 focuses on improving the lives of older Americans with objectives like adequate retirement income and comprehensive long-term care services. Title II establishes AoA within HHS as the advocate for older persons, requiring the establishment of the National Eldercare Locator Service. The Older Americans Act (OAA) requires the Administration on Aging (AoA) to establish various national centers to support older persons. With increasing lifespans, there is a growing concern for abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. Recent Congresses have considered legislation to address these issues through a multidisciplinary approach involving law enforcement, public health, and social services personnel. Additionally, provisions related to elder justice activities have been included in the OAA reauthorization legislation. The OAA reauthorization legislation includes provisions for elder justice activities, defining elder justice as efforts to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It authorizes the Assistant Secretary to designate an individual responsible for administering elder abuse prevention programs and requires a national study on incidence and prevalence of elder abuse. The OAA reauthorization legislation includes provisions for elder justice activities, defining elder justice as efforts to prevent, detect, treat, intervene in, and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It authorizes a national study on elder abuse incidence and prevalence, and expands AoA's role in promoting home and community-based long-term care services in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C. Congress expanded AoA's role in promoting home and community-based long-term care services by requiring the Assistant Secretary to conduct research and demonstration projects to identify cost-effective strategies for modifying state long-term care systems. This includes targeting services to individuals at risk for institutional placement to allow them to remain in home and community-based care settings. AoA has funded Aging and Disability Resource Centers in 43 states to provide information and assistance for individuals to make informed decisions about their care options. The ADRC grant program, a cooperative effort between AoA and CMS, helps states enhance individuals' choice of services and create a coordinated system of information for accessing long-term care services. P.L. 109-365 authorizes AoA to administer mental health services, including education, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders like age-related dementia and depression. Research shows many older people do not participate in federal and state programs. Research has shown that many older people do not participate in federal and state programs for which they may be eligible. Congress authorized the establishment of a National Center on Senior Benefits Outreach and Enrollment to inform older people about benefit programs and develop cost-effective methods for enrollment. The Administration proposed clarification and expansion of provisions for area agencies on aging to enter agreements with profitmaking organizations to provide services for older people, including conducting seminars on caregiving issues for employees. This would allow area agencies and other grantees to be reimbursed by the private sector for these services. The Administration proposed allowing area agencies on aging to enter agreements with profitmaking organizations to provide services for older people, with stipulations on cost reimbursement and reporting requirements. The law allows area agencies on aging to enter agreements with profit-making organizations for services for older people, with reimbursement at fair market rates. Revenue generated must support services for older individuals without displacing existing services. The Assistant Secretary must develop monitoring procedures and reporting requirements for these agreements. Title III of the Older Americans Act authorizes grants to state and area agencies on aging to coordinate programs for older persons. It accounted for 70% of total OAA funds in FY2006. The program supports state agencies, area agencies, and service providers with separate allotments for various services. Title III of the Older Americans Act provides nutrition services, home-delivered meals, incentive grants, and health promotion services for individuals aged 60 and over, with a focus on those with economic or social needs. Means testing is not allowed, and voluntary contributions are encouraged. States receive funds based on their share of the older population. Cost-sharing policies may be implemented, but services cannot be denied for failure to pay. In FY2004, Title III programs served 8.1 million older persons with various services including transportation, home care, adult day care, and legal assistance. 28% had income below the poverty level, and 22% were minority older persons. The supportive services and senior centers program provides funds for social services and activities of over 6,000 senior centers, funded at $350.4 million in FY2006. The supportive services program funded at $350.4 million in FY2006 represents 28% of Title III funds. It provides services such as transportation, personal care, and adult day care to help older persons remain independent in their homes and communities. A 2004 survey found that services target vulnerable populations, with many recipients relying on OAA transportation services for their local transportation needs. Almost three-quarters of homemaker services recipients, aged 75 or older, reported living alone. 55% of recipients had income of $10,000 or less. The Title III nutrition program, funded at $714.6 million in FY2006, represents 58% of Title III funds. Data for FY2004 show that 57% of the 249 million meals served were provided to frail older persons at home. The nutrition program for older persons provides meals in various settings, including at home and in congregate settings like senior centers. Participants must be age 60 or older, with spouses of any age also eligible. Meals must meet dietary guidelines and requirements based on the number of meals served each day. The nutrition program for older persons requires providing a minimum of one-third of the daily recommended dietary reference intakes per meal. Projects serving two meals per day must offer two-thirds of the dietary reference intakes, while those serving three meals must provide 100%. Congregate and home-delivered nutrition services must offer at least one meal per day five or more days per week, with exceptions in rural areas. Congregate providers must offer at least one \"hot or other appropriate meal\" per day, while home-delivered providers must offer at least one meal per day using various food options. The nutrition program for older persons provides one meal per day, with participants being older, more likely to be poor, live alone, and belong to minority groups. Many recipients have income below the poverty level and face health and functional limitations. The program is crucial for their overall nutrition, with meals being their primary nutrient source. The evaluation also shows that the program leverages a significant amount of non-federal dollars. The nutrition program for older persons leverages a significant amount of non-federal dollars, with an average of $1.70 for congregate meals and $3.35 for home-delivered meals from various sources. Recipient characteristics show that in 2004, 62% of congregate nutrition survey respondents were age 75 and older, 52% lived alone, and over one-quarter had annual income of $10,000 or less. Many recipients reported that the program provided a significant portion of their daily food intake and participated in other activities at the meal site. In a 2004 survey, it was found that almost three-quarters of home-delivered meal recipients were aged 75 and over, 61% lived alone, and 46% had an annual income of $10,000 or less. 66% stated that the home-delivered meals program provided at least half of their daily food intake. Recipients reported needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). The average cost of congregate meals in the US was $5.81, while home-delivered meals cost $4.68 on average. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) was added to Title III by the 2000 amendments (P.L. 106-501), funded at $156.1 million in FY2006. It represents 13% of Title III funds and 8.8% of the act's total funding, providing services such as information and assistance, individual counseling, support groups, caregiver training, respite services, and supplemental services. Caregivers may receive counseling, access to support groups, training, and services that complement care provided by family and informal caregivers. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) provides services such as information, counseling, support groups, training, respite care, and supplemental services. Respite services receive almost half of caregiver funding, with the remainder spent on caregiver information and assistance services. States can establish cost-sharing policies for individuals receiving respite and supplemental services. Priority is given to older persons and their families with the greatest social and economic need. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) provides services to older persons and their families with the greatest social and economic need, including low-income individuals and certain caregivers. The federal matching share for caregiver services is 75%, with states covering the remainder. In FY2004, outreach efforts reached over 9 million individuals, with access assistance provided to 525,000 caregivers and counseling/training services for over 322,000 caregivers. Respite care services were supported for over 190,000 caregivers. In a 2004 survey of NFCSP caregivers, over three-quarters had been providing care for three years or longer, with almost two-thirds aged 60 and over. Caregivers helped with various tasks like dressing, bathing, preparing meals, laundry, and medicine. The law requires state agencies to target services to older people in greatest social and economic need, including low-income minority older persons and those in rural areas. States must consider the distribution of people with special needs when developing funding formulas. The law requires state agencies to target services to older people in greatest social and economic need, including low-income minority older persons and those in rural areas. P.L. 109-365 added requirements for states and area agencies to focus on older people at risk for institutional care and those with limited English proficiency. Title III supports a variety of home and community-based long-term care services for older individuals. The law requires state agencies to target services to older people in greatest social and economic need, including low-income minority older persons and those in rural areas. P.L. 109-365 defines the responsibilities of state and area agencies on aging with respect to home and community-based services, thus codifying what many are already doing. The law requires state and area agencies on aging to develop comprehensive systems for home and community-based services, collaborating with other agencies and making recommendations to modify the long-term care system. The increasing number of people turning 65 will strain aging service providers supported by the Older Americans Act. Groups representing aging service providers proposed new Older Americans Act initiatives to help state and area agencies plan for the growing elderly population. State agencies are required to assess how prepared they are for changes in the elderly population over a 10-year period. This includes analyzing how demographic changes may affect older individuals with low incomes and minority older adults. The Older Americans Act aims to improve programs and services for older individuals, especially those with low incomes, minority older adults, and those in rural areas. It also focuses on adjusting resource levels to meet the changing needs of the aging population, including those aged 85 and older. Area agencies on aging are authorized to make recommendations to government officials on various areas to respond to the growing aging population. The Older Americans Act emphasizes the importance of nutrition, socialization, and health promotion for older individuals. It addresses hunger, food insecurity, and the need for access to nutrition and health services to prevent adverse health conditions. Congressional findings highlight malnourishment and nutrition deficiencies among older adults, emphasizing the role of diet and supplements in promoting health. The Older Americans Act emphasizes nutrition for older individuals, suggesting daily multivitamin-mineral supplements as a solution. Title III providers should consider offering compliant supplements with essential nutrients. P.L. 109-365 mandates an evidence-based evaluation of nutrition programs by the Food and Nutrition Board. The Older Americans Act emphasizes nutrition for older individuals, suggesting daily multivitamin-mineral supplements as a solution. P.L. 109-365 adds new services like nutrition assessment and counseling for participants, with a focus on caregivers providing care to individuals with severe disabilities. P.L. 109-365 prioritizes caregivers of individuals with severe disabilities, Alzheimer's disease, and children with disabilities. It allows caregiver services for grandparents and older relatives caring for children, including those who are adopted. The law P.L. 109-365 expanded caregiver services to include older individuals caring for children with disabilities, regardless of the child's age. This change was made to address the needs of caregivers affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In the event of a federally declared disaster, the Older Americans Act authorizes funds to provide social services and supplies for older persons. State agencies on aging pass these funds through to area agencies on aging, in addition to FEMA support. State and area agencies play a crucial role in assisting older people during disasters. The Older Americans Act authorizes funds for social services and supplies for older persons during federally declared disasters. State and area agencies are crucial in assisting older people during disasters, with new requirements added for disaster and emergency planning coordination. The Older Americans Act allows for voluntary contributions towards services provided, with a distinction between cost-sharing and voluntary contributions. Cost-sharing is allowed for certain services, but older people cannot be denied services for not contributing. The Older Americans Act prohibits states from applying cost-sharing for services to low-income individuals. An amendment was added to encourage voluntary contributions from those with income above 185% of the federal poverty level. This was in response to concerns about rising service costs without increased funding. Older individuals are still encouraged to contribute voluntarily but cannot be denied services for not contributing. P.L. 109-365 revised the formula for distributing Title III funds to states for various services for older Americans. The formula considers factors like a state's population of individuals aged 60 and over and a minimum grant amount for all states. The law also ensures that states receive at least the same amount they received in FY2000, plus a percentage increase in appropriations for the respective programs. The law P.L. 109-365 updated the formula for distributing funds to states for services for older Americans. States now receive funds based on their population of individuals aged 60 and over, with a minimum grant amount. The law gradually eliminates the guaranteed growth factor over four years, ensuring states receive no less than their FY2006 amount plus a phased-out growth factor. By FY2011, state allocations will be based solely on population and minimum grant provisions. Title IV of the act authorizes funds for training, research, and demonstration projects in aging to expand knowledge and test innovative ideas for older persons. AoA has funded national efforts supporting state agencies on aging, including projects on income, health, housing, retirement, and long-term care. The Assistant Secretary on Aging has conducted various projects focusing on legal assistance, retirement needs of minority populations, and vulnerable elderly. Initiatives include funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, outreach activities for Medicare beneficiaries, a nutrition and physical activity campaign, evidence-based health care interventions, and intergenerational opportunities. P.L. 109-365 added authority for new demonstration programs under Title IV, including projects to assist older people to age in place and mental health services for older individuals. Many communities are exploring ways to assist older individuals who have \"aged in place\" and may need supportive services to continue living independently. House and Senate appropriations legislation have earmarked funds for projects supporting Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) to help sustain the independence of older individuals. The bill defines a \"Naturally Occurring Retirement Community\" as a residential building or neighborhood where a significant percentage of older individuals reside. Entities receiving funds must provide comprehensive health and social services, excluding institutional care or assisted living settings. The law added a provision for competitive grants to states to develop systems for mental health screening and treatment services for older individuals. The purpose is to increase public awareness, reduce stigma, and discrimination related to mental disorders in older individuals. P.L. 109-365 authorized Title IV funds for various projects related to aging, including technology-based service models, support for caregivers, awareness of cognitive impairments, civic engagement, and transportation services for older individuals. The community service employment program for older Americans aims to provide part-time opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. It was first funded in 1965 and modeled after Operation Mainstream, a program for poor, chronically unemployed adults. Operation Mainstream was transferred to the Department of Labor in 1967. The community service employment program for older Americans, initially funded in 1965, was transferred to the Department of Labor in 1967. It was given statutory basis under Title IX of the Older American Comprehensive Services Amendments in 1973 and incorporated into the Older Americans Act in 1975 as Title IX, later redesignated as Title V in 1978. Administered by DOL, the program represented a significant portion of OAA funds in FY2006, providing part-time employment opportunities for older individuals and contributing to community welfare through various service activities. The community service employment program for older Americans, administered by the Department of Labor, provides part-time employment opportunities for individuals aged 55 and older. Enrollees receive wages, physical examinations, counseling, and transportation for employment purposes. Eligibility is based on age and income criteria. The Department of Labor's community service employment program prioritizes veterans and qualified veteran spouses aged 60 and older, with special consideration for those with low income, poor job prospects, and other needs. There is no upper age limit, and income recertification is required annually. Title V wages do not affect eligibility for food stamps or federal housing programs. Enrollees' wages are taxable and they contribute to social security. The Department of Labor's community service employment program prioritizes veterans and qualified veteran spouses aged 60 and older, with special consideration for those with low income, poor job prospects, and other needs. Wages received under Title V are counted for income-tested programs like supplemental security income. Funds are distributed based on set requirements including a hold harmless amount, state population aged 55 and over, and state per capita income. Competitive grant awards were initiated in 2002 and 2006 for distribution of funds to national organizations. The Department of Labor's community service employment program prioritizes veterans and qualified veteran spouses aged 60 and older. Competitive grant awards were initiated in 2002 and 2006 for distribution of funds to national organizations. Funds were distributed to more organizations through a competitive grant process, resulting in some organizations receiving reduced funds or no funds after competition. The future direction of the program was a topic of discussion in the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress discussed the future direction of the community service employment program. The proposed changes in H.R. 5293 focused on training participants for unsubsidized employment and allowing placement in private, for-profit jobs. However, the final law, P.L. 109-365, maintained the focus on community service jobs for older individuals and emphasized training for unsubsidized employment. The law, P.L. 109-365, allowed grantees to use more funds for training participants for unsubsidized employment. Grantees must use at least 75% of funds for wages and benefits, but can request to use 65% if approved. The remaining funds (up to 10%) can be used for training, job placement assistance, and participant supportive services. The law, P.L. 109-365, allows grantees to use more funds for training participants for unsubsidized employment. Participants will receive Title V wages, with funds used for various Title V activities and outreach. The law specifies income exclusions and calculation methods for eligibility. In 2005, DOL revised guidelines for determining eligibility for Title V project sponsors. The guidelines required including Social Security income, unemployment compensation, veterans' payments, interest, dividends, earnings, pension income, rents, and alimony as income. Exclusions from income calculation included Supplemental Security Income, capital gains, bank withdrawals, borrowed money, tax refunds, gifts, inheritances, public assistance payments, and certain disability payments. In a 2005 review of the program, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found concerns with the revised income criteria, specifically including SSDI and Social Security. Grantees expressed difficulty serving individuals receiving SSDI and disagreed with including all Social Security income in determining program eligibility. Congress addressed these concerns in P.L. Congress addressed concerns with the revised income criteria in P.L. 109-365 by excluding certain income sources, such as SSI benefits and 25% of Title II Social Security benefits. DOL issued guidelines in 2004 and 2005 on income calculation for program eligibility. The guidelines for income calculation for program eligibility were revised in April 2004 and again nine months later to require annualized income for the six-month period prior to application. Concerns were raised about this change, as it could make some individuals ineligible for Title V jobs. In response, Congress mandated that income be calculated for the 12-month period ending on the date of application submission. Prior to P.L. 109-365, there was no time limit on how long a Title V participant could be enrolled. However, the average duration of participation was about 27 months. The new law stipulated that eligible individuals could participate for up to 48 months starting July 1, 2007, with the option for extension for hard-to-serve cases upon grantee request. The law allows for an average enrollment duration cap of 27 months for grantees, with the option to extend up to 36 months in specific circumstances. Grantees can request an extension for hard-to-serve individuals such as those with severe disabilities, frail individuals aged 75 or older, and those with limited English proficiency or low literacy skills. The Secretary may approve extensions based on factors like high unemployment rates or poverty levels. The 2000 reauthorization added performance indicators for state agency and national organization grantees. The Secretary would assess if national grantees met performance measures annually, with corrective action plans required for non-compliance. The Department of Labor (DOL) implemented performance standards for grant recipients, requiring corrective action plans if standards were not met. Funds could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance. DOL held national competitions in 2002 and 2006 for Title V funding, resulting in a reshuffling of funds among grantees. During the 2002 and 2006 national competitions for Title V funding, issues arose regarding the competitive nature of the grants. Some organizations found the three-year competitive cycle challenging to implement, as new grantees needed time to ramp up activities before reapplying for funds based on DOL performance indicators. Congress made changes to requirements for competition and grantee performance in response to concerns raised by grantees about the time lag in DOL's publication of performance indicators. The law now mandates a national competition for national grantee funds every four years, with evaluations based on performance indicators. National grantees failing to perform will receive technical assistance and must take corrective action, without facing reduction or withdrawal of funds. The new law mandates a national competition every four years for grantee funds based on performance indicators. National grantees failing to meet standards will receive technical assistance and corrective action, without funding reduction. State agency grantees may face realignment of funds if they fail to meet indicators for three consecutive years. The law mandates a national competition every four years for grantee funds based on performance indicators. Indicators of performance by grantees were revised under P.L. 109-365, dividing them into core indicators and additional indicators. Core indicators now include hours of community service and earnings, entry and retention into unsubsidized employment, and the number of eligible individuals served. The Secretary of DOL is required to establish and implement performance indicators for grant recipients, including retention in unsubsidized employment, participant satisfaction, and other indicators determined by the Secretary. The Secretary must do this by July 1, 2007, and is prohibited from holding a grant. The Secretary of DOL must establish performance indicators for grant recipients by July 1, 2007. A grant competition cannot be held until the indicators are implemented or until January 1, 2010. Definitions for the indicators must be issued after consultation with stakeholders. Grantees and the Secretary must agree on performance levels, which will be publicly available. Grantees must place at least 20% of enrollees into unsubsidized employment. The law (P.L. 109-365) emphasized placing enrollees into unsubsidized employment, setting minimum percentages for each fiscal year from FY2007 to FY2011. Unlike the prior law, it did not define entry into unsubsidized employment, leaving the Secretary to issue regulations for performance indicators. Title VI authorizes funds for supportive and nutrition services to older Native Americans, with grants awarded directly to tribal organizations representing Native American elders. The 2000 amendments added caregiver support services, including transportation, nutrition, and home care services. P.L. 109-365 allowed tribal organizations to apply for grants for these services. P.L. 109-365 allowed tribal organizations to apply for grants independently or as part of a consortium for various elder care programs, including the long-term care ombudsman program and elder abuse prevention. Funding is allocated based on the state's elderly population. State agencies on aging allocate funds for various organizations to administer activities for the elderly population, with a focus on the long-term care ombudsman program. This program investigates and resolves complaints of residents in nursing facilities and other adult care homes, addressing issues that affect their health, safety, welfare, and rights. In FY2005, the ombudsman program received $78.6 million in funding from various sources, with 58% coming from the Older Americans Act. There were 52 state and territorial programs and 572 local programs, with 1,278 paid staff and over 13,800 volunteers assisting in carrying out ombudsman responsibilities. In FY2005, state and local ombudsman programs handled over 194,000 new resident complaints, with most related to care, rights, and quality of life. P.L. 109-365 authorized grants for elder justice systems to provide public access, coordinate efforts, and standardize data collection on elder justice issues. States receiving grants must develop and implement comprehensive elder justice systems. The Older Americans Act authorized grants for elder justice systems to establish a unified system across states, develop a management information system, and provide education and training. Funding for these programs is provided through appropriations legislation for various departments. In FY2003, administrative authority for the nutrition services incentive grant program was transferred from USDA to AoA. The program retains separate authorization of appropriations under Title III. For FY2006, the program was funded at $1.783 billion, a 2% reduction from FY2005. Most programs received slight decreases in funding, with a major reduction in the Title IV research, training, and discretionary projects program. The Title IV research, training, and discretionary projects program saw a 43% reduction from FY2005 to FY2006 due to earmarked amounts approved for specific projects in FY2005. The Older Americans Act was created in 1965 to address the lack of community social services for older persons. Funding distribution for FY2006 is shown in Figure 1. The Older Americans Act of 1965 established the Administration on Aging to provide grants for community planning, social services, research, and personnel training for older persons. It authorizes various service programs through state and area agencies on aging, supports job creation for low-income older workers, and funds training and research in the field of aging. Prior to the creation of the Older Americans Act in 1965, advocacy groups pushed for formal recognition of the increasing needs of older persons. President Truman initiated the first National Conference on Aging in 1950, leading to the establishment of the Federal Council on Aging by President Eisenhower in 1956. The 1961 White House Conference on Aging further paved the way for legislation like the Older Americans Act. The 1961 White House Conference on Aging called for a federal coordinating agency to be established for aging, with grants for community services for the elderly. Legislation introduced in 1962 and 1963 by Representative Fogarty and Senator McNamara aimed to create an independent U.S. Committee on Aging, but faced objections from the Administration. The 1963 proposal by Representative Fogarty and Senator McNamara aimed to create the Administration in Aging (AoA) within DHEW, under a Commissioner for Aging appointed by the President. The 1965 Older Americans Act, signed into law by President Johnson, authorized grants for community services and research in aging. The Older Americans Act has been amended multiple times since its enactment in 1965, with the most recent changes aimed at providing coordinated services and opportunities for older citizens. Amendments in 1967 extended state grant programs and added research and training programs, while 1969 amendments introduced area-wide model projects and volunteer programs for the elderly. The Older Americans Act underwent major amendments in 1972 and 1973, including the creation of the national nutrition program for the elderly and the establishment of substate area agencies on aging. These changes authorized the creation of local agencies to coordinate services for older persons and advocate for programs on their behalf. Additionally, the amendments created legislative authority for the community service employment program for older Americans. Congress extended the Older Americans Act through 1978 in 1975. In 1975, Congress extended the Older Americans Act through 1978 and consolidated separate grant programs for social services, nutrition services, and senior center facilities into one program under state and area agencies on aging. The 1978 amendments aimed to improve coordination among service programs. The 1981 amendments provided more flexibility to state and area agencies on aging in administering their programs. In 1984, Congress enacted amendments to the Older Americans Act, adding responsibilities for AoA, targeting services on low-income minority older persons, giving more flexibility to states in fund allocations, and prioritizing the needs of Alzheimer's victims and their families. The 1987 amendments expanded certain service components to address special populations and authorized appropriations for in-home services, long-term care ombudsman services, assistance for special needs, health education, services to prevent abuse, neglect, and outreach activities. The 1992 amendments to the Older Americans Act focused on protection of the rights of older persons, including prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It also aimed to give special attention to the needs of older Native Americans and persons with disabilities, and elevate the status of AoA within the Department of Health and Human Services. The 2000 amendments to the Older Americans Act expanded programs for elder abuse prevention, legal assistance, caregiver support, and data collection. These amendments were enacted after six years of congressional debate and extended the act's programs through FY2005. The 2000 amendments to the Older Americans Act expanded programs for elder abuse prevention, legal assistance, caregiver support, and data collection. The amendments allowed states to impose cost-sharing for certain services older persons receive while retaining authority for voluntary contributions. The amendments also required the President to convene a White House Conference on Aging by December 31, 2005. The 2006 amendments extended the act's programs through FY2011 and authorized grants to states for the prevention of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The 2000 amendments to the Older Americans Act expanded programs for elder abuse prevention, legal assistance, caregiver support, and data collection. P.L. 109-365 required AoA and state agencies on aging to focus on comprehensive home and community-based services for older persons. It also authorized funds for Aging and Disability Resource Centers to provide information on long-term care options. The law revised the formula for Title III funds allocation and required increased planning efforts for the growing number of older people in the future. The 2000 amendments to the Older Americans Act expanded programs for elder abuse prevention, legal assistance, caregiver support, and data collection. P.L. 109-365 focused on comprehensive home and community-based services for older persons, including programs for those with limited English proficiency and at risk of institutional placement. It added authority for new demonstration programs under Title IV, such as projects to assist older people to age in place and mental health services. The law also revised the Title V community service employment program to emphasize training and employment of older individuals in community service activities."
