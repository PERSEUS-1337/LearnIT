    "content": "The Act titled \"National Marine Mammal Research Program Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. Congress recognizes the ecological, scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value of marine mammal populations in US waters. Despite progress in understanding human impacts, many populations are still endangered. There is a need to better understand and mitigate the effects of human activities on marine species due to data gaps and scientific uncertainty. Managers face challenges implementing laws like the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act due to insufficient funding for research. The Marine Mammal Commission recommends a research program to study the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals and ecosystems. The Marine Mammal Commission recommends a research program to study the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals and ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of understanding marine mammals for ocean conservation and maintaining US leadership in marine science. The Marine Mammal Commission recommends a research program to study the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammals and ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of understanding marine mammals for ocean conservation and maintaining US leadership in marine science. A National Marine Mammal Research Program is established under the Marine Mammal Protection Act to focus on marine mammal research. The National Marine Mammal Research Program is established by the Commission to improve understanding of marine mammals, their habitats, and threats to their health. The program aims to coordinate research efforts among various entities to ensure marine mammal conservation. The Commission is responsible for resource management, public education, communication, and reporting to Congress. Their duties include implementing policies, supporting the Research Coordinating Committee, supervising the Program Office, preparing annual reports, and conducting program reviews. They have the authority to carry out necessary provisions within available appropriations. The Commission has the authority to enter contracts, make grants, and arrangements to implement the Research Program. They can do so with various entities without reimbursement, performance bonds, or regard to certain statutes. They can also accept voluntary services for the program. The Commission has the authority to establish a National Marine Mammal Research Program Office for the Research Program. The Program Office will have duties assigned by the Commission and will operate under prescribed rules and regulations. The National Marine Mammal Research Program Office will work with the Commission and Research Coordinating Committee to draft program announcements, manage proposal selection criteria, conduct peer reviews, and recommend projects for funding. They will also oversee the solicitation of research proposals, manage peer reviews, and submit annual reports on project status. The National Marine Mammal Research Program Office will draft program announcements, manage proposal selection criteria, conduct peer reviews, recommend projects for funding, oversee research proposals, and submit annual reports on project status to Congress. The National Marine Mammal Research Program Office will provide an outline of planned activities, describe involvement with Federal entities, and detail programs, projects, and estimated expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. The National Marine Mammal Research Program Office will outline planned activities, describe involvement with Federal entities, and detail programs, projects, and estimated expenditures for the upcoming fiscal year. SEC. 222 establishes the National Marine Mammal Research Coordinating Committee. The President, in consultation with the Commission, will establish a National Marine Mammal Research Coordinating Committee composed of representatives from various relevant agencies. The National Marine Mammal Research Coordinating Committee includes representatives from relevant agencies such as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Geological Survey, the Minerals Management Service, the National Academy of Sciences, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Commission. Additionally, one member appointed by the Research Coordinating Committee will represent ocean industries with expertise in marine mammal biology, marine ecology, oceanography, or marine policy. The National Marine Mammal Research Coordinating Committee appoints members to represent State governments, academia, and the marine conservation community with expertise in marine mammal biology, marine ecology, oceanography, or marine policy. The National Marine Mammal Research Coordinating Committee appoints members with expertise in marine mammal biology, marine ecology, oceanography, or marine policy. The Research Coordinating Committee is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Members cannot serve on both the Research Coordinating Committee and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals. The Executive Director of the Marine Mammal Commission is the chairman of the Research Coordinating Committee. The Research Coordinating Committee appoints members with expertise in marine mammal biology, ecology, oceanography, or policy. The committee is chaired by the Executive Director of the Marine Mammal Commission and may create subcommittees to receive input on the national marine mammal research plan. Members serve a 3-year term, filling vacancies for the remainder of the predecessor's term. The committee's responsibilities include overseeing the national marine mammal research plan. The Research Coordinating Committee, chaired by the Executive Director of the Marine Mammal Commission, appoints members with expertise in marine mammal biology, ecology, oceanography, or policy. Responsibilities include developing a national marine mammal research plan, facilitating cooperation among Federal agencies, revising and approving program announcements, estimating funding needed for research activities, and reviewing the research plan every 3 years. Federal departments and agencies involved in the committee have contract and grant authority for interagency financing. The Research Coordinating Committee can use funds for administrative purposes, transfer funds among departments, accept volunteers and gifts, and undergo evaluation by the National Research Council. The Research Coordinating Committee can seek evaluation from the National Research Council on the scientific content and implementation of the Plan. The Executive Director of the Commission must publish the Plan in the Federal Register for a 60-day public comment period. The Research Coordinating Committee will develop a 5-year national marine mammal research plan to enhance understanding of marine mammals, assess human impacts, evaluate conservation measures, improve management strategies, and address research gaps and priorities. The definitions of key terms related to the National Marine Mammal Research Program are provided in this section, including 'Plan', 'Program', 'Program Office', and 'Research Coordinating Committee'. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed in this section. The authorization of appropriations for the National Marine Mammal Research Program is $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2012. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act to include a new subtitle for Marine Mammal Research."
