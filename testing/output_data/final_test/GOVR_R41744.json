    "content": "This report discusses rare earth elements used in Department of Defense (DOD) weapon systems, oversight issues, and options for Congress to consider. Rare earth elements include the lanthanide series of 15 elements on the periodic table, yttrium, and scandium. These elements are difficult and costly to extract but are essential for various technologies. The United States is a major consumer of products containing rare earth elements. The United States was once a leader in global production of rare earths, but production has shifted to China due to lower costs. China's control over rare earths has raised concerns about U.S. dependence on foreign sources. Events like China cutting exports in 2010 have highlighted the potential for disruption in the world's supply of rare earth materials. Congress is concerned about the U.S. dependence on foreign sources for rare earth elements, especially from China. This dependence poses national security risks due to limited domestic production of certain rare earth materials. Congress has mandated assessments to address supply chain vulnerabilities in defense applications. The Secretary of Defense is required to assess and develop a plan to address supply chain vulnerabilities in defense applications, including the restoration of domestic NeFeB magnet production. Revamping the defense supply chain could take 15 years or more. Congress has mandated assessments to address U.S. dependence on foreign sources for rare earth elements and potential national security risks. The bill H.R. 1960 aims to address supply chain vulnerabilities in defense applications, specifically focusing on rare earth elements. It grants the President more authority to conserve critical materials and directs the Secretary of Defense to assess supply chain diversification for rare earth substitutes. The bill passed the House and was referred to the Senate in 2013. The bill H.R. 1960 grants the President more authority to conserve critical materials and directs the Defense Logistics Agency to engage in the market for strategic and critical materials. It includes provisions for the recovery of excess materials and updates the uses of the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. The bill H.R. 1960 grants the President more authority to conserve critical materials and directs the Defense Logistics Agency to engage in the market for strategic and critical materials. It includes provisions for the recovery of excess materials and updates the uses of the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. Section 1412 of the bill provides authority to acquire additional strategic and critical materials for the National Defense Stockpile to meet military, industrial, and essential civilian needs. The National Defense Stockpile Manager may acquire materials like Ferroniobium and Dysprosium using funds from the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. The bill H.R. 1960 grants the President more authority to conserve critical materials and directs the Defense Logistics Agency to engage in the market for strategic and critical materials. It includes provisions for the recovery of excess materials and updates the uses of the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund. Section 1412 of the bill provides authority to acquire additional strategic and critical materials for the National Defense Stockpile to meet military, industrial, and essential civilian needs. The National Defense Stockpile Manager may use up to $41,000,000 for acquisition of specified materials like Ferroniobium, Dysprosium Metal, Yttrium Oxide, Cadmium Zinc Tellurium Substrate Materials, Lithium Ion Precursors, Triamino-Trinitrobenzene, and Insensitive High Explosive Molding Powders. This authority is available for purchases during Fiscal Year 2014 through Fiscal Year 2019. Reporting requirements are also included to address concerns over maintaining a secure access and diverse supply chain for rare earth elements for national security purposes and defense weapon systems. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics must submit a report to Congress by February 1, 2014, outlining a risk mitigation strategy for securing rare earth elements for defense procurement needs. Domestic production can meet demand by fiscal year 2013, except for yttrium, according to a previous report. However, future projections show an increase in consumption of rare earth elements. The Future Years Defense Program predicts a rise in rare earth element consumption post-2013. Each SSN-774 Virginia-class submarine would need 9,200 pounds, each DDG-51 Aegis destroyer 5,200 pounds, and each F-35 Lightning II aircraft 920 pounds of these materials. The Department of Defense plans to secure rare earth supplies through diversification, substitutes, and waste reclamation. The committee directs the Under Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the Department's risk mitigation strategy for rare earth elements, including programs for reclaiming these materials and assessing the cost of production. The Under Secretary of Defense is directed to submit a report on the Department's risk mitigation strategy for rare earth elements, including reclaiming materials, assessing production costs, evaluating suppliers, exploring alternative sources, and diversifying supply activities. The Department of Defense is required to assess the potential for using non-rare earth materials in components of the Joint Strike Fighter due to supply chain challenges with rare earth materials. Concerns exist about how the Department's strategy for securing rare earth elements will be implemented in major defense acquisition programs like the F-35 Lightning II program. The committee directs the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition to submit a report on the potential for substituting components in F-35 aircraft to reduce rare earth material consumption by February 15, 2014. The report should include a list of subsystems containing rare earth elements and an assessment of incorporating substitute components. The report requested by the committee will assess the potential for substituting components in F-35 aircraft to reduce rare earth material consumption. It will include a list of subsystems with rare earth elements and evaluate the feasibility of incorporating substitute components based on technical and cost acceptability. Additionally, two bills, S. 1197 and S. 1600, were introduced in 2013 related to critical minerals policy. The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 aims to enhance domestic critical mineral capabilities in the United States. The bill requires the development of domestic sources of minerals crucial for economic and national security. Another bill, the RARE Act of 2013, focuses on rare earth materials and was introduced to address critical minerals policy. H.R. 981, the RARE Act of 2013, and H.R. 1063, the National Strategic and Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013, were introduced to assess global rare earth element resources and future supply, and to evaluate current and future demands for critical minerals essential for U.S. manufacturing, agricultural competitiveness, and national security. President Obama requested the World Trade Organization's assistance in formal matters related to the United States. The United States, along with Japan and the European Union, has asked the World Trade Organization to facilitate consultations with China over its restrictions on rare-earth exports. The U.S. believes China's limits are illegal and harm American workers and manufacturers. China argues that reducing exports will help address environmental concerns from rare earth mining. Ambassador Kirk stated that the launch of the case against China reflects the Obama Administration's commitment to fair trade. The United States aims to ensure a level playing field for American workers and manufacturers by challenging China's export restraints on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum. China's measures appear to give Chinese manufacturers unfair advantages. China's export restraints on rare earths, tungsten, and molybdenum create unfair advantages for Chinese producers, leading to pressure on U.S. and other non-Chinese downstream producers to move their operations to China. A WTO panel was convened in July 2012 to address these issues, with a final report expected in November. The WTO dispute resolution panel expected a final report on China's export restraints on rare earths by November 2013, but none was issued by December. The DOD's Annual Industrial Capabilities Report in October 2013 noted improvements in the rare earth supply chain issues. Global market forces are positively impacting rare earth supply chains, ensuring a sufficient supply for defense applications. Overall, there has been a significant decrease in demand for rare earth materials since 2011, with forecasts predicting a further decline in demand by 20% in 2016 compared to 2011. This reduction in demand is attributed to the substitution of other materials, decreased usage in various applications, and a drawdown in inventories. Additionally, there has been an increase in the supply of rare earth materials from sources outside of China, leading to a 60% decline in prices from their peak in the summer. Rare earth oxides and metals have decreased by 60% from their 2011 peaks. The supply chain for rare earth materials is expected to strengthen and diversify, with increased exploration and development of processing capabilities. Over 400 rare earth projects are under review globally, with two new projects set to impact markets in 2013. Production has begun in the U.S. and Malaysia, adding 40,000 tons of oxide capacity to global supply, close to one-third of forecasted demand. The Secretary of Defense is required to report to Congress biannually on defense planning and projections for stockpile requirements under national emergency planning assumptions. The report outlines the current state of strategic and critical materials for defense use, including proposed mitigation strategies such as stockpiling, substitution, export reductions, and increasing procurement. A study found that out of 76 materials evaluated, 23 could potentially face shortfalls in production to meet demands, including rare earth elements. The study identified six rare earth element shortfalls: yttrium, dysprosium, erbium, terbium, thulium, and scandium. DOD's report in March 2012 stated that seven rare earth elements met criteria, except for yttrium. By 2012, U.S. production could meet defense needs for rare earths, except for yttrium. DOD uses less than 5% of rare earths in the U.S. and closely monitors the market. The DOD closely monitors the rare earth materials market for any projected shortfalls. If shortages are expected, DOD may seek congressional approval to stockpile materials or use contingency contracting. Rare earth elements are not rare but found in low concentrations in the earth's crust. They are divided into two groups: light rare earth elements (LREE) and heavy rare earth elements. Rare earth elements are divided into two groups: light rare earth elements (LREE) - lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, and samarium, and heavy rare earth elements (HREE) - europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. DOD uses less than 5% of domestic consumption of rare earths. NdFeB magnets are essential to military weapons systems, while SmCo is ideal for technologies like precision-guided missiles and smart bombs. Rare earth elements, particularly neodymium iron boron magnets (NeFeB) and samarium cobalt magnets (SmCo), are crucial in defense weapon systems. China dominates the world's production of rare earths, with 97% of rare earth ore, 97% of rare earth oxides, 89% of rare earth alloys, 75% of NeFeB magnets, and 60% of SmCo magnets. The production process involves mining, separating, refining, alloying, and manufacturing rare earth materials. The stages of rare earth production include mining, separating, refining, alloying, and manufacturing into end-use items and components. The United States was a leader in rare earth production and magnet research from the 1960s to the 1980s, but production has since shifted to China due to lower costs. Production has shifted primarily to China for rare earth metals due to lower costs. The United States lacks the capacity to process rare earths domestically, with only limited production of certain alloys and magnets. Additional rare earth elements needed for magnets are not produced in the U.S. The United States lacks the capacity to process rare earths domestically, with only limited production of certain alloys and magnets. Electron Energy Corporation (EEC) in Landisville, PA, produces samarium cobalt (SmCo) permanent magnets, while Hitachi Metals, Ltd. of Japan produces neodymium iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets in North Carolina. Electron Energy Corporation (EEC) in China Grove, North Carolina imports magnet alloys from China for its production of SmCo permanent magnets. The United States is heavily reliant on imports for rare earth elements (REEs) due to underinvestment in domestic supply chain capacity. This dependency on a sole source, primarily China, highlights the need for investments in mining, separation, and alloying facilities in the U.S. The United States heavily relies on imports for rare earth elements (REEs), with China dominating the global supply chain. China produces the majority of REE raw materials and metals, as well as manufacturing magnets and other components. Even if U.S. rare earth production increases, much of the processing and fabrication would still occur in China. This highlights the need for investments in domestic mining, separation, and alloying facilities. Investors believe developing rare earth element (REE) mining operations alone is insufficient without building refining, metal production, and alloying capacity for manufacturing military components. Vertically-integrated companies are preferred for securing investor financing. Joint ventures and consortiums could support production at various supply chain stages globally. U.S. firms and allies investing strategically is crucial for a stable REE supply chain. Most experts predict new mining capacity for rare earths, but it's crucial to know where downstream capacity is being built. Questions for Congress include developing skills for downstream production in the US and potential international educational exchanges. Molycorp's Mountain Pass mine was a dominant rare earth oxide source from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. Molycorp's rare earth production was driven by higher grade, low cost, and rising demand for LREEs like europium and cerium. However, due to China's dominance in rare earth supply, Molycorp ceased production in 2002. Under new ownership since 2008, Molycorp aims to revive US rare earth production with a \"mine to magnet\" business model. Chevron sold off its non-energy Molycorp Mountain Pass asset to investor groups in 2008, who did not inherit the environmental liability from a pipeline spill. Molycorp, under new ownership, focused on minimizing their environmental footprint during the separation phase of their proprietary oxide separation process at the Mountain Pass mine. They designed a process that used fewer reagents, recycled waste water, and eliminated the need for a disposal pond. The new separation facility was constructed in 2011. Molycorp broke ground for a new separation facility at the Mountain Pass mine in 2011, aiming to use less ore for the same end product. They acquired Santoku America and renamed it Molycorp Metals and Alloys, focusing on NdFeB and SmCo alloy production. Molycorp also purchased a majority interest in AS Silmet to expand metal production. Molycorp recently acquired a majority interest in AS Silmet, now Molycorp Silmet, to double its rare earth oxide and metal production capacity. The company is also exploring metal recycling, particularly focusing on magnets and heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium. Testing the quality of recyclable materials and evaluating the economics are crucial for the success of the project. Additionally, Molycorp is looking into near-term opportunities for energy recycling. Molycorp is evaluating opportunities to recycle energy efficient light bulbs for phosphors and has entered into a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory to study new methods for creating commercial-grade permanent magnets. Development of downstream activities like refining and manufacturing will require significant financing and a skilled workforce. Recruiting top talent in engineering, science, and finance is a priority for the company to achieve its plans for vertical integration. Molycorp's recent supply chain developments include acquiring Neo Materials Technology, Inc., a Toronto-based firm with rare earth processing facilities in China. Concerns have been raised about potential Chinese export restrictions on these materials. Molycorp also has a joint venture in Japan for manufacturing rare earth magnets. Lynas and Siemens have a joint venture for manufacturing magnets used in wind turbine generators. Lynas will provide raw material from their Mt. Weld mine in Australia to Siemens. Lynas processes the concentrate at its Malaysian facility, facing concerns over thorium disposal. GWMG and China's Ganzhau Qiandong Rare Earth Group plan to build an oxide separation facility in South Africa using raw material from GWMG's SKK mine. Feasibility study is ongoing. Frontier Rare Earths and Korea Resources Corp. are conducting a feasibility study for a separation facility in South Africa. China's control over rare earth production has led to concerns among U.S. policymakers regarding export restrictions. China has significantly reduced its export quotas for rare earth elements in recent years. China announced quota levels for the second half of 2011, making the overall quota for the year similar to 2010. However, U.S. officials criticized China's new quota levels, which included restrictions on ferroalloys with more than 10% rare earths. The U.S. Trade Representative expressed concerns about China's export restrictions on raw materials, including rare earths. In response, China stated that it would apply the same policies to both domestic and overseas companies in rare earth production. Additionally, China imposes export tariffs of 15% to 25% on rare earth. In 2010, China delayed rare earth shipments to Japan due to a territorial dispute, raising concerns about China using rare earth control as leverage. The Chinese government has implemented initiatives to regulate rare earth mining and exporting to manage resources, ensure stable prices, and reduce pollution. Critics argue that China's policies aim to attract foreign high-technology industries. Critics argue that China's rare earth policies aim to attract foreign high-technology and green technology firms to move production facilities to China, provide preferential treatment to Chinese high-tech and green energy companies, and boost their global competitiveness. Some urge the USTR to bring a WTO dispute resolution case against China, similar to a 2009 case over export restrictions on certain raw materials. China's export restraints on raw materials, including steel, aluminum, and chemicals, are aimed at giving Chinese firms an unfair competitive advantage. Despite China's claims of environmental conservation, a WTO panel ruled in July 2011 that many of these restraints violate WTO rules. China is appealing the ruling. China is appealing the WTO panel's ruling on export restraints. Senators urged the Obama Administration to oppose new financing for rare earth projects in China. Concerns arise over Molycorp's ability to supply U.S. defense needs for rare earths. The Department of Defense (DOD) has not publicly stated whether rare earth minerals are considered strategic or critical for U.S. defense needs. Definitions of strategic materials vary, with disagreement over which rare earth elements fall within these categories. Strategic and critical materials are typically associated with national security purposes, with historical legislative references dating back to the late 1930s. DOD's current stance on strategic materials is influenced by past legislation. The Strategic Materials Protection Board (SMPB) determines the need for a domestic supply of critical materials for national security. The board meets every two years, but no meeting was held in December 2010. The SMPB defines critical materials based on their importance in DOD applications and the impact of not having a domestic supply source. The 2008 SMPD report identified beryllium as a critical material essential for national security. High purity beryllium is crucial for defense systems like sensors, missiles, satellites, avionics, and nuclear weapons. DOD's involvement is necessary to sustain the market and prevent supply disruptions. Without DOD support, U.S. industry would not be able to provide beryllium for defense applications. The Department has taken special action to maintain a domestic supply of high purity beryllium for defense applications by contracting with U.S. firm Brush-Wellman, Inc. to build and operate a new production plant. The House Armed Services Committee criticized the definition of critical materials, stating that it limits the purview of the Board and fails to consider materials not explicitly defined. The definition of critical materials fails to include materials designated as critical to national security by Congress, such as titanium, specialty steel, and high performance magnets. This limits the Board's ability to assess policies and take action until national security is at risk. The current definition of critical materials does not consider materials critical to national security, such as titanium, specialty steel, and high performance magnets. This hinders the Board's ability to assess policies and take action when national security is at risk. The committee finds the Board's identification of only one material as critical to national security implausible and urges a reevaluation of the definition to identify gaps in the defense supply chain. This information is crucial for providing advice to the President, Secretary of Defense, and Congress on strategic materials essential for Department of Defense operations. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the U.S. reliance on foreign sources for rare earth elements, particularly China's dominance in the industry. The issue is not just China's export restrictions but also the loss of domestic production capacity and the migration of the manufacturing supply chain outside the U.S. Some Members of Congress are worried about the U.S. dependence on foreign rare earth elements, especially China's control. Concerns include supply chain vulnerability for defense systems and lack of knowledge on strategic materials for national security. In 2011, three Members of Congress urged the Secretary of Defense to address the issue of rare earth supply limitations, highlighting a potential threat to national security. The DOD is still working to understand its consumption of rare earth elements for defense supply chain security. It is crucial for DOD Industrial Policy to have detailed knowledge of rare earth components in weapon systems. The Department should require contractors to provide this information for overall demand assessment. The Department of Defense is analyzing rare earth element supply and demand to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain and establish policies for security. The lack of U.S. presence in the global rare earth supply chain was highlighted in a 2010 GAO report. The United States lacks a domestic rare earth supply chain, with most processing now done in China, giving them a dominant position. Rebuilding a U.S. supply chain may take up to 15 years and is dependent on securing investments, developing new technologies, and acquiring patents. The United States lacks a domestic rare earth supply chain, with most processing done in China, giving them a dominant position. The Department of Defense (DOD) is assessing potential supply chain vulnerabilities and national security risks related to rare earth materials. The 2009 report to Congress highlighted the need for further study on the rare earth supply issue. The global push for fuel efficiency and substitutes for hydrocarbon fuels will increase demand for specialty metals and super alloys used in battery manufacturing. These metals are not typically mined in the US and EU, posing a strategic concern for resource access. The US Department of Energy's 2010 report on rare earths in renewable energy technologies sheds light on the DOD's efforts to review the rare earth supply chain. The DOD initiated a review of the U.S. rare earth supply chain in 2009 due to market evolution and concerns over dependence on non-domestic suppliers. The study assesses gaps in the supply chain for both commercial and defense demand, highlighting the importance of rare earth elements in defense applications and potential strain on global supplies. The Department of Defense (DOD) initiated a review of the U.S. rare earth supply chain in 2009 due to concerns over dependence on non-domestic suppliers and potential strain on global supplies. Recent events have reinforced the concern regarding reliable and secure supplies of rare earth elements (REE) for both commercial and defense purposes. Discussions on the criticality of REE for economic and national security purposes have been ongoing since 2007, involving experts from various federal agencies. The White House discussed the importance of rare earth strategy, highlighting the gap between the U.S. and China in rare earth research. Dr. Stephan Freiman presented findings on critical minerals to the House Committee on Science and Technology. The Colorado School of Mines is a key academic resource for rare earth studies. The NRC sponsored a study on critical mineral impacts on the U.S. economy, recommending federal agencies to fund activities for U.S. innovation in critical minerals, enhance global mineral understanding, and support scientific research on the mineral life cycle. Cooperation among academia, industry, and government was also encouraged for education and applied research. Congress may consider short-range and long-range options to secure rare earth elements for U.S. national security interests, including hearings on the \"Section 843\" rare earths report, establishing stockpiles, and reducing DOD consumption by finding alternatives and forming partnerships with foreign allies. Congress could require DOD to release a long-overdue self-assessment on the defense rare earth supply chain and hold hearings to examine the assessment and conclusions. They could also meet with defense suppliers to assess material shortages and bottlenecks in the supply chain. The rare earth elements are crucial in the supply chain from prime contractors to subcontractors in the defense industry. Some lower-tier contractors may hesitate to report supply chain issues to the DOD. Understanding the convergence between the rare earth and defense supply chains is important. The rare earth supply chain involves mining, processing, and manufacturing into the final product, while the defense supply chain starts with prime contractors and goes down to the first line processor. Congress could mandate DOD to convene the Strategic Materials Protection Board for further assessment. The Strategic Materials Protection Board (SMPB) defined critical materials based on their importance in DOD applications and the likelihood of supply disruption. Beryllium was identified as a \"strategic material critical to national security.\" Congress may convene the board to reassess the criticality of rare earth elements for national security purposes. The Strategic Materials Protection Board (SMPB) will use the new definition of \"materials critical to national security\" from the FY2011 NDAA. Congress could require a strategic rare earth elements stockpile to increase domestic supply security. Consideration may be given to creating a \"virtual\" stockpile database with supplier contracts. The USMMA advocates for a strategic reserve of rare earth alloys, metals, and magnets to ensure national security and domestic manufacturing. The Department of Defense needs access to rare earth oxides from reliable producers in the US and ally nations. Congress could determine material shortfalls and stages of action. Congress may consider funding rare earth application sciences in curriculums for military and government institutes to build U.S. leadership in rare earth research. A new Critical Minerals Program could be instituted to address potential supply shortages and protect strategic materials. In the 1990s, a program to mitigate supply shocks ended as Congress believed the market could handle disruptions. In 2010, there were discussions about reviving a national minerals and materials policy to support research and development for rare earths. Based on the need for increased research and development to address the rare earth shortage, Congress may encourage DOD to pursue joint ventures with other nations to reduce dependence on China. It is crucial for DOD to consider the implications of sourcing from partner nations to ensure security of supply. Some Members of Congress have introduced rare-earth related bills. Some Members of Congress have introduced rare-earth related bills during the 112th and 111th Congresses, focusing on national defense issues. One such bill, H.R. 3310, was part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 and included provisions appointing an Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy as Chair of the Strategic Materials Protection Board. This bill aimed to ensure the security of the rare earth supply chain. The Board's findings will be reviewed by the Secretary of Defense and congressional defense committees, and published in the Federal Register within 90 days. The Office of the Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy will oversee the defense supply chain to ensure no vulnerabilities, focusing on reliable sources of critical materials for national security. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a national security strategy for the national technology and industrial base, prioritizing risks and challenges to the defense supply chain. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 prioritized risks and challenges to the defense supply chain, ensuring reliable sources of critical materials for national security and reducing counterfeit parts. The bill did not include a provision on rare earths, but the Senate Rept. 112-173 highlighted the essential role of rare earth materials in critical weapons components and systems. The committee emphasizes the reliance on unreliable foreign sources, particularly China, for rare earth materials crucial to national defense applications. There is a need for a thorough understanding of vulnerabilities in the rare earth supply chain and the development of risk mitigation plans to reduce supply interruptions. The Department of Defense is encouraged to address these issues. The committee urges the Department of Defense to consider U.S. producers for reliable domestic rare earth materials. Legislation requires the Secretary of Defense to assess supply chain issues and report to Congress within 180 days. The assessment would identify critical rare earth materials for US military equipment, develop a plan for their long-term availability by 2015, consider inclusion in the National Defense Stockpile, and address trade practices limiting their availability. The assessment includes evaluating the availability of financing for industry, academia, and non-profit entities to ensure material availability, assessing the benefits of Defense Production Act funding for military components, evaluating funding for research and development, and implementing other risk mitigation methods to establish a secure material supply by December 31, 2015. The National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2012 aimed to develop domestic sources of minerals important for U.S. economic and national security. The Defense Supply Chain and Industrial Base Security Act focused on ensuring a secure material supply by December 31, 2015. H.R. 2184, Rare Earth Policy Task Force and Materials Act, introduced by Representative Mike Coffman on June 15, 2011, aims to establish a Rare Earth Policy Task Force within the Department of the Interior to ensure the long-term supply of rare earth materials. The Task Force would review laws and policies to encourage investment in domestic rare earths and submit an annual report with a research plan. The bill H.R. 2090, Energy Critical Elements Advancement Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Randy Hultgren, aims to establish a research program for energy critical elements. It requires the Secretaries of Energy and Interior to advance basic materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering associated with these elements. H.R. 2011, National Strategic and Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Doug Lamborn, requires the Secretary of the Interior to assess the U.S.' capability to meet mineral demands for manufacturing competitiveness and national security. The bill also evaluates federal lands' mineral potential and requirements for economic and national security needs. The bill, H.R. 2011, aims to assess the U.S.' capability to meet mineral demands for manufacturing competitiveness and national security. It also includes conducting an inventory of rare earth elements and critical minerals to address potential supply disruptions and set policy goals for federal agencies to coordinate responsibilities in facilitating domestic mineral resources development. H.R. 2284, Responsible Electronic Recycling Act, aims to establish a Rare Earth Materials Recycling Initiative for electronic devices.

Section 835 of H.R. 1540 requires the DLA Administrator to develop an inventory of rare earth materials for defense needs. Amendment #87 calls for a report on recycling rare earth elements, including fluorescent lighting in DOD facilities. H.R. 1540 passed the House and was referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. S. 734, the Advanced Vehicle Technology Act of 2011, focuses on research programs within the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy (DOE) is creating a research program for new vehicle technologies, focusing on substitutes and recycling of critical materials. Legislation such as H.R. 1367 and H.R. 1314 aim to promote advanced vehicle technology and assess rare earth resources. The Energy Critical Elements Renewal Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Brad Miller, aims to develop a program for rare earth materials and amend existing policies. Senator Mark Udall introduced the Critical Minerals and Materials Promotion Act of 2011 to address the criticality and impact of potential supply restrictions on minerals. Senator Mark Udall introduced the Critical Minerals and Materials Promotion Act of 2011 on February 17, 2011. The bill aims to assess and strengthen domestic critical mineral supply chains for clean energy technologies, enhance education in mineral science and engineering, and promote a stable supply of critical minerals for national security and economic well-being. The Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2011, introduced by Representative Leonard Boswell, aims to develop a rare earth materials program and revitalize domestic production in the United States. The Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2011, introduced by Senator Lisa Murkowski, seeks to address critical minerals policy and was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The bill aims to establish a methodology for identifying critical minerals and conducting a resource assessment in the United States. It also proposes the creation of a Critical Minerals Working Group to streamline the permitting process for mineral development and produce an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook report. The bill proposes the establishment of a Critical Minerals Working Group to support a fully integrated supply chain in the United States. It recommends mineral-specific actions for various elements and authorizes $106 million for appropriation. In the 111th Congress, two bills were enacted that impacted rare earth policy, including requirements for GAO to examine rare earths in the defense supply chain. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for FY2011 requires an assessment of the supply chain for rare earth materials and the development of a plan to address any vulnerabilities. Another bill, the Rare Earths Supply-Chain Technology and Resources Transformation Act of 2010, aims to establish a Critical Minerals Working Group to support a fully integrated supply chain in the United States. The bill H.R. 4866 aimed to establish a federal interagency working group to assess the rare earth supply chain for national security. It would have stockpiled critical rare earth elements and allowed purchases from China if necessary, terminating stockpiling when deemed appropriate. The Rare Earths and Critical Materials Revitalization Act of 2010, introduced by Representative Kathleen Dahlkemper, aimed to develop a rare earth materials program and provide loan guarantees to revitalize domestic production in the United States. The bill was passed by the House and forwarded to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
