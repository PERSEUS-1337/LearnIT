SEC. 45G. SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH INSURANCE EXPENSES: An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows small businesses to claim credits for health insurance expenses. The amendment allows small employers to claim a health insurance credit equal to a percentage of expenses paid for coverage under a new health plan for employees. The applicable percentage is 40% for insurance purchased through a health benefit purchasing coalition and 30% for other insurance. The expenses for employee insurance coverage are limited to $800 for self-only and $2,000 for family coverage if purchased through a coalition, and $600 for self-only and $1,500 for family coverage otherwise. If an employee is covered by a new health plan for only part of the year, the limits are prorated. The employer must bear at least 65 percent of the cost of health insurance coverage for expenses to be taken into account under subsection (a) for a 4-year period. Definitions for \"health insurance coverage\" and \"new health plan\" are provided in this section. The term 'new health plan' refers to an employer arrangement providing health insurance coverage to employees, meeting specific criteria including not being established in the previous two taxable years and covering at least 70% of qualified employees. The term 'qualified employee' includes any employee of an employer, including leased employees. A 'small employer' is defined as having 100 employees instead of 50, with only qualified employees considered. Special rules apply, similar to section 52, and no amounts paid under salary reduction arrangements are included. The amount paid under a salary reduction arrangement is considered for taxation. Dollar amounts in subsections (c)(1) and (d)(2)(B) are adjusted for inflation annually. The section does not apply to expenses paid. The section does not apply to expenses paid by an employer for any arrangement established after January 1, 2010. Additionally, a health insurance credit for small employers is included in the general business credit, with no carryback of the credit before the effective date. The unused business credit for any taxable year related to the employee health insurance expenses credit cannot be carried back before January 1, 2004. Section 280C of the Code denies a double benefit by disallowing a deduction for expenses used to determine the credit under section 45G. Persons in controlled groups are treated as a single employer for this purpose. The employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 is treated as 1 person for purposes of this section. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003, for arrangements established after the enactment of this Act. The new section allows for a refundable health insurance costs credit for uninsured individuals. The new section allows for a refundable health insurance costs credit for uninsured individuals, with a limit of $500 for qualified health insurance paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year for themselves, spouse, and dependents. Qualified health insurance is defined as health insurance coverage as per section 9832(b)(1), and the credit amount reduces the medical expense deduction for the taxpayer. The new section provides a refundable health insurance costs credit of up to $500 for uninsured individuals. The credit reduces the medical expense deduction for the taxpayer if they elect not to claim deductions under other sections. No credit is allowed for individuals eligible for deductions under other sections. The new section provides a refundable health insurance costs credit of up to $500 for uninsured individuals.

The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003."
