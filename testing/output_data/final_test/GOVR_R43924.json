    "content": "The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows public access to federal government information without requiring justification from the requestor. Access is limited only by nine statutory exemptions, including national defense information and agency internal rules. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows public access to federal government information through nine statutory exemptions, including trade secrets, personal privacy, law enforcement records, and financial information. These exemptions aim to prevent the disclosure of specific types of records. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has been amended multiple times, most recently by the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009. In March of 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder distributed a memorandum emphasizing transparency in FOIA administration, instructing agencies to disclose information proactively and not withhold information unnecessarily. The Department of Justice will defend a denial of a FOIA request only if disclosure would harm a protected interest or is prohibited by law. The new policy, known as \"the presumption of openness,\" departs from the previous administration's stance on FOIA implementation. Members of Congress are considering further amendments to address this and other issues. The 114th Congress considered amendments to FOIA to improve electronic accessibility of agency records. Two bills, S. 337 and H.R. 653, address similar issues with some differences. For example, H.R. 653 allows inspectors general to review FOIA compliance, while the Senate bill does not. The House legislation, H.R. 653, limits Exemption 5 scope, includes provisions for agency communication on record release, and mandates FOIA-related training for employees. In contrast, Senate bill S. 337 lacks specific details on Exemption 5 limitations and the prescribed process for agency communication. Senator John Cornyn introduced the FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 (S. 337) on February 2, 2015, and the Judiciary Committee reported the bill on February 9, 2015. The bill aims to place more requirements and standards on federal agencies, including extensions for providing records and notice requirements for requesters. Amendments to the House and Senate bills made them more similar in some areas, aligning provisions for FOIA-related search or duplication fees. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 (S. 337) and the FOIA Act (H.R. 653) were introduced in Congress in 2015. Both bills address similar topics with some differences in approach. H.R. 653 was passed in the House and referred to the Senate, while S. 337 passed the Senate but has been held in the House since 2016. No further action has been taken on either bill. Table 1 compares S. 337 and H.R. 653, showing amendments made to the bills. The bills are grouped into categories like Presumption of Openness, FOIA Administration, Oversight, and Reporting. The legislation (H.R. 653 and S. 337) includes provisions on oversight entities, reporting requirements, and new roles for the Office of Government Information Services and Chief FOIA Officers. These bills aim to make changes to FOIA moving forward. Both S. 337 and H.R. 653 aim to codify the \"presumption of openness\" standard set by the Obama Administration in FOIA implementation. This may limit future Presidents' discretion in changing the level of openness. The legislation also grants OGIS the authority to report directly to Congress and make legislative recommendations independently. The legislative recommendations in the 114th Congress aim to limit presidential authority over agency recommendations by prohibiting the application of Exemption 5 of FOIA to records older than 25 years. Records of historical value are to be transferred to NARA for permanent preservation after 30 years, and NARA does not apply Exemption 5 to these records. The amendments proposed by S. 337 and H.R. 653 aim to restrict the application of Exemption 5 of FOIA to records older than 25 years. NARA does not consult with agencies regarding the release of records transferred to them for permanent preservation. H.R. 653 goes further than S. 337 by removing an agency's ability to apply Exemption 5 to certain types of records. The proposed amendments aim to limit the application of Exemption 5 of FOIA to records older than 25 years, potentially making federal records more accessible to the public. However, this could also hinder candid discussions among federal employees involved in decision-making processes. The bills H.R. 653 and S. 337 propose establishing a Chief FOIA Officers Council, led by federal employees from DOJ's Office of Information Policy and OGIS. This council would be similar to other interagency management councils like the CAOC, CFOC, CIOC, PIC, PMC, and PMAB, all restricted to federal employees. Currently, a FOIA Advisory Committee includes both federal and private members focusing on similar issues. The bills H.R. 653 and S. 337 propose establishing a Chief FOIA Officers Council, led by federal employees from DOJ's Office of Information Policy and OGIS. This council would be complementary to the existing FOIA Advisory Committee, which includes both federal and private members. The Director of OIP and the Director of OGIS would sit on both the committee and the council, ensuring a unique role for each entity. Both bills could create barriers to agencies charging search and duplication fees beyond a certain timeline, addressing the ongoing debate on agency fee administration. The bills H.R. 653 and S. 337 aim to establish a Chief FOIA Officers Council and address fee assessments for missed deadlines. Amendments to H.R. 653 require agencies to provide detailed explanations of FOIA fees to requesters. The legislation being considered by the 114th Congress aims to address concerns about large FOIA fees by requiring agencies to detail costs for searching, reviewing records, and hours spent. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2014 and FOIA Act of 2015 were introduced in the Senate and House, respectively, to improve FOIA processes. The FOIA Act (H.R. 1211) was introduced in the 114th Congress by Representative Darrell Issa. It aimed to promote transparency in the federal government by establishing a presumption of openness. The legislation passed the House unanimously in 2014, with key provisions including a single portal for FOIA requests and a more independent role for OGIS in FOIA implementation. H.R. 1211 did not change Exemption 5 use. It proposed a pilot program for OMB to review the centralized portal for FOIA requests. The current legislation in the 114th Congress includes a consolidated portal without a pilot program. H.R. 653 aligns more closely with its Senate counterpart than H.R. 1211 did in the 113th Congress."
