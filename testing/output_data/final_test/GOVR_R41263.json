    "content": "Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China (ROC), has successfully transitioned from authoritarian rule to self-government, human rights, and democracy. The CRS report aims to discuss Taiwan's transformation, current concerns, and the role of Congress in shaping U.S. policy towards the island. Taiwan's journey towards democracy began with its first direct presidential election in 1996, following centuries of foreign influences on the island. The Qing Empire incorporated Taiwan as a province in 1885. Under the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. Japan ruled Taiwan as a colony until the end of World War II in 1945. The Kuomintang (KMT) claimed sovereignty over Taiwan in 1945. Chiang Kai-shek dominated the KMT and ROC's political and military power until his death in 1975. After losing the civil war to the Communist Party of China in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan and ruled the local people. After Chiang Kai-shek's death in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo became the KMT chairman and ROC president until his death in 1988. Lee Teng-hui succeeded him and won Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, marking a significant moment for the Taiwanese people who had felt oppressed under KMT rule. Taiwan has never been ruled by the CPC regime from mainland China, leading to complex political divisions and unresolved sovereign status. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) plays a significant role in Taiwan's political landscape. Taiwan's political landscape has been shaped by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT). The United States has a vested interest in a peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status, as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. The U.S. policy on Taiwan emphasizes peaceful resolution, democratic transition, and security through arms sales and business ties, despite ending the mutual defense treaty with the ROC in 1979. The U.S. policy on Taiwan focuses on peaceful resolution, democratic transition, and security through arms sales and business ties. U.S. support has increased Taiwan's security and confidence to carry out policies that align with U.S. interests. Taiwan's democracy and human rights record influence the level of U.S. support, including arms sales for self-defense. Representative Henry Hyde highlighted Taiwan as a successful model of Chinese democracy compatible with Chinese culture, strengthening support in the U.S. Congress. Representative James Leach, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, expressed pride in authoring the TRA's human rights section and highlighted Taiwan's peaceful democratic transition as significant. President Bush called Taiwan a \"beacon of democracy\" during the 2008 presidential election. Taiwan's role in promoting U.S. values in Asia is recognized, with some in Congress considering Taiwan's voices for self-determination and democracy. Taiwan's unfinished story in promoting rule of law and maintaining a strong multi-party system has implications for U.S. economic, political, and security interests. Congress has actively supported Taiwan's democratic reform due to past authoritarian abuses by the KMT. The mutual suspicion between the KMT and DPP has led to polarized partisan battles, hindering effective governance and consensus-building. Good governance and rule of law in Taiwan impact U.S. businesses, as Taiwan is the 10th largest trading partner of the United States. Taiwan, the 10th largest trading partner of the United States in 2009, is focused on professionalizing its military and strengthening its democracy to guard against undue influence from the People's Republic of China. A sustainable democracy in Taiwan helps maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait and aligns the country strategically with the United States and its allies. Successive U.S. presidents have supported Taiwan as an ally. Successive U.S. presidents have supported Taiwan as an ally against Communist movements in mainland China. The U.S. military worked with Taiwan's military through various agreements and assistance programs. One officer assigned to Taiwan from 1973 to 1976 believed that the military justice system was generally fair. The Taiwan Garrison Command tried defendants for alleged civilian crimes, including executing 12 people for robbery in two months in December 1975. The State Department's witness testified at a congressional hearing on human rights in Taiwan in June 1977, acknowledging improvements but also highlighting problematic practices such as torture, harsh treatment of detainees, surveillance of dissidents' associates, lengthy detentions without charges, and limited freedoms of speech and press. During the Martial Law era in Taiwan, there were around 9,000 political prisoners, military trials lacked due process, and elections were unrepresentative. An American in Taiwan in 1984 witnessed excessive security forces responding to a non-protest meeting. KMT forces from mainland China occupied Taiwan after Japan's surrender in 1945. In 1947, KMT agents accused a woman of tax evasion in Taipei. The Monopoly Bureau accused a woman of tax evasion and seized her stock and money, leading to a violent confrontation with agents and bystanders. Protestors marched to the Bureau, resulting in further violence and martial law being declared in the city. Chiang Kai-shek sent reinforcements from the mainland, leading to indiscriminate violence against civilians and targeted executions of educated elites seeking reform. In the aftermath of the violent confrontation in Taiwan, thousands of people were killed in what was known as the \"March Massacre.\" Mainland Chinese forces were reported to be terrorizing local Formosans, with an estimated 5,000-10,000 deaths in March alone. The total number of victims, including those detained, tortured, or executed, could have reached 20,000. It wasn't until 1996 when President Lee Teng-hui offered an apology and compensation to an estimated 30,000 victims. In 1979, dissidents in Kaohsiung led a massive protest in response to the KMT's actions. In response to the KMT's postponement of parliamentary elections in 1979 and to rally for Human Rights Day, the KMT authorities cracked down on protestors in Taiwan, detaining opposition leaders and suspected politically motivated murders. The United States urged the KMT government to restrain its repression after the Kaohsiung Incident, and in January 1980, David Dean of the American Institute in Taiwan visited Taipei to argue against death penalties for demonstrators. President Chiang Ching-kuo decided against death sentences. During the political crisis in Taiwan, the United States supported democratization efforts and urged the KMT government to refrain from using death sentences on demonstrators. Defense lawyers, including Chen Shui-bian, fought against military trials sentencing dissidents to jail. Shih Ming-teh, a former dissident, later became Chairman of the DPP. Calls for full disclosure of information related to the Kaohsiung Incident persist in Taiwan. U.S. efforts, including quiet diplomacy and congressional criticism, had limited effectiveness. In the 1980s, U.S. efforts to influence the KMT regime's human rights abuses had limited effectiveness. Congressional hearings in 1981 revealed the death of Professor Wen-chen Chen, a Taiwan-born professor in the U.S., who was allegedly murdered by Taiwan's security agents. The widow of Taiwan-born professor Wen-chen Chen alleged murder, disputing Taiwan's claim of suicide. The U.S. expressed concern to Taiwan and the FBI opened an investigation into Chen's case. Taiwan Garrison Command interrogated Chen for alleged anti-KMT activities using recordings of his phone calls and speeches in Pittsburgh. Representative Jim Leach raised concerns about the infiltration of American universities by informants reporting to the Taiwan Government. Leach supported the FBI's investigation, citing massive violations of U.S. law by Taiwanese officials. In a high-profile case in the United States, Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau allegedly ordered the killing of American citizen and author Henry Liu in Daly City, CA, in October 1984. Liu's death was deemed a political assassination by his widow. The FBI investigated the shooting, leading to the arrest of military intelligence officials in Taiwan for Liu's murder. Admiral Wang Hsi-ling of the Military Intelligence Bureau collaborated with Chen Chi-li of the Bamboo Gang to carry out covert operations against anti-KMT individuals and groups worldwide, including killings. The U.S. National Security Agency recorded incriminating phone calls between Taiwan and California regarding covert operations against anti-KMT individuals. President Chiang was shocked by Liu's murder and concerned about its impact on U.S. support for Taiwan. Ya-ping Lee, a Taiwanese newspaper publisher in California, was arrested in Taiwan for violating the Anti-Sedition Act but was released after 10 days with a two-year probation. Members of Congress and the State Department requested her release. In 1985, President Chiang Ching-kuo of Taiwan began planning political reforms partly due to the shock of Henry Liu's murder in the United States. Concerns were raised by some Members of Congress and the State Department about freedom of the press and speech violations in the U.S. Representative Stephen Solarz warned that Lee's arrest in Taiwan could strain U.S.-Taiwan ties and impact arms sales. Opposition forces in 1986 held rallies against Martial Law in Taipei, with security forces allowing political meetings where banned books about Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo were sold. President Chiang allowed the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to form in 1986 before ending Martial Law in 1987. In 1991, the DPP amended its platform to advocate for a \"Republic of Taiwan\" and the use of referendums. Representative Solarz urged government restraint, stating that cracking down on parties advocating Taiwan independence would violate human rights. In 1992, Taiwan elected a new Legislative Yuan without the KMT returning old members. In 1996, Taiwan held its first direct democratic election for the presidency, with the KMT's Lee Teng-hui winning. Subsequent presidential elections in 2000 and 2008 saw the DPP's Chen Shui-bian and the KMT's Lien Chan also winning, marking Taiwan's first democratic transfer of power after decades of KMT rule. In 2004, Chen Shui-bian won re-election in Taiwan with a narrow margin of victory, amidst controversy over an alleged assassination attempt. In 2008, Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT won the presidential election with a significant lead over the DPP's Frank Hsieh. President Ma focused on fighting corruption and improving the rule of law in Taiwan, leading to a relatively low corruption ranking by Transparency International. Taiwan was ranked 34th out of 180 countries. In 2007, Taiwan was ranked 34th in Transparency International's corruption index, improving to 39th in 2008 and 37th in 2009. President Ma Ying-jeou emphasized modernization should include freedom and democracy, proud that Taiwan achieved these pillars. His administration focused on democracy, rule of law, human rights, and ratified UN covenants. Ma also highlighted his efforts in combating corruption during his presidency. In May 2010, an opinion poll showed that 73% viewed President Ma as clean, while 6% saw him as corrupt. Concerns persist about Taiwan's need for democratic reforms. Events since 2008 have raised media scrutiny. Ma Ying-jeou resumed dialogue across the Taiwan Strait in 2008 but faced questions about policing protestors. Chen Yunlin visited Taiwan in 2008 for talks with Chiang Pin-kung, sparking protests. During Chen's visit to Taiwan, heavy police presence sparked protests from the opposition DPP and others, who criticized the government for prioritizing Chen's security over the liberties of Taiwan's people. The police confiscated flags, set up checkpoints, and shut down a music store playing pro-Taiwan music. This led to a confrontation between riot police and around 2,000 protestors, including DPP politicians. During Chen Yunlin's visit to Taiwan, riot police and around 2,000 protestors, including DPP politicians, trapped KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and Chen Yunlin inside a hotel during a banquet. Tens of thousands protested, leading to calls for independent investigations into police violence and government handling of dissent. President Ma acknowledged the need for improvement in security bureau and police agency actions. The Heritage Foundation examined conflicting reports of the events, while even KMT Mayor Jason Hu warned against violating the constitution during Chen's next visit in 2009. President Ma Ying-jeou defended the detention of former President Chen Shui-bian, stating it showed judicial neutrality. The case has sparked debate in Taiwan, with some supporting the charges of corruption, while others criticize selective application of anti-corruption measures against DPP politicians. Both parties have faced allegations of corruption and misuse of expense accounts. Former President Chen Shui-bian's detention on suspicion of corruption sparked debate in Taiwan, with some questioning the legal justification and viewing it as political persecution. Prosecutors used Taiwan's Code of Criminal Procedure to detain Chen incommunicado before indictment, citing the need to prevent him from fleeing or tampering with evidence. He was arrested in 2008 without formal charges, indicted a month later for corruption involving $15 million, and accused of abusing the \"state affairs fund\" during his presidency. Other DPP officials were also questioned or detained during this time. Former President Chen Shui-bian was detained on suspicion of corruption, leading to his indictment for embezzlement of funds and abuse of the \"state affairs fund.\" He was released without bail but later ordered back to detention. Chen was found guilty of corruption, forgery, and money-laundering, receiving a life sentence and a fine. Additional indictments were issued related to secret diplomacy. Former President Chen Shui-bian faced multiple indictments for corruption, including bribery and money laundering charges. Despite being detained multiple times, President Ma has not granted any amnesties or pardons to Chen. Some observers in Taiwan and the United States, including legal scholar Jerome Cohen, have raised concerns about President Ma's handling of former President Chen's case, criticizing his prioritization of cross-strait ties over civil liberties in Taiwan. Jerome Cohen criticized the harsh pre-indictment detention of detained DPP figures in Taiwan, warning that it could obstruct a fair defense and challenge the presumption of innocence. He also lamented the lack of response from Ma's government to a skit mocking Chen and urged Taiwan's legal community to speak out against restrictions on defense attorneys. In June 2009, defense attorneys, academics, and activists, including Nobel Laureate Lee Yuan-tseh and Taiwan Bar Association Chairman Wellington Koo, expressed concerns about the credibility of Taiwan's judicial system due to Chen's prolonged detention. Freedom House chose Taipei and the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy to host the release of the annual report on \"Freedom in the World\" in 2008, raising international scrutiny. The DPP raised concerns about political interference in TFD's leadership, prompting support from the National Endowment for Democracy for TFD's independence. In January 2010, Freedom House reported that Taiwan improved political rights but had issues with civil liberties. Before 1986, Congress pressured the KMT for political reform. Congressional actions included hearings, resolutions, and visits to Taiwan to engage with both ruling and opposition forces. Members also used arms sales as leverage for democratization efforts. Members of Congress used arms sales as leverage to influence democratization in Taiwan. Representative Donald Fraser held the first congressional hearing on human rights in Taiwan in 1977, while some Taiwanese-Americans sought support for a free and democratic Taiwan. Others stayed out of the public eye due to fear of surveillance by the KMT's security forces. The Kaohsiung Incident in December 1979 led to increased political advocacy by Taiwanese-American activists, with organizations like WUFI and \"Taiwan Communique\" raising awareness in Congress. Representative Jim Leach warned the KMT regime about harsh sentences impacting Taiwan's stability and U.S.-Taiwan relations. Congressional support for Taiwan's human rights did not necessarily extend to advocacy for self-determination to declare a \"Republic of Taiwan\" instead of \"ROC.\" Concern grew over KMT authorities' actions against Taiwanese activists on American soil, leading to increased congressional scrutiny, especially after U.S. diplomatic recognition shifted to the PRC in 1979. Alleged KMT regime activities in the U.S., such as surveillance of professor Chen Wen-chen before his death in 1981, provoked some Members of Congress. Representative Solarz emphasized that any intimidation or interference in America was unacceptable to the U.S. Congress. Solarz introduced an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act to prohibit arms sales to countries intimidating or harassing individuals in the US. Despite warnings, the ROC government did not comply, leading to incidents like the suspected murder of Professor Chen and the arrest of editor Lee Ya-ping in 1985. Key hearings on human rights in Taiwan were held by the House Subcommittee on International Organizations. Key Members of Congress paid attention to Taiwan's human rights issues in various hearings held by House and Senate Subcommittees between 1977 and 1985. Key Members of Congress, including Representatives Jim Leach and Stephen Solarz, and Senators Claiborne Pell and Edward Kennedy, criticized Taiwan's human rights situation, leading to the crafting of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. This act included a section emphasizing the United States' interest in human rights for all inhabitants of Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 reaffirmed the United States' commitment to promoting human rights for all inhabitants of Taiwan. Senators Pell, Javits, and Percy introduced an amendment to advance human rights through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), without supporting any specific group in Taiwan's domestic politics. Senator Pell proposed stronger language to ensure the AIT's obligation to promote human rights for all Taiwanese people. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 reaffirmed the US commitment to promoting human rights in Taiwan. Senator Pell introduced language to strengthen ties between the US and Taiwan, while Senators Javits and Percy amended it to focus on promoting human rights for all Taiwanese people. Representative Leach wanted AIT to monitor political freedom. The TRA allows for oversight by Congress on defense articles and services for Taiwan. Congress has a history of oversight on human rights in Taiwan, supporting democracy and urging the KMT regime to allow multiparty politics. Congressional influence has shown strong US support for Taiwan, monitoring reforms for democracy and addressing concerns about China's military power threatening Taiwan's democracy. The United States showed support for Taiwan's democracy and security during the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996. Congress passed H.Con.Res. 148 to support Taiwan, and President Clinton deployed aircraft carriers in response to PLA provocations. Taiwanese-American advocates and the DPP emphasized Taiwan's separate identity. The TRA's legislative history highlighted human rights concerns. The TRA's legislative history linked human rights to the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, including the right of self-determination. Some Members questioned if this aligns with the U.S. \"one China\" policy, which aims for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. Representative Leach noted Taiwan's unique ability for de facto self-determination after President Chen's re-election in 2004. Taiwan's unique situation allows for de facto self-determination without seeking de jure sovereignty. Political ambiguity provides greater security, along with the historic 'one China' policy and the TRA ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait. Oversight has been exercised over potential interference in Taiwan's electoral politics. President Chen Shui-bian called for a referendum on joining the U.N. as \"Taiwan\" in 2007. Representatives Tancredo and Rohrabacher urged the U.S. to stop influencing Taiwan's affairs. The U.S. has been urged to stop influencing Taiwan's electoral politics, particularly regarding the upcoming referendum on U.N. membership. Despite criticism of the referendum as \"provocative,\" the U.S. has maintained a balance in supporting Taiwan's democratic outcomes. The issue has been complicated by political disputes in Taiwan, including the detention of ex-president Chen and restrictions against protestors during a PRC official's visit in 2008. U.S. policymakers have considered judicial reforms to advance the rule of law in Taiwan, while Taiwan relies on U.S. support, especially in arms sales for self-defense. The U.S. has been urged to stop influencing Taiwan's electoral politics, particularly regarding the upcoming referendum on U.N. membership. Despite criticism, the U.S. has maintained a balance in supporting Taiwan's democratic outcomes. Arguments for U.S. actions to show concern about Taiwan's democracy include implementation of Section 2(c) of the TRA, advancement of human rights worldwide, and preservation of Taiwan as a political model. Arguments against actions critical of Taiwan cite support for an \"ally\" against Communist China and deference to the will of Taiwan's voters. The U.S. has maintained a balance in supporting Taiwan's democratic outcomes despite criticism. There is a distinction between a president's supervision of the appointed justice minister and interference in the work of judges. In 2009, Jerome Cohen criticized President Ma for not rebuking his Justice Minister attending a skit mocking ex-president Chen. President George W. Bush rebuked Taiwan's President Chen for pro-independence actions. Chen's actions, including support for pro-independence referendums and name changes, have raised concerns in Congress and strengthened the Executive Branch's position. The State Department reports on Taiwan's human rights situation, and foreign delegations observe presidential elections. Foreign capitals congratulate winners, implying legitimacy, and foreign leaders send envoys to inaugurations. After President Chen Shui-bian's re-election in 2004, the White House delayed its congratulatory message until the results were certified. Representative Leach attended Chen's second inauguration in Taipei. Members of Congress have more flexibility in communicating with Taiwan's officials. It is important for the US to support a strong multi-party system in Taiwan. In 2009, Taiwan's Minister of the Interior criticized Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer in Washington, involving the US as her supporting host. The United States was involved in an unfounded attack with \"terrorist\" ties, raising questions about Taiwan's approach towards minorities oppressed by the PRC. Taiwan's government and Taiwanese-American activists have sought confirmation or criticism of Taiwan's policies from Congress. President Ma Ying-jeou's speeches to the United States in 2009 and 2010 were inserted into the Congressional Record. Representatives commemorated the 63rd anniversary of Taiwan's \"228 Massacre\" in 2010. The 63rd anniversary of Taiwan's \"228 Massacre\" in 1947 was commemorated in 2010. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton supported Google in warning against cyber attacks from China, specifically pointing to the PRC government. Taiwan's IT companies are significant global players in Internet freedom, with experience in facing suspected PRC cyber attacks. Taiwan's Acer and Asustek IT firms complied with PRC's demand for installing Green Dam Internet filter in products in China. The U.S. Executive and Legislative Branches have policy interests and options regarding Taiwan's democracy, human rights, and rule of law. The U.S. Executive Branch has refrained from speaking out against Taiwan's government since Ma Ying-jeou became president in 2008. However, there were a few mentions of concern, such as when the AIT Director emphasized the need for transparency and fairness in ex-president Chen Shui-bian's case. The new AIT Director faced controversy in Taiwan for supposed U.S. interference when discussing Chen's case with Taiwan's Justice Minister in 2009. The State Department could use various policy options to address human rights concerns in Taiwan, including making statements from Washington, DC, expanding contact with Taiwan, considering an Extradition Treaty, and encouraging support for Internet freedom. Coordination with Taiwan's organizations for foreign assistance programs is also recommended. The U.S. and Taiwan could collaborate on foreign assistance programs to promote democracy and governance, including press freedom. Congress could enact legislation to promote human rights and legal reform in Taiwan, intensify exchanges with Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, observe elections, and visit the TFD and the museum dedicated to the \"228 Incident\" victims. Congress has greater flexibility in communicating with Taiwan compared to the Executive Branch. Congress has greater flexibility in communicating with Taiwan's officials, allowing for enhanced engagement to promote U.S. values, democracy, and rule of law."
