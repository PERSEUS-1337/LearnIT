The Water Source Protection Program for National Forest System land is established by the Secretary of Agriculture through partnerships with end water users to protect and restore National Forest watersheds that provide water to non-Federal partners. The Water Source Protection Program involves partnerships with end water users to protect and restore National Forest watersheds through various agreements and a water source management plan that prioritizes projects for firewood gathering and environmental analysis. The Water Source Protection Program involves partnerships with end water users to protect and restore National Forest watersheds through a water source management plan that prioritizes projects for firewood gathering and environmental analysis. The Program may use the Manual on Adaptive Management of the Department of the Interior for fulfilling requirements under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretary may accept funding and assistance from water source investment partnership participants to implement the water source management plan. Investments can be used directly or indirectly through the National Forest Foundation. A Water Source Protection Fund may be established to match funds contributed by partnership participants. The Secretary can use appropriated funds to make multiyear commitments for water source investment partnership agreements. SEC. 3003 of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 establishes a Watershed Condition Framework. The Secretary of Agriculture, through the Chief of the Forest Service, is required to establish and maintain a Watershed Condition Framework for National Forest System land to evaluate and classify watershed conditions based on various factors such as water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, presence of roads, soil condition, and ecological indicators. The Secretary of Agriculture is mandated to establish a Watershed Condition Framework for National Forest System land, evaluating and classifying watershed conditions based on factors like water quality, aquatic habitat, vegetation, roads, soil condition, and ecological indicators. Additionally, the framework aims to identify and prioritize up to 5 watersheds in each National Forest and up to 2 in each national grassland for restoration, considering impacts on wildfire behavior, flood risk, fish and wildlife, water supplies, forest-dependent communities, and other significant factors determined by the Secretary. A watershed restoration action plan is to be developed for each priority watershed. The priority watershed restoration action plan includes major stressors, essential projects, implementation schedule, partners, funding sources, and monitoring program. The plan aims to prioritize and implement restoration activities for each watershed. The Secretary is required to implement watershed restoration action plans, monitor restoration effectiveness, coordinate with stakeholders, and engage the public. In cases of emergency, a watershed may be designated for priority rehabilitation without following the standard process if a wildfire has significantly impacted its condition. The emergency stabilization activities of the Burned Area Emergency Response Team are insufficient to restore the watershed to proper function. SEC. 4. COLLABORATIVE FOREST LANDSCAPE RESTORATION PROGRAM. The Selection Process for awarding contracts funded by the Fund under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program includes prequalification criteria to ensure contractors have the financial ability and capacity to complete proposed restoration activities. The Department may seek assistance from other agencies or consultants to develop criteria for restoration activities. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is reauthorized with $60,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2024."
