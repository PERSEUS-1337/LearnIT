    "title": "AB 2414",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 10 is added to Division 23 of the Health and Safety Code, allowing for the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District. All other provisions of this division apply to the District following reorganization, with exceptions outlined in this chapter. The Desert Healthcare District is required to file a resolution of application by January 5, 2017, with the Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission to expand its boundaries to include the East Coachella Valley region. The expanded district will encompass various communities, including Indian Wells, La Quinta, Indio, and Coachella, as well as several unincorporated areas. Funding for the expanded district must be specified in the resolution of application. The Desert Healthcare District will fund the expanded district and cover any associated fees. The Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission initiates proceedings upon acceptance of the application resolution. A hearing is held, and an election must be completed within 150 days. The Commission cannot reject the application resolution. The Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission will order the expansion of the district after completion of proceedings, subject to a vote by registered voters. The annexation may be conditioned on the district generating sufficient revenues through special taxes or benefit assessments. The Riverside County Local Agency Formation Commission will direct the Board of Supervisors to conduct an election for approval of district expansion. If voters within the territory vote in favor of the expansion and necessary funding, the district will be expanded. The district will cover the cost of the election services. The Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Act does not apply to the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District, except as specified. It will apply to any other changes following the reorganization of the district. The Desert Healthcare District will increase its board of directors from five to seven members without voter approval, following an expansion. Vacancies will be filled by appointment from registered voters residing in the annexed territory. The Desert Healthcare District will expand its board of directors from five to seven members through appointments. Vacancies in the board positions will be filled according to specified methods. Voting districts and election procedures must be established by January 1, 2020 for this section to become operative. The voting districts established by January 1, 2020 will elect board members, with one member per district. Candidates must be residents of the district for 30 days before the election. A vacancy on the board of directors in a voting district must be filled by appointment of the remaining members, with the appointee being a resident of the unrepresented district. This provision is contingent on the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District as outlined in Section 32499. The Desert Healthcare District aims to maximize its assets to provide health services directly to individuals through operating or funding hospitals, clinics, ambulance services, transportation for seniors or disabled persons, wellness centers, health education, mental health services, veterans' health services, and similar programs. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for the expansion of the Desert Healthcare District in Riverside County to include the entire Coachella Valley region due to limited access to healthcare services in the eastern Coachella Valley for an underserved population. If the Commission on State Mandates finds this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided."
