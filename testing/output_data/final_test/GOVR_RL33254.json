    "content": "The EPA has established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six criteria pollutants: particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb). Revisions to the NAAQS for particulates were published in 2006 to protect against health effects from short- and long-term exposure. The new standards focus on particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10) and fine particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5). The 2006 revisions to the particulates NAAQS introduced PM 2.5 for the first time, based on EPA's evaluation of over 2,000 scientific studies between 1997 and 2002. The new standards are expected to spark national interest and debate, similar to the changes made in 1997. The 2006 particulates NAAQS tightened air quality standards, sparking controversy over whether the standards are too strict. 13 states and the District of Columbia petitioned for a review, along with various industry and agriculture groups and environmental organizations. The 2006 NAAQS review sparked controversy with petitions filed by states, industry, agriculture, and environmental groups. Briefs were filed with the court by March 7, 2008, with oral arguments pending. EPA announced changes to the NAAQS review process in December 2006, removing CASAC's role in approving policy recommendations. The Senate EPW Committee discussed these changes in February 2007. The report provides an analysis of EPA's final 2006 revisions to the particulates NAAQS, including estimated costs and benefits of the new standards. Concerns raised by the science advisory committee (CASAC) and actions in Congress are highlighted. NAAQS does not directly limit emissions but represents the EPA Administrator's judgment on ambient pollution levels for public health protection. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to set national air quality standards every five years based on scientific studies to protect public health from pollutants. The process includes preparing a criteria document summarizing scientific information for the EPA Administrator to determine the final standard. The Clean Air Act mandates the EPA to set national air quality standards every five years based on scientific studies to protect public health from pollutants. The act also established the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to review criteria and standards, and to advise the Administrator. The CASAC augments its resources by creating a review panel of scientists with expertise specific to the pollutant in question. The EPA's most recent review found that scientific evidence since 1997 reinforced the associations between exposure to particulates and numerous cardiovascular and respiratory health problems. The EPA found significant associations between ambient air PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels and health issues like irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks, and premature death. The CASAC recommended modifying particulate standards based on scientific evidence. The standards include annual and daily limits for PM concentrations, with specific percentile forms for 24-hour standards. The EPA has set new standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels, with a 98th percentile 24-hour standard allowing exceedance 2% of the days. The daily PM 2.5 limit is now 35 \u00b5g/m3, with an annual limit of 15 \u00b5g/m3. The PM 10 standard retains a daily limit of 150 \u00b5g/m3 with no more than one exceedance per year on average over three years. The secondary NAAQS for PM 2.5 and PM 10 are the same as the primary standards. The EPA revised the standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10, with the PM 2.5 NAAQS remaining the same as the primary standards. The PM 10 standard was proposed to be replaced with a range of 10 to 2.5 micrometers (PM 10-2.5) with a daily standard of 70 \u00b5g/m3. The focus of the PM 10-2.5 standard would be on \"urban and industrial\" sources, excluding rural area particles like windblown dust. The EPA revised the standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10, focusing on \"urban and industrial\" sources and excluding rural area particles like windblown dust. The 2006 tightening of the PM 2.5 standards is expected to increase nonattainment areas, with final designations based on 2005-2007 monitoring data expected by April 2009. States have until April 2012 to submit State Implementation Plans. The EPA requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by April 2012 to bring areas into compliance with new particulates NAAQS. The focus is on protecting public health without considering costs or non-health criteria in setting the standards. Costs and benefits did not play a central role in setting the particulates NAAQS. The EPA released a regulatory impact analysis in 2006 to meet obligations under Executive Order 12866. The analysis only focused on the benefits and costs of implementing the PM 2.5 NAAQS, not the PM 10 standard. The EPA emphasized that the analysis was primarily for illustrative purposes and did not analyze the regulatory impact of an action. The EPA analyzed cost-effective state implementation strategies to reduce PM 2.5 concentrations, highlighting limitations and uncertainties. The estimated costs were based on assumptions about control strategies, technologies, emissions inventories, and regional variability. States will evaluate various programs to achieve attainment. The EPA estimated the total annual mean social cost of attaining the new PM 2.5 NAAQS would be $5.4 billion in 2020. The monetized benefits of complying with the new standard reflect reductions in health and social welfare effects, ranging from $15 billion to $17 billion annually. The EPA's estimated monetized benefits for attaining the new PM 2.5 NAAQS in 2020 range from $8 billion to $76 billion, based on mortality and morbidity functions. The total annual health and welfare net benefits of meeting the new standard range from $9 billion to $12 billion, subtracting social costs from the monetized benefits. The EPA's cost and monetized benefits estimates for attaining the new PM 2.5 NAAQS in 2020 range from $2.4 billion to $70 billion. The estimates are incremental to the agency's modeled attainment strategy and include health benefits, improvements in visibility in national parks, and wilderness areas. EPA used a stated preference approach for estimating values based on sampling surveys. The EPA estimated visibility \"willingness to pay\" benefits to be $530 million in 2020 with attainment of the new PM2.5 NAAQS. Nationally, annual PM2.5 concentrations declined by 14% between 2000 and 2006, and PM10 concentrations declined by 30% between 1990 and 2006. Areas with the highest improvements in PM2.5 were highlighted. In southern California, decreasing PM2.5 concentrations were mainly due to lower nitrate levels, while organic carbon levels remained stable. The Southeast saw little change, while the industrial Midwest and Northeast experienced decreases in nitrates and sulfates. Despite progress, in 2006, around 67 million people lived in areas exceeding the annual PM2.5 air quality standard. The American Lung Association reported higher PM2.5 levels in densely populated eastern U.S. areas from 2003-2005 compared to 2002-2004. The report highlighted higher PM2.5 levels in densely populated areas of the eastern United States during 2003-2005 compared to 2002-2004. Outside of the eastern U.S., particle levels continued to drop during the same period. The EPA predicted reductions in adverse health effects annually in 2020 for the new PM2.5 NAAQS, based on various epidemiology studies. These estimates were a key component in determining the monetized benefits of the new standards. The EPA estimated reductions in premature mortality from attainment of the new PM 2.5 standards, with estimates ranging from 1,200 to 13,000 avoided premature deaths annually in 2020. Compliance with the standards was expected to prevent 15,000 premature deaths, 75,000 cases of chronic bronchitis, and 10,000 hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disease. These estimates have been the subject of debate and re-analysis since 1998. The EPA conducted research on PM 2.5 to understand health effects and reduce risks. Funding supported various research projects and university-based centers. Recent review confirms links between PM 2.5 exposure and respiratory issues, hospitalizations, and premature death. Debate on new particulates NAAQS includes costs and feasibility of implementation. The proposed tightening of the PM 2.5 standards is expected to increase nonattainment areas, leading to higher compliance costs. The PM 10 daily standard remains unchanged, with 87 areas designated as nonattainment since 1990. As of March 2008, 40 areas have achieved attainment, while 18 areas still do not meet the 1987 standard. The remaining counties have submitted required SIPs for PM 10 but have not been formally redesignated to attainment. Nonattainment of the 1987 PM 10 NAAQS is shown in Figure 1. Implementation of the 2006 revised PM NAAQS is years away, impacting nonattainment areas. States recommended nonattainment boundaries for the 2006 PM 2.5 standards to EPA in December 2007. EPA plans to finalize nonattainment designations by the end of 2008, with SIPs due in April 2012. SIPs for attainment must be submitted by April 2012, identifying regulations and emission control requirements. Transportation conformity is required to ensure federal funding for projects align with air quality goals. States must meet the 2006 PM 2.5 standard by April 2014, with a possible extension of up to five years. States must submit SIPs for how nonattainment areas will meet the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS by April 2008. EPA expects half of the SIPs to be submitted before July 2008, with the remainder following. Compliance with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS is required by April 5, 2010, unless a five-year extension is granted. The EPA's \"PM 2.5 implementation\" rule outlines requirements for states and tribes to achieve and maintain attainment of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. Implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS has been delayed due to litigation and monitoring issues. EPA has designated 39 geographical areas in nonattainment with the standards, effective since April 5, 2005. National comparison with the 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS is not currently available. The EPA identified 143 counties with monitors exceeding the new 2006 PM 2.5 NAAQS using 2003-2005 data. This is an increase from 73 counties exceeding the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS. The geographic distribution of these counties is shown in Figure 2, with areas exceeding the new standards appearing small compared to the total number of counties in the US. The EPA identified 143 counties exceeding the new 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS, with potential impacts on nonattainment areas likely to be even larger. Nonattainment areas include counties with pollutant concentrations exceeding the standard and those contributing to exceedance in adjoining counties, affecting metropolitan areas and a large population. The new 2006 particulates NAAQS may affect a larger percentage of the population. Stakeholders, including Congress, have closely followed the development of the new standard for nearly 10 years. Business and industry generally oppose more stringent standards, while public health and environmental groups advocate for tighter regulations. The EPA received thousands of comments during the development process. The EPA received over 120,000 comments on the 2006 particulates NAAQS proposal, with the Administrator's final decisions differing from CASAC's recommendations for PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards. CASAC raised concerns in letters dated March 21, 2006, and September 29, 2006, regarding the proposed standards. The Administrator is not required by statute to follow CASAC's recommendations. The EPA received over 120,000 comments on the 2006 particulates NAAQS proposal, with the Administrator's final decisions differing from CASAC's recommendations for PM 10 and PM 2.5 standards. CASAC raised concerns regarding the proposed standards, but the Administrator is not required to follow their recommendations. Courts generally defer to the Administrator's judgment on scientific matters when reviewing EPA regulations. CASAC's objections to the Administrator's decisions could impact litigation challenging the standards. EPA solicited comments and held public hearings before finalizing the standards. The EPA's final modifications to the existing particulates NAAQS have sparked interest and conflicting concerns among stakeholders and in Congress. The final 2006 revised PM 2.5 NAAQS are not as stringent as recommended by CASAC and EPA professional staff. CASAC did not endorse keeping the annual standard at its present value. EPA staff and CASAC recommended more stringent levels than those proposed and finalized in 2006. According to the CASAC, most Panel members favored setting a 24-hour PM 2.5 NAAQS at concentrations in the range of 35 to 30 \u03bcg/m3 with the 98th percentile form, along with an annual NAAQS in the range of 14 to 13 \u03bcg/m3. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson's decision to retain the existing standards was based on long-term exposure studies. The CASAC disagreed with the EPA Administrator's decision to retain the annual PM 2.5 standard, urging reconsideration. Public comments on the proposed revisions to the PM 2.5 standards varied, with environmental and health organizations advocating for stricter standards, while industry associations opposed revising the 1997 standards. The EPA Administrator disagreed with CASAC recommendations on the PM 2.5 annual standard, citing lower and less significant risk estimates from recent studies compared to 1997. The emphasis was placed on long-term studies on mortality effects in determining the standard level. CASAC disagreed with EPA's decision on the PM 2.5 annual standard, citing evidence of adverse health effects at levels below the current standard. The majority of the Particulate Matter Review Panel members supported CASAC's recommendation for a lower standard. The CASAC and all seven members of the statutory committee agreed on recommending a reduction in the PM 2.5 standard for public health protection. The EPA estimated benefits of meeting the revised PM 2.5 standards, including a new 35 \u00b5g/m3 daily standard and an unchanged 15 \u00b5g/m3 annual standard, as well as an alternative standard with a tighter annual limit of 14 \u00b5g/m3. The EPA estimated that meeting the more stringent alternative PM 2.5 NAAQS would result in $26 billion to $30 billion of total annual benefits in 2020, compared to $15 billion to $17 billion for compliance with the newly promulgated PM 2.5 NAAQS. The agency also estimated a range of $15 billion to $140 billion for the more stringent alternative based on expert elicitation, compared to $8 billion to $76 billion for compliance with the new standard. EPA also assessed the monetary benefits associated with improvements in visibility in selected national parks and wilderness areas. The estimated total annual cost associated with attainment of the alternative PM 2.5 NAAQS in 2020 would be $7.9 billion, compared to $5.4 billion for compliance with the newly revised PM 2.5 NAAQS. The EPA predicted reductions in premature deaths and adverse health effects annually in 2020, with 2,200 to 24,000 fewer premature deaths estimated for the more stringent attainment strategy. Table 5 compares EPA's predicted reductions annually for the new PM 2.5 NAAQS with a more stringent alternative. The EPA proposed replacing the existing PM 10 indicator with PM 10-2.5 and setting a daily standard of 70 \u00b5g/m3. There was a lack of evidence on long-term health effects of specific PM 10 measurements, leading to the need to address particles ranging from 2.5 to 10 microns. The EPA proposed maintaining the PM 10 indicator with a daily standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3 in the 2006 particulates NAAQS, citing limited evidence on health effects associated with thoracic coarse particles. The CASAC expressed surprise at the decision to revert to using PM 10 as the indicator for coarse particles. The CASAC expressed concerns about the decision to use PM 10 as the indicator for coarse particles in the 2006 particulates NAAQS, noting that retaining the existing daily PM 10 standard was not discussed. The EPA is promulgating a new federal reference method for measuring PM 10-2.5 concentrations in ambient air to gather scientific data for future reviews of the NAAQS. The EPA proposed changing the indicator for coarse particles in response to a court decision, arguing that PM 10 was not a suitable indicator for thoracic coarse particles. The agency addressed concerns in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS, but this could still be challenged in litigation. Additionally, the EPA proposed narrowing the indicator for coarse particulates. The EPA proposed changes to the PM 10-2.5 standard, focusing on urban and industrial sources and excluding rural windblown dust and soils. They also suggested revoking the 24-hour PM 10 standards in most areas, except those with violating monitors and a population of 100,000 or more. The emphasis on urban areas was based on research showing toxicity primarily in urban settings. The EPA's proposal to exclude rural windblown dust and soils and particulates from agricultural and mining sources in the PM 10-2.5 standard raised questions. The CASAC recommended expanding knowledge on the toxicity of PM 10-2.5 dusts instead of exempting specific industries. Members of the House Committee on Agriculture also expressed concerns in a letter to the EPA Administrator. Members of the House Committee on Agriculture supported the EPA's proposal to exclude agriculture and mining dust from the particulates NAAQS. However, most commenters, including environmental groups and industries like transportation and construction, opposed the exclusion. The EPA ultimately did not exclude any areas or types of particles in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS revisions. The EPA acknowledged more evidence on health effects of thoracic coarse particles in urban areas than non-urban areas. Research and monitoring programs are being expanded to gather more evidence on the differences between coarse particles in urban and rural areas. The EPA released a final rule amending national air quality monitoring requirements in 2006. The CASAC agreed with the EPA's decision not to include exemptions in the particulates NAAQS revisions. Some Members of Congress and agriculture representatives expressed concerns about EPA's decision not to include exemptions in the final 2006 particulates NAAQS, fearing unnecessary burdens on the agricultural community. The EPA's final actions regarding exemptions were discussed during a September 28, 2006, hearing on pesticide programs. The EPA's proposal set the secondary standards for PM 10 and PM 2.5 at the same level as their primary standards, despite recommendations for more protective standards from the PM staff paper and CASAC. The CASAC reiterated recommendations for PM 2.5 standards, suggesting a sub-daily standard in the range of 20 to 30 \u03bcg/m3 for a midday time period. Stakeholders argued for consideration of recent studies to reduce uncertainty. The EPA acknowledged new studies supporting arguments for more stringent particulate matter standards in their 2006 criteria document, despite opposition from some stakeholders who wanted a delay in decision-making to consider these studies. The agency reviewed significant new studies developed since 2002 during the comment period, leading to insights on particulate exposure and health effects. The EPA acknowledged new studies supporting arguments for more stringent particulate matter standards in their 2006 criteria document, despite opposition from some stakeholders. The agency reviewed significant new studies developed since 2002 during the comment period, leading to insights on particulate exposure and health effects. The new data did not materially change the broad scientific conclusions regarding the health effects of PM exposure made in the 2004 PM Air Quality Criteria Document. Proponents of stricter standards argue for levels recommended in the EPA PM staff paper and by the CASAC, citing compelling scientific evidence of adverse health effects. The EPA staff analysis supports more stringent particulate matter standards to protect public health and welfare effects. Critics argue that the proposal does not consider newer studies and that the same level of stringency for all fine particles is unfounded. The EPA staff analysis supports more stringent particulate matter standards to protect public health and welfare effects. Critics argue that the proposal's same level of stringency for all fine particles is unfounded, with concerns about excessive costs and adverse impacts on the economy. Urban sources argue against exempting rural particles, while rural sources claim exemption is warranted due to lack of evidence on adverse effects. Revising the standards could hinder compliance efforts and impede meeting air quality regulations. In late December 2006, thirteen states, the District of Columbia, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals to review the new 2006 particulates NAAQS. Various industry and agriculture groups, as well as environmental and public health organizations, also challenged the new NAAQS in court. The court consolidated cases challenging the 2006 particulates NAAQS and ordered submission of briefs from petitioners, EPA, and supporters. Oral argument date not scheduled yet. EPA anticipates a decision in late 2008. Tightening NAAQS will lead to more nonattainment areas and require new controls on particulate matter. States and local governments must develop and implement new plans. Stricter particulate matter standards will require states and local governments to develop new plans to address emissions in noncompliant areas. This will increase costs for transportation and industrial sectors like utilities, refineries, and trucking. The stricter standards aim to reduce adverse health effects, especially for vulnerable populations. NAAQS decisions have been a significant concern in Congress due to health and cost implications. In December 2006, states, industry, agriculture, business, environmental, and public health groups petitioned the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to review the new 2006 particulates NAAQS. The EPA's previous establishment of particulates NAAQS faced litigation and challenges, including a Supreme Court decision in 2001. Critics accused the EPA of overregulation, while environmental groups argued that the EPA had not gone far enough in setting standards for particulate matter. Plaintiffs petitioned the court to overturn the EPA's new 2006 particulates NAAQS standard, which has sparked debate and controversy. The final form of the revision efforts may take some time to be determined."
