    "content": "Insurance companies are a major segment of the U.S. financial services industry, divided into life and health insurance companies and property and casualty insurance companies. Premiums for life and health companies in 2015 totaled $593.7 billion with assets of $6.40 trillion, while property and casualty insurance companies had premiums of $518.4 billion and assets of $1.81 trillion. Life insurance involves longer-term contracts with well-defined risks, while property/casualty insurance is shorter-term with contracts typically lasting six months to one year. Insurance companies, unlike banks and securities firms, have been chartered and regulated solely by the states for the past 150 years. Legal and legislative landmarks in the state-based insurance regulatory system have included Supreme Court decisions in 1868 (Paul v. Virginia) and 1944 (U.S. v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association) and federal legislation. The McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945 preserved states' authority to regulate insurance and granted a federal antitrust exemption to the industry. Since then, Congress and federal courts have somewhat expanded federal government involvement in insurance, leading to division within the industry over federal actions. States generally resist federal intervention, arguing they are better equipped to regulate insurance and address consumer complaints. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 expanded federal regulation in insurance, but states remained the primary regulators. GLBA allowed securities firms, banks, and insurers to coexist under a financial holding company overseen by the Federal Reserve or the Office of Thrift Supervision. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) established functional regulation for bank, thrift, securities, and insurance subsidiaries within a holding company. Insurance company subsidiaries were regulated by state insurance authorities with limited oversight by the federal regulator. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the regulatory structure post-GLBA, giving enhanced systemic risk regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Holding companies, including those with insurance subsidiaries, were overseen by the Federal Reserve with additional capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act altered the regulatory structure post-GLBA, giving enhanced systemic risk regulatory authority to the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Insurance regulatory issues before the 114th Congress include overseeing the implementation of, and possible amendments to, the Dodd-Frank Act, specific legislation, and responding to international developments. The 114th Congress is addressing insurance regulatory issues, including overseeing the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and responding to international developments such as Solvency II and IAIS standards. Legislation like S. 1086, H.R. 2141, H.R. 5143, H.R. 6436, S. 1484, and S. 1910 are being considered. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2015 was introduced as Title II of H.R. 26. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act, passed in the 113th Congress, establishes a private, nonprofit corporation called NARAB. Members, licensed in one state as insurance producers, can operate in other states by paying a licensing fee, without needing separate licenses. They remain subject to each state's consumer protection and market conduct regulations. The NARAB, overseen by a board of appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners, allows out-of-state insurance producers to operate in multiple states with a single license. H.R. 5143, introduced by Representative Blaine Luetkemeyer, aims to streamline licensing processes. The bill, scored by CBO to increase spending by $7 million over 10 years, has seen some progress in the House Committee on Financial Services. H.R. 5143, passed by the House on December 7, 2016, would increase spending by $7 million over 10 years, offset through a reduction in the SEC Reserve Fund. The White House indicated a potential veto. The bill aims to strengthen state-based insurance regulation, enhance public and congressional input on international insurance standards, and promote U.S. regulatory standards. H.R. 5143 aims to enhance public and congressional input on international insurance standards by creating specific procedural requirements for adoption. The Treasury, Fed, and state insurance commissioners must publish standards for public comment, analyze their effects, and certify they won't change state law. H.R. 5143 introduces procedural requirements for adoption of international insurance standards, including public comment, analysis of effects, and certification that they won't alter state law. The Fed and Treasury must certify capital standards for policyholder claims, with reports on international activities and transparency. The Comptroller General will report on transparency of domestic organizations, primarily the NAIC. Public notice of 30 days is required for any proposed standard. H.R. 5143 adds procedural requirements for international insurance standards adoption, including public comment and consultation with State insurance commissioners. It grants the FSOC independent insurance expert authority to consult with international bodies. The bill was marked up on May 21, 2015, and assigned S. 1484 when introduced on June 2, 2015. It was included in Senator John Boozman's S. 1910, the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act. The General Government Act, 2016, S. 1910, was reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Title IX of S. 1910 did not make it into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 includes sections on various financial-sector issues, with Title IV of S. 1484 addressing insurance regulations. Section 401 reaffirms the McCarran-Ferguson Act, while Section 402 requires consent from state insurance regulators before moving insurance company assets under Fed oversight. Title IV of the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015 focuses on insurance regulations, including provisions for accessing insurance company assets during orderly liquidation under the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 403 requires additional reporting on international negotiations for insurance regulatory standards. Title III addresses the designation of nonbank financial companies as systemically important. H.R. 5983, introduced by House Committee on Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling, aims to provide more information to institutions regarding SIFI designation and increase public disclosure requirements. The bill would merge Treasury's Federal Insurance Office with FSOC's independent member with insurance expertise, changing various parts of the financial regulatory system. The bill H.R. 5983 proposes to merge the Federal Insurance Office with FSOC's independent member with insurance expertise, creating the Office of Independent Insurance Advocate within Treasury. The advocate would have new responsibilities, such as observing the insurance industry instead of monitoring it, and would not focus on underserved communities' access to insurance or have the authority to require industry data submission. Additionally, the bill would introduce an additional public notice and comment period for covered agreements. The bills H.R. 1478 and S. 798, introduced by Representative Bill Posey and Senator David Vitter, respectively, on March 19, 2015, propose extending provisions regarding insurers and affiliated depository institutions. S. 798 aims to include insurance companies that are savings and loan holding companies and other companies controlling insured depository institutions. It also introduces a rule of construction that may extend the provision's effect. The bill, H.R. 1478 / S. 798, introduced by Representative Bill Posey and Senator David Vitter, aims to extend provisions regarding insurers and affiliated depository institutions. It includes a rule of construction that broadens coverage to situations where insurance companies are required to provide financial support to affiliated depository institutions. The bill also addresses FDIC authority over insurers under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill, H.R. 1478 / S. 798, introduced by Representative Bill Posey and Senator David Vitter, aims to extend provisions regarding insurers and affiliated depository institutions. It includes a rule of construction that broadens coverage to situations where insurance companies are required to provide financial support to affiliated depository institutions. The bill also addresses FDIC authority over insurers under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act by requiring notification to state insurance regulators before placing a lien on insurance subsidiary assets during an FDIC-administered orderly liquidation of a financial holding company. If the state regulator deems it would have a \"materially adverse effect\" on policyholders, the FDIC cannot place such a lien. The bill clarifies that the FDIC can only step in if the state regulator has not initiated a suit for orderly liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurance company. The bill S. 1086, introduced by Senators Dean Heller and Jon Tester, clarifies that the FDIC can only intervene if the state regulator fails to take action for orderly liquidation or rehabilitation. It also establishes an \"Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues\" at the Federal Reserve. H.R. 2141, introduced by Representative Sean Duffy, sets negotiating objectives for U.S. representatives in international insurance capital standard negotiations at the IAIS. The bill requires reports and testimony from the Federal Reserve and U.S. Department of the Treasury on ongoing discussions until 2018. It also mandates a study on the impact of international capital standards, with public comment and review by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before agreeing to such standards. The bill H.R. 2141 focuses on the protection of policyholders, regulation on a legal entity basis, and the use of supervisory colleges in overseeing insurance groups. It prohibits U.S. representatives from agreeing to international standards unless they ensure sufficient funds for policyholders in case of liquidation, except for SIFIs under the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill also requires consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders during international negotiations. Senator Patrick Leahy introduced bill S. 1561 on June 11, 2015, which aims to amend the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010. The bill excludes captive insurers from the definition of a nonadmitted insurer, thereby exempting them from certain regulatory and tax requirements. Captive insurance companies are defined as those wholly owned by a single-parent company, a group of companies, or an industry, trade, or service. The bill also mandates consultation with relevant committees and stakeholders during international negotiations. H.R. 2998, introduced by Representative Stephen Fincher, aims to preempt state laws on claims adjuster licensing, allowing adjusters to operate in multiple states under NARAB. H.R. 3794, introduced by Representative Dennis Ross, is also related to insurance regulations. H.R. 3794, introduced by Representative Dennis Ross, aims to expand insurance allowed under the federal Liability Risk Retention Act to include all forms of commercial insurance for risk retention groups organized by nonprofits. H.R. 6436, introduced by Representative Denny Heck, seeks to ensure international insurance standards reflect existing federal and state laws, prioritizing policyholder protection in solvency regulation. Title V, Subtitle A of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury to oversee the insurance industry and develop policies related to international agreements. FIO has the authority to preempt state laws that conflict with international agreements, but this authority is limited to cases where non-U.S. insurers are treated less favorably than U.S. insurers and the state law is inconsistent with an international agreement on prudential measures. The international agreement must provide a level of consumer protection that is \"substantially equivalent\" to state law. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) has the authority to preempt state laws that conflict with international agreements, but only in cases where non-U.S. insurers are treated less favorably than U.S. insurers and the state law is inconsistent with an international agreement on prudential measures. FIO's monitoring function includes gathering information from public and private sources, with subpoena power if necessary. FIO is led by a director, currently Michael McRaith, and has been active in issuing reports and participating in international forums. The Federal Insurance Office (FIO), led by Director McRaith, has issued reports and been active in international forums. Negotiations for a covered agreement with the European Union began in November 2015, but no agreement has been reached. The Dodd-Frank Act includes systemic risk provisions affecting the insurance industry through Federal Reserve oversight and higher standards for SIFIs. Banks with over $50 billion in assets are considered SIFIs, while nonbank SIFIs are designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). The FSOC is responsible for identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States and responding to emerging risks in the financial system. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) consists of 10 voting members, with a presidential appointee as an insurance expert. However, the majority of voting members focus on regulating depository institutions. The FSOC sets higher prudential standards for financial stability, with the insurance expert having limited organizational capacity compared to other voting members. The Federal Reserve sets prudential standards for firms based on risk factors, including capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, risk management, and exposure limits. Firms must submit resolution plans and credit exposure reports. Regulated subsidiaries are overseen by their primary regulator, but the Federal Reserve can intervene if regulatory standards are not met or if there is a threat to financial stability. Annual stress tests are conducted on systemically significant firms. The Federal Reserve conducts annual stress tests on systemically significant firms and issues regulations for early remediation measures to prevent insolvency. Insurers designated as SIFIs also fall under the Collins Amendment and Volcker Rule. FSOC has designated AIG, Prudential Financial, and MetLife as SIFIs. Insurers argue they do not pose systemic risk due to the nature of insurance operations. The designations of Prudential Financial and MetLife as SIFIs were controversial, with challenges and lawsuits filed. The U.S. District Court ruled in favor of MetLife, rescinding the designation, which was appealed by FSOC. Any financial company could be subject to Dodd-Frank's resolution regime, but insurance subsidiaries would not be included. The FDIC has \"backup authority\" to resolve insurers if state system fails to act within 60 days. Funding for systemically important financial firms comes from assessments on financial companies with over $50 billion in assets. Assessments on insurance companies consider their contributions to state resolution regimes. FDIC has started issuing rules on the new resolution process. The FDIC has issued rules for the new resolution regime, consolidating oversight of thrift holding companies and bank holding companies under the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened capital standards for holding companies, including the \"Collins Amendment.\" Insurers, as thrift holding companies, saw a change in holding company regulator. Concerns were raised about the impact of Federal Reserve capital rules and accounting standards on insurers. The Federal Reserve indicated that capital rules for insurers would differ from those for banks, as clarified by P.L. 113-279. Insurers are not required to use different accounting standards than state regulators. Federal Reserve recognizes the unique assets and liabilities composition of insurers compared to banks. Insurers have concerns about Federal Reserve oversight and capital rules, with some divesting their depository subsidiaries to avoid regulation. MetLife was designated as systemically important by the FSOC in 2014. The Volcker Rule, part of Dodd-Frank, may impact insurers with banking subsidiaries by restricting proprietary trading. However, there is an exemption for trading by regulated insurance companies for their general account. Compliance with laws and regulations is required to ensure safety and soundness. The FSOC released a study on the Volcker Rule in December 2014. The FSOC released a study on the Volcker Rule in December 2014, which includes a discussion of the insurance company exemption and a recommendation to monitor fund flows between banking entities and insurance companies to prevent 'gaming' the rule. The final Volcker Rule was published on December 13, 2013, and the Federal Reserve issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding insurer capital standards on June 3, 2016. Insurer SIFIs would be subject to a consolidated approach for setting a minimum ratio of required capital. The Dodd-Frank Act's Title V, Subtitle B, known as the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 (NRRA), addresses insurance regulatory issues pre-dating the financial crisis. It harmonizes regulation and taxation of nonadmitted insurance by giving the \"home state\" of the insured sole authority. Taxes collected on surplus lines transactions are distributed accordingly. The NRRA harmonizes regulation and taxation of nonadmitted insurance by giving the \"home state\" of the insured sole authority. It preempts state laws on surplus lines eligibility conflicting with NAIC model law unless states agree on alternative requirements. For reinsurance transactions, it vests authority in the home state of the insurer and reinsurer respectively. Interstate agreements may allocate premium taxes among states. The NRRA harmonizes regulation and taxation of nonadmitted insurance by giving the \"home state\" of the insured sole authority. Interstate agreements may allocate premium taxes among states, with NCOIL's SLIMPACT addressing surplus lines regulatory issues and taxes, and NAIC's NIMA focusing on tax allocation. Congressional hearings aimed to address the lack of uniformity in state ratifications of these agreements. The United States has generally experienced a surplus in trade in financial services, other than insurance, but in insurance services, the United States has consistently run a deficit with the rest of the world. Consolidations in the insurance industry are creating larger international entities with growing market shares, particularly in the reinsurance market. The growing \"internationalization\" of the financial services industry may make it difficult for governments to reform their regulation in isolation. The need for a single federal voice to represent U.S. insurance interests internationally is highlighted. The Financial Stability Board coordinates with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors to address financial stability concerns within the insurance sphere. The IAIS, established in 1994, consists of insurance regulators worldwide to ensure consistent supervision of the insurance industry. U.S. members include individual states, NAIC, Federal Reserve, and FIO. The FIO director chairs the IAIS Financial Stability and Technical Committee, while NAIC coordinates state participation in IAIS committees. The NAIC members play a significant role in the IAIS, with three members serving on the Executive Committee and the Financial Stability and Technical Committee. The NAIC has 15 votes in IAIS general meetings and designates which members can vote. The IAIS, in consultation with the FSB, has identified nine global systemically important insurers, including three U.S. insurers. The IAIS is developing a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame) and specific capital standards for G-SIIs. The IAIS announced plans for capital standards in 2013 and is currently in the second round of consultations, with comments closing in October 2016 and completion expected mid-2017. Any standards created by the IAIS are non-binding and would require adoption by sovereign entities with legal authority for regulating insurance. In the United States, this authority primarily lies with individual states, meaning international standards would not directly affect most insurers unless state legislatures and regulators enact new laws or regulations. The Federal Reserve may implement some IAIS standards for SIFIs and holding companies with depository subsidiaries even if states do not act. U.S. insurers operating outside the country could also be impacted by IAIS standards imposed by foreign regulators. The IAIS and G-SII designations have raised concerns in Congress about the competitiveness of U.S. insurers and the U.S. regulatory system. Foreign and domestic insurance regulators differ in their focus on individual insurance subsidiaries versus the overall financial institution. State regulators in the U.S. focus on individual insurance subsidiaries' capital, while IAIS standards focus on the solvency of the entire insurance group. The solvency of insurance groups is a concern, with the possibility of transferring capital between subsidiaries to maintain overall financial stability. This approach could prevent insolvency but may put individual policyholders at risk. The EU is implementing Solvency II to match capital requirements with insurer risks. The EU's Solvency II aims to align capital requirements with insurer risks, setting a high standard for financial soundness. It includes equivalency determinations for foreign jurisdictions, potentially impacting U.S. insurers operating in EU markets. The EU's Solvency II aims to align capital requirements with insurer risks, setting a high standard for financial soundness. There have been suggestions that an EU regulatory change could improve access for European reinsurers to foreign markets, like the United States. The EU has granted provisional equivalence to the United States, but this only applies to capital requirements of EU insurers with U.S. operations, leading to difficulties for U.S. insurers operating in EU countries. Reinsurance collateral requirements in the EU have posed challenges for non-U.S. reinsurers. The NAIC and states previously mandated 100% collateral deposits, citing concerns about unpaid claims. However, recent years have seen a shift in this stance, with the NAIC proposing federal legislation to address the issue. In 2009, the NAIC proposed federal legislation to enforce national standards for reinsurance collateral, including reducing collateral for highly rated reinsurers. By 2011, the NAIC approved recommendations to reduce required collateral based on the reinsurer's financial strength and recognition of the insurer's domiciliary regulator. As of April 2016, 32 jurisdictions have adopted the model law, with 22 also adopting the model regulation, representing approximately 66% of total premiums. Over 30 reinsurers have been approved by states as certified reinsurers for collateral reduction. As of January 2015, 30 reinsurers have been approved by states as certified reinsurers for reduced collateral requirements. The NAIC's Reinsurance Financial Analysis Working Group has conducted peer reviews for certifications issued by various states, with a streamlined approval process known as passporting. Seven jurisdictions have been approved on the NAIC List of Qualified Jurisdictions. Concerns remain as non-U.S. reinsurers seek a single standard across the U.S. to eliminate, not just reduce, collateral requirements, which is a key factor in the EU's interest in a covered agreement. The EU's desire to enter covered agreement negotiations with the US is driven by the goal of facilitating trade in reinsurance and related activities. State insurance regulators in the US embarked on a regulatory modernization program in response to criticisms and the convergence of financial services. NAIC members pledged to modernize insurance regulation to meet the new financial services marketplace. The NAIC formed new working groups to address state privacy protections, reciprocity of state producer licensing laws, and promotion of \"speed to market\" for insurance products. Efforts post-GLBA included certifying 42 states as reciprocal jurisdictions for producer licensing laws and the growth of the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) for insurers to file changes to rates and forms. Over 637,000 filings were made through SERFF in 2015, up from 3,700 in 2001. In 2015, 637,000 filings were made through the system, up from 3,700 in 2001. 49 states participate in the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact, which aims to provide regulatory uniformity for life, annuities, disability income, and long-term care products. The compact came into effect in May 2006, with 43 states currently participating. The NAIC believes state regulators are better suited to protect consumer interests in the insurance industry. In 2015, state insurance departments had a total budget of $1.36 billion and handled nearly 300,000 consumer complaints and 1.9 million inquiries. The NAIC handled nearly 300,000 consumer complaints and 1.9 million inquiries regarding insurance policies and treatment by companies and agents. They employed over 11,300 employees to handle these issues. Post-financial crisis, the NAIC implemented regulatory changes, including holding company oversight reform to scrutinize insurer group issues and enhance regulator rights. The NAIC implemented regulatory changes post-financial crisis, including holding company oversight reform, enhancing regulator rights, and emphasizing enterprise risk management through Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted these changes. The NAIC has implemented regulatory changes post-financial crisis, including Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and principle-based reserving (PBR) to enhance insurer's financial stress resilience. 40 states have passed ORSA legislation, and 46 states have enacted PBR legislation as of December 1, 2016. PBR will now begin being operational. The U.S. market approved the law for PBR to be applied in 2017, marking a shift in insurance regulation historically governed by states. This change was influenced by past Supreme Court decisions regarding interstate commerce and antitrust laws. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 was passed to preserve states' authority to regulate and tax insurance, granting a federal antitrust exemption to the insurance industry. This act was a response to concerns raised by the South-Eastern Underwriters decision, which had created uncertainty about state insurance regulation. The Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 and 1986 created some insurance regulations, but proposals to transfer regulatory authority to the federal government were opposed by states and the insurance industry. State groups like NAIC and NCOIL worked on regulatory reform to prevent federal involvement and improve state regulation. Efforts were made for more uniformity and efficiency in state regulatory processes. A push to transfer insurance regulatory authority to the federal government began in the mid-1980s due to insolvencies of large insurance companies. Former House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell questioned state regulation's ability to oversee the industry and proposed creating a federal insurance regulatory agency. State regulators and the industry opposed this, implementing reforms at the state level and NAIC, including a new accreditation program for state solvency regulation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, state insurance regulatory reforms were implemented, including the introduction of state insurance guaranty funds. These funds provide protection for insurance consumers. Despite these changes, a breach in the state regulatory system occurred in the late 1990s when Martin Frankel diverted over $200 million from small life insurance companies. State insurance guaranty funds, like the FDIC for banks, protect insurance consumers in case of insolvency. The funds use assets to pay claims, with limits of $300,000 for property/casualty insurance and life insurance benefits. Insurers in the state may be assessed to cover shortfalls, unlike the FDIC, which is funded prior to bank failures. The 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) overhauled the financial regulatory system in the United States due to market convergence. Convergence in financial services refers to the blending of different products and providers driven by globalization, technology, deregulation, and competition. GLBA aimed to repeal federal laws inconsistent with modern financial services. GLBA repealed federal laws inconsistent with modern financial services, allowing banks and securities firms to compete with insurance companies. It created a new competitive paradigm where insurance companies faced competition from brokerages, mutual funds, and commercial banks. GLBA reaffirmed state insurance regulators as the primary regulators of insurance products, leading some insurance companies to believe they are at a competitive disadvantage compared to federally regulated non-insurer competitors. Competitors in certain product lines have more efficient federally based regulation systems compared to insurers who are subject to perceived inefficiencies of state insurance regulation. Insurers face delays in getting products to market due to state approvals, unlike banks that can launch nationwide products in weeks. Industry support for broad regulatory change, like an optional federal charter for insurance, increased after GLBA repealed federal laws allowing banks and securities firms to compete with insurance companies. GLBA supported broad regulatory change for insurance through an optional federal charter, similar to the dual chartering system for banks. It also aimed to modernize state laws for licensing insurance agents and brokers, introducing the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB). However, NARAB provisions were not enacted as enough states implemented legislation for reciprocity. The issue of insurance producer licensing reciprocity or uniformity persists due to varying state actions. After the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, there was an expectation of convergence among banks, securities firms, and insurers, but major mergers like Citibank and Travelers did not materialize as anticipated. Instead, banks started distributing insurance without merging across sectoral lines. Consolidation continued within the banking and insurance sectors, with banks merging with banks and insurers merging with insurers. Despite the functional regulation instituted in the GLBA, regulation still followed institutional lines. Congressional interest in insurance regulatory issues persisted from the 107th through the 110th Congresses, with proposals for federal intervention in insurance regulation being introduced but not advanced. Narrower bills addressing various aspects of insurance regulation were also introduced during this time. During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, new regulatory requirements were introduced in Congress, addressing surplus lines, reinsurance, insurance producer licensing, and expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act. The crisis highlighted failures in the financial regulatory structure, including oversight gaps for the entire system, impacting sectors like insurers previously seen as low risk. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 exposed flaws in the regulatory structure, leading to calls for increased oversight and systemic risk regulation. While insurers generally performed well during the crisis, there were notable failures in the bond insurance sector. This highlighted the need for regulatory changes, including federal oversight of larger insurance firms. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 revealed weaknesses in the regulatory system, prompting calls for more oversight and systemic risk regulation. The bond insurance sector, dominated by four major companies, faced challenges due to exposure to mortgage-backed securities. This led to downgrades in ratings, impacting municipal bond markets and causing unexpected difficulties for investors and municipalities. American International Group, a key player in the industry, failed in mid-September 2008, seeking over $100 billion to avoid bankruptcy. In 2008, AIG sought over $100 billion in assistance to prevent bankruptcy, resulting in the U.S. government owning 92% of the company. The assistance included funds from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Regulatory failures were highlighted in the near collapse of AIG and bond insurers. The case of AIG in 2008 demonstrated the need for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation. AIG was a federally regulated thrift holding company with oversight by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The immediate losses that caused AIG's failure came from derivatives and securities lending operations. The Dodd-Frank Act enacted broad financial regulatory reform in response to the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act is still undergoing regulatory rulemaking, particularly concerning the Federal Reserve's approach to insurance-focused bank holding companies and the potential designation of insurers as systemically important by the FSOC. The federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate the business of insurance under the Commerce Clause. The federal government has the authority to regulate the business of insurance under the Commerce Clause, which was not always clear due to previous Supreme Court rulings. In Paul v. Virginia, the Court held that issuing insurance policies was not considered interstate commerce, impacting a case challenging a Virginia law affecting out-of-state insurance companies. The law was found not to violate the Commerce Clause as insurance was not classified as commerce. The Supreme Court ruled in Paul v. Virginia that insurance contracts were not considered commerce under the Commerce Clause. This decision was based on a narrow definition of commerce, stating that insurance policies were not articles of commerce and were not subject to trade or barter. Subsequent rulings upheld this interpretation, leading states to develop regulatory systems for the insurance industry. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Associations changed the perspective on insurance as commerce, allowing for federal regulation. This case challenged the notion that insurance was not interstate commerce, leading to the question of Congress's power to regulate the insurance industry directly. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Associations recognized insurance as interstate commerce, allowing for federal regulation due to the industry's widespread operations across multiple states. This decision marked a shift in perspective on the regulation of the insurance business, acknowledging its significant role in the U.S. economy and its interstate nature. The Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Associations recognized insurance as interstate commerce, allowing for federal regulation due to the industry's widespread operations across multiple states. The Court endorsed Congress's broad powers to regulate insurance business as interstate commerce, stating that no commercial enterprise conducting activities across state lines is beyond the regulatory power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. The McCarran Ferguson Act was passed by Congress in response to the South-Eastern Underwriters decision, declaring state regulation and taxation of the insurance business as in the public interest. It ensures state regulatory authority over insurance, preventing federal preemption of state insurance regulations. The McCarran-Ferguson Act allows Congress to regulate the business of insurance when necessary, as seen in the Barnett Bank of Marion County v. Nelson case where a federal law preempted a Florida statute on insurance sales. The Act does not prevent federal laws specifically related to insurance from superseding state laws. The Supreme Court upheld federal regulation of the business of insurance, affirming it as commerce under the Constitution. Congress's authority to regulate insurance under the Commerce Clause is limited to interstate commerce. The individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act was deemed unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause in a 2011 Supreme Court decision. Chief Justice Roberts ruled that Congress cannot compel individuals to engage in economic activity under the Commerce Clause, but upheld the individual mandate as a valid exercise of Congress's power to levy taxes. This decision affirmed federal regulation of insurance as commerce under the Constitution. Legislation in the 113th Congress includes the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act (S. 534, S. 1926, S. 2244, H.R. 1155/H.R. 1064, and H.R. 4871). S. 534 was introduced in the Senate by Senator Jon Tester with 13 cosponsors. H.R. 1155 and H.R. 1064 were introduced in the House by Representative Randy Neugebauer. H.R. 1155 had 42 cosponsors and H.R. 1064 had 41 cosponsors. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act (NARAB II) was passed in the 113th Congress with 41 cosponsors. It established a private, nonprofit corporation allowing members to operate in any state with a single license, subject to payment of licensing fees. The NARAB II association would have been overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners. The President could dissolve the board or suspend any rule. S. 534 and H.R. 1155 were nearly identical, with the Senate adding S. 534 to a bill on flood insurance. The House did not take up S. 1926, and P.L. 113-89 addressing flood insurance was enacted without NARAB provisions. H.R. 1155 was added to H.R. 4871, a bill on terrorism risk insurance, and passed by the House Committee on Financial Services. The Senate adopted language similar to H.R. 1155 as an amendment to S. 2244, a bill on terrorism risk insurance, with a new Section 335 that would sunset NARAB language two years after its first member approval. On December 10, 2014, the House passed an amended version of S. 2244, including NARAB language but not the Section 335 sunset provisions. The bill also added a new Title III related to derivatives legislation. The House and Senate adjourned on December 16, 2014, without resolving the differences in the versions of S. 2244 or passing other NARAB legislation. H.R. 605, introduced by Representative Bill Posey, aimed to amend the Dodd-Frank Act to exempt insurance companies from the resolution regime created by the law. H.R. 2156, introduced on May 23, 2013, aimed to encourage uniformity among states licensing independent insurance claim adjusters. It excluded insurance companies from the FDIC's assessment authority and would have impacted the resolution regime created by the law. H.R. 2156 aimed to promote uniformity in licensing independent insurance claim adjusters across states. It allowed out-of-state adjusters to operate without state licensure but still required them to pay uniform state fees. H.R. 2140, introduced by Representative Gary Miller, aimed to create a presumption of compliance with minimum capital standards for insurance companies under Federal Reserve Board supervision, based on state capital standards. The bill S. 2102 introduced by Senator Susan Collins aimed to clarify leverage and risk-based requirements for insurance companies under Federal Reserve supervision. It required the Federal Reserve to follow specific procedures and standards to determine compliance with state capital standards, while also ensuring that state laws continue to apply and prohibiting the Federal Reserve from imposing different accounting standards. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held a hearing on bill S. 2102, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, to clarify capital requirements for financial institutions under the Dodd-Frank Act. The bill aimed to exempt regulated insurance entities from certain minimum capital requirements while maintaining the Federal Reserve's authority to apply capital standards. Three bills were introduced in Congress: S. 2270 by Senator Susan Collins, H.R. 4510 by Representative Gary Miller, and H.R. 5461 by Representative Andy Barr. S. 2270 was signed into law as P.L. 113-279 on December 18, 2014, after passing through both the Senate and the House. The House passed H.R. 5461 on September 16, 2014, addressing capital standards under Dodd-Frank. The bill clarifies that banks and insurers do not need to have the same capital standards. It also prevents the Federal Reserve from requiring insurers to file financial statements according to GAAP if they use SAP. H.R. 4557, introduced by Representative Bill Posey in 2014, aimed to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act regarding bank holding companies providing funds to subsidiary depository institutions. The bill sought to exempt certain insurance companies and their affiliates from such requirements. The Servicemembers Insurance Relief Act (H.R. 4669) introduced by Representative Edward Royce in 2014 aimed to prevent military members from changing auto insurance policies when temporarily moving. The Captive Insurers Clarification Act (S. 2726/H.R. 5388) introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy and Representative Peter Welch clarified regulations for captive insurers. The bill S. 2726 / H.R. 5388 aimed to exclude captive insurers from the definition of a nonadmitted insurer in the Dodd-Frank Act. H.R. 1112, introduced in the 112th Congress, sought to establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a private, nonprofit corporation. The National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) is a private, nonprofit corporation that allows licensed insurance producers to operate in any state by paying a licensing fee. NARAB is overseen by a board with appointees from the insurance industry and state insurance commissioners. The President has the authority to dissolve the board or suspend its actions. NARAB, also known as \"NARAB II,\" was established under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 to streamline state insurance producer licensing. The GLBA NARAB provisions aimed to streamline state insurance producer licensing, contingent on states enacting uniformity and reciprocity laws. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2126) proposed expanding federal preemption for risk retention groups to cover commercial property risks. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2011 (H.R. 2126) aimed to expand federal preemption for risk retention groups (RRGs) to include commercial property risks. It proposed changes to enforcement mechanisms, adding federal corporate governance requirements for RRGs, and allowing the Federal Insurance Office director to issue determinations on state regulations. The Insurance Data Protection Act (H.R. 3559) introduced by Representative Steve Stivers aimed to impose governance standards on risk retention groups, including requirements for independent directors, audit committees, and limited contracts with service providers. The bill also proposed expanding consumer disclosure and imposing a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. However, it was not brought before the full committee for consideration in the 112th Congress. H.R. 3559 aimed to remove the Federal Insurance Office's subpoena authority and extend confidentiality requirements for insurance information. H.R. 6423, introduced by Representative Bill Posey, focused on insurance consumer protection and solvency but did not progress through hearings in the House Committee on Financial Services. H.R. 6423, discussed in a subcommittee hearing in November 2011, aimed to amend Dodd-Frank by exempting insurance companies from the resolution regime. It would have removed the FDIC's authority to resolve insurance subsidiaries and excluded them from assessment authority. H.R. 1583, introduced in 2009, sought to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the insurance industry. No hearings or markups were held on this bill. The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 1880) introduced in 2009 aimed to abolish the exemption from federal antitrust laws for the insurance industry. It would have created a federal charter for insurers, agencies, and producers, under the Department of the Treasury. No further action was taken on the bill. The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 1880) proposed creating an independent entity under the Department of the Treasury to regulate nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers across the United States. It also addressed systemic risk by designating a regulator for insurance. The bill was not purely optional federal charter legislation. H.R. 2554, introduced by Representative David Scott in 2009, aimed to establish a NARAB as a private, nonprofit corporation allowing insurance producers to operate in any state after being licensed in one state. The bill passed the House in 2011 but was not acted upon by the Senate. NARAB members would still be subject to state regulations but laws treating out-of-state producers differently would be preempted. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws, allowing risk retention groups to cover commercial property risks. The bill also proposed changes to the enforcement mechanism for insurance producers operating across state lines. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for commercial property risks. It proposed changes to the enforcement mechanism for risk retention groups and added federal corporate governance requirements. The bill would have allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to issue determinations on state regulations and required reports on compliance with the LRRA. The Risk Retention Modernization Act of 2010 (H.R. 4802) aimed to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for commercial property risks. It proposed changes to the enforcement mechanism for risk retention groups and added federal corporate governance requirements. The bill would have included standards such as a majority of independent directors on an RRG's board, independent audit committees, written governance standards, and limited contracts with service providers. Specific amendments to the LRRA would have expanded consumer disclosure and imposed a fiduciary duty on RRG directors. Additionally, H.R. 6529 would have created a federal license for reinsurers under the FIO's regulatory authority. The FIO, created under the Dodd-Frank Act, would have authority to determine state laws inconsistent with federal law. The 2008 Treasury Blueprint proposed a revamped regulatory structure for financial services, including prudential, business conduct, and market stability regulators. The Department of the Treasury recommended the creation of a federal insurance regulator to oversee an optional federal charter for insurers and federal licensing for agents and brokers. It also suggested establishing an \"Office of Insurance Oversight\" in the Department of the Treasury to handle international regulatory issues and advise on insurance matters. President Obama's Financial Regulatory Reform Plan in 2009 included these recommendations. The 2009 Financial Regulatory Reform Plan proposed by Secretary Timothy Geithner outlined changes to the financial regulatory system in the US, including introducing systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve, merging banking regulators, and creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Insurance regulatory changes were not a focus of the plan. The 2009 Financial Regulatory Reform Plan proposed systemic risk oversight by the Federal Reserve and the creation of a new Office of National Insurance within the Department of the Treasury. The plan aimed to regulate large financial companies presenting systemic risk and included a Financial Services Oversight Council. Insurers were not specifically named as subject to federal systemic risk regulation. The draft legislation proposed stringent solvency standards and enhanced resolution authority for companies deemed a threat to financial stability, including insurers. It was unclear how the Federal Reserve would interact with state regulators of insurance subsidiaries under the proposed legislation. The application of systemic risk regulation would likely be limited to a small number of companies. The proposed creation of an Office of National Insurance by President Obama would serve as a federal overseer for insurance matters, setting policy, representing the US internationally, and preempting state laws inconsistent with international agreements."
