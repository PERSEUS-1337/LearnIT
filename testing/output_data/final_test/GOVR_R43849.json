    "content": "Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, insurance coverage for terrorism losses changed. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was passed by Congress to create a temporary terrorism insurance program. This program aimed to stabilize the insurance markets by providing a government reinsurance backstop for terrorism losses, allowing the private industry time to develop the capacity to cover terrorism risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage but does not mandate commercial policyholders to purchase it. Congress extended the program in 2005 and 2007, with changes focused on reducing government exposure by increasing event size thresholds, raising insurer deductibles, and expanding coverage to domestic terrorism. The program expired in 2014 after the 2007 extension. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) expired at the end of 2014. The program required a terrorist act to cause $5 million in insured losses for coverage, with government covering 85% of losses and insurers retaining 15%. Insurers had to meet a deductible of 20% of annual premiums. If insured losses were under $27.5 billion, the Secretary of the Treasury would recoup 133% of government outlays through a surcharge on insurance policies. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) required the Secretary of the Treasury to recoup a reduced amount of outlays if insured losses exceeded $27.5 billion. After TRIA's passage, the insurance market saw increased willingness to cover terrorism risk, with prices for terrorism coverage trending downward. Representative Randy Neugebauer introduced H.R. 26 on January 6. The House and Senate passed H.R. 26 to extend the TRIA program until 2020, with changes to federal loss sharing and program trigger amounts. The House and Senate passed H.R. 26 to extend the TRIA program until 2020, with changes to federal loss sharing and program trigger amounts. The bill increases the program cap to $37.5 billion and adjusts the recoupment provisions, requiring 140% of federal payments to be recouped. It also mandates a study on the certification process, additional data collection on the terrorism insurance market, and a GAO study on insurer premiums and capital reserve funds for terrorism coverage.
