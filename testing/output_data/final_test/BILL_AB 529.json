    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 30000 of the Penal Code is amended to establish the Prohibited Armed Persons File by the Attorney General. This database identifies individuals prohibited from owning or possessing firearms after January 1, 1996. Access to this information is restricted to specified entities for the purpose of determining if individuals are prohibited from possessing firearms. The Department of Justice provides access to the Prohibited Armed Persons File to the Department of Motor Vehicles for compliance with Vehicle Code Sections 4750 and 12805. Section 4750 of the Vehicle Code is amended to include grounds for refusal of registration, renewal, or transfer, such as false statements, unpaid fees, and prohibitions under the Health and Safety Code. (e) Evidence of financial responsibility required for vehicle registration renewal has not been provided to the department as per Section 4000.37. This does not apply to vehicles with a certification filed under Section 4604 or owned by the United States or public entities listed in Section 811.2 of the Government Code. It also does not apply to vehicle registration renewal with a change of registered owner. (f) The department will not register a vehicle if the registered owner is listed as a prohibited person in the Prohibited Armed Persons File. Before registering, renewing, or transferring a vehicle, the department must check the Prohibited Armed Persons File to see if the person is prohibited. The department is also prohibited from issuing or renewing a driver's license to individuals who are underage, have poor vision, or lack understanding of traffic laws. The department is prohibited from issuing or renewing a driver's license to individuals who are unable to safely operate a motor vehicle, unable to read simple English on traffic signs, hold a valid foreign driver's license without surrendering it, or have had their license suspended due to a traffic violation conviction. The department may issue a license to an applicant whose license was suspended by a state not in the Driver License Compact, or to someone whose out-of-state license was revoked due to a traffic violation, once the revocation has ended or after one year. The department may issue a license to an applicant listed as a prohibited person in the Prohibited Armed Persons File, as per Section 30000 of the Penal Code. The department must check the file before issuing or renewing a driver's license."
