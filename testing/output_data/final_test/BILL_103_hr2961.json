The Congress acknowledges the unique opportunities for observing and interpreting the biological richness of the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern North Carolina. A partnership has been proposed to establish an educational and interpretative facility called the Center for the Sounds, which would bring economic benefits to Tyrrell County and the town of Columbia. The Federal Government has designated the Albemarle-Pamlico estuary system in northeastern North Carolina as an estuary of national concern, bringing economic benefits to Tyrrell County and the town of Columbia. SEC. 2. FURTHER FINDINGS. The Honorable Walter B. Jones strongly supported the National Wildlife Refuge System during his congressional career. He played a key role in establishing and expanding 6 new National Wildlife Refuges in eastern North Carolina, including the Alligator River and Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuges. Jones helped increase refuge acreage by over 303,000 acres, ensuring protection for wildlife habitat and public recreation. Walter B. Jones was instrumental in reintroducing endangered red wolves at Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and dedicated his congressional career to fish and wildlife conservation. He should be honored by naming the Center for the Sounds at Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge System after him. The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to construct and operate the Walter B. Jones Center for the Sounds at the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina for various purposes including studying natural history, offering environmental education programs, and providing office space for refuge activities. The Secretary of the Interior will ensure that the facility's design aligns with the area's cultural and natural history. Non-Federal funds can be accepted for operating costs, and a report on progress must be submitted to Congress within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The House of Representatives passed the Act on September 21, 1993."
