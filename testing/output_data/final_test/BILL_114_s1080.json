    "content": "The Act titled \"Protect Marriage from the Courts Act of 2015\" includes legislative findings. The Senate findings in Baker v. Nelson upheld a State law defining marriage as between one man and one woman, stating that challenging this law on the basis of not including same-sex couples does not raise a substantial Federal question. The ratifiers at the time of ratification adopted a constitutional principle invalidating State laws defining marriage as male-female union. The power to extend marriage to same-sex couples belongs to the people through their elected State representatives. Federal courts have invalidated State marriage laws despite this principle. Federal courts have invalidated State marriage laws that do not allow same-sex marriages, exceeding their authority and usurping the people's power. Pending cases challenge marriage laws in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. The purpose of an Act is to maintain States' authority to define marriage until a constitutional amendment guarantees it as between one man and one woman. This Act aims to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, in adjudicating claims regarding the constitutionality of state marriage laws. Congress has the power to establish inferior courts and make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, as recognized by legal precedent. The Supreme Court's power extends to pending cases, as seen in Ex parte McCardle. A court's judgment only applies to parties involved, nonparties are not obligated to comply until ordered by the court. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. LIMITATION OF JURISDICTION.\" is a concise statement indicating a restriction on jurisdiction. The text chunk adds a new section to Chapter 99 of title 28, United States Code, stating that no Federal court can adjudicate claims regarding the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman or refusing recognition of same-sex marriages from other states. The new section added to Chapter 99 of title 28, United States Code, specifies that judgments before the effective date only bind the parties involved. The Act includes a severability clause, stating that if any provision is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. It takes effect upon enactment and applies to all pending claims. Amendments are made to the Table of Sections for Chapter 99 of title 28, United States Code by adding a new section at the end. \"1632. Limitations on Federal jurisdiction.\""
