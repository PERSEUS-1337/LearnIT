    "content": "Congress's authority to grant patents comes from the IP Clause of the U.S. Constitution, allowing for the exclusive rights of inventors. Patents are available for new and useful inventions, requiring a formal application and evaluation by a patent examiner at the PTO. The invention must be directed at patent-eligible subject matter, useful, new, and nonobvious to be patentable. The requirements for patentability include being directed at patent-eligible subject matter, useful, new, nonobvious, and adequately disclosed and claimed in the patent application. If these requirements are met, the PTO will grant the patent, which typically expires 20 years after the initial application. The utility requirement states that an invention must have specific and substantial utility to be patentable, in line with the Constitution's goal of promoting progress in useful arts. The utility requirement for patentability mandates that an invention must offer a significant and presently available benefit to the public, aligning with the Constitution's aim to promote progress in useful arts. Additionally, a fundamental requirement for patentability is that the claimed invention must be new and not already disclosed in prior art. If an invention is already disclosed in the \"prior art,\" then no valid patent may issue. Even if novel, an invention must also be non-obvious to be patentable. Courts consider factors like commercial success and unsolved needs when determining obviousness. The Patent Act requires technical disclosures in patent applications to ensure the invention is adequately described for public use. Section 112(a) mandates a detailed specification enabling anyone skilled in the art to make and use the invention. The Patent Act requires technical disclosures in patent applications to ensure the invention is adequately described for public use. The statutory language sets forth three basic disclosure requirements for patentability: written description, enablement, and best mode. These requirements ensure that the inventor had possession of the claimed subject matter, provide enough information for others to make and use the invention, and disclose any preferred way of practicing the invention. The legal scope of a patent is defined by the patent claims, which must be sufficiently definite to be valid. The claims set the boundaries of the patent right, informing those skilled in the art about the scope of the invention. The Patent Act uses a system of peripheral claiming where the claims establish the outer boundaries of the invention. The Patent Act uses a system of peripheral claiming to define the boundaries of a patent, allowing patentees to claim more than they invented by using broad, functional language. This system may lead to potential dangers as patentees could seek to claim beyond their actual invention. The Supreme Court limited the practice of using functional patent claims in Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Walker, invalidating an indefinite claim for an apparatus in an oil well. Functional claims may be convenient but can be overbroad and ambiguous, allowing the patentee to claim more than they actually invented. Congress enacted Section 112(f) in the Patent Act of 1952 as a compromise for functional claims. Section 112(f) was enacted as a compromise for functional claims, providing a standard to make them more definite. A patentee may express a claim element as \"a means or step for performing a specified function\" without detailing structure, material, or acts. The claim is limited to the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents. The use of the term \"means\" in claims invokes Section 112(f), while its absence presumes non-invocation, unless there is a sufficiently definite structure provided. Section 112(f) applies to claims lacking \"sufficiently definite structure\" for function. A patent lasts 20 years from filing, with possible term adjustments for delays. Patent holders have exclusive rights to their invention in the US until expiration. Infringement occurs if others use, sell, or import the invention without permission, leading to potential legal action for damages and injunctions. To obtain relief from patent infringement, the patentee must sue in federal court, specifically the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Accused infringers can defend by arguing the patent is invalid, requiring clear and convincing evidence of patentability requirements not being met. The accused infringer can defend against patent infringement by arguing lack of novelty, obviousness, nonpatentable subject matter, lack of enablement, or indefiniteness. They may also claim noninfringement or argue that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable activities. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) has become a significant forum post the 2011 Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) has become a key forum for patent disputes post the 2011 AIA. The AIA introduced new procedures like post-grant review (PGR), inter partes review (IPR), and covered business method patents (CBM). IPR is the most commonly used procedure for challenging patent validity. The most widely used procedure for challenging patent validity is IPR. To claim patent-eligible subject matter, an invention must fit into one of the four statutory categories: process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. Exceptions exist, such as a transitory electromagnetic signal not being considered patent-eligible. The second requirement, which receives more attention, is that the invention must fit into one of these categories. The second patentable subject matter requirement is that the invention cannot claim one of the judicially created categories of ineligible subject matter. The Supreme Court has articulated a two-step test for this requirement, known as the Alice / Mayo framework, to prevent patent monopolies on basic scientific and technological tools. This includes laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Court has stated that a practical application of a mathematical formula or law of nature can be patent-eligible, even if the formula or law itself is not. The exceptions to patent-eligible subject matter, such as abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena, have been developed through common law case-by-case adjudication in federal courts. The scope of patentable subject matter has evolved over time based on recent judicial decisions. The 1853 case of Le Roy v. Tatham set the foundation for American patentable subject matter jurisprudence by distinguishing between abstract principles and practical applications of those principles. The Court emphasized that principles in the abstract cannot be patented, but new properties discovered in matter can be. In the case of O'Reilly v. Morse, the Court applied the rule that new properties discovered in matter can be patented, while abstract principles cannot. Morse's patent on the telegraph was mostly sustained, but his claim regarding the use of electric or galvanic current for marking characters at a distance was rejected. In the case of O'Reilly v. Morse, the Court ruled that abstract principles in natural philosophy are not patentable. Chief Justice Taney found Morse's claim regarding the use of electric or galvanic current for marking characters at a distance to be \"too broad.\" The Court also made significant decisions on the patentability of processes in the late nineteenth century, moving away from prohibiting \"pure\" method patents and construing process patents as claiming a machine or limiting them to disclosed machinery and equivalents. In Cochrane v. Deener, a patentable process was defined as a mode of treatment of materials to produce a given result, irrespective of the form of instrumentalities used. Similarly, in Tilghman v. Proctor, a method for separating fat into glycerin and fatty acids using water, pressure, and heat was deemed patentable. The Telephone Cases allowed Alexander Graham Bell's patent claim on a method for transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically. The Court upheld Bell's patent claim for transmitting vocal sounds telegraphically, distinguishing it from Morse's case. In the early 20th century, the Court rejected patent claims on treated citrus fruit as a natural article, not a manufacture. The Court rejected patent claims on treated citrus fruit as a natural article, not a manufacture, and also rejected patent claims on an inoculant for leguminous plants consisting of multiple species of bacteria. In previous cases, the Court rejected patent claims on treated citrus fruit and a plant inoculant. In subsequent cases like Benson, Flook, and Chakrabarty, the Court ruled against patents on algorithms and methods involving mathematical formulas, but upheld a patent on a genetically engineered bacterium for breaking down oil. In Diamond v. Diehr, the Court upheld a patent on a process for molding synthetic rubber using a mathematical formula. The patent did not claim the formula itself and did not preempt its use in other fields. This decision marked a shift in patentable subject matter law, with the Federal Circuit primarily handling further developments in the field. In the late 1990s, Section 101 of patent law was seen as \"a dead letter\" as the Federal Circuit expanded patentable subject matter. In 2010, the Supreme Court introduced the two-step Alice / Mayo test for patent eligibility, focusing on whether claims are directed to ineligible concepts like laws of nature or abstract ideas. The test emphasizes that claims must not simply involve ineligible concepts but must be directed to them. The patent eligibility process involves determining if patent claims are directed to an ineligible concept, with the second step of the Alice / Mayo test requiring an \"inventive concept\" to make the invention patentable. This concept involves elements that transform the claim into a patent-eligible application of an ineligible concept, ensuring that the patent amounts to significantly more than just the ineligible concept itself. Conventional and routine limitations, such as generic computer implementation, do not qualify as an inventive concept. In Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court ruled that a business method for hedging against price-fluctuation risks in energy and commodity markets was not patent-eligible under Section 101. The Court rejected the \"machine-or-transformation test\" as the sole test for patent eligibility, but considered it a useful clue. In Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court rejected the \"atextual\" notion that business methods were categorically unpatentable under Section 101. The Court concluded that the patent in question attempted to claim an unpatentable abstract idea of hedging risk. Justice Stevens, concurring only in the judgment, argued that business methods should be categorically patent-ineligible. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, the Court addressed the \"law of nature\" exception, ruling that the patent claims were directed towards relationships between concentrations of metabolites in human blood. The patent claims in the first case were deemed patent-ineligible as they were considered little more than instructions for doctors to apply existing laws when treating patients. In the second case, the issue was the patentability of human DNA, specifically genes associated with breast cancer. The inventor claimed isolated DNA and complementary DNA segments based on the discovery of the genetic sequences. In Myriad, the Supreme Court ruled that isolated DNA segments were nonpatentable products of nature, while cDNA, a synthetic molecule, was patentable. In Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, the Court examined the patentability of a system for mitigating settlement risk using a computer as an intermediary, ultimately deeming it an abstract idea. The Supreme Court's recent patentable subject matter cases, including Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, have sparked criticism from various patent law stakeholders. Critics argue that the Alice / Mayo framework is vague, subjective, and unpredictable. The Alice / Mayo framework is criticized for being vague and unpredictable in determining patent eligibility. The Federal Circuit requires a specific \"focus\" on ineligible concepts in patent claims, but the level of specificity varies, leading to a lack of objective criteria. Key terms like \"abstract idea\" and \"significantly more\" lack clear definitions. The Alice / Mayo framework for determining patent eligibility is criticized for its vagueness and unpredictability. The lack of clear definitions for key terms like \"abstract idea\" and \"significantly more\" makes it difficult for patent applicants to know if their claims will survive judicial scrutiny. Critics argue that the framework imposes extra-statutory requirements for patent eligibility, injecting uncertainty into the patentability of inventions. Some argue that the Alice / Mayo framework for patent eligibility is based on a historically inaccurate understanding of patent law. Critics believe it confuses patent law by mixing eligibility with policy concerns better addressed by other provisions in the Patent Act. For example, patent claims have been rejected for lacking an inventive concept when implementing an abstract idea on conventional computer hardware. The Alice / Mayo framework is criticized for its impact on innovation in biotechnology and computer software industries. Stakeholders argue that it limits patentability of diagnostic methods, personalized medicine, and natural substances in biotechnology. In the computer industry, opinions are divided with some claiming devaluation of patents and uncertainty for their business. Some stakeholders argue that Section 101 law is reducing incentives to innovate in biotechnology and computer software industries, driving investment elsewhere, and putting the United States at a disadvantage. Critics claim that Alice/Mayo leads to a loss of patent protection, allowing competitors to benefit from American innovation. Defenders argue that the Supreme Court's reinvigoration of Section 101 has important benefits for the patent system. The reinvigoration of Section 101 has benefits for the patent system, with some indicating that the Alice/Mayo framework is not as unpredictable as claimed. Uncertainty in patentable subject matter law is not new and may be inevitable. A subjective approach to patentable subject matter offers flexibility and adaptability to new technologies. Defenders of the framework argue that courts may clarify or change Section 101 doctrine over time. The Alice/Mayo framework, grounded in Section 101, has been part of patent law for 150 years. Some defend the \"inventive application\" requirement as consistent with precedent. Section 101 serves distinct purposes from other patent law doctrines. For example, even if an invention is novel, nonobvious, and disclosed, it may not be patentable due to concerns about future innovation or moral issues. Some stakeholders argue that Section 101 is beneficial for weeding out overly broad patents in certain industries like computer software. Others support exclusions for patents on basic discoveries in science and nature. Some commentators believe that restricted patent-eligibility standards may benefit U.S. consumers by increasing competition and lowering prices for certain products. The modern Supreme Court has settled on the \"preemption rationale\" for subject matter exclusions in the patent system, aiming to prevent patents that impede innovation by reaching too broadly. This rationale asserts that abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena should not be patentable to avoid hindering future innovation. The preemption rationale is one justification for Section 101, which aims to prevent patents that impede innovation by being too broad. Other rationales for Section 101 include identifying patents with negative social costs and denying them protection. Some commentators argue that Section 101's purpose is to exclude patents on inventions that would have been created without patent incentives, such as business methods. Others believe Section 101 is based on moral or ethical concerns, like the prohibition on patenting products of nature. Some commentators question the independent purpose of Section 101 in patent law. Some commentators question the independent purpose of Section 101 in patent law, suggesting that it may not be necessary if other patentability requirements are rigorously applied. Different reform approaches are being considered to contextualize current proposals within possible reforms. The proposed paths forward for Section 101 in patent law fall into four categories: opposing legislative intervention and letting courts refine standards, replacing the Alice / Mayo framework with explicit patent-eligible or -ineligible subject matter lists, implementing a lower standard for patent eligibility, or removing limitations on patentable subject matter. Congress may choose to leave Section 101 unchanged for courts or the PTO to continue development. Supporters of leaving Section 101 unchanged argue that the courts should continue developing the law of patent-eligible subject matter, believing that the current framework is not as harmful to innovation as critics claim. They also suggest that the courts will refine, clarify, or improve the law over time. Additionally, some view the current law as beneficial for innovation and society by preventing property rights in fundamental aspects of science, nature, and ideas, and by weeding out overly broad patents or unmeritorious patent litigation. Opponents of maintaining the legal status quo suggest potential routes for reforming Section 101, including amending it to replace the Alice/Mayo framework with a more specific list of patent-eligible and patent-ineligible subject matter categories. The proposal to reform Section 101 involves creating a clearer and more predictable definition of patent-eligible and patent-ineligible subject matter categories, potentially following the model of the European Patent Convention. The European Patent Convention defines specific subject matter that is not patentable, including discoveries, scientific theories, and methods for mental acts or business. This approach aims to provide greater clarity and predictability in determining patent eligibility. The laundry-list approach offers clarity and predictability in patent eligibility, grounded in statutory language. However, it may lack flexibility for new technologies and replace judicial judgments with legislative ones. Some proposed reforms aim to replace the Alice/Mayo framework with a new standard limiting patent eligibility to inventions resulting from human effort and contributing to the technological arts. Proposed new patentability standards aim to limit patent eligibility to inventions resulting from human effort and contributing to the technological arts, potentially replacing the current judicially created subject matter exclusions and the two-step Alice/Mayo test. Various proposals suggest different criteria, such as allowing patenting of \"practical applications\" of laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas under certain conditions. Proposed new patentability standards aim to limit patent eligibility to inventions resulting from human effort and contributing to the technological arts. Commentators debate whether new standards would provide clarity and predictability in patent-eligibility law while being flexible enough for new technologies. Some argue for eliminating the Alice/Mayo framework and judicially created exceptions to patent eligibility without replacing them. The appropriate course for Congress may be to eliminate nonstatutory eligibility requirements in favor of a more rigorous application of patentability standards. Supporters argue this approach aligns with policy concerns, while opponents believe Section 101 serves distinct purposes that would be lost. Various proposed reforms to Section 101 have been inspired by recent Supreme Court jurisprudence on patentable subject matter. In 2019, the PTO issued Revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Guidance to provide clearer guidelines for patent examiners. Additionally, a bipartisan group of legislators proposed draft legislative reforms on patentable subject matter, sparking roundtables and congressional hearings on the issue. The PTO issued revised guidance to patent examiners for clearer Section 101 determinations, addressing the challenge of determining patent-ineligible subject matter by synthesizing case law into three categories. The PTO issued revised guidance to patent examiners, categorizing patent-ineligible subject matter into three groups: mathematical concepts, methods of organizing human activity, and mental processes. Claims not falling into these groups should not be considered abstract ideas. The PTO's Revised Guidance clarifies when patent claims will be considered \"directed to\" an ineligible category under the Alice / Mayo test. Claims integrating a practical application of a judicial exception will be treated as patent-eligible without the need for an \"inventive concept\" analysis. The PTO's Revised Guidance under the Alice / Mayo framework has been seen as lowering Section 101 barriers to patentability for computer-related inventions. While some praised the clarity it provides to patent examiners, others criticized it for being inconsistent with Supreme Court decisions. It is important to note that the guidance is not legally binding and lacks the force of law, as it is only a tool for internal PTO management. The Federal Circuit has issued contradictory signals on the Guidance, which would receive \"some deference\" if found persuasive by a court. Senators Tillis and Coons, along with Representatives Collins, Johnson, and Stivers, proposed a bipartisan framework for legislative Section 101 reform. The proposal aimed to retain the four statutory categories of patentable inventions but remove the requirement for inventions to be \"new and useful\" from Section 101. The First Tillis-Coons Proposal aimed to define five exclusive categories of patent-ineligible subject matter, codifying judicial exceptions in a narrower form. This would include fundamental scientific principles, products existing solely in nature, pure mathematical formulas, economic or commercial principles, and mental activities. The First Tillis-Coons Proposal aimed to narrow the construction of patent-ineligible categories by introducing a \"practical application\" test. This proposal blended elements of the PTO's 2019 Guidance with specific ineligible categories and new statutory standards, aiming to lower Section 101 barriers to patentability while still defining classes of ineligible subject matter. Mixed reactions followed the proposal. The First Tillis-Coons Proposal aimed to reform Section 101 by introducing a \"practical application\" test to narrow patent-ineligible categories. Mixed reactions followed, with critics arguing it didn't go far enough. In response to feedback, a Second Tillis-Coons Proposal was released for further reform. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal, presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, aims to expand patent eligibility by making sweeping changes to Section 101. This draft bill would remove the word \"new\" from Section 101 and emphasize considering the claimed invention as a whole for patent subject matter eligibility. Various stakeholders, including industry representatives and former Federal Circuit Judges, expressed differing views on Section 101 reform during hearings. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal aims to broaden patent eligibility by removing judicial exceptions and emphasizing considering the invention as a whole. It would eliminate the need to consider factors like how the invention was made or the state of the art at the time. The draft bill also states that Section 101 should be interpreted in favor of eligibility. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal aims to broaden patent eligibility by replacing judicial exceptions with a new statutory definition of utility. Inventions must fit into one of the four statutory categories and provide specific and practical utility through human intervention to be considered patent-eligible. The proposal also aims to combat overbroad patent claims. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal aims to combat overbroad patent claims by altering functional claiming rules under Section 112(f) to limit claim elements to corresponding structures described in the specification. This change clarifies that Section 112(f) applies to any claim element lacking a structure for performing a function, making it harder for patentees to avoid its limiting effects. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal received mixed reactions from patent law stakeholders, with critics expressing concerns about potential ambiguities in the proposed definition of \"useful\" and the sweeping changes to Section 101 law. Both supporters and opponents debated the practical effects of the legislative changes, including the impact on unmeritorious patent litigation. The Second Tillis-Coons Proposal faced criticism for potential ambiguities in the definition of \"useful\" and sweeping changes to Section 101 law. Concerns were raised about the elimination of judicial exceptions and the possibility of patenting human genes. Senators Tillis and Coons clarified they have no intention of allowing gene patenting. After the hearings, they emphasized the need for Congress to intervene and bring clarity to patent eligibility. The Senators are considering exempting research and experimentation from infringement liability to avoid inhibiting scientific research. They plan to clarify gene patent eligibility and may sharpen the 'field of technology' requirement to include advances like artificial intelligence and medical diagnostics. Certain concepts like economic transactions or social interactions may remain patent-ineligible. A revised formal bill reflecting these provisions is expected in the fall."
