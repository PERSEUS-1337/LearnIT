    "content": "President Obama's budget request for FY2011 includes proposed increases in income tax rates for high-income individuals, aiming to restore the top two tax brackets to pre-2001 levels. The 39.6% rate would apply to filers with AGIs above $373,650, while the 36% rate would affect single filers with AGIs from $200,000 to $373,650 and joint filers with AGIs from $250,000 to $373,650. High-income individuals would face higher marginal tax rates under health care reform legislation passed by the House and Senate. The House bill includes a 5.4% surtax on income over $500,000 for single filers and over $1 million for joint filers. The Senate bill imposes a 0.5% payroll tax on wage income over $200,000 for single filers and over $250,000 for joint filers. Proponents argue that these rate hikes are necessary to raise revenue and address budget deficits. The proposed higher marginal tax rates in the health care reform legislation aim to increase revenue and address budget deficits. Critics argue that these rate increases could negatively impact small business formation, growth, and investment by raising the tax burden on many small business owners. This report examines the impact of proposed higher marginal tax rates on small business owners by analyzing the distribution of small business income by tax brackets using a micro-simulation model. The analysis aims to shed light on the validity of arguments regarding the tax burden on small businesses. In analyzing the distribution of small business income by tax brackets, it is important to define what constitutes a small business owner. Various definitions exist, but for this study, a small business owner is defined as anyone reporting income or loss on Schedule C or Schedule E. This definition aligns with previous Treasury Department studies and is crucial for determining the impact of proposed higher marginal tax rates on small business owners. The definition of a small business owner includes individuals reporting income or loss on Schedule C, E, or F, encompassing various types of entities. This definition allows for the separation of small business income from other sources using tax data, but may not align with the traditional image of small businesses as start-ups or family-owned enterprises. The definition of small business owners separates business income from other sources using tax data, but has limitations. It excludes income from small C corporations passed on to owners and allows some medium-sized or large firms to be counted as small. The TPC/Treasury definition of small business owners includes passive investors in partnerships and S corporations, leading to some upper-income individuals being counted as small business owners. Additionally, certain miscellaneous income unrelated to business ownership is considered small business income, such as fees for sitting on corporate boards or proceeds from sales on eBay. The limitations of the TPC/Treasury definition of small business owners include counting passive investors and including miscellaneous income like fees for sitting on corporate boards or sales on eBay. The linkages between individual and business tax data needed to generate a more accurate distribution do not exist, so the results should be viewed as illustrative rather than definitive. The growth of small firms would not be significantly impacted by a rise in the top two individual tax rates, as only a small percentage of small business owners fall into those brackets. Most small business owners are subject to lower marginal tax rates, indicating that only a tiny share would be affected by an increase in the top two rates. The proposed tax hikes for upper-income individuals would affect a greater share of small business income than small business owners in 2007 and 2009. Small business income is not the dominant form of income in any tax bracket above zero, with most filers in the top two brackets reporting some small business income but deriving less than half of their AGIs from it. The proposed tax hikes for upper-income individuals would impact a significant portion of small business income. Small business income represented 30-35% of AGI for filers in the 33% and 35% tax brackets, compared to 14% for all taxpayers. IRS data shows that small business income accounted for 61-62% of AGI for filers with AGIs of $200,000 or more. Increasing marginal tax rates for high-income individuals raises policy issues related to small businesses. The potential tax rate increase for upper-income individuals could impact small businesses, particularly in terms of their legal structure and formation. The decision to operate as a C corporation or a passthrough entity depends on various tax and non-tax factors. Concerns arise about how higher tax rates may affect small business income, potentially leading to reduced formation and investment. The decision to operate as a C corporation or a passthrough entity depends on tax rates, dividends, capital gains, and investment horizon. Large firms prefer C corporations for global capital raising benefits. C corporations have no limits on shareholders, stock types, or shareholder nationality. The shares of C corporations are traded on exchanges, allowing for easy ownership transfer at low costs. C corporations are taxed twice, while passthrough entities are taxed only once at the individual level. Small business income taxed at top rates may lead to more firms choosing C corporation status. The individual and corporate tax rates are structured progressively, with the top individual rate potentially rising to 39.6% in 2011, exceeding the top corporate rate by nearly five percentage points. Long-term capital gains and dividends may also see a tax rate increase to 20% for certain filers. The tax incentives for operating as a C corporation may change for filers with AGIs over $200,000. Lawmakers are considering how this alteration could impact the fraction of small firms operating as corporations. To analyze this, investment scenarios involving partnerships and corporations are compared based on current and proposed tax rates. The results are summarized in Table 2. Investment scenarios for passthrough entities like partnerships and C corporations are compared based on different tax rates for one year, five years, and 10 years. Scenarios include individual tax rates at 35% or 39.6%, corporate rates at 35%, and capital gains rates at 15% or 20%. Proposed changes in tax rates by the Obama Administration and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Charles B. Rangel are also considered. Investment scenarios for passthrough entities like partnerships and C corporations are compared based on different tax rates for one year, five years, and 10 years. The scenarios assume a constant pre-tax rate of return of 20% and reinvestment of after-tax income. Partnerships distribute 7% of earnings annually for taxes, while corporations do not pay dividends. After five years, partnerships liquidate with no capital gain or loss, distributing remaining after-tax income and initial investments to partners. Corporations liquidate with shareholders paying capital gains. Based on the comparison of tax rates for partnerships and C corporations, small business owners may benefit more from operating as a partnership rather than a C corporation. Partnerships show a higher after-tax rate of return over one year, five years, and 10 years, even with proposed changes in tax rates. This is due to the top individual and capital gains tax rates affecting shareholders in a corporation. A partnership would realize a greater after-tax rate of return in all three periods when the top individual rate is 39.6%, the top capital gains rate is 20%, and the top corporate rate is 35%. Reducing the corporate rate to 30.5% would result in a greater after-tax rate of return over one year and five years for a partnership, although a corporation would gain a slight edge over 10 years. The distribution of taxable income among different business forms can impact revenue to the U.S. Treasury, as shown in a recent report by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy on average effective tax rates. The average effective tax rates for different forms of business organization in 2004 were 26.9% for S corporations, 17.5% for C corporations, 13.3% for sole proprietorships, and 23.6% for partnerships. Federal tax policy can impact small firms' performance through its effect on taxable income distribution among these entities. Federal tax policy can influence small firms by affecting incentives for savings, investment, and self-employment decisions. Proposed increases in marginal tax rates for high-income taxpayers are criticized for potentially harming small business formation and investment by reducing incentives for upper-income households to save, start new businesses, or invest. Critics argue that higher tax burdens on individuals in the top tax brackets could discourage saving, business formation, and investment in small businesses. Recent research, including a study by economists Holtz-Eakin and Rosen, suggests that increased individual marginal tax rates can lead to lower investment spending, reduced workforce growth, and lower payrolls for profitable sole proprietors. Critics argue that higher tax burdens on individuals in the top tax brackets could discourage saving, business formation, and investment in small businesses. Recent research suggests that increased individual marginal tax rates can lead to reduced investment spending, workforce growth, and payrolls for profitable sole proprietors. Small firms, accounting for about half of GDP and non-agricultural employment, play critical roles in commercial development and new technologies. Concerns raised by critics warrant serious consideration, but the literature on taxation and entrepreneurship does not offer unqualified support for these concerns. The relationship between income taxes and entrepreneurial activity is complex and not clear-cut. Tax policy can influence the decision to enter self-employment, with varying views among economists on the impact of taxes on the creation of new firms. Theoretical literature suggests that taxation has a complex and ambiguous effect on the choice to become self-employed, with factors like tax treatment of business income and wage income playing a role. Tax policy can influence the decision to enter self-employment, with varying views among economists on the impact of taxes on the creation of new firms. Theoretical literature suggests that taxation has a complex and ambiguous effect on the choice to become self-employed, considering factors like the tax treatment of business income and wage income. Differences in tax treatment, government risk-sharing, progressivity of income tax systems, and opportunities to avoid taxation of business income all play a role in the decision-making process. Studies have yielded inconclusive results on the impact of taxes on entrepreneurial firm formation, with some suggesting higher tax rates foster increased entrepreneurial activity while others challenge this finding. Studies have shown conflicting results on the impact of taxes on self-employment. While some believe higher tax rates can increase entrepreneurial activity, others argue that tax rates have a weak link to entry into self-employment. Research by Bruce and Mohsin suggested that a significant tax cut would be needed to see a small gain in entrepreneurial activity. The decision to become self-employed is influenced by factors like tax rates, risk-sharing, and opportunities for tax evasion. More research is needed to understand the importance of risk-sharing and tax evasion in the decision-making process. Theoretical model incorporating risk-sharing and tax evasion in self-employment decision-making can inform tax legislation for small business formation incentives. A rise in top tax rates may not significantly impact small business investment as previously thought. An increase in tax rates could potentially lead to less investment by small firms if most income is subject to those rates. According to the neoclassical theory of business investment, the cost of capital drives investment decisions. An increase in a business taxpayer's marginal tax rate raises the cost of capital, leading to reduced investment spending. Studies show that business investment is responsive to changes in the cost of capital. Higher tax rates could lead to a decline in business investment due to the cash flow theory, which suggests that firms base investment decisions on their cash flow and retained earnings. Unlike the neoclassical model, the cash flow model assumes that internal funds are cheaper than external funds. Therefore, an increase in tax rates would likely result in reduced business investment as firms would have lower retained earnings. The relationship between cash flow and business investment is not clear. One theory suggests that firms invest more when their retained earnings grow, while another theory links investment to overall demand for goods and services in the economy. The accelerator model of business investment posits that changes in the cost of capital can impact investment levels. The cost of capital and tax incentives influence business investment. Small firms can write off the cost of qualified assets under Section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. In 2008 and 2009, firms were allowed to expense up to 50% of the cost of qualified assets. Small firms were able to expense up to 50% of the cost of qualified assets in 2008 and 2009. There is bipartisan support for extending these deductions through 2010. Expensing allows for accelerated depreciation, reducing the tax burden on returns to investment. The exact number of small firms utilizing these deductions is unknown due to a lack of data. The research tax credit under IRC Section 41 and research expenditures expensed under IRS Section 174 can lead to a negative marginal effective tax rate on investment in research and development. Tax incentives and business benefits may offset the impact of rising tax rates on small business investment. A potential upturn in demand could further counteract any negative effects."
