    "content": "The \"Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2002\" may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The \"Remote Sensing Applications Act of 2002\" acknowledges the importance of federal involvement in innovative land use planning and the potential of remote sensing data for societal goals. The United States is investing in acquiring geospatial information for various purposes, including scientific and national security applications. Landsat data and earth observation data have already shown significant assistance potential. The potential of remote sensing and other geospatial information for various applications has not been fully explored. Several policies support the development of integrated sets of geospatial information to address societal needs. The Space Act of 1998 promotes the development of US commercial remote sensing capabilities. Many agencies are unaware of the utility of remote sensing for urban planning and disaster relief. NASA can play a unique role in this area. NASA, in collaboration with other agencies, can demonstrate how scientific data combined with other sources can assist various agencies and the private sector in decision-making related to agriculture, weather forecasting, and forest management. Additionally, NASA can stimulate the development of the remote sensing and geospatial information sector through pilot projects showcasing the integration of governmental and commercial remote sensing data with geographic information systems and satellite-based positioning data. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"geospatial information,\" and \"institution of higher education.\" It also includes provisions for pilot projects to promote the use of scientific data in decision-making across various sectors. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. Preference will be given to projects using existing data sets, integrating multiple geospatial sources, involving non-Federal contributions, and collaborating with commercial entities. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information to address agency needs. The projects aim to create data products with added value, demonstrate diverse public sector applications, assist in commercial applications development, and support growth management for State, local, regional, and tribal agencies. Assistance for pilot projects will not exceed 3 years, and recipients must submit a report on project results within 180 days of completion. The Administrator will establish a grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information. Recipients must conduct a workshop within 180 days after project completion to disseminate lessons learned. The Administrator will issue regulations for application, selection, and implementation procedures for pilot projects. The program evaluation will be conducted as part of the grant program for pilot projects using remote sensing and geospatial information. Regulations will be issued for application, selection, and implementation procedures. The Administrator will establish an advisory committee with expertise in various fields to monitor the program under section 4. The committee will consult with relevant industry representatives and organizations. An evaluation of the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2006. The evaluation of the program's effectiveness in utilizing remote sensing sources will be conducted by an independent entity to address agency needs. The Administrator will ensure that pilot project results are accessible through an electronic database. An educational outreach program will be established to raise awareness of remote sensing applications. A study on the impact of remote sensing imagery costs on agency applications will be conducted and results will be reported to Congress within 2 years. Authorization of appropriations of $15,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007 to carry out the Act encouraging the development and integrated use of remote sensing and geospatial information by the public and private sectors."
