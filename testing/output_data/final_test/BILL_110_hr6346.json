    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act\" aims to prevent unconscionable pricing of gasoline and other petroleum distillates during emergencies. The Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act prohibits selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at unconscionably excessive prices during an energy emergency, indicating unfair advantage. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation for specific areas where this prohibition applies. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation specifying the area, fuel type, and duration of the prohibition on selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices. The proclamation can last up to 30 days and be renewed for additional 30-day periods. Factors considered in determining violations include various factors. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation specifying the area, fuel type, and duration of the prohibition on selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices. Factors considered in determining violations include whether the price charged grossly exceeds the average price offered by the seller in the 30 days prior or the price offered by other sellers in the same area. The President can issue an energy emergency proclamation to prohibit selling gasoline or petroleum distillates at excessive prices. Factors considered for violations include additional costs, risks, and market conditions, as well as the quantity of fuel sold in the affected area. During a 30-day period following an energy emergency proclamation, if the quantity of gasoline or petroleum distillates sold exceeds the amount produced prior to the proclamation, it is considered a violation. Definitions for \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" sales of gasoline or petroleum distillates are provided in this section. The sale of gasoline or other petroleum distillates includes all sales to end users such as motorists, agriculture, industry, residential, and commercial consumers. Transactions on futures markets are not considered sales in this context. SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. Enforcement of section 2 of the Act by the FTC includes treating violations as unfair or deceptive acts, with enforcement actions prioritizing companies with significant sales of gasoline and petroleum distillates. Civil penalties apply to violators with actual or implied knowledge of the Act. The Act enforces penalties for violations, including price gouging and false information, with fines of up to 3 times the profits gained or $3,000,000 for price gouging, and a civil penalty of up to $1,000,000 for false information. Penalties are obtained similarly to civil penalties under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, penalties for violations are assessed based on the seriousness of the violation and efforts to remedy the harm caused in a timely manner. Each day of a continuing violation is considered a separate offense. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Any person violating section 2 may face fines up to $150,000,000 for corporations and $2,000,000 for individuals, along with possible imprisonment for up to 10 years. Enforcement of these penalties requires a criminal action brought by the Attorney General or Department of Justice. A State can bring a civil action in federal court to enforce the provisions of the Act or impose civil penalties for violations involving retail sales. The State must notify the Federal Trade Commission before initiating the action, providing a copy of the complaint if feasible. The Federal Trade Commission can intervene in a civil action brought by a State under the Act, allowing them to be heard on all matters and file petitions for appeal. The attorney general of a State can still conduct investigations and compel witnesses in such actions. The venue for the civil action will be in a judicial district determined by the provisions of the Act. In a civil action under the Act, the venue will be in a judicial district where the defendant operates, was authorized to do business, or is found. Process serving is not limited by district or state boundaries. Individuals involved in the alleged violation can be joined in the action regardless of their residence. State actions are limited if the Federal Trade Commission has initiated a civil or administrative action for Act violations. State officials can enforce civil or criminal statutes in State court. The Consumer Relief Trust Fund will receive fines and penalties from section 3 of the Act to assist low-income households with energy costs. The Act does not limit the Federal Trade Commission's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other law, and it does not preempt State laws."
