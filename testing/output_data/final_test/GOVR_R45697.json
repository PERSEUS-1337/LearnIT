    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied, encompassing production activities related to traditional field crops, livestock, poultry products, fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. Farm income and rural economic conditions vary across the United States due to regional differences in market structure and production processes. Annual U.S. net farm income is a key indicator of farm sector well-being, reflecting economic activity across production processes, input expenses, and marketing. The U.S. farm sector is diverse, including traditional field crops, livestock, and fruits. Annual net farm income reflects economic activity, expenses, and marketing conditions. In 2019, projected net farm income is $69.4 billion, up 10% from last year, but below the 10-year average. The U.S. farm sector is facing uncertainty in 2018 due to weak commodity prices and trade disputes. Net cash income and net farm income have fallen since 2013, leading to a general downward trend in farm income. The U.S. farm sector has seen a general downward trend in farm income since 2013, mainly due to declining commodity prices. Cash receipts for major crops and animal products are projected at $381.5 billion in 2019, down from highs in 2012 and 2014. Government payments are expected to decrease by 17% in 2019. Total production expenses are projected to increase slightly in 2019. Global demand for U.S. agricultural exports is projected to decrease by 1% in 2019. Farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels in 2019, with asset values at $3.1 trillion and farm debt at $427 billion. The debt-to-asset ratio is expected to reach 13.9%, the highest level since 2002. Farm production choices in 2019 will be influenced by producers' expectations for net returns from market and government programs. Most major growing zones are free of drought, with some dryness persisting in certain regions. Excessive precipitation and early spring flooding may hinder crop-choice and planting routines in 2019, especially in the western Corn Belt. U.S. corn and soybean crops have shown strong growth in productivity and output in recent years, leading to stockpile increases. Soybean plantings surpassed corn plantings for the first time in history in 2018, with record plantings and high yields. In 2018, record soybean plantings and high yields led to a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.5 billion bushels and record ending stocks of 900 million bushels. The sudden loss of China as a buyer caused soybean farm prices to drop by 8% to $8.60/bushel, the lowest since 2006. Additionally, the U.S. produced the third-largest corn harvest on record at 14.4 billion bushels, with near-record yields of 176.4 bushels/acre. The United States' large exports of corn and soybeans, along with high international demand, are projected to result in a small reduction in corn ending stocks and a slightly higher farm price. The export outlook for these crops is critical for farm sector profitability and regional economic activity. The trade dispute between the United States and China has led to lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products, impacting corn and soybean markets. USDA has revised downward its expected export value to China for 2018 and 2019. The soybean export forecast has also been lowered. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report for August 2019 forecasts depend on the trade dispute's impact on corn and soybean trade. U.S. soybean production growth has affected the wheat sector, leading to the lowest wheat-planted acres in over 100 years. Poor planting conditions in 2018 are expected to support wheat prices and may increase spring wheat plantings in 2019. The U.S. cattle herd was reported in the February 2019 Cattle report by USDA. The USDA's February 2019 Cattle report indicated a slowdown in U.S. cattle herd expansion, with growth expected to continue in 2019. The hog and poultry flocks are also projected to expand. There is uncertainty regarding whether demand will keep pace with production growth, potentially leading to lower prices. Beef, pork, broilers, and eggs production are expected to increase in 2019. Beef, pork, broilers, and eggs production saw strong growth rates in 2018. Demand for red meat and poultry is projected to grow, but at a slower rate than production. The changing conditions in the U.S. livestock sector can be tracked by the evolution of livestock output prices to feed costs ratios. Higher ratios indicate greater profitability for producers. The hog, cattle, and broiler sectors have shown volatility in margins from 2015-2018. Continued production growth of red meat and poultry suggests vulnerability to weak demand, leading to lower prices and eroding profitability for some producers. Hog and milk producers are facing financial difficulties, with projected growth in milk production globally and in the U.S. This could lead to further pressure on milk prices in 2019. Despite weakening profitability, cattle expansion continues through 2019 due to a lag in response to market price signals from 2014. High feed and forage prices, along with drought in the Southern Plains, led to a contraction in the U.S. cattle inventory from 2007-2014, triggering a slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle. The slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle started in 2014 due to high feed prices and drought in the Southern Plains, leading to lower market prices in 2016. Despite strong demand for beef, pork, and poultry, lower prices are expected to persist through 2019. Farm sector revenue sources in 2019 include crop revenues, livestock receipts, government payments, and other farm-related income. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2019 is projected to increase driven by crop and livestock receipts. Total crop sales are projected at $201.7 billion in 2019, slightly up from 2018. Feed crops are expected to reach $58.8 billion (+4.0%), while oil crops are projected at $39.5 billion (-6.6%). Fruits and nuts are estimated at $32.9 billion (+8.2%), vegetables and melons at $18.6 billion (+0.9%), and cotton at $8.3 billion (+6.5%). Livestock sector cash receipts peaked in 2014 and are expected to continue growing steadily. Cash receipts for the livestock sector peaked at $212.8 billion in 2014 but declined in 2015 and 2016 due to price decreases. In 2017, cash receipts increased by 8.1% to $176.0 billion. In 2018, there was little change, and in 2019, projections show a 2.6% increase to $179.9 billion, with varying sales figures for different livestock categories. Government payments in 2019, totaling $11.5 billion, make up 3% of projected gross cash income of $427.5 billion. These payments include various types such as direct, price-contingent, conservation, ad hoc disaster assistance, and other miscellaneous outlays. While representing a small share of gross income, government payments are expected to make up 16% of the projected net farm income of $69.4 billion. Government payments in 2019 are projected to decrease by 16.8% from 2018 to $11.5 billion. This decrease is mainly due to the reduction in MFP payments from $5.7 billion in 2018 to $3.5 billion in 2019. Ad hoc disaster assistance payments are expected to increase by 20.4% to $1.4 billion. Overall, government payments are estimated to contribute about 12% to net farm income in 2018 and 8% in 2019. Government payments in 2019 are projected to decrease by 16.8% to $11.5 billion, contributing about 8% to net farm income. Payments under various programs are expected to decrease, with the new Dairy Margin Coverage program making $600 million in payments. Conservation payments are forecasted to be $4.3 billion in 2019, slightly up from $4.0 billion in 2018. The 2018 farm bill renamed the MPP program to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program, offering expanded margin coverage choices. Milk producers can now cover the milk-to-feed margin at a $9.50/cwt. threshold on the first 5 million pounds of milk. The DMC payments in 2019 are likely due to the formula-based milk-to-feed margin being below the $9.50/cwt. threshold. Total production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector in 2019 are projected to increase slightly (+0.6%) from 2018 to $372.0 billion. Production expenses in the agricultural sector are projected to be slightly up from 2018 at $372.0 billion. The prices received index declined from 2014 through 2016, rebounded in 2017, then declined again in 2018. Farm input prices showed a similar pattern, suggesting that farm sector profit margins have been squeezed since 2014. Livestock farms will be affected differently by production expenses, with feed costs being a principal expense. The principal expenses for livestock farms include feed costs, purchases of feeder animals and poultry, and hired labor. Feed costs, labor expenses, interest costs, and property taxes are projected to increase in 2019. Renting or leasing land is a way for young or beginning farmers to enter agriculture without incurring debt. About 38% of agricultural land used in U.S. farming operations has been rented since 2002, with the majority rented from nonoperating landlords. In 2012, 30% of farmland was rented from nonoperating landlords, with 8% rented from other farm operations. Net rent to nonoperator landlords is projected to decrease in 2019. Cash rental rates for 2018 were higher than in 2017. Rental rates reflect high crop prices and large net returns from 2011-2014. Agricultural exports are a significant factor. The peak rate for cropland was $144 per acre in 2015. U.S. agricultural exports have been a major contributor to farm income, with a downturn starting in 2015 deepening the downturn in farm income that began in 2013. USDA projects agricultural exports at $141.5 billion in FY2019, down slightly from the previous year. Ongoing trade disputes have led to changes in country-level exports. Agricultural imports are projected to remain nearly unchanged at $127.0 billion in FY2019, resulting in the lowest agricultural trade surplus since 2007. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to be $141.5 billion, with China, Canada, and Mexico being the top three markets. However, China's share of U.S. exports is decreasing, leading to a shift in the order of top markets. In FY2019, China's imports of U.S. agricultural products are forecasted to decline due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The European Union and Japan are the fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. export markets, with limited growth compared to the rest of the world. The \"Rest of World\" component, including South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, is expected to account for 41% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019, driven by population and GDP growth. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports are driven by population and GDP growth, as well as shifting trade patterns diverting products from China to new markets. High-value exports are forecasted at $94.3 billion, accounting for 66.6% share, while bulk commodity shipments are forecasted at $47.2 billion, representing a 33.4% share. The share of agricultural production sold outside the country indicates the level of U.S. exports. The export share of U.S. agricultural production was estimated at 19.8% from 2008 to 2016, with varying percentages for different product categories. Bulk food grains and oilseeds had higher export shares, while fruit, tree nuts, and meat products fell in the mid-range. Vegetable and melon sales had lower export shares. The export share of vegetable and melon sales ranges from 15% to 18%, dairy products from 9% to 24%, and agricultural-based beverages between 7% and 13%. The U.S. farm income and asset-value outlook for 2019 suggests a stable financial position for the agriculture sector, with uncertainty regarding prices and market conditions. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 1.5% in 2019 to $3.1 trillion, mainly due to higher real estate values. In 2019, farm asset values are expected to increase due to higher real estate values (+1.8%), offsetting a slight decrease in nonreal estate values (-0.1%). Real estate is projected to make up 83% of total farm sector asset value. Crop land values are influenced by commodity prices, with mixed forecasts for corn, soybeans, and cotton lower, and wheat, rice, and livestock products higher. Total farm debt is forecasted to rise to a record $426.7 billion in 2019 (+3.9%), while farm equity is projected to increase slightly (+1.1%) to $2.7 trillion. The farm debt-to-asset ratio is expected to increase to 13.9% in 2019, the highest level since 2002. Average farm household income in 2019 is projected at $115,588, with 18% coming from farm production activities and the remaining 82% earned off the farm. Farm income from off-farm sources peaked at about 95% in 2000 and has since surged ahead of average U.S. household incomes. In 2017, average farm household income was $113,495, 32% higher than the average U.S. household income of $86,220. USDA data shows monthly farm prices for major commodities. Tables present aggregate farm income variables and annual average farm prices."
