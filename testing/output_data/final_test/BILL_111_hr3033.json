    "content": "The \"Carbon Neutral Government Act of 2009\" authorizes the purchase of offsets and credits. Federal agencies and legislative offices can use appropriated funds to buy qualified tradeable greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits in compliance with procurement rules. The offsets and credits must be certified by the Secretary of Energy to be considered qualified for purchase. The Secretary of Energy certifies generators meeting necessary requirements for offsets or credits representing greenhouse gas reduction or renewable energy generation. Transactions in open markets are regulated by the Secretary after public input. The Act approves open market transactions involving qualified greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits. Rules will allow forward purchasing and crediting on an estimated basis from small scale generators, enabling short-term purchases to reduce emissions. Greenhouse gas offset is defined as the reduction in emissions resulting from actions to reduce greenhouse gases. The Act allows open market transactions for greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits to reduce emissions. Greenhouse gas includes carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Renewable energy credit refers to environmental attributes of energy generated by renewable sources. The Act permits trading of greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits to lower emissions. Renewable energy credit involves environmental attributes of energy from sources like solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal. Ownership of credits must be verified by the Secretary through an auditable contract path. The Act allows for trading of greenhouse gas offsets and renewable energy credits to reduce emissions. Renewable energy credits represent environmental attributes of energy from sources like solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal. The term \"tradeable\" means that offsets or credits can be bought and sold in an open market. The authority of this section will be effective for fiscal years following the enactment of the Act."
