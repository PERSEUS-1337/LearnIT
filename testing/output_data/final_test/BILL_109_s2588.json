The \"Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2006\" establishes 50 pilot programs for three-share programs over a 5-year period. Grants are awarded to eligible entities to establish and operate three-share programs, contribute to premiums, and establish risk pools. Each entity must develop a plan meeting specific requirements. Each entity applying for a grant under the \"Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2006\" must submit an application to the Administrator, including a three-share program plan and assurances regarding benefit packages, recruitment, network management, and administrative needs. The Secretary will prioritize existing or eligible three-share programs with community support or in states allowing program expansion for grants under the Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2006. The Secretary will establish eligibility regulations for three-share programs to participate in the pilot program. To be eligible for the pilot program, a three-share program must be a non-profit or local governmental entity, define its service region, and have the capacity to manage health plans administratively. To be eligible for the pilot program, a three-share program must be a non-profit or local governmental entity, define its service region, have the capacity to manage health plans administratively, and demonstrate community involvement. Payment for services is divided between covered individuals and qualified employees or employers. The three-share program requires the qualified employer to pay a premium for a qualified employee, with at least 40 percent covered by a grant and the remaining amount from other sources. Program flexibility allows for income eligibility guidelines and enrollment procedures to accommodate different needs. The three-share program allows enrollment of individuals and small businesses, with enrollees responsible for the employer's share of the premium. Limitations on pre-existing health conditions may apply for individual enrollees and employer groups of less than 4 individuals in the first year. Benefits include physician services. The three-share program covers physician services, in-patient and out-patient hospital services, emergency room visits, ambulance services, diagnostic lab fees, x-rays, and prescription drugs. Coverage is limited to services within a specific region and pre-existing conditions cannot exclude individuals from the program. The Administrator may award grants to existing three-share programs to meet certification requirements. Eligible entities must submit an application containing required information. State laws are not preempted by this section. A distressed business formula must be implemented within 60 days of enactment. The Administrator will develop a formula to determine distressed businesses for eligibility. Granting eligibility to distressed businesses will not affect the insurance market. Businesses reducing benefits to qualify as distressed will not be eligible for the three-share program. Definitions include the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration and covered individuals. \"A covered individual is a qualified employee, child under 23, or spouse without access to healthcare coverage. A distressed business is one identified by the Administrator for eligibility.\" \"A distressed business facing economic hardship and rising healthcare premiums may have to reduce or end its healthcare coverage. An eligible entity is defined as an entity meeting specific requirements. A qualified employee is an individual meeting certain criteria, such as lacking access to health coverage through a family member or common law partner.\" \"A qualified employer is a small business located in a specific region that has not provided health care benefits to its employees for at least 12 months or is classified as a distressed business.\" The General Accounting Office will evaluate the effectiveness of programs established under this section for distressed businesses. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2007 through 2012."
