    "content": "In the U.S. Department of Justice's National Drug Threat Assessment 2009, Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) were identified as the greatest organized crime and drug trafficking threat to the United States worldwide. Mexican DTOs gained control of cocaine trafficking into the United States, becoming major suppliers of heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana. Mexico is now the major transit country for cocaine smuggled into the United States, with an estimated 90% of cocaine entering the U.S. transiting through Mexico. Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n has prioritized combating drug cartels and violence since taking office in 2006. He deployed army contingents and federal police to cartel-controlled areas to regain government control. Drug cartels are acquiring military-style firearms from the United States, leading to increased violence. Calder\u00f3n has urged the U.S. to curb the flow of firearms into Mexico. Drug-related murders in Mexico have significantly increased, reaching 6,200 in 2008. The number of murders in Mexico doubled from 2006 to 2007 and more than doubled again in 2008 to 6,200, with nearly 10% involving law enforcement officers or military personnel. Over 23,000 firearms were recovered by Mexican authorities and traced back to the U.S., with approximately 87% originating from there. The Mexican government estimates that 2,000 firearms are smuggled across the Southwest border daily, contributing to the increase in violent crime. Reducing illegal firearms flow from the U.S. to Mexico could decrease crime rates and enhance public safety. Mexican gun laws are stricter than U.S. laws, with warnings for U.S. citizens not to bring firearms without a permit. The NRA provides guidance on legally transporting firearms to Mexico for sporting purposes. Gun trafficking between Mexico and the U.S. is similar to \"crime gun\" trafficking. The trafficking issue between Mexico and the United States is similar to the \"crime gun\" trafficking issue within the U.S. Some states have stricter gun laws than others, leading to the perception that lax laws contribute to gun-related crimes. Canada also faces illegal firearms flow due to its strict gun laws. Illegal gun trafficking from the U.S. to Mexico varies from small-scale smuggling to larger conspiracies. The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) intercept large weapons shipments, with firearms often diverted from legal channels to illegal ones in the U.S. and smuggled into Mexico. Cross-border firearms trafficking is high-risk but profitable, with profit margins of 300% to 500%. U.S. firearms commerce is governed by four federal statutes, with states having their own stricter laws requiring permits and waiting periods for firearm transfers. The National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA) and the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) regulate domestic firearm commerce in the United States. The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 governs the exportation of firearms. The ATF enforces federal firearms laws, including restrictions on certain types of firearms like machine guns and short-barreled shotguns. The NFA also regulates concealed firearms and destructive devices. The National Firearms Act (NFA) and Gun Control Act (GCA) regulate firearm manufacture and distribution, requiring registration with the Attorney General. The ATF administers the NFA, while the GCA aims to reduce crime without burdening law-abiding citizens. The GCA mandates federal licensing for firearm businesses and prohibits interstate mail-order sales and transfers of handguns. The Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits interstate mail-order sales of firearms, sets restrictions on who can purchase firearms, requires background checks for non-licensed individuals, and imposes special penalties for using a firearm in certain crimes. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act amended the GCA in 1993 to include background checks for all non-licensed individuals purchasing firearms from federal licensees. Background checks are administered by the FBI for Brady checks, while the GCA is generally overseen by the ATF. Private, intrastate transactions do not require background checks under the GCA. Under the Gun Control Act (GCA), background checks are not required for private, intrastate transactions between non-licensed persons not \"engaged in the business\" as firearms dealers. Possession, registration, and licensing of firearm owners may be regulated by state laws. The GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing or purchasing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, mental defectives, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. The Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, mental defectives, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, and others. The GCA does not distinguish between citizens and legal permanent residents; both are eligible to possess firearms unless they fall into prohibited categories such as illegal immigrants and nonimmigrants. Illegal immigrants are noncitizens who entered the US without inspection or violated their visas, while nonimmigrants are admitted for temporary stays. Nonimmigrants admitted for temporary stays in the US are generally not eligible to purchase firearms, with exceptions for certain cases such as official representatives of foreign governments or distinguished visitors designated by the State Department. The State Department requires possession of a firearm for official capacity; foreign law enforcement officers of friendly foreign governments entering the US for law enforcement purposes; visitors admitted for lawful hunting or sporting purposes with valid hunting licenses. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the President to control the export and import of defense articles and services, including non-automatic and semi-automatic firearms up to caliber .50, fully automatic firearms up to .50 caliber, and other designated weapons on the US Munitions List. The US Department of State controls the export of items on the US Munitions List (USML) under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The Arms Export Control Act imposes strict penalties for violations. The Department of Commerce regulates exports of goods not on the USML. The Department of Commerce (DOC), through its Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), implements export controls on goods under its jurisdiction in the Export Administration Act of 1979. After the act expired in 2001, export controls have been maintained under an executive order issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), granting the President broad authorities to regulate exports from the U.S. Firearms are controlled in the Commerce Control List (CCL) under Category 0. Items related to firearms, including shotguns, stun guns, and optical sighting devices, are regulated under Subgroup A of the Commerce Control List (CCL). These items are controlled for crime control purposes. Items related to firearms, including shotguns, stun guns, and optical sighting devices, are regulated under Subgroup A of the Commerce Control List (CCL) for crime control reasons, U.N. embargoes, CIFTA implementation, and anti-terrorism purposes. The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) detail licensing requirements for exports to specific countries, with no license exceptions available. BIS oversees a licensing system for exporting shotguns and related items to OAS Member countries, including Mexico and Canada, based on OAS Model Regulations. Violations of EAR provisions result in strict criminal and civil penalties. The OAS Model Regulations were developed to aid OAS Member countries in implementing CIFTA, a treaty aimed at preventing illegal trafficking of firearms. Despite the US Senate not ratifying the Treaty, the US maintains export regulations to support CIFTA's goals. The CIFTA treaty aims to prevent illegal trafficking of firearms by regulating licenses, markings, information sharing, controls at export points, and training for law enforcement. Signed by the US and 28 other OAS member states in 1997, it went into effect in 1998. As of 2009, 29 OAS Member states have ratified the Convention. President Clinton recommended ratification to the Senate in 1998, but it has not been voted on. The Senate has not voted on the CIFTA treaty. ATF is the lead federal agency responsible for stopping gun trafficking from the US to Mexico. ATF's strategy aims to prevent convicted felons, drug traffickers, and gang members from acquiring firearms through straw purchases or corrupt dealers. Gun trafficking involves moving firearms from legal to illegal markets. ATF works to reduce firearms-related crime by regulating the U.S. firearms industry and conducting criminal investigations. Despite tensions with the firearms industry, ATF Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators can inspect licensed gun dealers without search warrants under certain scenarios. ATF Special Agents and Industry Operations Investigators can inspect FFL inventory and records without search warrants in specific scenarios, such as criminal investigations or ensuring compliance with record-keeping requirements. This helps trace crime guns and generate leads in criminal investigations. ATF investigators lead criminal investigations and uncover illegal activities by inspecting FFL records. The DOJ OIG reported that ATF conducted firearms compliance inspections on a percentage of FFLs each fiscal year, with over 11,000 inspections in FY2008. ATF reported approximately 113,000 FFLs nationwide, with half being licensed collectors not authorized for business dealings. Licensed collectors, not authorized for business dealings, can engage in limited interstate firearms transfers of \"curios and relics\" without using an FFL. Straw purchases involve buying firearms for prohibited individuals without a paper trail. Small-scale gun smuggling across the border often involves straw purchases from FFLs in border states. The ant run, involving one to three guns, is a common method of smuggling firearms into Mexico. Straw purchases are illegal under the GCA in the United States. When buying a firearm from an FFL, both the buyer and the FFL must fill out ATF Form 4473. Falsifying information on the form is a federal offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine. It is also illegal to aid, abet, or engage in a conspiracy to smuggle firearms out of the United States. In 1986, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act amended the GCA to require FFLs to report multiple handgun transfers to the AG within five days. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993 further required FFLs to forward this information to state or local law enforcement. However, federal law prohibits disclosure of these records, except for those related to prohibited individuals, and mandates their destruction within 20 days. State or local agencies must certify to the AG every six months. Private, intrastate firearm transfers are legal in some states at gun shows and flea markets, allowing individuals not \"engaged in the business\" of dealing firearms to transfer them as long as certain conditions are met. These transfers are difficult to trace, making it a challenge to monitor potential interstate firearms trafficking. Private transfers, especially multiple private transfers, are hard to trace, leading to a premium for these firearms in illegal markets. Southwest border states like Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California allow private transfers at gun shows, with California having stricter regulations. Mexican drug traffickers favor certain semiautomatic firearms, some of which were previously classified as \"semiautomatic assault weapons\" under a past federal law. The ban on semiautomatic assault weapons (SAWs) and large capacity ammunition feeding devices (LCAFDs) expired in 2004. These weapons were defined by specific characteristics like detachable magazines and pistol grips. Legally owned SAWs prior to the ban remained available for transfer under federal and state laws. Opponents argue against the ban. Assault rifles were developed during and after World War II to provide a lighter infantry weapon with increased firing capacity through detachable magazines. Proponents argue against civilian ownership of semiautomatic military-style firearms with large capacity ammunition feeding devices. Assault rifles have automatic mode for rapid firing until trigger release. Post-ban models still included key features like detachable magazine and pistol grip. In the United States, fully automatic machine guns are strictly regulated under the NFA, with penalties for possessing unregistered firearms including fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years. Converting a semiautomatic firearm to \"full-auto\" without proper authorization is a federal offense. Parts kits to convert semiautomatic weapons to fully automatic are available but are also strictly regulated by the ATF. ATF monitors FFLs in the Southwest border region to prevent illegal gun trafficking by Mexican DTOs who hire straw purchasers to buy firearms, including \"military-style\" weapons and pistols with large cartridges. DTOs also seek .50 caliber sniper rifles. During FY2006 and FY2007, ATF focused on disrupting the illegal flow of guns from the United States into Mexico through \"Project Gunrunner.\" ATF agents investigated 187 firearms trafficking cases in FY2007 and recommended 465 defendants for prosecution. By the end of FY2008, ATF had deployed agents to the Southwest border at a cost of $32.2 million. In FY2009, the Administration's budget included an increase of $948,000 for Gunrunner, and Congress provided ATF with $10 million in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to ramp up efforts. In FY2009, Congress provided ATF with $10 million in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to ramp up Gunrunner. The FY2010 budget request includes $18 million and 92 permanent positions to support Project Gunrunner. The House-passed FY2010 appropriations bill would provide ATF with $1.106 billion. The House-passed bill (H.R. 2847) would provide ATF with $1.106 billion, including an $18 million increase for Gunrunner. The Senate-reported bill would allocate $1.121 billion for ATF, with a total funding of $61 million for Southwest border firearms trafficking. ATF also maintains an Electronic Trace Submission System in Mexico City for Mexican law enforcement. From FY2005 through FY2007, ATF traced over 11,700 firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, with approximately 90% originating in the United States. Nearly 75% of traced firearms were handguns and 25% were long guns. 25 machine guns were confiscated, with six traced back to U.S. military inventories. No public information was available on the number of semiautomatic assault weapons. Reports indicate that Mexican authorities recovered U.S. manufactured 66 millimeter anti-tank weapons from Mexican DTOs, caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from ATF crime gun trace data. Crime gun trace data are useful measurements of crime gun trends, but issues of consistent, random, and unbiased data collection have not been adequately addressed. In FY2008, ATF traced 7,743 firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, with 63.5% made in the United States, 29.5% imported, and 7% with unknown import status. E-Trace technology was deployed to nine U.S. consulates in Mexico to address illegal trafficking of firearms. The GAO reported that a significant number of firearms recovered in Mexico were traced back to the United States, with over 90% of traced firearms originating from the US in the last three years. Additionally, 68% of these firearms were manufactured in the United States. In FY2008, about 25% of firearms recovered in Mexico and traced back to the United States were semiautomatic variants of AK-47 and AR-15 rifles. Only a fraction of firearms recovered by Mexican authorities have been traced due to bureaucratic obstacles and lack of resources. The GAO reported that out of 23,159 firearms submissions, one machine gun was traced back to the Mexican government. Over the years, 160 firearms, or .70% of the total, were traced back to U.S. military inventories. U.S. officials stated there were no significant trafficking from military personnel or arsenals. GAO recommended updating ATF's reporting on firearms trafficking data and ensuring systematic data gathering on efforts to combat firearms trafficking. In the 110th and 111th Congress, bills were introduced to increase ATF resources for Project Gunrunner and assign agents to Mexico to combat firearms trafficking. The Senate did not take action on the M\u00e9rida Initiative bill, while Senator Bingaman and Representatives Cuellar and Rodriguez introduced similar bills in both Congresses. Representative Rodriguez introduced bills for Project Gunrunner funding and border security measures, including deploying federal agents in case of emergencies. Current U.S. firearm laws govern possession and transfer, but lack specific penalties for firearms trafficking, requiring enforcement to work within existing statutes. Law enforcement and prosecutors in the Southwest border region work with federal statutes to combat illegal gun trafficking. Cases from the Southern District of Texas show that long investigations often reveal individuals involved in firearms trafficking, leading to prosecutions under laws like the GCA. Other U.S. Attorney Offices handle similar cases involving firearms trafficking. In February 2008, four men were arrested by ATF agents in connection with a 10-month long investigation under ATF's Project Gunrunner in the Southern District of Texas. The defendants were charged with 26 counts of violating federal firearms statutes, including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)(i)-(ii), which carries penalties of up to 30 years' imprisonment for possessing certain types of firearms. The defendants were charged with violating federal firearms statutes, including possession of illegal firearms such as machine guns and destructive devices. These offenses carry penalties of up to 10 years' imprisonment. Additionally, statutes from the NFA were at issue, making it unlawful to possess unregistered firearms. In October 2008, a defendant was sentenced to prison for trafficking firearms by paying others to make straw purchases. The defendant pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make false statements in firearms transactions and was found to be the organizer of the trafficking operation. He was prosecuted under two provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(e), which carry penalties of up to $10,000 fine and/or 10 years' imprisonment. The defendant was sentenced to 46 months in prison for organizing transactions involving false statements in firearms purchases. Four co-defendants were also sentenced for making false statements on firearms purchase forms under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A), with sentences ranging from probation to home confinement. In December 2008, a defendant pleaded guilty to eight counts of federal firearms statutes after purchasing over 500 firearms to smuggle into Mexico for resale. He would order specific firearms from dealers in Texas, list himself as the buyer, and evade sales taxes by claiming the firearms were for resale. The defendant used a motor home compartment to smuggle the firearms for deliveries to various locations. The defendant smuggled firearms into Mexico using a motor home compartment for deliveries to various locations. The federal firearms statutes implicated in this case carry penalties of fines and/or imprisonment for making false statements or exporting merchandise contrary to US laws. The defendant smuggled firearms into Mexico using a motor home compartment for deliveries to various locations. Federal firearms statutes carry penalties of fines and/or imprisonment for making false statements or exporting merchandise contrary to US laws, including fines and/or imprisonment for shipping firearms in interstate or foreign commerce with intent to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year. The defendant smuggled firearms into Mexico using a motor home compartment for deliveries to various locations. Trafficking and smuggling firearms have subtle differences, with trafficking involving diverting items into illegal markets and smuggling involving importing/exporting in violation of the law. Smuggling firearms into the US with intent to violate drug or violence laws can result in up to 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine. There is no specific provision prohibiting smuggling firearms out of the US. Persons caught smuggling firearms out of the United States are typically charged under a general smuggling provision, as seen in a case in Victoria, Texas. Smugglers often carry only a small number of firearms at a time, claiming them as personal property to avoid detection. Establishing a criminal offense can be challenging if the individuals are not prohibited from possessing firearms, making it difficult to intervene before they cross the border. Trafficking often involves a smaller quantity of guns to evade detection of illicit activities. The ATF needs to quickly follow up on trafficking leads to prevent wider schemes. Investigators and prosecutors use existing laws to charge gun traffickers with multiple violations, such as dealing firearms without a license or off the books. Gun traffickers are prosecuted under various provisions of the GCA and NFA. The existing statutory scheme does not include firearm-specific federal provisions that cover a wider range of illegal activities related to firearms, such as straw purchases or directing someone to buy a firearm for a prohibited person. The recent GAO report on firearms trafficking highlights challenges in federal firearms laws, including restrictions on collecting information, lack of background checks for private sales, and reporting limitations for multiple sales. These challenges hinder U.S. efforts to combat arms trafficking to Mexico. The ATF heavily relies on its firearms tracing program to identify individuals involved in trafficking schemes. The ATF's ability to trace firearms is limited due to restrictions on maintaining a national registry of firearms. This hinders the success of tracing crime guns, especially for secondary firearms trafficked to Mexico. ATF may trace a firearm to the first retail purchaser but lacks information on secondhand purchases without further investigation. Private firearms sales, including those at gun shows, do not require background checks, allowing for the transfer of firearms without verifying the purchaser's eligibility. This lack of required checks may hinder efforts to combat gun trafficking, as highlighted in a GAO report. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act mandates background checks for nonlicensed individuals purchasing firearms from FFLs, but private sales are exempt from this requirement. This loophole means sellers are not obligated to ensure buyers are not prohibited from owning firearms, such as felons or illegal aliens. The GAO report highlighted the importance of reporting multiple handgun sales to the Attorney General to aid in arms trafficking investigations. Implementing a similar reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales, especially for rifles and shotguns capable of accepting large capacity ammunition feeding devices, could provide early warning of potential firearms trafficking schemes. This is crucial as 27% of firearms recovered in Mexico and traced from FY2004 to FY2008 were long guns. The GAO report emphasized the importance of reporting multiple handgun sales to aid in arms trafficking investigations. Implementing a similar requirement for long guns, especially those capable of accepting large capacity ammunition feeding devices, could provide early warning of trafficking schemes. Congress has passed laws prohibiting a registry of firearms or owners, and proposals to regulate private firearm transfers at gun shows have not been enacted. Past legislative proposals and current law only address reporting requirements for handguns, not long guns. During the 110th Congress, anti-gun trafficking measures were introduced to strengthen provisions of the GCA, including repealing limitations on ATF firearm trace data, requiring comprehensive crime gun tracing, establishing new recordkeeping requirements for second-hand firearms, increasing penalties for violations, and implementing a federal one-handgun-per-month limit. Senator Charles Schumer also introduced the Anti-Gun Trafficking Penalties Enhancement Act of 2007. The 110th Congress introduced anti-gun trafficking measures to strengthen provisions of the GCA, including repealing limitations on ATF firearm trace data, requiring comprehensive crime gun tracing, and increasing penalties for violations. Additionally, the legislation required reporting of stolen or crime-related firearms to ATF and expanded the AG's authority to conduct unannounced inspections of FFLs. Certain offenses under the GCA were made predicate offenses under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. In the 110th Congress, anti-gun trafficking measures were introduced to strengthen provisions of the GCA, including increasing penalties for violations. Bills like S. 77 and H.R. 1895 aimed to address issues such as shipping firearms to prohibited persons and receiving firearms while under felony indictment. Representative Peter King also introduced H.R. 4818, proposing a new \"gun trafficking\" crime punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to strengthen provisions of the GCA, including increasing penalties for violations. Representative Peter King proposed a new \"gun trafficking\" crime punishable by up to 20 years of imprisonment for specific conditions related to the sale or transfer of firearms. The bill proposed a new \"gun trafficking\" crime with penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for specific conditions related to the sale or transfer of firearms. It also included provisions to increase funding for Project Safe Neighborhoods and required reports on firearms tracing and prosecutions. The End Gun Trafficking Act introduced in 2008 aimed to prevent the sale of handguns to non-licensees within a 30-day period and limited unlicensed individuals to purchasing only one handgun in the same timeframe. Violations would result in fines and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. The End Gun Trafficking Act of 2008 aimed to prevent multiple handgun sales within a 30-day period, with violators facing fines and/or imprisonment for up to 10 years. The bill also sought to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and address incomplete information on Southwest border gun trafficking. Questions remain about Southwest border gun trafficking, including recent military investigations between the US and Mexico involving heavy weapons. ATF trace data is also questioned regarding the scope of illegal gun trafficking between the two countries. The ATF trace data raises questions about gun trafficking between the US and Mexico, including straw purchases, firearms traced back to gun shows, and corrupt federal firearms licensees. The data also examines illegal military small arms trafficking and the impact of \"Tiahrt\" restrictions on assisting law enforcement. Additionally, concerns are raised about the ratification of the Inter-American Gun Trafficking Convention and the adequacy of federal statutes in targeting gun trafficking on the Southwest Border. The need for a more complex statute to target gun trafficking on the Southwest Border is being questioned due to the scale and proliferation of the ongoing trafficking activities."
