    "content": "The Act titled \"Freedom of Choice Act of 1995\" is established. The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade set limits on States' power to restrict a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. The strict scrutiny standard was initially applied but has since been modified, leading to some States limiting this right. Certain States have restricted women's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy or use certain forms of contraception, leading to an increase in unsafe abortions, burdening interstate commerce, interfering with freedom of travel, and straining the resources of States that provide access to these services. Certain States have restricted women's access to safe and legal abortion, obstructed medical professionals from providing health services, hindered access to contraceptives, discriminated against women who cannot afford interstate travel, and infringed upon women's rights secured by Federal and State law. Congress cannot legislate on these matters. Congress has the power to enact legislation to create statutory rights in areas of national concern, including prohibiting State interference with interstate commerce, liberty, or equal protection of the laws. The purpose of this Act is to establish limitations on States restricting women's freedom to terminate a pregnancy, aligning with constitutional protections.
