    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Real Solutions to World Hunger Act of 2002\" and includes a table of contents. The \"Real Solutions to World Hunger Act of 2002\" includes provisions for safety and ecological impact measures for genetically engineered exports, promoting sustainable agriculture research internationally, and imposing a tax on biotech companies to support this research. Congress emphasizes that mandatory labeling and safety testing of genetically engineered foods are not hindrances to addressing world hunger. The dominant causes of world hunger are rooted in social-economic failures, with technologies like genetically engineered food playing a limited role. Expensive genetically engineered foods may exacerbate the barrier to a consistent food supply, as developing countries cannot afford this technology. Agroecological interventions have been successful in helping developing nations feed themselves. Agroecological interventions have been successful in helping developing nations feed themselves with higher yields and improved environmental practices at reasonable costs. Requiring biotech companies to provide necessary resources to mitigate hunger concerns, domestic or foreign, is appropriate. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a genetically engineered animal is defined as an animal containing genetically engineered material or produced with it. Similarly, a genetically engineered plant is a plant with genetically engineered material or produced from a genetically engineered seed. Genetically engineered material is present in plants if they have been treated with it, excluding the use of manure as fertilizer. Genetically engineered seed refers to seeds containing or produced with genetically engineered material, excluding manure as a fertilizer. The term \"genetically engineered material\" refers to material altered at the molecular or cellular level by means not possible under natural conditions. This includes techniques like recombinant DNA, RNA, gene deletion, and introducing foreign genes. A \"biotech company\" is defined as a person engaged in creating genetically engineered products. A biotech company is a person creating genetically engineered material for commercial exploitation and obtaining patent rights. It does not include the company's employees. SEC. 3. ENSURING SAFETY AND MITIGATING ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF UNITED STATES EXPORTS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ANIMALS, PLANTS, AND SEEDS. It is illegal to export genetically engineered animals, plants, or seeds to a foreign country if they have not received necessary federal approval in the US or if the foreign country has not certified the ecological impacts of the importation. The importation of genetically engineered animals, plants, or seeds must have their ecological impacts mitigated to the satisfaction of the foreign government. SEC. 4. PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH REGARDING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE TO ASSIST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. The Secretary of Agriculture may provide grants to designated international research institutions for sustainable agriculture techniques in developing countries. Recipients must use funds as intended, and eligible institutions include the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Grants for sustainable agriculture in developing countries will be provided on a competitive basis using the Sustainable Agriculture Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury will direct the US Executive Directors at international financial institutions to not push for prohibiting countries eligible for HIPC Initiative assistance from requiring compulsory licensing for genetically engineered animals, plants, and seeds. Additionally, a tax on biotech companies will fund sustainable agriculture research. Tax on biotech companies will fund sustainable agriculture research under a new part in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A 1% tax is imposed on corporations for gross income attributable to marketing genetically engineered organisms or holding patents on them. Genetically engineered organism is defined as an organism altered at the molecular or cellular level by unnatural means. The text discusses the definition of a genetically engineered organism as one altered at the molecular or cellular level by unnatural means, such as doubling genes or introducing foreign genes. It also includes organisms produced through reproduction involving altered characteristics of the original organism. Part VIII. Tax on genetic engineering businesses. The amendments made by this subsection apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. Creation of the Sustainable Agriculture Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Sustainable Agriculture Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, funded by taxes under section 59B, and available for grants under the Real Solutions to World Hunger Act of 2002. The Sustainable Agriculture Trust Fund, funded by taxes under section 59B, is available for grants under the Real Solutions to World Hunger Act of 2002."
