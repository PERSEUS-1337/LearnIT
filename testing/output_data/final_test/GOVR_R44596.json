Subsequent years saw funding for construction in Djibouti, Bahrain, Diego Garcia, Romania, and airfield improvements in various European countries. The FY2016 appropriation focused on an AEGIS Ashore Missile Defense Complex in Poland, with additional funding for ship-related construction in Bahrain and airfield improvements in Oman, Niger, and Djibouti. The FY2017 request of $172.4 million is mainly for airfield improvements in Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative.
