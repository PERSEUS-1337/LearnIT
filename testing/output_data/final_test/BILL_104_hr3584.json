    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Workplace Violence Prevention Tax Credit Act of 1996\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress recognizes the increasing awareness of workplace violence against women, its severe implications for health and safety, and the high prevalence of homicides and rapes in the workplace. Workplace violence against women is a significant issue, with husbands and boyfriends committing acts of violence, and women being more likely to be attacked by someone they know. Surveys show that domestic violence negatively impacts productivity, attendance, and healthcare costs in companies. Corporate executives and security directors highlight the heavy toll that workplace violence takes on American women and businesses. Domestic violence is a high-risk security problem in the workplace, with 94 percent of corporate security directors ranking it as such. Collaboration between various sectors is necessary to combat violence against women at work, including legal, medical, social services, business, and religious communities. Congress should also encourage companies to implement education and safety programs to address this issue. SEC. 3.
