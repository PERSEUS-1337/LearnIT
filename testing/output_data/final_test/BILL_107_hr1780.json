    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Volunteer Firefighter's Relief Act\" and includes a new section allowing deductions for contributions to volunteer firefighter savings accounts in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Volunteer Firefighter's Relief Act\" allows qualified volunteer firefighters to deduct contributions to their savings accounts, up to a maximum of $500 per year. A qualified volunteer firefighter is a member in good standing of a volunteer fire department. The term 'volunteer firefighter savings account' refers to a trust created in the US for the exclusive benefit of an individual and their beneficiaries. The trust must meet specific requirements such as only accepting cash contributions, having a trustee who meets certain criteria, not investing in life insurance contracts, and not commingling assets with other property. The interest in an individual's account in a volunteer firefighter savings account is nonforfeitable. Distributions from the account are generally included in the recipient's gross income for the taxable year. However, excess contributions returned before the due date of the return are not subject to taxation. Excess contributions exceeding the allowable deduction must be distributed before the tax return deadline, with no deduction allowed for the excess amount. The distribution must include the net income attributable to the excess contribution, which will be included in the individual's gross income for that taxable year. Rollover contributions are exempt from these rules. Paragraph (1) does not apply to payments from a volunteer firefighter savings account if the amount is transferred to an individual retirement plan within 60 days. This exemption does not apply if the account holder received a similar payment within the previous year. The tax treatment of volunteer firefighter savings accounts exempts them from taxation unless certain conditions are met, such as engaging in prohibited transactions. Rules similar to those for investment in collectibles apply, and any account subject to unrelated business income tax if it ceases to be a volunteer firefighter savings account. If a prohibited transaction occurs in a volunteer firefighter savings account, it will cease to be a volunteer firefighter savings account as of the first day of the taxable year. The account will be treated as distributing all its assets in such cases. If a prohibited transaction occurs in a volunteer firefighter savings account, it will cease to be a volunteer firefighter savings account as of the first day of the taxable year. The account will be treated as distributing all its assets. If the account is used as security for a loan, that portion will be treated as distributed to the individual. Contributions are deemed made on the last day of the preceding taxable year. The trustee of a volunteer firefighter savings account must report contributions, distributions, and other relevant matters to the Secretary and the account holder as required by regulations.
