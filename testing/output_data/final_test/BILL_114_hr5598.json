The Congress recognizes the upcoming 400th anniversary of the Mayflower voyage and the founding of Plymouth Colony, highlighting the cultural contributions and traditions that shaped the United States through the interaction of the Wampanoag and English peoples. The settlers, including the Pilgrims, and the Mayflower symbolize freedom and law, while the Wampanoag's assistance and association with the Pilgrims created an important legacy. The Mayflower Compact, signed before landing in Plymouth, was a cornerstone for self-governance in the New World. Over 20 million descendants worldwide trace their ancestry back to Mayflower passengers. Plymouth 400, Inc. was established in 2009 to ensure a national observance of the Plymouth 400th anniversary. The Plymouth 400th anniversary will focus on exploration, innovation, immigration, self-governance, religious freedom, and thanksgiving. Plymouth 400, Inc. will lead efforts for a commemorative coin series and postage stamps. The commemorative coins will bring attention to Plymouth Colony's legacy and help finance related activities. The commemorative coins will support a national observance in 2020 and 2021 of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim landing, including the signing of the Mayflower Compact and the \"First Thanksgiving\" feast. People visit Plymouth to see historic sites and learn about the Pilgrims, Wampanoag people, and the Mayflower's significance. These symbols represent freedom, family, law, and justice. The commemorative coins will support a national observance in 2020 and 2021 of the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim landing, including the signing of the Mayflower Compact and the \"First Thanksgiving\" feast. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins with specific weights, diameters, and compositions. The coins minted under this Act will be legal tender and considered numismatic items under title 31, United States Code. SEC. 4. DESIGN OF COINS. The design of the coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the landing and settlement of Plymouth Colony, the signing of the Mayflower Compact, and the role of the indigenous Wampanoag tribes. Each coin will include the coin's value, the year of minting (2020, 2021, or 2020-2021), and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be selected by the Secretary after consulting with Plymouth 400, Inc. The organizations involved in the design selection process for the Plymouth Colony commemorative coins include Plymouth 400, Inc., Plimoth Plantation, Inc., Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, Wampanoag Tribe of Gayhead (Aquinnah), General Society of Mayflower Descendants, Pilgrim Society, Plymouth Antiquarian Society, Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum, Massachusetts Cultural Council, and Massachusetts Historical Society. The design will be reviewed by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF COINS. Coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities from a single US Mint facility during a 2-year period starting January 1, 2020. SEC. 6. SALE OF COINS.

The Comptroller General of the United States will audit the organizations receiving funds. No surcharge may be included for the issuance of any coin under this Act.
