The Act, known as the \"Strong Forests Grow Strong Communities Act of 2014,\" defines key terms such as \"annual volume requirement\" and \"appropriate congressional committees.\" The annual volume requirement specifies the minimum volume of national forest materials that must be harvested, excluding certain types of sales. The appropriate congressional committees are identified as the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives. The \"Strong Forests Grow Strong Communities Act of 2014\" defines terms like \"national forest materials\" and \"National Forest System.\" The Act specifies the minimum volume of materials to be harvested and identifies the relevant congressional committees. The Act of July 22, 1937 (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012) defines terms like \"Secretary,\" \"sustained yield,\" and \"State,\" which includes Puerto Rico. The Secretary must publish the annual volume requirement for each unit of the National Forest System within 30 days of the Act's enactment. Once published, the annual volume requirement for a unit cannot be reduced without Congress's consent in a subsequent law. The Secretary must manage the sale of national forest materials to meet the annual volume requirement for each unit of the National Forest System. They can modify land management plans to achieve this goal and must comply with the Endangered Species Act if a sale may impact endangered species. The Secretary must issue a determination under the Endangered Species Act to ensure that a proposed sale will not harm the species. The determination is reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce within 30 days for approval or rejection. The Secretary's determination under the Endangered Species Act must be reviewed by the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce within 30 days for approval or rejection. If rejected, recommendations for measures to avoid jeopardy to species must be provided. The Secretary of the Interior or Commerce must engage in formal consultation within 90 days if a determination is rejected under the Endangered Species Act. SEC. 5. State management of national forest system lands when annual volume requirements are not met. State may manage a National Forest System unit if the Secretary fails to meet volume requirements for five years. Management can be done directly by the State, through agreements with political subdivisions, or contracts with third parties. If a National Forest System unit spans multiple states, a state's request for management authority only applies to lands within that state. The Secretary must approve the request within 90 days unless the state lacks funds, the request is incomplete, or the proposed agreement is insufficient. The state has the opportunity to amend the request if needed. If the Secretary denies a request under subsection (a), they must provide clear reasons for the denial and any deficiencies in the request. The State can then resubmit the request with amendments. If the Secretary does not approve or deny a request within 90 days, it is deemed approved. The request submitted under subsection (a) for a cooperative agreement shall include a letter from the Governor identifying the National Forest unit, the proposed agreement, the role of political subdivisions, and proof of State funding. The cooperative agreement must outline the elements of State management. The cooperative agreement between the Secretary and the Governor of a State for managing a National Forest unit includes the State's management responsibilities, a cost-sharing agreement where the State contributes at least 50% of the total management costs, and the determination of the State's contribution based on a categorical assessment of all costs. During the cooperative agreement, the State manages the unit and employee salary data. In the event of a natural disaster, the State takes authority over recovery initiatives, sharing costs with the Federal government based on a cost-sharing agreement. The State assumes the cost and administration of repairing damages from natural disasters. Revenue from fees and royalties is also collected. The revenue from fees, royalties, and other sources related to the unit will be distributed to State and Federal entities as per the cost-sharing agreement. The Federal entity's funds will be at the discretion of the Secretary. Transition procedures from Federal to State management include guarantees for Federal employees and State's use of management funds. The transfer of authority over the unit to the State includes hiring additional staff, State-directed management, State-appointed manager, and implementation with State employees. Special use permits issued to the Secretary will be transferred to the State. Lands open to mineral entry under the General Mining Act of 1872 will remain open unless changed by a State mineral closing order. State laws supersede Federal laws on National Forest System lands managed by a State under a cooperative agreement. The United States retains ownership of the lands. The cooperative agreement can be terminated if the State defaults on a payment. If the State defaults on a payment, Federal entities will assume financial liabilities. The State can also be in breach of the cooperative agreement, leading to termination of the agreement as determined by a US court. SEC. 6. ANNUAL REPORT. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress within 60 days after each calendar year, detailing the volume requirements, units not meeting requirements, state-managed units, harvested volume, preparation costs, and sales revenues. The report must also be available on the Forest Service website."
