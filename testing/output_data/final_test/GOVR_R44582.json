    "content": "Every year, Congress considers legislation that creates or modifies federal programs. The funding structure of a program influences its design and impacts assumptions about its stability. Funding decisions also affect Congress's power of the purse. The federal government's funding framework is based on authorizations and appropriations. Authorizations establish legal authority for government actions, while appropriations allow for future payments. Funding for programs is determined by the type and source of funding, with mandatory spending controlled by authorization acts. The federal government's funding framework is based on authorizations and appropriations. Mandatory spending is determined by authorization acts, which establish the program and require certain payments to be made. Discretionary spending is determined by appropriations laws, which decide how much to fund a program. Funding sources can come from the General Fund of the Treasury or dedicated revenue sources. Funding mechanisms are established through authorization or appropriations laws. The funding mechanism for programs can be established through authorization or appropriations laws. Understanding whether the funding involves an authorization act, an appropriations measure, or both is important. Appropriations acts are enacted annually, while authorizations may be enacted as needed. Control over authorizations and appropriations is divided between separate committees in Congress. This results in different schedules, committee processes, and methods of legislative review for funding mechanisms involving appropriations acts. The report discusses the different funding mechanisms for government programs, including discretionary and mandatory funding types. It also explains the various budget process options and general issues for Congress when evaluating funding mechanisms. The report outlines funding mechanisms for government programs, including discretionary and mandatory funding types. It describes general budget process principles but does not cover all variations or budget enforcement rules. Other issues outside the report's scope include types of budget authority and specific budget execution implications. Funding mechanisms are generally classified under the congressional budget process. Under the congressional budget process, funding mechanisms are classified as discretionary or mandatory spending. Discretionary spending authorizes activities but leaves funding decisions to annual appropriations. Mandatory spending is controlled by an authorization act, usually funding the activity in the same law. The text discusses the contrasting roles of authorizations and appropriations in discretionary and mandatory funding mechanisms, including examples of funding mechanisms for federal government programs and mixed approaches. It explains how mandatory spending is controlled by an authorization act, which may also contain provisions for future funding. This alternative approach is known as \"appropriated mandatory\" spending. Discretionary spending, accounting for 31% of federal spending in FY2016, funds various activities including grants, equipment purchases, defense, and government operations. Congressional control over money and policy decisions for discretionary programs is divided between authorization and appropriations processes. This allows for policy decisions to be made as needed through authorization laws or periodically. Money decisions for discretionary programs are typically made annually through appropriations laws, separate from policy decisions. This can lead to variations in funding levels and program stability from year to year. Congressional authority for funding must be established before the program is funded, either specifically or more broadly. The National Apprenticeship Act, enacted in 1939, grants the Secretary of Labor authority to oversee apprenticeships. This includes formulating labor standards, promoting apprenticeship programs, and cooperating with state agencies and the Secretary of Education. The Office of Apprenticeship within the Department of Labor registers apprenticeships under this authority. The Office of Apprenticeship in the Department of Labor registers employers' apprenticeship programs to comply with federal standards. Legislative review of this authority occurs as needed, with funding decisions made annually through the appropriations process. In FY2016, $90,000,000 was allocated for expanding opportunities in apprenticeship programs under the National Apprenticeship Act. The National Apprenticeship Act authorizes the Secretary to carry out activities through grants, agreements, and contracts with states and entities. Appropriations can be provided for general or specific purposes under this authority. Authorization provisions implicitly allow for future appropriations for the program's purposes. The National Apprenticeship Act authorizes activities through grants, agreements, and contracts with states and entities, implicitly allowing for future appropriations. Authorization laws may also explicitly authorize future appropriations, indicating the level of funding needed for the program. The authorization of funding levels in legislation signifies the necessary funding for a specific purpose, with the actual funding determined through appropriations laws. Explicitly authorizing a dollar amount also sets a limit on appropriations, although Congress can override this limit. For example, the Child Care and Development Block Grant authorizes specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2015-2020. The Child Care and Development Block Grant authorizes specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2015-2020, with subsequent legislative action determining the actual funding available each year. The FY2016 appropriation was $2,761,000,000 for child care assistance for low-income families. The FY2016 appropriation for child care assistance was $2,761,000,000 for low-income families. Additionally, $127,206,000 is allocated for improving infant and toddler care quality. Indefinite authorizations of appropriations allow for flexibility in determining specific funding amounts. The FY2016 appropriation for child care assistance was $2,761,000,000 for low-income families, with $127,206,000 allocated for improving infant and toddler care quality. Procedural flexibility is maintained for determining specific funding amounts. The appropriation for FY2016 included $5,000,000 for research on violence against women, which will be administered by the Office of Justice Programs. Even without explicit authorization of appropriations, federal agencies can still implement programs. If an authorization of appropriations expires, subsequent appropriations may be considered unauthorized under congressional rules. However, the expiration of an authorization does not affect the legal authority for the government to engage in related programs. Congress has the legal authority to implement and operate federal programs through appropriations acts, which determine the funding levels. Authorization laws establish program parameters, while appropriations laws decide the funding amounts for discretionary spending programs. The congressional budget process determines budget priorities and discretionary funding for programs through the appropriations process. Authorization laws may have temporary provisions to prompt regular legislative action. The National Defense Authorization Act provisions require annual reauthorization for defense-related programs since 1962. However, regular enactment of annual authorization laws is limited. Congress may not renew provisions before they expire, such as those for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which have lapsed for months or years before being renewed. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act provisions may lapse for months or years before being renewed due to congressional deliberations. Funding for programs authorized by the ESEA continues through appropriations each fiscal year even after authorizations expire. Decisions made during the authorization process impact federal program nature and funding levels, influencing discretionary spending decisions. Program funding levels inform congressional decision-making but do not guarantee funding. The appropriations decision-making process for discretionary spending occurs within a \"top-down\" funding structure where programs compete for budgetary resources. Congress uses this process to prioritize funding based on authorized purposes and current budget constraints. Appropriations decisions also serve as an opportunity for Congress to make policy changes to federal government programs. The appropriations process allows for policy changes in federal programs, such as setting new requirements or limiting activities. For example, the FY2014 appropriations law for the Department of Housing and Urban Development altered how local housing authorities set flat rents and redefined \"extremely low-income.\" Discretionary spending's annual decision-making process affects funding predictability for recipients and Congress's evaluation of funds. Discretionary spending can lead to unpredictable funding levels for recipients, as programs may fluctuate annually based on various factors. Agencies may adjust activities based on budget resources, such as reducing employees or cutting expenses. Congress can revisit programs yearly under a discretionary spending approach. Mandatory spending, around 63% of federal spending in FY2016, funds entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Authorization acts control both money and policy decisions for these programs, with appropriations provided on varying schedules and amounts each fiscal year. Mandatory spending authorizations determine funding parameters for programs and policies, with appropriations provided through annual processes. The role of authorizations and appropriations in congressional budget decisions differs from discretionary spending. Tradeoffs between congressional review frequency and funding stability vary based on funding structure characteristics. Mandatory appropriations control funding for entities, programs, or policies by specifying dollar amounts or formulas for a defined fiscal year or indefinitely. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) at HHS exemplifies this practice, providing health coverage to low-income children and pregnant women above Medicaid eligibility levels. The federal appropriation for CHIP allotments to states is provided by the Social Security Act through a set dollar amount tied to specific fiscal years. The lump sum amount for each fiscal year is divided amongst the states based on a formula established in the law. The CHIP authorization requires additional appropriations beyond the specified fiscal years. The funding structure mandates specific amounts, necessitating new laws for any changes. An example is the Social Security Act's $3,000,000 appropriation for the HHS Technical Assistance for Tribal Child Welfare Programs account. The $3,000,000 appropriation for the HHS Technical Assistance for Tribal Child Welfare Programs account is to improve services and outcomes for Indian children and families. Any changes to this amount would require new legislation. Mandatory spending for such programs is typically based on a formula rather than a set amount. Mandatory spending for programs like Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is based on a formula to fund benefits for eligible individuals, making adjustments unnecessary. The SSDI program translates a worker's earnings into benefit payments, with spending dependent on the level of benefits needed each year. In FY2014, total spending on SSDI benefits was $141.3 billion. The total spending on SSDI benefits was $141.3 billion in FY2014 and $142.9 billion in FY2015. Legislative action would be required to change the amount of spending for future years. Appropriated mandatory funding is used for federal programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Grants to States for Medicaid. The curr_chunk discusses how appropriated mandatory authorizations establish entitlements to payments or funding for programs like Medicaid, Trade Adjustment Assistance, Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners, and veterans' disability compensation. Future funding needs to be provided separately as the authorizations do not include appropriations language for financing. Annual appropriations acts provide funding for appropriated mandatory spending. The level of appropriated mandatory spending is determined by authorization law, not annual appropriations acts. The funding in appropriations acts is provided to fulfill the legal obligation established by the authorizing statute. Some programs, like the HHS Social Services Block Grant, specify the total appropriation amount in the authorizing statute. The purpose of SSBG funding is to promote economic self-sufficiency and support for families, and to prevent neglect, abuse, and exploitation of children. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds are used by states to support various social services, including child care, foster care, and services for the disabled. The authorizing statute specifies the funding for the program and outlines the goals for which the funds should be used. The Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds are allocated to states according to the authorizing statute, with a specified total amount of $1,700,000,000 for each fiscal year. The appropriation for SSBG is provided annually through the appropriations process. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income support to needy aged, blind, or disabled individuals based on a formula. The authorization does not limit benefits, allowing for sums to be appropriated as needed. The SSI program allows for appropriations to be made based on projected benefits for the fiscal year. The appropriation for FY2016 was $46,305,733,000 for administrative expenses and payments to beneficiaries. The SSI program appropriation for FY2016 was $46,305,733,000 for administrative expenses and payments to beneficiaries. An additional $101,000,000 is allocated for research and demonstrations under specific sections of the Social Security Act, with funds available until September 30, 2018. After June 15 of the fiscal year, additional funds may be used for unanticipated costs incurred for benefit payments under title XVI of the Social Security Act. This structure allows the SSA to cover unexpected benefit obligations in the last months of the fiscal year. Mandatory spending authorizations control policy and spending decisions, unlike discretionary spending authorizations. Authorizing committees for mandatory spending both control the program and provide the spending. Appropriations committees may not control the spending level for appropriated mandatory spending, but annual appropriations laws finance obligations incurred by authorization acts. Timing of authorization decisions for mandatory spending is crucial. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established special diabetes programs with mandatory appropriations for FY1998-FY2002. Subsequent appropriations were provided for FY2003 and extended through FY2008. Further extensions have been enacted for shorter intervals, requiring frequent congressional action. The Affordable Care Act established a permanent mandatory appropriation in 2010, but changes to the amount or duration of spending may still occur. The annual enactment of appropriations allows Congress to make adjustments to funded programs. In the SSI example, appropriations language can set limits for research and demonstrations, in addition to program requirements. Mandatory spending decisions in Congress are decentralized, with the total amount each fiscal year depending on various factors. Unlike discretionary spending controlled by appropriations committees, there is no single process establishing an aggregate level of mandatory spending annually. Spending results from past mandatory funding decisions made through authorization laws. Mandatory spending programs are funded through authorization laws, with some programs funded via a formula. Factors outside Congress's control can affect the number of beneficiaries and payment levels. Funding decisions for mandatory spending have a longer time horizon, balancing stability for beneficiaries with Congress's ability to reevaluate. Congress may choose to fund programs via mandatory spending for predictability and to ensure future funding, especially for entitlement programs like Medicare. Observers suggest changes to spending affecting benefits should be phased in for future beneficiaries. Mandatory funding decisions have a longer time horizon but may need periodic renewal, allowing Congress to reevaluate programs and funding before expiration. The approach of providing appropriations for set fiscal years can make funding less predictable for recipients. Some programs are funded with both mandatory and discretionary spending, which can be used for identical or closely related purposes. Mandatory and discretionary approaches can fund identical or closely related purposes within programs or multiple programs with similar missions. Examples include the Pell Grant program at the Department of Education and various programs at HHS. Entitlement programs may have mandatory benefits funded through discretionary spending. Congress may choose a mixed approach based on budget and policy considerations, impacting authorization and appropriations processes. The federal Health Center Program at HHS awards grants to support outpatient primary care facilities for low-income individuals or those in underserved areas. Funding for the program increased from $1.7 billion in FY2005 to $5.1 billion in FY2016, with a mix of discretionary and mandatory appropriations. The Affordable Care Act created the Community Health Center Fund, providing $9.5 billion in mandatory appropriations between FY2011 and FY2015. The Affordable Care Act created the Community Health Center Fund with $9.5 billion in mandatory appropriations between FY2011 and FY2015 to support health center operations. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 extended the funding through FY2017 with $7.2 billion. The 1996 welfare reform law consolidated federal programs supporting child care for low-income families into the Child Care Entitlement to States, funded with mandatory spending. This new block grant targeted families on welfare or at risk of receiving welfare, transferring funding to each state's lead agency managing the discretionary CCDBG funding. The consolidation of child care programs in 1996 aimed to address concerns about effectiveness and efficiency by streamlining federal roles, reducing conflicting rules, and increasing state flexibility. Funding for programs is divided into mandatory and discretionary portions, with the former being more predictable. Combining mandatory and discretionary funding approaches can provide predictability for budgetary resources for mandatory spending purposes while allowing annual reevaluation of appropriations. This structure allows Congress to direct administrative activities for programs like SSA's OASI, SSDI, and SSI through the appropriations process. The FY2016 LAE appropriation directed SSA to revise guidelines for evaluating Huntington's disease. Mixed funding approaches control aspects of funding through authorization and appropriations processes. Mandatory funding for the Health Center Program increased steadily, while discretionary appropriations decreased from $2.2 billion in FY2011 to $1.5 billion in FY2016. The combination of mandatory and discretionary funding for a program can lead to inconsistent funding outcomes from year to year. General Fund of the Treasury (GF) is the default place where federal government collections are deposited for use. The General Fund of the Treasury is where federal government collections are deposited for use. There are two types of funding sources: collections deposited into the GF for spending obligations, and dedicated collections that fund specific programs. These funding sources can be used for mandatory or discretionary spending, with examples provided to illustrate the variety of options available. The General Fund of the Treasury is where federal government collections are deposited for use, including funds from various sources. Funds collected by a government entity are deposited into the GF and become budgetary resources for meeting obligations. The GF serves as a funding source for both discretionary and mandatory spending, with funds used to pay for expenses. Discretionary spending from the General Fund (GF) is the default source of funding for appropriations unless specified otherwise. An example is the appropriation for the National Apprenticeship Act, where $90,000,000 was allocated for expanding apprenticeship programs. The funds come from the Treasury and are available for the Secretary to carry out activities through various agreements with states and entities. The General Fund (GF) is the default funding source for appropriations unless specified otherwise. For example, the National Apprenticeship Act is funded from the GF. Mandatory appropriations, like the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, also draw from the GF. This program supports home visiting services for families with young children in communities with poor child health indicators. The appropriations language for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program is similar to the National Apprenticeship Act. Dedicated collections may be directed to specific purposes and are usually credited to and expended from places in the Treasury other than the General Fund. Special fund or trust fund accounts in the Treasury hold funds specified by law for certain purposes, which can be used for mandatory or discretionary spending. The structure and control of collections in these accounts depend on whether they support mandatory or discretionary spending. For mandatory spending programs funded by dedicated collections, the authorization act provides authority to make, retain, and expend the collections for program purposes. An example is the fees collected by USCIS for immigration adjudication. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 authorizes the collection of fees for immigration and naturalization petitions. These fees are deposited into the \"Immigration Examinations Fee Account\" to cover the full costs of providing adjudication and naturalization services. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes fees to cover costs of immigration services, including naturalization. Fees can also cover administration costs. Fees collected are deposited into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account for expenses related to adjudication and naturalization services. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes fees to cover immigration services and naturalization costs. Fees collected are deposited into the Immigration Examinations Fee Account for adjudication and naturalization services. The mandatory appropriation for benefits is not limited by dollar amount and depends on available funds. Funding for SSDI comes from Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes and Self-Employment Contributions Act taxes deposited in the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The \"Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund\" is created to receive gifts, bequests, and appropriations for disability insurance. Funding comes from Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes and Self-Employment Contributions Act taxes. The Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund receives funding from Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes and Self-Employment Contributions Act taxes. The amount expended from the fund each fiscal year cannot exceed total collections and is based on the amount needed to pay benefits funded through the collections. The formula for DI trust fund collections is specified and not left up to the agency to determine. The formula for DI trust fund collections is specified and not left up to the agency to determine. Unlike dedicated collections for mandatory spending, discretionary spending funded through dedicated collections can be configured in two ways: authority to collect provided by an authorization act and authority to expend provided in appropriations acts, or both authority to collect and expend provided in appropriations acts. The Manufactured Housing Standards Program exemplifies both configurations. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to receive dedicated collections from manufacturers to fund monitoring and enforcement activities related to standards for manufactured housing. The act allows the Secretary to establish and collect fees from manufacturers to cover expenses incurred in carrying out responsibilities under the act. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 authorizes HUD to collect fees from manufacturers for monitoring and enforcement activities. Fees are deposited into the Manufactured Housing Fees Trust Fund and can only be used for approved purposes, subject to annual appropriations. Annual appropriations acts allocate specific amounts of collections for expenditure each fiscal year, such as the FY2016 appropriation of $10,500,000 for necessary expenses under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act. HUD is also authorized to collect and expend additional fees for the program, including fees for dispute resolution and installation programs. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development can collect fees from program participants, which are deposited into a fund for necessary expenses. The appropriations language allows HUD to use these collections for expenses related to the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act, as well as additional fees for dispute resolution and installation programs. These fees are deposited into the fund and subject to an overall cap on expenditures. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Health Surveillance and Program Support account at HHS operates similarly to HUD's manufactured housing fees. SAMHSA funds behavioral health data systems, national surveys, and surveillance activities for agency grantees and the public. Additional data analysis or publication orders may require fees collected and expended by SAMHSA. The Health Surveillance and Program Support account authorizes the collection and expenditure of fees for data analysis and publications under the PHS Act. The authority to collect fees is temporary and must be included in the relevant appropriations act each fiscal year. The Health Surveillance and Program Support account funds programs with mixed funding sources from the General Fund and dedicated collections. This approach is used for programs that offer both general government services and business-like benefits. An example is the Medicare federal insurance program, where dedicated collections cover some costs while the General Fund subsidizes the rest. Medicare Part A is funded through dedicated collections (payroll taxes) credited to the Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund. It provides insurance for hospital services, skilled nursing facility services, home health visits, and hospice services for qualified beneficiaries. Medicare Part A is funded through dedicated collections in the HI trust fund, including premiums from voluntary enrollees and federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. If the trust fund income is insufficient, legislative action may be needed to ensure full benefit payments. Medicare Part B is an optional program covering various medical services, funded by premiums from enrollees. Medicare Part B is funded by a combination of collections and the General Fund, deposited in the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund. Premiums cover 25% of program costs annually, with the General Fund covering the rest. Legislative action may occur for policy reasons, but not typically to address funding shortfalls. Both Part A and Part B have permanent authority to collect and expend funds. The funding structure for Medicare Part B and FDA activities involves a mix of dedicated collections and the General Fund. While Part B has permanent authority to collect and expend funds, FDA activities transitioned to this mixed approach between 1992 and 2012. Funding sources may require future legislative action if insufficient. The FDA's review of human drug applications for prescription drugs was funded by dedicated collections and the General Fund between 1992 and 2012. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 to address the lengthy approval process for new drugs, which was a concern for industry, consumer groups, and the FDA due to its impact on patient access to life-saving medications and manufacturers' ability to recoup research costs. The FDA receives additional funding from user fees paid by the pharmaceutical industry to support the review of human drug applications. The PDUFA user fees supplement discretionary appropriations from the General Fund and are contingent on maintaining a certain level of funding. Performance goals are negotiated with industry to set target completion times for review processes. The FDA is authorized to collect and expend user fees each year through appropriations acts. The PDUFA funding mechanism includes a five-year reauthorization cycle and annual appropriations process. It has been renewed four times, most recently in 2012, extending the authority to collect user fees through September 30, 2017. The FDA is authorized to collect fees for activities related to the review of human drugs, biologics, and medical devices. The FDA has the authority to collect user fees for the review of brand and generic human drugs, biologics, medical devices, and veterinary drugs. Various acts such as MDUFMA, ADUFA, and BPCIA have expanded this authority to include different types of drugs and devices. The FDA established a new regulatory authority for biosimilar drugs and generic prescription drugs through the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 and the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments. These user fee programs require a minimum level of appropriations and are authorized for a specific amount over a five-year period. The authority to expend the user fees is provided in annual appropriations acts, with the most recent authorization through September 30, 2017. The Innovation Act (P.L. 112-144) authorizes collections through September 30, 2017. The choice between using the General Fund (GF) or a dedicated collection for funding is based on program nature and purpose. The GF funds general government purposes, while a dedicated collection may fund business-like activities or provide additional services for a specific population. It can also enable government activities that lack budgetary resources. A mixed approach may be chosen when multiple considerations are at play. The structure of dedicated collections has implications for funding control and budget decision-making. Authorities for collection and expenditure can be permanent or temporary, with adjustments needed for sufficient budget resources. For example, in 2015, adjustments were made to ensure adequate funding levels. In 2015, adjustments were made to the SSDI funding to address funding issues caused by the aging population and changes in work opportunities. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 authorized a temporary reallocation of Social Security payroll tax to extend funding until 2023. This may require a revisit of the funding formula in the future. The annual appropriations process provides the authority to collect and expend funding for discretionary spending, which can be provided on a multiyear or permanent basis. Congress can specify or restructure aspects of the funding source during this process, such as modifying the amount of dedicated collections to fund programs like the Manufactured Housing Standard Program. The structure of a funding source adds complexity to the process. The funding structure impacts the stability and control of funding sources. Mandatory funding sources offer greater stability but can still be subject to congressional control through specified caps or time limits. Discretionary collections can be authorized for a set number of fiscal years or dollar amounts. The congressional budget process considers various factors when structuring funding mechanisms, such as the roles of authorizations and appropriations in spending decisions. Congress may choose between discretionary and mandatory funding based on factors like the optimal budgetary decision interval and control over spending. The funding mechanism for a program can be influenced by factors like discretionary or mandatory funding, budget process context, and potential funding sources. Congress must consider whether to use the General Fund or establish a dedicated funding source, which can impact budget decision-making. Congress must decide on the best funding mechanism for programs, considering factors like stability, predictability, and program purpose. This decision can impact budget decision-making and the ability to meet program needs. Congress must consider various factors when assessing the funding mechanism for programs, such as stability, predictability, and program needs. This decision can impact budget decision-making and the ability to meet program needs. Funding sources can range from user fees to special taxes or the General Fund, with the time interval for establishing the funding source affecting funding predictability or congressional review. Congress must consider factors like the nature of the program, funding stability, adaptability to variable funding levels, forecasting future funding needs, reevaluation frequency, alternative funding sources, evaluation schedules, and congressional control over funding. The report discusses the tensions between Congress's frequency of funding decisions for a program and the stability of that funding. Policymakers may have different perspectives on how to reconcile these tensions, leading to compromises in the funding mechanism chosen. As policymakers' perceptions evolve, the funding mechanism may be altered to better meet the program's needs. The report discusses how the funding mechanism may be altered to better reflect program needs and Congressional budget decisions. Tables summarize examples of various funding types and sources discussed in the report, including programs like Child Care and Development Block Grant, State Children's Health Insurance Program, and Social Security Disability Insurance. For more details on each example, refer to specific pages in the report. The curr_chunk discusses various programs such as Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, Immigration Examinations Fee Account, Manufactured Housing Standard Program, Health Surveillance and Program Support, Medicare Part A and B, and Prescription Drug User Fee Act."
