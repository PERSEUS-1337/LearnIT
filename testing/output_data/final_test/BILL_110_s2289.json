The \"Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act\" emphasizes that consent decrees should only address violations of Federal law, protect involved parties, consider State and local government interests, respect policy judgments of officials, and avoid imposing complex policy requirements. Consent decrees should have a clear strategy for ending court supervision and should not be unlimited. The limitation on consent decrees is emphasized to ensure they have a clear strategy for ending court supervision and are not unlimited. The addition of a new section in Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, defines consent decrees as court orders based on the consent of parties, imposing relief against State or local governments or officials. It excludes private settlements and orders unrelated to official duties.

The new section in Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code mandates states to end segregation in schools based on race, color, or national origin. It limits the duration of consent decrees against state or local governments. A successor may file a motion to modify or terminate a consent decree after 4 years or upon the expiration of the term of office of the highest elected official involved. The burden of proof is on the party filing the motion. The burden of proof is on the party who filed the civil action to demonstrate the necessity of denying a motion to modify or terminate a consent decree to prevent a violation of Federal law addressed in the original decree. If the burden is not met, the court will terminate the consent decree. The court must ensure that any remaining provisions of a consent decree are the least restrictive means to prevent a violation if the burden of proof is met. The court will rule expeditiously on a motion filed under this subsection and enter a scheduling order within 30 days to limit the time for parties to file motions and complete discovery. The court may stay injunctive or prospective relief in a consent decree if a party causes delays, and federal courts can still issue new orders for relief as authorized by law. The provisions of this section do not prevent parties from seeking relief under State law. \"SEC. 4. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORT.\" The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on consent decrees involving the United States that are at least 4 years old. The report includes copies of the decrees and explanations for why court supervision is still necessary, along with any efforts to limit the decrees' scope or duration. Other federal agencies must provide the required information as well. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress on consent decrees involving the United States that are at least 4 years old. State and local officials' statements on consent decrees, supporting or opposing court supervision, must be included in the report. Electronic submission of consent decrees is allowed. SEC. 5.
