Congress finds that the Department of Defense has invested over $6 billion in directed energy science and technology since 1960. Despite this, there is concern that the Department's directed energy initiatives lack the necessary resources for full-scale acquisition programs. The Defense Science Board Task Force on Directed Energy Weapon Systems and Technology Applications believes that directed energy has the potential to significantly enhance military capabilities. The Task Force believes that increased attention is needed to assess, develop, and field laser, microwave, and millimeter wave weapons for operational capabilities. The Task Force emphasizes the importance of evaluating and implementing laser, microwave, and millimeter wave weapons for operational use. Additionally, the inclusion of directed energy weapon system programs in the rapid acquisition authority program is highlighted in Section 3. The Secretary of Defense may use rapid acquisition procedures for urgently needed supplies and support services to address deficiencies in directed energy weapon systems. This includes acquiring offensive or defensive directed energy weapon systems capabilities. The Secretary shall consider specific procedures for directed energy weapon systems acquisition. The Secretary of Defense can use rapid acquisition procedures for urgently needed supplies and support services for directed energy weapon systems. This includes acquiring offensive or defensive capabilities using various authorities such as other transactions authority and simplified acquisition procedures. The term 'directed energy weapon system' refers to military actions involving the use of directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy equipment, facilities, or personnel. The code is amended to include directed energy weapon systems in the definition of military actions using directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy targets. The code is amended to include directed energy weapon systems in the definition of military actions using directed energy to incapacitate, damage, or destroy enemy targets. Additionally, a Joint Directed Energy Program Office is established. The High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office of the Department of Defense is now the Joint Directed Energy Program Office. It will develop a strategic plan for directed energy weapons capabilities and accelerate their development for the Department. The Office will use revised Department policies and new practices to speed up the development of directed energy capabilities. The Secretary will ensure engagement with defense industries, research universities, and nonprofit institutions."
