    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Global Investments in America's Cities Act\" and it modifies the EB-5 visa program. Section 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to reserve at least 3,000 visas each fiscal year for qualified immigrants investing in new enterprises in economically distressed urban areas to create employment. Investors must invest a specified amount in a new enterprise through an investment agreement with a qualified venture capital operating company or angel investors. Investors must invest at least $250,000 in a new enterprise through an investment agreement with angel investors. The Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust this amount for inflation. The accredited investor must be a US citizen or permanent resident and have made at least 2 equity investments of $50,000 each in the 3 years before the petition. The petition by the qualified immigrant for classification under this paragraph is for an economically distressed urban area, defined as a city with an average unemployment rate of at least 150 percent of the national average rate for the preceding year. A qualified venture capital operating company is defined as an entity registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or an investment company. A qualified venture capital operating company, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, is exempt from registration under certain sections and includes relatives such as spouses, siblings, children, parents, aunts, and uncles of qualified immigrants. Relatives exempt from registration under certain sections include aunts, uncles, first cousins, and grandparents. SEC. 3. Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to guarantee a decision on EB-5 investor petitions within 60 days. SEC. 4. Calls for a study by the Government Accountability Office. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress on the EB-5 Visa Program within 2 years of this Act.
