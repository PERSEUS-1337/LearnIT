    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1170.02 of the Penal Code states that a prisoner convicted of first-degree murder of a peace officer while on duty is not eligible for resentence or recall. Additionally, Section 3550 is amended. Section 3550 of the Penal Code is amended to allow for medical parole for permanently medically incapacitated prisoners, subject to certain conditions and approval by the Board of Parole Hearings. This amendment does not affect the rights under the Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights Act of 2008. Prisoners eligible for medical parole include those sentenced to death or life without parole, those serving sentences where parole is prohibited by law, and those convicted of first-degree murder of a peace officer. When a physician employed by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation identifies a prisoner meeting medical criteria for parole, they recommend referral to the Board of Parole Hearings. The head physician of the institution must concur within 30 days and refer the matter using a standardized form. If the head physician does not agree, they must provide a written explanation to the primary care physician. The prisoner or their family can request medical parole by contacting the head physician at the prison. The head physician, in consultation with the primary care physician, will determine if the prisoner meets the criteria for medical parole. If approved, the head physician will refer the case to the Board of Parole Hearings. If denied, a written explanation will be provided. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation completes parole plans for inmates referred for medical parole consideration. Medical parole hearings are conducted by two-person panels and may be heard in absentia. The Board of Parole Hearings makes an independent judgment on granting medical parole based on public safety concerns. The board or Division of Adult Parole Operations can impose conditions on prisoners under medical parole, such as electronic monitoring. Parolees may need to undergo a medical examination to assess their current condition. If their condition improves, they may no longer qualify for medical parole and will be returned to custody. A prisoner sentenced to a determinate term placed on medical parole supervision before the earliest release date will remain on medical parole until that date, then serve the remaining parole period under Chapter 8 of Title 1. A prisoner on medical parole supervision before their minimum eligible parole date will remain on medical parole until that date, after which they will be eligible for parole consideration under Chapter 8 of Title 1. The Department of Corrections ensures that a prisoner on medical parole has applied for federal entitlement programs and possesses necessary medical documents and belongings. Medical parole does not affect eligibility for other forms of parole or release. The Department of Corrections notifies the county of commitment and proposed county of release about medical parole hearings and releases at least 30 days in advance. This applies to inmates regardless of their sentence length."
