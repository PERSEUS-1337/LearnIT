    "content": "The report focuses on ground electronic warfare (EW) systems in the Department of Defense's FY2020 budget request for the Army and Marine Corps. Ground EW capabilities aim to defeat IEDs, UAS, and jam enemy communications and radars. Congress faces decisions on approving, rejecting, or modifying DOD's proposals for these programs, which could impact future military capabilities and funding requirements. Electronic warfare (EW) is crucial in modern warfare against technologically advanced adversaries like Russia and China. It involves using the electromagnetic spectrum to detect, jam, and deceive enemy systems. Congress must balance EW programs for counter-improvised explosive device missions and great power competition, standardize funding approaches, and consider the role of new technologies in EW operations. Electronic warfare (EW) involves using electromagnetic and directed energy to control the spectrum or attack the enemy. DOD divides EW into electronic warfare support, electronic protection, and electronic attack. Support includes detecting, locating, and understanding adversary radar and radio transmissions. Protection involves limiting electromagnetic signatures and hardening military equipment. Electronic attack includes jamming and deceiving enemy systems. Developing advanced EW systems is crucial in the competition between major military powers. Ground EW systems provide support, protection, and attack capabilities in military operations. These systems categorize enemy signals and counter threats such as improvised explosive devices and drones. Electronic warfare gained importance post-Cold War for mitigating IED threats during counter-insurgency operations. During counter-insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. and allied ground forces faced casualties from IEDs. Insurgents used cell phones and radios to detonate IEDs, prompting the development of EW systems to jam their communications. The DOD allocated $18 billion from FY2006 to FY2011 for C-IED technologies, including man-portable platforms for foot patrols and vehicle-mounted jamming systems like the Duke Version 3. The Duke Version 3 C-IED jamming system can be installed on vehicles like the Humvee or MRAP. Ground forces need both vehicular-based and man-portable jamming systems for different operations. The use of drones by state and nonstate actors poses challenges for U.S. military forces. Adversaries have used UAS systems to support ground operations, with examples including the Islamic State modifying commercial drones for reconnaissance and dropping explosives, and the Russian military pairing EW drones with artillery fire. Emerging concepts like \"swarming\" tactics, where multiple small drones work together, are also being developed. In 2015, IS demonstrated swarming tactics to attack a Russian airbase in Syria. DOD has developed EW techniques to counter UAS systems, with 235 products from 155 manufacturers available as of February 2018. These systems range from hand-held devices for point defense to ground-based systems for larger areas. The latest Army and Marine Corps counter-UASs use directed energy like lasers for target destruction. The Army has developed vehicle-mounted lasers to engage UAS, with plans to upgrade to a 50 kW laser by 2022 capable of destroying rockets, artillery, and mortars. Challenges remain in developing a compact energy source for these laser technologies. The Marine Corps is developing its own counter-UAS systems, including the Compact Laser Weapons System (CLaWS) and the Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS) as part of its ground-based air defense program. The CLaWS program aims to provide an affordable solution for the C-UAS challenge, while MADIS is designed to be integrated onto the Joint Tactical Light Vehicle. In the FY2020 budget request, the Marines sought funding to integrate 28 MADIS systems into their vehicle fleet. Advances in networking sensors and computing power have made using the electromagnetic spectrum for communications crucial in military operations. Disrupting enemy communications limits their ability to command forces and maintain battlespace awareness. The Army's primary communications jammer is the EW tactical vehicle (EWTV), incorporating a variant of the CREW Duke system. The Army's EW tactical vehicle (EWTV) incorporates a variant of the CREW Duke system to provide electronic attack capabilities for brigade combat teams. The EWTV uses the EW planning and management tool (EWPMT) to neutralize and exploit enemy signals through the Raven Claw computer program, giving commanders a comprehensive view of the electromagnetic spectrum for jamming enemy communications systems and radars. Marine Corps radio battalions primarily use the Communication Emitter Sensing and Attack System (CESAS) II for jamming. The Marine Corps primarily uses the CESAS II system to jam communications systems. CESAS II comes in two variants: a vehicle-transportable version and a man-portable system. The weight of the vehicle jammer has been reduced from 1,300 pounds to 670 pounds, while the man-portable version weighs 180 pounds. The Marine Corps declared initial operational capability in July 2016 and plans to declare full operational capability in FY2021. Additionally, the Marine Corps utilizes the AN/MLQ-36 Mobile Electronic Warfare Support System (MEWSS) to jam communications and other electronic transmissions. The Marine Corps fields 12 MEWSSs, modified light-armored vehicles with upgrades like a 9-meter mast. During the Cold War, EW capabilities were crucial in the competition between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The post-Cold War era saw a shift towards countering terrorist groups, possibly reducing emphasis on high-end warfare. The shift in international security towards great power competition has led to a renewed focus on Electronic Warfare (EW) in U.S. defense planning. Concerns about China and Russia's advanced EW systems, designed to deny U.S. military access, have prompted efforts to strengthen U.S. EW capabilities to maintain military superiority. Russia has emphasized EW in its military modernization efforts. Russia and China are prioritizing Electronic Warfare (EW) in their military modernization efforts. China is integrating its civil and military technological bases to enhance its EW capabilities, while Russia is focusing on modernizing its forces with an emphasis on command, control, communications, and intelligence systems, where EW plays a crucial role. McDermott highlights the close relationship between Russian signals intelligence forces and electronic warfare units, which also work closely with air defense and artillery. The Defense Intelligence Agency notes that Russian military modernization efforts were tested in the 2008 Georgian war, where Russian forces displayed limitations but ultimately prevailed against weaker opponents. Russian forces, after prevailing in the 2008 Georgian war, implemented the \"New Look Program\" to modernize their military. This included reorganizing divisions into fully-manned brigades, reducing officer ranks, increasing professional enlisted personnel, restructuring military districts, and initiating a state armaments program to field 70% new equipment by 2020. Since 2008, Russian military forces have been modernizing their equipment through the New Look Program, with a focus on enhancing electronic warfare capabilities. There are indications that this modernization is influenced by US and NATO military operations, prompting the defense ministry to counter high-precision weapons. KRET leadership is aware of the need for modern EW systems in Russia's military. The need for modern EW systems in Russia's military is driven by the desire to counter high-precision weapons and respond asymmetrically to network-centric combat operations. The \"National Strategic EW System\" includes the Murmansk-BN subsystem with a range of 5,000 km, deployed on seven trucks in Crimea. Russian forces are integrating EW forces into their main combat arms organizations, with each motorized brigade having at least one electronic warfare company. China has also seen a similar progression in EW capabilities over the past decade, focusing on ground domain systems and informationized warfare. The PLA has organized EW functions in the Strategic Support Force, including cyber, psychological, information, and space forces. China has developed sophisticated ground-based sensors, jammers, and unmanned systems for electronic warfare. Investments in science and technology initiatives have improved network capabilities. The balance of EW capabilities in the Army and Marine Corps is a potential oversight issue for Congress. The U.S. military's focus on counter-IED programs in Iraq and Afghanistan has left them vulnerable to potential Russian or Chinese weapons systems. Both the Army and Marine Corps acknowledge the need for new investments in electromagnetic warfare capabilities. Congress may need to review resource allocation for countering emerging threats and overlapping programs between the two services. Both the Army and Marine Corps are developing competing C-UAS programs, while C-IED programs are joint efforts. Congress may need to assess the efficiency of funding competing programs and the progress of technology research and development. Tracking funding for EW systems is challenging due to complexity and classification, with both services using research and development appropriations for procurement activities. The challenge in tracking EW programs transitioning from development to procurement lies in the small scale of procurement activities compared to larger weapons systems. DOD procurement activities do not always disclose EW components, making it difficult to track both breakout of EW components and total dollar figures for Army and Marine Corps. Army's EW capabilities receive R&D funding, leading to inconsistent funding and lack of sustainment plans, while Marine Corps' programs are programs of record. Emerging technologies could change how the Army and Marine Corps conduct electronic warfare. Advances in electronics, such as active electronically scanned arrays and software-defined radios, are already impacting ground forces. Some experts believe that with the integration of artificial intelligence, automated decision-making could manage the electromagnetic spectrum more effectively. Advances in electronics, including active electronically scanned arrays and software-defined radios, are impacting ground forces. Artificial intelligence algorithms could enhance electronic warfare systems by locating and engaging small unmanned aerial systems. The Army and Marine Corps have not publicly announced plans to use artificial intelligence for managing electromagnetic spectrum operations. New materials are reducing the size, weight, power, and cooling requirements of electronics components. Advances in electronics are reducing energy consumption and improving battery technology, leading to smaller and lighter man-portable electronics. New waveforms and AESA antennas are enhancing electronic warfare systems. Quantum technologies may revolutionize electronic warfare by changing communication and radar systems. Quantum technologies may impact electronic warfare operations, but the exact effects are unclear. Russian EW Company Equipment is detailed in Appendix A."
