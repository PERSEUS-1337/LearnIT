    "content": "The \"Work for Warriors Act of 2014\" establishes a Direct Employment Pilot Program for members of the National Guard and Reserve under Chapter 1601 of title 10, United States Code. The \"Work for Warriors Program\" is a pilot program established under the \"Work for Warriors Act of 2014\" to provide job placement assistance and employment services to members of the reserve components of the armed forces. The program is administered by the adjutants general and requires states to contribute at least 30 percent of the funds provided by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. The Work for Warriors Program focuses on job placement services for reserve component members, with assistance from the Secretary of Labor and guidance from State programs in California and South Carolina. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau will develop outcome measurements to evaluate the success of the Work for Warriors Program in a State. A report describing the results of the program must be submitted to the congressional defense committees within 180 days after its completion. The report will assess the effectiveness and achievements of the program. The Work for Warriors Program's effectiveness, achievements, impact on reserve component employment levels, and comparison to other Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs programs will be assessed. Any other relevant matters will also be considered by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau or the Undersecretary. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau or the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness may obligate up to $20,000,000 for the Work for Warriors Program during fiscal years 2015 through 2018, with a possible extension for two additional fiscal years. Subtitle E of title 10, United States Code, and part IV of such subtitle, are amended by replacing the item related to chapter 1601 with a new item. The Work for Warriors Program is listed under chapter 16101 in title 10 of the United States Code."
