    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Emergency Neighborhood Reclamation Act of 2008\". Congress acknowledges the subprime mortgage foreclosure crisis has caused widespread abandonment of housing in urban neighborhoods, particularly affecting communities already struggling with economic decline and population loss. These communities lack resources to promptly demolish and remove vacant properties, posing risks to public health and safety. Emergency grant assistance can help communities quickly demolish vacant housing to promote public health and safety and create open space for various beneficial purposes. SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM TO ASSIST MUNICIPALITIES WITH A VACANT HOUSING PROBLEM. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will provide grants to eligible local governments for neighborhood reclamation if they meet certain criteria, including experiencing population loss since 1980 and having high levels of vacant and abandoned housing. The grant program aims to address urban decay and neighborhood degradation by funding the demolition of vacant and abandoned residential structures in eligible local governments. The grant program funds the demolition of vacant residential structures in eligible local governments, ensuring the abatement of health and safety hazards before demolition and the rehabilitation of the site for public use or sale after demolition. One year after receiving a grant, a local government must report the number of structures demolished and remaining to be demolished, as well as the site rehabilitation completed. The grant award does not impact funding decisions for demolition under other HUD programs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Act does not waive obligations under local, State, and Federal law. Funds from this Act cannot be used to demolish public housing as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937. Authorization of appropriations for the Act is set at $1 billion for fiscal year 2009 and as needed for subsequent years. The Act will take effect within 60 days of funds being allocated. Interim regulations must be issued within 60 days, and final regulations within 180 days of the effective date. Definitions are also provided in the Act. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The term \"unit of general local government\" is defined as in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. \"Other vacant and abandoned structures\" are those not used for residential purposes or used for a combination of residential and other purposes."
