    "content": "FY2013 discretionary appropriations were influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which set spending limits for FY2012-FY2021. The failure to enact deficit reduction legislation by January 15, 2012, led to automatic spending cuts through sequestration starting on January 2, 2013. This process required across-the-board cuts to achieve equal reductions in defense and nondefense funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, leading to automatic spending cuts through sequestration starting in January 2013. Certain programs were exempt from sequestration, including VA programs, but there was a potential 2% reduction in budget authority for VA medical care. On April 23, 2012, OMB confirmed that VA programs, including Veterans' Medicare Care, are exempt from sequestration. The failure to enact deficit reduction legislation led to a re-definition of \"security\" and \"non-security\" spending categories. The impact of sequestration on appropriations accounts was calculated by the Office of Management and Budget. President Obama submitted his request for military funding on February 14, 2012. President Barack Obama submitted a request for military construction appropriations for FY2013 to Congress on February 14, 2012. The House passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2013 (H.R. 5854) on May 31, 2012, with a vote of 407-12. The bill was then received in the Senate on June 5, 2012, where it was placed on the Legislative Calendar. The Office of Management and Budget issued a Statement of Administration Policy recommending a veto of the bill. The senior advisors recommended a veto of the bill due to issues related to military construction, including funding for an Aegis Ashore Missile Complex in Romania and language on Project Labor Agreements. The Senate Committee on Appropriations introduced its own draft of the bill, but no further action was taken. Representative Harold Rogers introduced a continuing appropriations resolution to the House. The House passed resolution H.Res. 778 on September 13 by a vote of 329-91. It was then passed by the Senate on September 22 and signed into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012. The resolution allowed for a 0.612% increase in department operations over the previous year's appropriations. Section 101(c) of H.J.Res. 117 permitted a 0.612% increase in department operations over the previous year's appropriations. However, Section 102(a) of the Continuing Appropriations Resolution specified restrictions on the use of funds for new production or increased production rates beyond those of fiscal year 2012. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (H.R. 933, P.L. 113-6) funded the government through the remainder of FY2013, including the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations. Tables display the amounts appropriated, and the impact of sequestration on these accounts. Explanatory statements for the bill were printed in the Congressional Record. In response to Hurricane Sandy, the President requested $47.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations, including $259.9 million for military construction and veterans affairs. The Senate proposed a bill for $60.4 billion, with $259.8 million allocated to military construction and veterans affairs. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (P.L. 113-2), was passed by the House on January 15 and the Senate on January 28, with the President enacting the bill. The President enacted the bill on January 29, 2013, as P.L. 113-2, which authorizes funding to the Department of Defense for military construction. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) is responsible for this authorization, with the House version for FY2013 introduced on March 29, 2012. The House Committee on Armed Services reported its amendment of the bill on May 11. The House debated and passed the bill on May 18 by a vote of 299-120. The Senate received the bill on June 19 and referred it to the Committee on Armed Services. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) raised objections to the legislation in a statement issued on May 15, citing concerns about impeding the new defense strategy and directing scarce resources. The Senate version of the NDAA (S. 3254) introduced in 2012 included various issues such as funding reductions for the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Complex in Romania, new missile defense construction on the U.S. East Coast, absence of authorization for new base closure rounds, and retroactive DOD liability for environmental conditions at military installations closed after October 24, 1988. The Office of Management and Budget expressed serious concerns with the bill in a statement issued on November 29, 2012. The Office of Management and Budget raised serious concerns with S. 3254, citing departures from the President's budget request, constraints on the Armed Forces, and limitations on Executive authorities. The Administration objected to Title XVII and section 2208, warning of a potential veto if presented to the President. The Senate received H.R. 4310 on June 19 and referred it to the Committee on Armed Services. The bill was discharged by Unanimous Consent on December 4, 2012, and laid before the floor. The Senate then amended the bill and passed H.R. 4310 after a conference committee filed its report on December 18, 2012. The House and Senate agreed to the conference report on H.R. 4310, with the President signing it into law as P.L. 112-239 on January 2, 2013. The bill includes appropriations for military construction accounts, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program (NSIP), and family housing accounts. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund provides funding for new construction, maintenance, and other expenses related to military housing privatization. The Homeowners Assistance Fund helps federal personnel unable to sell their homes near closing installations. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act expanded eligibility for the Homeowner Assistance Program. The Homeowner Assistance Program eligibility was expanded to include wounded DOD and Coast Guard personnel or their surviving spouses. Funding for disposal facilities for chemical weapons, environmental remediation from past base closures, and military construction were allocated from various accounts. The Department of Defense has completed the implementation of recommendations from the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, approved by President George W. Bush. This involved a complex program of construction and movement to prepare new facilities, close unnecessary ones, and transfer personnel and equipment to new locations. Implementation costs for BRAC 2005 were detailed in DOD's FY2011 appropriations request. The House version of the NDAA (H.R. 4310) includes a provision to establish a single \"Department of Defense Base Closure Account\" consolidating all existing BRAC Treasury accounts. This account would fund environmental restoration, property management, and military construction projects related to BRAC rounds. The Senate version of the NDAA does not include provisions for new BRAC rounds, unlike the House version which establishes a single \"Department of Defense Base Closure Account\" for funding BRAC-related projects. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced plans for new BRAC rounds in 2013 and 2015, citing potential reductions in military infrastructure needs due to troop reductions. The BRAC process involves submitting recommendations to a commission for review and presentation to Congress for a single vote. The BRAC process involves submitting recommendations to an independent commission for review and presentation to Congress for a single vote. The President submitted his recommendation for legislative language to Congress on March 28, 2012, closely resembling the process of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The Secretary of Defense analyzes infrastructure requirements for future military forces and suggests actions to align the infrastructure inventory with projected needs. The BRAC process involves submitting recommendations to an independent commission for review and presentation to Congress for a single vote. Recommendations are assessed by the commission using data from DOD and public input, with limited power to revise or reject recommendations. The President has three options for disposing of the commission's recommendations: reject, return for revision, or approve. Congress has up to 45 days to pass a joint resolution of disapproval to halt the BRAC process after the President's approval. The BRAC process allows for recommendations to be reviewed by an independent commission and presented to Congress for a single vote. Congress has up to 45 days to pass a joint resolution of disapproval to stop the process after the President's approval. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and its reauthorization in 2001 created temporary processes for closing military installations or adjusting their missions and manning. Sunset provisions were included in both versions of the law. The BRAC process, established in 1990 and reauthorized in 2001, allows for the closure or realignment of military installations in the United States. The President's recommendation for two new BRAC rounds combines elements from previous rounds and includes the creation of a multi-round commission. The new BRAC Commission would terminate on April 15, 2016, but the President's legislative request did not appear in the drafts of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013. The House Committee on Armed Services (H.R. 4310) version of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 included a provision (Section 2713) to prohibit using appropriations for another BRAC round. The Senate Committee on Armed Services referenced testimony from Dr. Dorothy Robyn, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, stating that the 2005 BRAC round only eliminated a small percentage of excess infrastructure. Senior Army and Air Force officials expressed disinterest in another BRAC round despite previous closures in 2005. The House Committee on Armed Services directed a review of DOD processes to identify excess bases. The Constitution divides military authority between the executive and legislative branches. Congress has the power to raise armies, maintain a navy, and regulate military forces. The Constitution divides military authority between the executive and legislative branches, with Congress having the power to raise armies and regulate military forces. Article II, Section 2, designates the President as the Commander in Chief of the Army, Navy, and Militia when called into service. This creates a natural tension between Congress and the President, especially regarding DOD real property management during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was tension between Congress and the President over military base closures and reductions in operational activity. President Lyndon B. Johnson vetoed a military construction bill in 1965 due to increased congressional control over base realignments. President Gerald R. Ford vetoed a bill in 1976 that would delay closures or realignments affecting DOD civilian employee positions. Congress later passed a similar bill with slight modifications. The President's authority to close military installations was restricted by a bill enacted as P.L. 94-431, with provisions expiring in FY1977. The Senate Committee on Armed Services made these restrictions permanent in P.L. 95-82, codified as Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code. This statute, amended multiple times, prohibits actions to close or realign military installations with at least 300 civilian personnel. The President's authority to close military installations was restricted by a bill enacted as P.L. 94-431, with provisions expiring in FY1977. The Senate Committee on Armed Services made these restrictions permanent in P.L. 95-82, codified as Section 2687 of Title 10 of the United States Code. This statute prohibits actions to close or realign military installations with at least 300 civilian personnel. The NDAA imposes additional requirements on the Secretary of Defense if a significant transportation impact will occur as a result of his action. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012 created a new restriction on the ability of the Secretaries to change operational activity at military installations through 10 U.S.C. 993. This statute requires the Secretary to notify Congress of any plan to reduce by more than 1,000 members of the Armed Forces assigned to duty at a military installation. The Secretary is barred from taking any irrevocable action regarding such a reduction until notifying the Committees on Armed Services, submitting a justification and evaluation of the impact, and waiting for a 21-day period to pass. The President and defense secretaries do not need specific authorization from Congress to close or realign domestic military installations. Army and Air Force personnel in Germany are being consolidated into two large military communities in Kaiserslautern and Grafenw\u00f6hr-Vilseck. Military construction has been focused in these areas for the relocation. Some combat power in the Army portion of EUCOM was planned to redeploy to the southwestern United States, but the Secretary of Defense is reconsidering moving two brigade combat teams from Germany. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be reduced by approximately 15% over the coming decade, with units like the 170th and 172nd Infantry Brigades being recalled and inactivated by FY2014. Additionally, the Air Force's 81st Fighter Squadron and 603rd Air Control Squadron will be deactivated, along with the Army's 5th Corps Headquarters moving to Wiesbaden, Germany. About 2,500 Army personnel will also be reduced over the next five years, while two heavy brigade combat teams will remain in Germany. The U.S. military presence in Europe will be reconfigured over the next five years, with a reduction of personnel and the inactivation of certain units. However, there will still be two heavy brigade combat teams stationed in Germany, along with plans for a rotational U.S.-based brigade to support NATO Response Force, ballistic missile defense destroyers in Spain, V-22 aircraft in Europe for special operations, and additional Special Forces units in Germany. The President's FY2013 request includes $243 million for construction in Germany, including upgrades to a Defense Information Systems Agency facility, replacement of an elementary school and addition to a high school in different garrisons, and funding for a medical center replacement project. Japan has agreed to construct a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units, with the existing facility to be returned to Japanese control. The construction of a new air facility in Okinawa for U.S. Marine Corps aviation units has been delayed due to the selection of a new site and Japanese domestic political considerations. An agreement on a potential site and runway configuration was reached between the U.S. and Japan in 2011, with plans formalized at a ministerial meeting. The completion date of 2014 was deemed impossible, and the facility is now expected to be completed \"at the earliest possible date after 2014.\" The Department has been struggling to implement a PACOM strategy for the past 6 years, but the administration has now decided to limit the number of U.S. marines relocating from Okinawa to Guam and scrap future tour normalization for Korea. Instead, a new strategic plan for the Pacific AOR includes U.S. rotational forces in Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines. The new strategic plan for the Pacific AOR includes U.S. rotational forces in Australia, Singapore, and the Philippines, a reduced presence of U.S. marines permanently based in Guam, and a planned shift of 2,500 marines from Okinawa to Hawaii. This has implications for military construction requirements in the PACOM AOR, with the Committee deferring funding for additional military construction related to the relocation of U.S. marines to Guam. The House Committee on Armed Services recommended temporary authorization for the Secretary of Defense to use operation and maintenance funds to assist Guam in preparing for the Marine redeployment. The Senate Committee on Armed Services recommended against funding for a firing range on Guam until DOD certifies its necessity for national security. They expressed concerns about the lack of comprehensive cost and schedule data for the Marine relocation, questioning the need for $139.4 million intended for socioeconomic and infrastructure improvements on Guam. The committee directs the Comptroller General to assess costs associated with the revised plan to realign marines in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on movements to Guam, Hawaii, and Australia. The assessment will distinguish between known, estimated, and unknown costs, including recurring annual costs. The assessment of costs for realigning marines in the Asia-Pacific region will include estimates of recurring annual costs affecting future budgets for the Department of Defense. U.S. ground forces have been concentrated in forward bases along the demarcation line between South Korea and North Korea since the Armistice in 1954. The headquarters of U.S. Forces, Korea and military units are being consolidated into two large communities centered on Osan Air Base and Camp Humphreys. Military personnel tours of duty are being extended. The military is extending tours of duty for personnel in South Korea, allowing them to bring their families. The cost estimates for these initiatives total $17.6 billion through 2020, with potential costs of $22 billion or more through 2050. However, the lack of a business case analysis raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of these investments. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys for tour normalization in South Korea. They questioned the cost-effectiveness of establishing two-year tours for single service members and three-year tours for married members with families, directing the Secretary of Defense to report back within 60 days. The Senate Committee on Appropriations raised concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys in Korea for tour normalization. They questioned the lack of a business case analysis and the need for additional facilities to accommodate the relocation of U.S. troops and tour normalization. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys in Korea for tour normalization. They emphasized the importance of a detailed business case analysis to justify the strategic objectives driving the decision. The Committee will require cost information and approval from the Secretary of Defense before considering any funding requests for future years. The Senate Committee on Appropriations raised concerns about the $13 billion construction program at Camp Humphreys in Korea for tour normalization. They stressed the need for a detailed analysis to justify the decision, requiring cost information and approval from the Secretary of Defense before considering funding requests for future years. Senator Carl Levin discussed defense budget cuts but did not address the prohibition on funds for tour normalization in the NDAA for FY2013. The National Press Club forum on national security quoted a military official discussing defense budget cuts, specifically mentioning the high cost of family housing in Korea. Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) establish employment terms for construction projects and have been used since the 1930s. President Obama's Executive Order 13502 allows executive agencies to require PLAs for large-scale construction projects. President Obama's Executive Order 13502 allows executive agencies to require the use of project labor agreements on a project-by-project basis for construction projects. The order does not mandate the use of project labor agreements on all projects, nor does it require contractors to enter into agreements with specific labor organizations. The government cannot require contractors to enter into agreements with labor organizations or discriminate based on their refusal to do so. This amendment applies to Department of Defense contracts and prohibits such requirements or discrimination. The NDAA for FY2013 includes a provision (Section 2803) extending the Secretary of Defense's authority to use funds for construction in USCENTCOM areas and Africa. Additional funding can be used for construction in Afghanistan with certification of need. Congress originally granted this authority in FY2004. The NDAA for FY2013 extends the Secretary of Defense's authority to use funds for construction in USCENTCOM areas and Africa, with additional funding for construction in Afghanistan if certified necessary. Congress granted this authority in FY2004 and has renewed it annually. Funding for military construction projects is provided at 100% of the estimated amount needed to complete the project, but large-scale projects may be funded incrementally or in phases to avoid committing too much budget authority in a single fiscal year. Phased construction involves completing a usable structure at the end of each phase, while incremental funding stages funding rather than construction. There is controversy between the executive and legislative branches regarding full budget authority allocation for projects. Congress has been more receptive to incremental construction than the executive. The Senate committee supports full funding for military construction projects but provides incremental funding for certain large projects. For fiscal year 2013, incremental funding is recommended for projects including High Performance Computing Center, U.S. STRATCOM Replacement Facility, Cadet Barracks, Hospital Replacement, and Explosives Handling Wharf 2. Section 1701 through Section 1709 of the Senate-reported version of the NDAA would create a framework for this funding approach. The Senate-reported version of the NDAA includes the creation of a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force\" to study and report on force structure. It would prevent the Air Force from removing any aircraft from Reserve Component units and authorize $1.4 billion to freeze Air Force structure in place. This provision would retain Reserve Component aircraft at their current locations through the end of FY2013. The Senate-reported version of the NDAA includes the creation of a \"National Commission on the Structure of the Air Force\" to study and report on force structure. It would prevent the Air Force from removing any aircraft from Reserve Component units and authorize $1.4 billion to freeze Air Force structure in place. The commission's report would be produced by March 31, 2013. The Secretary of the Air Force has announced plans to transfer aircraft from Reserve Component units and close some installations, stating they do not fall under the base closure statute. The committee charges the Comptroller General with submitting a report on objective criteria for realignments. The Department of Defense must use specific criteria for realignments and closures of military installations not covered by existing laws. Any action affecting military installations with over 300 civilian personnel requires notification to Congress. The closure of military installations under Section 2687 requires notification to Congress with detailed justification and a waiting period before implementation. The Secretary's stance on civilian manning levels may not be affected by this provision. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs for veterans through three primary organizations. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers programs for veterans through three primary organizations: the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). Benefits available to veterans include disability compensation, pensions, vocational rehabilitation, medical care, insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational/training benefits. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased significantly over the years, with a proposed budget of $135.87 billion for FY2013, representing an 11.2% increase from the previous year. The Administration requested $54.46 billion in advance FY2014 funding for VA medical care, with differences in funding allocation compared to P.L. 113-6. Mandatory funding is higher than discretionary funding for the VA, with mandatory funding at 54.4% in FY2013. All advance funding for VA medical care is discretionary. For more information on VA health care appropriations, refer to CRS Report R42518. The Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) maintains U.S. monuments and memorials honoring the achievements of the U.S. Armed Forces in battles since World War I. They also oversee the construction of monuments and markers in foreign countries, as well as the design and upkeep of cemeteries and memorials abroad. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, established in 1988, has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals and interpret relevant laws and regulations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has the authority to interpret laws, compel action by the VA, and overturn decisions. Arlington National Cemetery is managed by the Secretary of the Army and hosts numerous ceremonies and visitors annually. H.R. 5854 provides funding for Arlington National Cemetery in a single account, differing from the Administration's request. H.R. 5854 provides funding for the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund, which operates facilities in Washington, DC and Gulfport, MS. The trust fund is sustained through various sources including gifts, bequests, and a monthly assessment on active duty military personnel. Funding levels in S. 3215 are lower than the requested amount. Table 7 displays enacted appropriations for FY2012, the Administration request, and funding for FY2013. The curr_chunk provides information on Military Construction Appropriations for FY2011-FY2013 and the Sequestration Impact."
