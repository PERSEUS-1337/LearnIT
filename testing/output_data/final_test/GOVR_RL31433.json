    "content": "On February 12, 2003, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Resolutions, 2003, P.L.108-7, which includes funding for USAID global health activities. The bill allocates $800 million for USAID HIV/AIDS activities, with $591.5 million designated for Child Survival and Health Programs Fund. An additional $38.5 million is provided through other USAID accounts, $170 million for the Global ATM Fund and UN agencies, and $100 million for the Global Fund. Congress also reserves $120 million for tuberculosis assistance in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill. In the FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill, $115 million is appropriated for malaria assistance, with $65 million from the CSH account. $446.5 million is allocated for family planning/reproductive health, with $368.5 million for the CSH account. The Administration prioritized HIV/AIDS in its budget request for USAID programs, allocating over 40% of funding to HIV/AIDS activities. Some Members of Congress expressed concern about the significant portion of the global health budget dedicated to HIV/AIDS activities. The report examines U.S. global health funding trends since 1999, focusing on USAID's decision to allocate a significant portion of its budget to HIV/AIDS activities. Global health activities have become a key component of U.S. foreign aid due to concerns about health's impact on economic growth, national security, and political stability worldwide. The 2000 CIA report highlights the impact of infectious diseases on economic growth, national security, and political stability globally. It warns that diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria could reduce GDP by up to 20% in some sub-Saharan African countries by 2010. The report also mentions the reemergence and spread of diseases like TB, malaria, and cholera over the last 30 years, posing a threat to both developing countries and the United States. The CIA report warns of the reemergence and spread of diseases like TB, malaria, and cholera, as well as the emergence of new incurable diseases since the 1970s. Infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and new variants of influenza, pose a significant threat to the United States, introduced by international travelers, immigrants, and imported animals and foodstuffs. U.S. health programs aim to combat the spread of infectious diseases and address the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS. The U.S. aims to combat infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and bolster health infrastructures in developing countries. Congress has increased funding for global health programs since the mid-1990s, with USAID implementing these initiatives. Funding for these programs comes from various accounts including the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund and the Economic Support Fund. Table 2 displays the funding levels of USAID global health programs since 1999, with the majority of funding coming from the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund (CSH). CSH consistently receives bipartisan support in Congress and accounts for nearly 90% of the global health budget. In FY2003, $170 million of the Global Fund contribution was allocated to HIV/AIDS activities, with additional contributions totaling $650 million to date. The Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, established in FY1996, supports various global health programs for child survival and maternal health. The Child Survival and Health Programs Fund (CSH) was created to protect vulnerable populations in poor regions by ensuring no cuts to programs for children and accelerating efforts to eradicate diseases. Funding for CSH was derived from existing child survival and adult disease accounts. The Development Assistance Fund (DA), The Development Fund for Africa (DFA), The Economic Support Fund (ESF), Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States (AEEB), Assistance for the New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (FSU), and UNICEF portion of International Organizations and Programs are part of the funding sources. The Child Survival and Health Programs Fund (CSH) now includes reproductive health and population activities, focusing on immunizations, oral rehydration, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, UNICEF grants, displaced children, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS. The Child Survival and Health Programs Fund (CSH) has become a significant part of the global health budget, receiving bipartisan support in Congress. Funding for CSH has increased from $592.6 million in FY1996 to $1.836 billion in FY2003. The global health budget reached $1.972 billion in FY2003, with the Administration requesting $1.594 billion to be funded through development assistance. The Administration requested $1.771 billion for global health programs in FY2003, with $177 million to come from other accounts. USAID argued for flexibility in project implementation. Congress prioritized funding for Child Survival and Health Programs and UNICEF contributions. Funding for global health programs and UNICEF was placed under the Child Survival and Health Programs account in the Senate and House Foreign Operations bills for FY2003. The Administration requested a significant increase in HIV/AIDS spending for FY2003. In FY2003, USAID significantly increased HIV/AIDS spending, allocating 40.6% ($800 million) of its global health budget to HIV/AIDS activities. This marked a 40% increase from the previous fiscal year. Other health programs faced budget cuts, with proposed decreases of 28% from FY1999 levels and 11% from FY2002 levels if the Administration's request had been approved. USAID increased HIV/AIDS spending in FY2003, allocating 40.6% of its global health budget. Despite cuts in other health programs, USAID emphasized the integrative nature of their programs, stating that focusing on overall spending on global health is crucial. Administrator Andrew Natsios highlighted the interconnectedness of HIV/AIDS, maternal health, and child survival programs during a congressional hearing. In FY2003, USAID increased HIV/AIDS spending by 40.6% of its global health budget, emphasizing the interconnectedness of health programs. Congress deliberated on global health funding, including HIV/AIDS spending, to meet U.S. health objectives amidst the spread of HIV/AIDS in developing countries. In FY2003, USAID increased HIV/AIDS spending by 40.6% of its global health budget. Congress passed P.L. 108-7, allocating $1.84 billion for CSH and $1.97 billion for USAID global health activities, with a significant increase in funding for HIV/AIDS, including $800 million specifically for this cause. The omnibus bill allocates $140 million above the Administration's request for various health initiatives, including $100 million for the International Mother and Child HIV Transmission initiative. Congress also directed funds for maternal and child health, infectious diseases, family planning, and UNICEF. Additionally, $170 million of the $250 million Global Fund contribution is included in the HIV/AIDS funds. The omnibus bill allocates $100 million for the Global Fund through the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriation, totaling $350 million. Critics argue that global health funding levels overshadow other development programs like education, democracy, trade, and agriculture, which also impact development and health. They believe that supporting programs that build human capacity, promote stable governments, encourage private investment, and foster environmentally-friendly growth is essential for the sustainability of health programs. The trend of reducing funding to agricultural programs is jeopardizing the sustainability of health programs, as noted during Foreign Operations hearings. USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios emphasized the importance of teaching people how to grow more food to reduce poverty and hunger, rather than relying solely on humanitarian aid. This shift in funding priorities towards immediate responses to issues like HIV/AIDS and famines is leading to long-term challenges in addressing malnutrition and poverty. U.S. Representative Jerry Lewis acknowledged high malnutrition rates in countries with child survival programs and emphasized the impact of agriculture on poverty reduction. Chairman Kolbe highlighted the challenge of balancing foreign assistance spending, noting the trade-offs between funding HIV/AIDS and other development activities like economic growth and education. The FY2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill funded global health programs above requested levels, but it is unclear if family planning programs were funded below requested levels to support increases in other areas. Funneling a significant portion of the global health budget to HIV/AIDS programs raises questions about the impact on other health programs, especially those focused on infectious diseases. Congress historically prioritizes halting the spread of infectious diseases, including those becoming antimicrobial resistant. In FY2003, Congress funded global health programs above requested levels, with a focus on combating infectious diseases, including those becoming antimicrobial resistant. USAID was urged to increase activities related to HIV/AIDS, TB prevention, sexually transmitted diseases, and microbicide research. Concerns were raised about the agency not placing enough emphasis on halting emerging epidemics. In FY2002, the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Operations urged USAID to provide resources for building government capacity in HIV/AIDS programs. Congress expressed concerns about increasing spending on HIV/AIDS at the expense of other global health programs, such as TB, malaria, and child survival. Representative Jesse Jackson criticized the Administration's budget cuts in these areas. Congress supports the child survival and health account, but questions the unequal growth of global health accounts, specifically regarding HIV/AIDS funding. Additional funding for HIV/AIDS was included in the FY2002 supplemental appropriation bill, showing Congressional support for HIV/AIDS programs. The FY2002 Supplemental Appropriation, Public Law 107-206, included $200 million for HIV/AIDS, with $100 million for the Global Fund. President decided not to use the funds due to fiscal discipline concerns, sparking criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The President faced criticism for blocking funding to his own programs, including HIV/AIDS initiatives. He proposed changes to the FY2003 appropriations to request $200 million for the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative, with Congress funding $140 million for the initiative in FY2003. Legislative directives from Congress impact the ability to adjust health assistance programs quickly. Specific directives have increased as Congress focuses more on global health issues, with smaller directives adding up to significant impacts on global health programs. Congress has clearly earmarked high priority areas, leading to the creation of the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund. Despite Administration dissatisfaction, Congress attached directives to the FY2003 global health budget to protect its spending priorities. Chairman Kolbe highlighted divergent spending priorities between Congress and USAID, with directives remaining in the budget. This may continue in the future if Congress' priorities differ from USAID's."
