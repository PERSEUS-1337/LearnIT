    "content": "The House of Representatives rules have provisions for maintaining order and decorum since the 1st Congress. Members can be called out for using disorderly language, leading to a demand for their words to be taken down. This initiates procedures to determine if the language is unparliamentary and decide on further debate participation. These procedures aim to uphold decorum in House debates. The House of Representatives rules include a mechanism called \"words taken down\" to address disorderly language. Members can invoke this during debates to call out inappropriate language and have it recorded by the Clerk for review. This rule has been in place for decades to maintain decorum in House proceedings. The House of Representatives has a mechanism called \"words taken down\" to address disorderly language during debates. The Clerk consults with the transcriber to identify objected words, which are then read out loud for review by the Speaker or committee chair. The rules do not explicitly define disorderly language, but past precedents guide decisions based on the words and context used. The Parliamentarian advises the Speaker based on recorded precedents. Rule XVII, clause 4, outlines the procedure for demanding that disorderly words be taken down during debates in the House of Representatives. The Office of the Parliamentarian does not provide procedural assistance during committee meetings. When a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner is called to order, the Speaker decides the validity of the call. The House can appeal the decision without debate. If the decision favors the Member, they can proceed; otherwise, they may face censure or other punishment. A call to order cannot be made if further debate or business has occurred. According to Rule XVII, a demand for words to be taken down must be timely, generally before intervening business or debate. The Member must immediately state their demand after offensive words are spoken, briefly stating the reason for objecting. The presiding officer may allow an explanation if prompted or if a motion is made and agreed to by the House. The Member who spoke the disorderly words is usually asked to suspend while the Clerk reports the words. The House rules require timely objection to offensive words spoken, with the Member asked to suspend while the Clerk reports the words. The Member can request to withdraw the words or the demand for them to be taken down before the Clerk reads them aloud for a ruling by the presiding officer. The presiding officer's ruling on offensive words is subject to appeal and can be followed by a motion to table. If the words are deemed unparliamentary, they are usually stricken from the Congressional Record by unanimous consent. Members can also make a motion to remove disorderly language from the Record, which the House will vote on. The House may vote to strike a Member's words if ruled out of order, preventing them from speaking for the day. Members can request to proceed in order by unanimous consent or through a motion voted on by the House. If not allowed to proceed, the Member can demand a vote. The concept of taking disorderly words down in writing is provided for in the principles of general parliamentary law. The practice of taking down words began in 1808 and was formally adopted as part of the standing rules of the House in 1837. The practice of taking down disorderly words in writing was formally adopted as part of the House rules in 1837. An amendment in 1880 modified the procedure for demanding words to be taken down, removing the requirement for repeating the objectionable words. This version, similar to the current rule, requires the words to be recorded in writing. The House rule for taking down disorderly words was modified in 1880, requiring objectionable words to be written down and read aloud. The rule was further updated in the 106th Congress, combining clauses for addressing unparliamentary language. The House rule for taking down disorderly words was modified in 1880, requiring objectionable words to be written down and read aloud. In the 106th Congress, clauses for addressing unparliamentary language were combined and clarified to apply to Members, Delegates, or Resident Commissioners. CRS found 170 instances since 1971 where a Member demanded words be taken down, occurring in various settings including the Committee of the Whole and during special order speeches. The Speaker ruling on the words' appropriateness is now uncommon in contemporary practice.

The full procedure presented above\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which the Speaker rules whether or not the words are in order\u00e2\u0080\u0094occurs in the House. Of the 170 demands that words be taken down, 107, or more than half, were settled before the Speaker made a ruling, usually before the Clerk reported the words. In 75 of these instances, the Member whose words were taken down asked to withdraw or revise the words, and in another 32 cases, the Member who demanded that the words be taken down withdrew the request. There were an additional 13 occasions on which the Speaker ruled that a Member's call for words to be taken down was untimely. Throughout this time period the Speaker ruled on the words taken down 50 times. Twenty-seven, or more than half, of these rulings took place in the 1990s, with only nine rulings by the Speaker since 2000. In 25 of the 50 rulings following a demand that words be taken down, the Speaker ruled that the words were not disorderly. The Speaker ruled that the words were not disorderly in 25 occurrences. The ruling was often based on the Member's remarks not constituting an improper personal reference towards another Member. The words were found to be out of order 25 times, with the Speaker stating that the Member was engaging in personalities towards an identifiable individual in nearly every instance. In most cases, when a Member's remarks were deemed out of order for engaging in personalities towards another Member, the Speaker would strike the words from the Record by unanimous consent. This occurred in 17 out of 25 instances, with the Speaker often allowing the Member to proceed after the ruling."
