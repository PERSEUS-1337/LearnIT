    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Indian Tribal Justice Act\". The Congress recognizes the government-to-government relationship with Indian tribes, the trust responsibility to protect tribal sovereignty, the self-determination and inherent sovereignty of tribes, the authority of tribes to establish their own government and justice systems, and the importance of tribal justice systems for public health and safety. Congress and Federal courts acknowledge tribal justice systems as appropriate for resolving disputes affecting personal and property rights. Traditional tribal justice practices are crucial for maintaining tribal culture and identity. However, tribal justice systems lack adequate funding, which hinders their operation. Tribal government involvement and commitment to improving these systems are essential for achieving the goals of this Act. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3.
