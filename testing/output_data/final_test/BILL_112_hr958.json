    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"We the People Act\". It includes findings. The Congress has the power to establish and limit the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts, including making exceptions to Supreme Court jurisdiction based on policy and constitutional reasons. Congress has the authority to set limits on the jurisdiction of Federal courts to correct abuses of power and violations of the Constitution. The Constitution guarantees each State a republican form of government, and decisions by the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts have impacted issues such as religious liberty, sexual orientation, family relations, education, and abortion. The Supreme Court and lower Federal courts threaten the republican government of individual States by replacing elected government with rule by unelected judges. Supporters of liberalized abortion laws have admitted that the Supreme Court's decisions overturning the abortion laws of all 50 States are constitutionally flawed. Several members of the Supreme Court have admitted that the Court's Establishment Clause jurisdiction is indefensible. Congress has the responsibility to protect the republican governments of the States and has the power to limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the lower Federal courts over matters reserved to the States and the People by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON JURISDICTION.\n\nThe Supreme Court and Federal courts are prohibited from adjudicating claims related to state or local laws on religion, privacy rights, and equal protection laws regarding marriage regardless of sex or sexual orientation.
