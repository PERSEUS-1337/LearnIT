    "content": "The State Department is developing a civilian reserve force for rapid deployment to conflict areas, known as a \"surge capability.\" This force would include rule of law practitioners, civil administrators, governance experts, and infrastructure experts to fill the gap between government employees and contractors for state-building efforts. The Administration plans to create a civilian reserve force for rapid deployment to conflict areas, consisting of civilian reservists with expertise in transitional security, rule of law, public services, and civil administration. Reservists would be deployable within 30 to 60 days, paid at a comparable level to government employees, and offered incentives like insurance and diplomatic privileges. They would be screened and trained to work effectively from the start and function in teams.

Reservists would be deployable within 30 to 60 days, paid at a comparable level to government employees, and offered incentives like insurance and diplomatic privileges. They would be screened and trained to work effectively from the start and function in teams. The reservists could form part of the U.S. government management structure, supervising and managing permanent U.S. government employees and contractors. The Administration will consult with Congress on specific plans for the reserve once intra-executive branch consultations are completed. The Administration plans to consult with Congress on issues related to specific functional specialty areas for the civilian reserve force, deployment situations, and building a comprehensive reserve force. The United Nations' Recruitment and Outreach Unit, led by Catherine Rolland, manages a roster for peacekeeping operations. The Center for International Peace Operations (ZIF) in Berlin and CANADEM are government-funded recruitment agencies for peacekeeping operations. They do not have a civilian reserve for stabilization and reconstruction operations like the one proposed by the Bush Administration or the Senate bill passed in 2006. The Senate passed the Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2006, which aimed to develop a civilian response capability for stabilization and reconstruction activities. Organizations like ZIF and CANADEM recruit civilians for peacekeeping operations, but they do not have a civilian reserve for stabilization and reconstruction operations. The United States is studying proposals for a civilian reserve, facing recruitment and other challenges. Scott R. Feil, a retired U.S. Army Colonel, is conducting a study on civilian post-conflict reserve forces, examining roster systems internationally and in the U.S. Elizabeth Anderson and Michael Maya, experts in recruiting civilian volunteers for post-conflict missions, also participated in the discussion. Principal Deputy Director of the American Bar Association's CEELI discusses the importance of well-qualified personnel in post-conflict missions. Experience and qualifications are key factors for success in establishing the rule of law in new democracies. Organizations share their methods for recruiting and retaining skilled individuals for specific tasks. The importance of proactive recruitment for creating a civilian roster of well-qualified experts for foreign operations was emphasized by speakers. Targeted recruitment is essential to ensure the roster includes the best candidates, with methods such as \"head-hunting\" and building networks being cited as effective strategies. CANADEM and ZIF utilize targeted recruitment methods to build networks in professional communities for finding well-qualified individuals for overseas deployments. This includes contacting professional associations, surveying expatriates, and using word-of-mouth referrals. ZIF also persuades corporate leaders to grant leaves of absence for peacebuilding missions and considers recruiting among expatriate communities. Roster size and depth are crucial factors in recruitment efforts. Participants recommended having a sizable roster with depth in each specialty to provide well-qualified individuals for specific missions. A large database increases the chances of deploying qualified personnel quickly, as recruiting individuals with necessary language skills can be challenging. CANADEM currently has 400 individuals abroad from a core roster of 4,000, showing the importance of having a sufficient roster size to meet deployment needs. CANADEM currently has 400 individuals deployed from a core roster of 4,000, with a ratio of 10 persons on the core roster to each person deployed. ZIF, on the other hand, has a roster of 900 persons with 200 deployed, for a ratio of 4\u00bd to one. ZIF has decided to limit its roster to 1,500 people to effectively manage deployments and provide support for future missions. The lack of entry-level positions in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations is a concern for ZIF, as the demand is for mid-career professionals. With a tight domestic labor market in Germany, ZIF receives many applications from junior professionals. However, the organization may face a shortage of qualified professionals in the future as current members retire. Multiple layers of screening are necessary to ensure that only well-suited applicants are placed on rosters. The screening process for peacekeeping and related missions is rigorous, aiming to select individuals with expertise and interpersonal skills for working in diverse cultural environments. Screening includes reference checks, interviews, and testing in hostile environments. It ensures that candidates are well-suited for the demanding physical and psychological challenges of such missions, weeding out those seeking adventure or escaping personal issues. Intensive screening is crucial for selecting individuals fit for demanding peacekeeping missions in challenging environments. Organizations are enhancing their screening efforts to prevent unsuitable candidates from risking themselves and others. Improved screening systems will provide applicants with more information to make informed decisions about their suitability for a mission. The United Nations, ZIF, and CANADEM are implementing improved screening processes for selecting candidates for peacekeeping missions. They also offer training to prepare individuals for their missions, with ZIF providing the most extensive initial training as part of its recruitment process. Personal knowledge of roster members is emphasized by ZIF and CANADEM, although it becomes challenging as the roster size grows. ZIF applicants undergo a two-week training program, including four days at a German Army base for hands-on experience with police and military personnel. They face simulated hostile environments, such as legal and illegal checkpoints, and must demonstrate adaptability to weapons fire. Training assesses interpersonal skills and stress management for difficult missions. CANADEM provides tailored training for those with no international experience and predeployment briefings for experienced mission veterans. Consideration is being given to expanding training opportunities. CANADEM is considering increasing training, including online options, for peacekeeping/peacebuilding roster participants. There is competition for qualified personnel with organizations like UNDP, with benefits and incentives being a factor. ZIF deploys personnel who often have to quit their jobs, while CANADEM can grant leaves of absence. Participants in overseas deployments often extend their commitments or seek new positions due to the lack of leaves of absence. Benefits like health insurance and life insurance are crucial for recruitment. Organizations like CANADEM and ZIF are striving to secure higher benefits for their missions. Follow-up work with deployed individuals and their families is essential to encourage future volunteering. Reintegration work is necessary to retain personnel for second tours, while caution is advised against repeated redeployments to hostile environments. The ZIF representative cautioned against repeated redeployments to hostile environments due to the psychological toll it can take on individuals. They discourage viewing peacebuilding as a long-term career and emphasize the importance of determining the appropriate length for deployments to build necessary relationships for successful job performance. The length of deployments is crucial for building relationships and job performance in peacebuilding missions. U.N. contracts are typically for six months but can be extended, leading to improved results with longer civilian retention. Organizations like ABA aim for a one-year commitment and offer incentives to reduce duplication of effort. CANADEM and ZIF, funded by governments, operate as autonomous non-profits. Both CANADEM and ZIF operate as autonomous non-profit organizations to protect themselves from political demands and maintain rapid response capabilities. They enjoy continuity of managers and personnel, unlike government agencies. The workshop raised questions about the appropriate size, screening, and resourcing of a potential civilian reserve, in comparison to recommendations from a previous study. The workshop discussion highlighted the need for decisions on roster size to evolve over time, with the S/CRS planned roster of 3,000 being insufficient according to the BearingPoint study. The study suggests that the entire roster would be deployed if reservists were sent to multiple operations, with a ratio of five persons on the roster to one person deployed for small operations. However, this ratio may be problematic for larger and multiple operations. The IDA study suggests a rule of law reserve of 6,000 people and a civilian response corps of 2,500. They looked at international and domestic models, such as the National Wildfire Coordinating Group's roster of 75,000 firefighters. Another model mentioned is the concept of \"directed overstrength\" in local agencies for a U.S. civilian reserve. The emphasis on screening personnel for stress reactions raises the question of whether the ZIF model is more suitable than the Bearing Point model. ZIF extensively screens applicants through training exercises, while Bearing Point uses written exams and in-person evaluations. Bearing Point also includes four to six training events for reservists during their service. The workshop discussion suggests that baseline training could be included in the screening process for reserve applicants. Longer deployments of a year or more are preferred over shorter ones, with a standard maximum deployment length of one year for U.S. civilian reservists. Most participants are willing to commit to one tour for up to twelve months over a four-year period, with the option for extensions and additional deployments. The BearingPoint study recommends a one-year deployment length for U.S. civilian reservists, with shorter commitments for law enforcement personnel in high threat environments. Despite potential reservists being unwilling to sign on for longer than a year, continuity of personnel is emphasized by workshop speakers. The workshop speakers recommend a one-year deployment for most specialists, but longer deployments may be necessary for positions requiring long-term relationships and mentoring. Ms. Andersen of the ABA suggests that in rule of law areas, tours of one year or more are desirable, especially for civilian reservists serving as managers or supervisors. The workshop discussion raised questions about the use of contractors and the deployment of federalized reservists to cover gaps before contractors could be deployed. CANADEM and ZIF rosterees are not government employees, leading to a lack of control over them and the need for extensive screening. Policymakers may need to consider various factors when choosing civilian reservists for deployment. Policymakers should consider deploying reservists in situations of prolonged hostilities or sensitive U.S. interests. They should also implement greater controls and oversight over deployed contractors to manage the size of the civilian reserve force."
