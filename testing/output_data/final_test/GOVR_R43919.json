    "content": "United States agriculture is praised for its production and innovation but can have negative impacts on the environment due to excess nutrients. Ongoing research focuses on understanding nutrient interactions, damages, and prevention methods. Federal policies on agricultural nutrients have few regulations, with some laws exempting agriculture from environmental requirements. The main federal response is through research and education. The federal response to agricultural nutrients includes research, education, outreach, and voluntary incentives for producers. Recent events have raised concerns about the adequacy of current regulations. This report discusses nutrient pollution sources, environmental effects, control measures, federal programs, and future policy considerations. Agriculture is one of many industries that can impact the environment with excess nutrients. The report discusses the evolving science of pinpointing sources of excess nutrients causing environmental harm, emphasizing that various industries, including agriculture, lawn care companies, and sewage treatment plants, contribute to environmental harms in similar ways. The overview provided in the report is supported by a large body of research, with complexities of individual issues discussed in cited sources. Best management practices and federal responses mentioned are not exhaustive lists, as the success or failure of nutrient management practices can vary greatly by location. Nutrients are essential for plant growth, with plant roots absorbing them from the soil. Excess nutrients can enter the environment if not utilized by plants. Various entities, including the federal government, private sector, nonprofit groups, and state/local governments, are involved in managing nutrients from agriculture. Success or failure of nutrient management practices varies by location. Plants have different nutrient requirements that affect yield and production. Primary macronutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are crucial for plant growth. Micronutrients also play a significant role in plant development. Excess nutrients can lead to environmental issues like algal blooms. Micronutrients can impact plant growth significantly when levels are imbalanced. This report focuses on nitrogen and phosphorus, key macronutrients in agriculture. Plants uptake nutrients in ionic form through interception, mass flow, and diffusion. Mass flow is the primary method of nutrient movement towards plant roots. Diffusion is a substantial method of nutrient movement towards plant roots, especially for mobile nutrients like nitrogen. It is less important for immobile nutrients such as phosphorus. Nutrients are used by plants at different times and rates during the growing cycle. Farmers apply nutrients based on soil mobility knowledge, for example, nitrogen can be broadcasted. Fertilizers, whether organic or inorganic, are applied to soil to promote plant growth. Organic fertilizers, like animal manure, provide plant-available nutrients, increase soil organic matter, and improve water and nutrient retention. Inorganic fertilizers, like urea and potash, are synthetic or mined sources of nutrients. Manure is a primary organic fertilizer that can vary in nutrient content. Manure is a valuable organic fertilizer for crop production, providing nutrients, increasing soil organic matter, and improving water retention. However, factors like transportation costs, nutrient content variability, and compatibility with crop nutrient needs limit its widespread use. Livestock waste is a significant source of organic fertilizer. Livestock waste, such as animal manure, is a valuable organic fertilizer for crop production. Proper management is essential to avoid environmental harm and ensure animal health. Manure can be collected, stored, and distributed for use on crop or pastureland. However, high stocking rates can lead to nutrient imbalances and impact water quality through runoff, erosion, and leaching. Improper management can also result in air emissions of harmful gases. Livestock waste, such as animal manure, contains particles and gases like ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and volatile organic chemicals. More manure could be utilized on cropland to reduce environmental risks. Different regions have varying capacities to handle manure based on soil types and crops grown. For example, the Midwest can handle additional nitrogen from manure, while the Southeast can handle more phosphorus. Livestock production in areas with low capacity to assimilate manure increases the risk of environmental harm. Livestock waste, like animal manure, can pose environmental risks when production exceeds land assimilative capacity. Excess manure can lead to runoff and nutrient leaching, especially in areas with high numbers of confined animals. Inorganic fertilizers, while more concentrated and cost-effective than organic fertilizers, can also be damaging when overused. The use of inorganic fertilizers in the United States has increased over time, outpacing organic fertilizers. Commercial nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium-based fertilizers are the primary types used. Corn, which requires intensive fertilizer applications, accounts for nearly 40% of total U.S. commercial fertilizer consumption. U.S. commercial fertilizer consumption is driven by the high number of planted acres and crop requirements. Nitrogen, an abundant element, is converted to a usable form through the Haber-Bosch process, producing NH3 (anhydrous ammonia) used as a fertilizer. NH3, urea, and dissolved N account for 90% of total N fertilizer use domestically. Phosphate rock is the primary raw material for soluble phosphorus fertilizers, with major deposits in northern Africa, China, the Middle East, and the United States. World phosphate rock production is expected to increase from 223 million tons in 2015 to 255 million tons in 2019. In the U.S., Florida and North Carolina mines contribute over 85% of domestic output, with additional operations in Idaho and Utah. Potassium fertilizer, primarily mined, is known as potash, with the largest high-grade deposit in Saskatchewan, Canada. The largest potash deposit in the world is in Saskatchewan, Canada, with domestic production also occurring in Michigan, New Mexico, and Utah. In 2015, 85% of potash sales in the United States were by the fertilizer industry. Nutrients in agriculture cycle through soil, plants, and the atmosphere, with some being taken up by plants, incorporated into soil organic matter, or precipitated as solid minerals. Excessive nutrients in agricultural production can lead to environmental and health impairments, with nitrogen and phosphorus being of primary concern. Water and air quality concerns have highlighted the damage excessive nutrients can cause in the environment. Quality concerns in the United States stem from pollution by excess nutrients, heavy metals, and toxic substances. Data from the EPA and states show that a significant portion of river and stream miles, as well as lake acres, do not meet water quality standards. Streams and small rivers are particularly affected, with 67% in poor or fair condition due to nutrients and streambed sediments. Agricultural production contributes to nutrient and sediment loading in waterways if not managed properly, with nitrogen being a key concern due to its mobility and various forms. The use of reactive nitrogen in agriculture increases the potential for nitrogen to be lost to the environment in various forms like ammonia, nitrate, and nitrous oxide. Excess nitrogen can be transferred to water sources through soil erosion, runoff, and leaching. Phosphorus is an immobile nutrient primarily transferred to water through sediment-based runoff or erosion from cultivated lands. Soil erosion during flow events is the main source of phosphorus transport, with leaching occurring to a lesser extent through subsurface flow. Continued phosphorus application beyond plant needs can lead to soil phosphorus saturation, increasing surface runoff and subsurface flow linked to soil phosphorus concentration. High levels of nutrients can lead to eutrophication in water bodies, promoting algae growth. Algal blooms from excess nutrients can harm aquatic ecosystems by depleting oxygen, blocking sunlight, and producing toxins like cyanobacteria and red tides, which can contaminate water supplies and harm human and animal health. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) can occur in various water bodies due to warm temperatures, high light levels, and excess nutrients like phosphorus. These blooms can lead to hypoxic or anoxic conditions, causing die-offs of aquatic life and the formation of \"dead zones\" with minimal biodiversity. CyanoHABs thrive in warm water with high light levels and excess nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. Major sources of nutrients include agricultural runoff, sewage discharges, and storm-water runoff. These blooms can produce toxins harmful to humans and wildlife, leading to various health effects and even death. Exposures mainly occur during recreational activities, accidental ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact with contaminated water. Red tides, caused by the alga K. brevis, produce toxins that can concentrate in shellfish, leading to neurotoxic shellfish poisoning in humans. Exposure to brevetoxins can cause neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. Ciguatera, caused by Gambierdiscus toxicus, is another illness from consuming fish with toxins produced by harmful algal blooms. Excess nutrients in water can have various health effects, including potential contributions to infections and noninfectious pathogens. The primary route of human exposure to nitrogen is through contaminated drinking water, leading to methemoglobinemia. A blood disorder called methemoglobinemia, also known as \"blue baby syndrome,\" is caused by an abnormal amount of methemoglobin interfering with oxygen release to body tissue. Other health effects of nitrate ingestion include cancers, reproductive issues, diabetes, and thyroid conditions. Research on the health effects of nitrate ingestion and regulatory limits on nitrogen in drinking water is lacking. Phosphorus, like nitrogen, contributes to environmental and health concerns related to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. The direct health effects of excess phosphorus fertilizers are not well understood. Nutrient management aims to balance nutrient cycles with the ecosystem in crop production. Nutrient management in crop production is crucial for ecosystem balance and sustainability. Advances in understanding nutrient utilization have led to the development of best management practices (BMPs) to prevent excess nutrients from entering the environment. BMPs focus on erosion, runoff, leaching, and other ways nutrients can impact the environment. Success of BMPs depends on application and location, with multiple BMPs possibly needed to correct nutrient imbalances. Nutrient BMPs are essential for crop production to prevent excess nutrients from harming the environment. They may not always be fail-safe and can require time and investment. USDA's NRCS maintains national standards for these BMPs, focusing on the \"4Rs\" of nutrient management. State and local regulations may also impact their application. Crop production BMPs, such as Nutrient Diagnosis and Testing, Planning, and Tillage Systems, aim to prevent nutrient and sediment runoff into waterways. These practices help producers manage nutrients effectively while minimizing environmental impacts. Implementing conservation practices such as no-till systems, cover crops, and crop rotation can improve soil health, reduce nutrient loss, and enhance nutrient cycling efficiency. These practices help to sequester nutrients, reduce soil runoff, and minimize environmental impacts. Crop rotations improve nutrient cycling and reduce energy needs. Stripcropping with grass or close-growing crops can slow runoff, reduce erosion, and increase filtration to reduce nutrient loss. Inhibitors like nitrification and urease inhibitors delay denitrification and reduce nitrogen volatilization. Denitrifying Bioreactors use a carbon source to reduce nitrate nitrogen concentration in agricultural drainage. Application timing is crucial for efficient nutrient uptake by plants. The efficient uptake of nutrients by plants depends on the timing, amount, and method of application. Nutrient application should be based on nutrient diagnosis, expected yields, and residual nutrients to avoid overapplication. Different application methods are available based on crop type and planning. Filter and buffer strips can help trap sediment and denitrify residual nitrates near water bodies. Constructed wetlands, irrigation management, terraces, grassed waterways, and best management practices for livestock operations are all methods used to trap sediment and denitrify residual nitrates in water bodies. These practices help in nutrient filtration, runoff reduction, and capturing residual nutrient loss. Nutrient management practices for grazing operations include controlling animal movements, nutrient testing of manure, waste planning, feed management, and proper carcass disposal to prevent excess nutrient release into the environment. Constructed wetlands, waste storage, and handling are important resources for managing animal waste. Constructed wetlands use hydrophytic vegetation for nutrient filtration, while waste storage facilities allow for flexible nutrient application. Lagoons provide biological treatment and long-term storage of animal waste. The biological treatment of animal waste involves dilution, decomposition, and use in a separate form like irrigation liquid. This process is achieved through anaerobic or aerobic bacteria. Stream crossings are constructed to provide access while reducing sediment and nutrient loading. Federal regulations on agriculture's environmental impacts are limited, with the main response being through research, education, and voluntary incentives. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates environmental impacts in agriculture, focusing on protecting water resources through water quality standards, effluent discharge limits, and permits. The CWA distinguishes between \"point sources\" and \"nonpoint sources\" of pollution, with the livestock industry being an exception to environmental rules. The Clean Water Act regulates environmental impacts in agriculture, focusing on protecting water resources through water quality standards and permits. Nonpoint sources of pollution, such as agricultural activities, are governed by state water quality planning provisions. Permits for point sources, like concentrated animal feeding operations, are issued by EPA or qualified states under the NPDES program. EPA revised regulations in 2003. In 2003, EPA revised regulations for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) under the NPDES program. The 2008 CAFO rule applies to about 15,300 large animal feeding operations, detailing permit requirements, annual reports, and manure/wastewater handling plans. The rule prohibits discharges from regulated CAFOs except in specific circumstances. The Clean Water Act requires states to identify impaired waters and establish Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) to control pollution. If states fail to do so, EPA must make its own TMDL determination. Over 20,000 waterways in the US are violating water quality standards and need TMDLs. Over 20,000 waterways in the US are violating water quality standards and require Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs). Lawsuits have been filed to push EPA and states to develop TMDLs for impaired waters. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is the largest one developed so far. Since 1995, 69,205 TMDLs have been created, addressing 72,653 causes of water quality issues. Nutrient impairments make up 8.9% of TMDLs, sediment impairments 5.7%. 42,368 waterbodies in the US remain impaired, with 71,602 causes of impairment. TMDLs need to be established for these waterbodies, with 10% caused by nutrients and 8.4% by sediment. The identification and listing of impaired waters are done by states, with federal response to nutrient pollution from agriculture mainly through voluntary technical and financial assistance. USDA agencies provide support through education, outreach, and research, while federal funds are provided for adopting BMPs for nutrient reduction. Nutrient management planning assistance is available at no cost through NRCS, drawing on scientifically based principles. Various conservation practices may be prescribed based on needs and resource goals, with nutrient management plans and BMPs being voluntary unless required by specific programs. Nutrient management education is primarily handled through land-grant universities and extension programs, with NRCS offering financial assistance for nutrient management. The NRCS offers financial assistance for nutrient management practices, with programs funded by omnibus farm bills like the Agricultural Act of 2014. The largest program, EQIP, supports conservation activity plans and financial assistance for practices like cover crops and buffer strips. Other programs like CSP incentivize producers to adopt nutrient-reducing practices. Land retirement and easement programs also play a role in promoting nutrient management. Land retirement and easement programs, such as CRP and ACEP, remove land from production for resource-conserving vegetation. The Clean Water Act Section 319 Program provides grants to address water quality challenges from nonpoint sources like farmland runoff. States use this funding to implement non-regulatory programs promoting nutrient management in agriculture. USDA conducts nutrient management research. USDA conducts nutrient management research through its in-house agencies ARS and ERS, as well as funds provided to states by NIFA. ARS has 17 national programs, including five for nutrient management research. ERS analyzes societal and economic impacts of nutrient use in the US. USDA participates in CEAP to quantify environmental effects of conservation practices. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducts studies on agricultural nutrient transport and fate in various settings across the country, focusing on how environmental processes and agricultural practices interact to affect the movement and transformation of agricultural chemicals. The study covers surface water, groundwater, the unsaturated zone, the streambed, and the atmosphere, with the aim of making the findings nationally relevant. The study areas include diverse irrigated crop systems in Western states and corn and soybean row crop systems in the Midwest. A 2015 USGS report noted high nitrate levels in U.S. rivers with no widespread evidence of improvement. Despite efforts, environmental issues from excess nutrients in agriculture persist nationwide. Policymakers are exploring the balance between voluntary and regulatory approaches to address these challenges. The effectiveness of federal environmental laws delegated to states is questioned, along with the utilization of billions of dollars for conservation efforts. The debate includes the balance between regulation and cost, the impact of regional planning, and the efficiency of federal resources for conservation. The debate surrounds the effectiveness of federal environmental laws and the allocation of resources for conservation efforts, focusing on targeting limited resources to areas of greatest need, identifying sources of nutrient pollution, and evaluating the value versus cost of conservation practices like Conservation BMPs in agriculture. Additional research and innovation are also being considered for enhancing the response toolbox. Value Versus Cost of Conservation: Agricultural producers aim to maximize profit while minimizing costs. The debate questions if the value of conservation BMPs outweighs the cost and if savings are effectively communicated to increase adoption. Nutrient pollution consequences include high costs for removing nitrates from drinking water, with the burden falling on large water utilities and consumers. The question of who should bear the cost of nutrient loading arises, with the potential for education and outreach to connect on-farm actions to off-farm results. Increased demand to feed a growing population drives the need for additional agricultural output. The importance of managing additional nutrients in agriculture to prevent environmental degradation is highlighted. Agriculture is a major contributor to nutrient pollution that can adversely affect the environment. Identifying the sources of water impairments can be challenging due to the complex movement of nutrients. The industry's use and management of nutrients have brought attention to the need for proper practices. The agriculture industry's management of nutrients has raised concerns about water pollution. Best practices exist to reduce nutrient runoff, but their effectiveness and affordability vary. Some advocate for more regulations, while others prefer incentive-based approaches. Congress debates the balance between these options, considering research and water impairments that impact public health and safety."
