Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that affects many women during and after pregnancy. It can be categorized into three subgroups: \"baby blues,\" postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis. \"Baby blues\" is characterized by mood swings, tearfulness, irritability, poor sleep, and vulnerability. Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders include symptoms like worsening baby blues, affecting 10-20% of new mothers. Postpartum psychosis symptoms involve losing touch with reality, paranoia, and rapid speech, striking 1 in 1,000 new mothers. Over 400,000 women experience postpartum mood changes annually, with baby blues affecting up to 80% of new mothers. The causes of postpartum depression are complex and unknown, possibly linked to hormone level changes after childbirth. Postpartum depression can be caused by various factors such as hormone level changes after childbirth, lack of support, marital strife, stressful life events, and personal history of depression or anxiety. It is a treatable disorder that requires prompt diagnosis and personalized care including social support, therapy, medication, and sometimes hospitalization. Unfortunately, postpartum depression often goes undiagnosed. Postpartum depression often goes undiagnosed or untreated due to social stigma, the myth of motherhood, inability to self-diagnose, shame, lack of understanding, and economic pressures. Untreated, it can lead to further depression, substance abuse, loss of employment, divorce, social alienation, self-destructive behavior, or suicide, impacting society through the infant's physical and psychological well-being. Child abuse, neglect, or death of the infant or siblings can have a significant impact on the infant's physical and psychological development, as well as disrupt the family. SEC. 101. CONSENSUS RESEARCH CONFERENCE AND PLAN CONCERNING POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOSIS. Amendments are made to the Public Health Service Act regarding research on postpartum depression and psychosis.

After developing the research plan, the Secretary will expand research activities through the NIH Director, focusing on postpartum depression and psychosis. A report on these efforts must be submitted within 1 year. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress annually on the progress of the research plan for postpartum depression and psychosis at the Nation Institutes of Health.
