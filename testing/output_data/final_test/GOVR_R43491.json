    "content": "Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" allows the President to expedite the approval and implementation of certain international trade agreements through Congress. TPA ensures limited congressional consideration and a vote without amendments if the agreement meets specific requirements and advances U.S. trade objectives. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) statute outlines U.S. trade negotiating objectives and requires extensive consultations with Congress and stakeholders. It also mandates the submission of a draft implementing bill that meets specific content requirements. TPA provides mechanisms to make the bill ineligible for expedited consideration if requirements are not met, giving Congress authority over trade policy while giving the President leverage to negotiate agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows Congress to consider trade agreements without amendments in a timely manner. TPA can be used for new agreements or changes to existing ones, with legislation needing to be implemented before July 1, 2021. TPA-2015 was introduced in April 2015, with similar bills reported by Senate and House committees shortly after. In 2015, the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives after multiple votes and amendments. The Senate version was attached to an unrelated House bill, which passed both chambers. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, passed in 2015, granted no new authority to the President but reaffirmed Congress's power to regulate foreign trade. The President has inherent authority to negotiate trade agreements, while Congress holds the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation provides expedited procedures for congressional approval of trade agreements that require changes in U.S. law. The President has the authority to negotiate international agreements, including free trade agreements (FTAs). The Constitution gives Congress sole authority over the regulation of foreign commerce and tariffs. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 allowed the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements to reduce tariffs without further congressional action. This authority was renewed until 1974, and in the 1960s, nontariff barriers became subjects of trade negotiations. Congress altered the President's authority to require an implementing bill for trade agreements. Congress altered the President's authority to require an implementing bill for trade agreements, leading to the establishment of fast track authority in the Trade Act of 1974. This authority was later renamed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was established in the Trade Act of 1974 and later renamed in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA ensures that U.S. trade partners are confident in negotiating with the United States, as it allows for timely legislative consideration of trade agreements without congressional amendments. Congress retains its constitutional authority under TPA. Under TPA, Congress requires the President to consult with stakeholders during trade agreement negotiations and adhere to trade negotiating objectives. TPA-2015 added consultation requirements during agreement implementation. After signing, the President submits the agreement, implementing bill, and required administrative action to Congress. If the U.S. signs a trade agreement during TPA, the implementing bill can be submitted to Congress the next day. Trade promotion authority (TPA) allows the President to submit implementing bills to Congress on a session day, even if TPA has expired. TPA was first enacted in 1975 and has been renewed four times since then. It was used to implement multilateral trade agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since 1979, TPA has been used for 14 FTAs and one multilateral trade agreement under the WTO. The U.S.-Jordan FTA was approved without TPA and applies to a small portion of U.S. trade. Some countries allow the executive to conclude trade agreements without legislative approval, while others require approval through regular legislative procedures. TPA applies to negotiations of new agreements. Under TPA, negotiations for new agreements and changes to existing agreements are self-executing. The President notified Congress of intent to renegotiate NAFTA on May 18, 2017. Negotiations began on August 16, 2017, with detailed objectives submitted by USTR on July 17. A preliminary agreement with Mexico was announced on August 27, 2018, and the revised deal was signed on September 30, 2018, including Canada, forming the USMCA. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed on November 30, 2018. The government shutdown delayed the International Trade Commission report on the economic effects of the agreement, now expected by April 20, 2019. Congress defines trade negotiating objectives in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation, reflecting changing trade policies since 1974. Since 1974, Congress has updated trade negotiating objectives in TPA legislation to reflect changing priorities in international trade. TPA-2015 includes new issues like state-owned enterprises, digital trade, and localization policies as principal negotiating objectives. The objectives are categorized into overall, principal, and capacity building priorities, focusing on goals like fostering economic growth and obtaining favorable market access for U.S. products and services. The capacity building objectives under TPA involve providing technical assistance to trading partners to advance politically critical goals necessary for a U.S. trade agreement. Market access negotiating objectives aim to reduce barriers for U.S. products, including utilizing global chains and sectoral agreements for greater access. Separate negotiating objectives address agriculture, textiles, and apparel to achieve fair and open export opportunities. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to provide fair and open export opportunities for foreign exports in the U.S. markets. Services have become increasingly important in the U.S. economy and play a prominent role in trade policy, with a focus on reducing barriers to trade in services and promoting liberalization. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to promote fair export opportunities for foreign exports in the U.S. markets, with a focus on reducing barriers to trade in services. TPA-2015 expands negotiating objectives on services by emphasizing their role in global value chains and advocating for liberalized trade through plurilateral agreements like the Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). Additionally, TPA-2015 introduces three new agriculture negotiating objectives, including robust trade rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The new agriculture negotiating objectives introduced by TPA-2015 focus on addressing concerns about SPS measures as barriers to market access, ensuring transparency in TRQ administration, and preventing improper use of geographical indications to protect agricultural products. The European Union aims to protect geographical indications in trade agreements, while the United States focuses on reducing barriers to foreign investment. The TPA-2015 includes negotiating objectives to ensure fair treatment of foreign investors and secure important rights. The TPA-2015 aims to protect U.S. foreign investment by establishing provisions such as nondiscriminatory treatment, free transfer of capital flows, and compensation for expropriation. Investor-state dispute settlement allows foreign investors to seek arbitration against host governments for alleged violations of investment provisions in FTAs. The TPA-2015 aims to protect U.S. foreign investment by improving mechanisms to resolve disputes, selecting arbitrators efficiently, enhancing public input, and providing coherence to interpretations of investment provisions in trade agreements. U.S. investment negotiating objectives are shaped by the U.S. Model BIT and the Model BIT is periodically revised. The Model BIT is revised periodically to balance investor protections and policy interests. The 2004 version narrowed definitions and connected expropriation to property rights. The 2012 version clarified obligations for state-owned enterprises and financial services under a prudential exception. The Model BIT is periodically revised to balance investor protections and policy interests. Revisions over time include more detailed provisions on ISDS, aspirational language on environmental and labor standards, and enhanced transparency obligations. TPA-2015 prohibits trade agreements from granting foreign investors greater substantive rights than U.S. investors. \"Trade remedies\" provide means for U.S. firms to address unfair trade practices, such as antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The \"escape clause\" allows temporary restraints on import surges not considered unfair. Trade remedies, including restraints on import surges, are used to address unfair trade practices. The objective is to preserve the ability of the United States to enforce its trade laws effectively. Some trade agreements, like NAFTA and the proposed USMCA, have mechanisms for challenging trade remedy decisions. This reflects concerns that other countries may seek to weaken trade disciplines. TPA-2015 maintains notification provisions for potential changes to U.S. trade remedy laws and addresses concerns about currency manipulation by trading partners. TPA-2015 elevates currency manipulation to a principal U.S. negotiating objective in trade agreements, calling for various remedies such as cooperative mechanisms and enforceable rules. The legislation does not specifically define currency manipulation and allows for multiple means to address it. The Senate passed the Hatch/Wyden amendment by a vote of 70-29 to address concerns about discouraging central bank activities and currency manipulation. The amendment modified the currency language in the bill to define unfair practices and establish objectives. The amended objective aims to establish accountability through enforceable rules and mechanisms to address exchange rate manipulation. It includes the original negotiating objective and language from the Hatch/Wyden amendment. The May 10th Agreement covered worker rights, environment protection, intellectual property rights, government procurement, and foreign investment in U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, Peru, and South Korea. TPA-2015 incorporates labor, environmental, and investment principles from the May 10th Agreement. It includes requirements for adherence to core labor standards and environmental obligations. The agreement also ensures that foreign investors in the US do not have greater rights than US investors. The TPA-2015 language focuses on ensuring that trade agreements promote innovation and access to medicine through intellectual property rights. The United States has supported strengthening IPR protection in trade agreements since 1988. Objectives include promoting adequate IPR protection, market access for U.S. persons, and respecting the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health Declaration. These objectives address concerns about the impact of patent protection on innovation and access to medicine, especially in developing countries. The TPA-2015 aims to promote innovation and access to medicine through intellectual property rights. Key provisions include strong protection of new technologies, standards that keep pace with technological developments, and prevention of government involvement in IPR violations like cybertheft. Regulatory coherence is also emphasized for enhanced protection of trade secrets. The TPA-2015 includes negotiating objectives on labor issues and worker rights, requiring trading partners to enforce their own labor statutes and internationally recognized core labor standards. This differs from the 2002 TPA, which focuses on ensuring trading partners do not fail to enforce their labor statutes. The 2002 TPA allowed trading partners discretion in enforcing laws affecting trade or investment, while the TPA-2015 requires compliance with labor and environmental standards without using discretion as a reason not to comply. It also aims to strengthen trading partners' capacity to adhere to standards and reduce policies threatening sustainable development. TPA-2015 requires compliance with labor and environmental standards, including internationally recognized agreements. It prohibits waiver or derogation from environmental laws in trade and investment matters. The agreement allows prosecutorial discretion in enforcement and resource allocation. Dispute settlement for labor and environmental standards is subject to the same remedies as other provisions, potentially leading to trade concession withdrawal until disputes are resolved. The 2015 TPA requires compliance with labor and environmental standards, with dispute settlement potentially leading to trade concessions withdrawal until disputes are resolved. The regulatory practices negotiation objective aims to reduce governmental regulations impeding market access for U.S. goods, services, or investment by seeking commitments in trade agreements based on scientific principles and increasing transparency and participation in regulatory development. The TPA-2015 aims to limit governmental collection of proprietary data, protect against public disclosure, eliminate government price controls, ensure transparency, procedural fairness, and nondiscrimination in regulatory regimes. It also establishes dispute settlement mechanisms and seeks commitments in trade agreements based on scientific principles. The TPA-2015 provisions focus on resolving disputes through consultation and withdrawal of benefits to ensure compliance with trade agreement commitments. It also requires labor and environmental disputes to follow the same procedures as other disputes, allowing for full settlement under the agreement. Additionally, TPA-2015 aims to ensure that WTO DS panels and the Appellate Body apply the WTO Agreement as written without altering rights and obligations, using a standard of review applicable to the Uruguay Round Agreement. The TPA-2015 provisions aim to resolve disputes through consultation and withdrawal of benefits to ensure compliance with trade agreement commitments. It also addresses labor and environmental disputes, ensuring they follow the same procedures as other disputes for full settlement under the agreement. The digital trade provisions update and expand upon e-commerce provisions, emphasizing the importance of treating trade in digital goods and services no less favorably than physical goods or services in trade agreements. The TPA-2015 extends commitments to digital trade, including cross-border data flows and protection of trade secrets. It also aims to promote strong IPR for technologies and address competition from state-owned firms. TPA-2015 includes a principal negotiating objective on \"localization,\" aiming to prevent trade-distorting practices like indigenous innovation and the enforced use of domestic standards. It also addresses localization barriers in digital trade and foreign investment chapters. TPA-2015 includes provisions to restrict performance requirements and forced technology transfers in U.S. investments abroad. It also promotes good governance, transparency, and the rule of law with trade partners to create open democratic societies and respect human rights. Amendments were made to consider religious freedom in trade agreement negotiations with the United States. The amendments to TPA-2015 included making human rights a principal negotiating objective, discouraging trade limitations with Israel, and prohibiting expedited consideration of trade agreements with Tier III human trafficking countries. These amendments were added to the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The amendments to TPA-2015 included adding negotiating objectives related to immigration laws, global warming, market access for fish products, consultation provisions, and human trafficking. The TPA-2015 includes provisions for consultation with Congress during trade negotiations and requires the USTR to meet with relevant committees. The amendment allows the President to submit a waiver for countries taking steps to combat human trafficking. TPA-2015 introduces new provisions for transparency in trade negotiations, including the appointment of a Chief Transparency Officer at USTR and the requirement for detailed objectives and updates during FTA negotiations. The President must also release the ITC's assessment of the trade impact. TPA-2015 introduces transparency provisions in trade negotiations, including the appointment of a Chief Transparency Officer at USTR and the requirement for detailed objectives and updates during FTA negotiations. It also mandates the release of the ITC's assessment of the trade impact and consultation with committees of jurisdiction after accepting a petition for review or taking enforcement actions. The negotiating text must be made public 60 days before signing, and implementing legislation submitted to Congress 30 days prior to introduction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations are established for each house. The Trade Promotion Authority of 2015 (TPA-2015) includes transparency provisions in trade negotiations, such as appointing a Chief Transparency Officer at USTR and requiring detailed objectives and updates during FTA negotiations. It also mandates the release of the ITC's trade impact assessment and consultation with relevant committees. The negotiating text must be public 60 days before signing, and implementing legislation submitted to Congress 30 days prior. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) are established for each house, replacing the previous Congressional Oversight Group (COG). USTR is required to develop guidelines for the CAGs to facilitate information exchange. The Trade Promotion Authority of 2015 (TPA-2015) mandates transparency in trade negotiations, including fixed-timetable briefings and access to negotiating documents for Congressional Advisory Groups (CAGs) and their staff. The USTR must develop guidelines for consultations with Congress, advisory committees, industry groups, and the public, within 120 days of TPA-2015 enactment. These guidelines ensure timely briefings on negotiation objectives, status, and potential law changes. The Trade Promotion Authority of 2015 (TPA-2015) mandates transparency in trade negotiations, including consultations with Congress and designated Congressional Advisors (DCAs). DCAs are selected from specific committees to advise U.S. delegations in trade negotiations. Under TPA-2015, Members of Congress can be designated as DCAs to advise U.S. trade negotiation delegations. USTR accredits HAGON and SAGON members as trade advisers. USTR classifies draft trade agreement texts under Executive Order 13526. Members have the right to examine draft trade agreements. Under TPA-2015, Members of Congress can be designated as DCAs to advise U.S. trade negotiation delegations. USTR accredits HAGON and SAGON members as trade advisers. Members have the right to examine draft trade agreements, as the USTR provides access to pertinent documents for trade negotiations. Congress established a three-tier advisory committee system to ensure private and public stakeholders have a voice in U.S. trade policy formation. The top committee is the 30-member Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN). The USTR consults with various advisory committees and stakeholders from local, state governments, industries, and labor groups. There are three tiers of advisory committees, including sector-specific committees, to provide technical advice. The TPA/fast track authorities require the President to submit reports from advisory committees on the potential impact of negotiated agreements. TPA-2015 expands consultation requirements by USTR with the public, including guidelines for enhanced public consultation and stakeholder events for sharing views with negotiators. Under TPA-2015, parties meet to share views with negotiators during negotiating rounds. The President must make public reports on the impact of trade agreements on the environment, employment, and labor rights. Import sensitive products in agriculture, fishing, and textile sectors have special assessment and consultation requirements. Congress requires the President to notify them before launching trade negotiations or signing a trade agreement. Under TPA-2015, the President must notify Congress before initiating or signing a trade agreement with a foreign country. Special notification and reporting requirements apply to agriculture, fishing industry, and textiles and apparel. The U.S. International Trade Commission plays a key role in investigating matters related to international trade. Under TPA-2015, the President must submit proposed trade agreements to the ITC for assessment. The ITC must produce an economic impact assessment within 105 days of the agreement being signed, with reports made public. TPA-2015 maintains and establishes reporting requirements, including an extension disapproval resolution. The President must report to Congress on negotiation progress and the need for extensions. The Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations, International Trade Commission (ITC), and the President must report on the progress, economic impact, and proposed changes to U.S. trade remedy laws for trade agreements under TPA-2015. Advisory Committee Reports are required before and after agreements are signed. The policy, sectoral, and functional committees must report on the economic interests of the United States and the negotiating objectives of TPA. The ITC assesses the impact of the agreement on the economy and specific sectors. Reports are submitted to Congress and committees on trade agreements, environmental reviews, and consultative mechanisms under TPA-2015. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of future trade agreements on U.S. employment, labor rights reports, implementation and enforcement plans, and reports on penalties for non-compliance. The curr_chunk discusses the economic impact of trade agreements implemented under TPA procedures since 1984, incorporating expedited procedures for consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. The expedited TPA procedures include mechanisms for timely floor consideration, limits on debate, and a prohibition on amendment to ensure Congress can vote on the implementing bill. The expedited TPA procedures, including limits on debate and a prohibition on amendments, ensure timely floor consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. This arrangement increases confidence in U.S. negotiating partners that the enacted law will implement the terms of the agreement negotiated. The agreement's terms were agreed upon, and any amendments to the implementing bill would require resolution between the House and Senate through a conference committee. Trade agreement implementing bills under TPA have restrictions on content, allowing only provisions approving the agreement and necessary implementation actions. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for the implementation of trade agreements, including necessary provisions and potential changes to existing laws. There is debate over what constitutes \"necessary or appropriate\" provisions, with some advocating for a strict interpretation. TPA-2015 requires implementing bills to include only essential provisions. The President submits a Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) to Congress, outlining the Administration's views on the trade agreement's interpretation and application for the U.S. The President submits an explanation of how the implementing bill and administrative action will \"change or affect U.S. law\" to support the trade agreement. Each renewal of TPA provides Congress with the means to decide on expedited consideration for implementing bills. In TPA-2015, Congress can deny extending expedited consideration for implementing bills through various mechanisms, including the \"Extension Disapproval Resolution\" and the \"Procedural Disapproval Resolution.\" Congress also has the authority to override TPA procedures and consider implementing bills under its general rules. In TPA-2015, Congress can limit the use of expedited procedures for implementing bills through mechanisms like the \"Extension Disapproval Resolution.\" The President requested an extension of TPA until July 1, 2021, which was granted as neither chamber adopted an EDR before the deadline. The EDR control lies with the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance. Under TPA-2015, Congress can withdraw expedited legislative consideration from an implementing bill if the President fails to adequately notify or consult Congress, or if the agreement does not progress in achieving the act's purposes. The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance have control over Extension Disapproval Resolutions. Under TPA-2015, Congress can withdraw expedited legislative consideration from an implementing bill if the President fails to adequately notify or consult Congress, or if the agreement does not progress in achieving the act's purposes. The \"procedural disapproval resolution\" (PDR) allows both houses to adopt a resolution within 60 days, preventing the expedited procedure for that bill. The PDR is a simple resolution in each chamber, enforcing the negotiating objectives and consultation requirements of a trade agreement. Under TPA-2015, Congress can withdraw expedited consideration from an implementing bill if certain conditions are not met. The House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance control the use of the procedural disapproval resolution (PDR). The resolution must be reported by the respective revenue committee before it can be considered on the floor. This limits the expedited procedure to the first resolution reported in each chamber for a given trade agreement. Under TPA-2015, each chamber can withdraw expedited consideration from an implementing bill on a trade agreement only once. A \"mock markup\" is an informal method for the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee to provide advice on the bill before it goes to both houses. This process is not legally binding. Under TPA-2015, a \"mock conference\" is an informal process where the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee provide advice on a draft bill. This process is not legally binding, and the President can choose whether to accept the advice. The committees' preferences are signaled to the executive, and the implementing bill submitted to Congress often reflects the results of the mock markup. If the revenue committees are unhappy with the bill, they can request Congress to deny expedited consideration. Under TPA-2015, a simple resolution can be adopted by either house if changes to U.S. trade remedy laws in a trade agreement bill are inconsistent with statutory negotiating objectives. The resolution must be reported by the revenue committee for floor consideration, following an expedited procedure under Section 152. Unlike a PDR, TPA-2015 does not specify the process for this resolution. TPA-2015 allows for a resolution to be adopted if changes in trade agreement bills are inconsistent with statutory negotiating objectives. The resolution must be reported for floor consideration under an expedited procedure. Unlike a PDR, the process for this resolution is not specified. The proposal emphasizes using a \"Consultation and Compliance Resolution\" (CCR) to address inadequate consultation by the executive branch regarding trade agreements. This resolution asserts that the President failed to notify or consult as required, leading to the trade authorities procedures not applying to the implementing bill in question in that chamber. Unlike a PDR, the CCR only needs one chamber to withdraw expedited consideration, potentially preventing the effective operation of the expedited procedure. TPA-2015 provides separate procedures for a Consultation and Compliance Resolution (CCR) in each chamber, without expedited consideration. In the Senate, if the Committee on Finance does not report an implementing bill favorably, a CCR must be reported instead. The Senate may choose not to consider this resolution, but if a motion is made, it could be filibustered, requiring a cloture vote to limit consideration. In the Senate, a Consultation and Compliance Resolution (CCR) may require a cloture vote to limit consideration if a motion is made, potentially taking up to two days to reach a vote. In the House, the CCR process is triggered if the Committee on Ways and Means reports an implementing bill \"with other than a favorable recommendation.\" If a Member submits a CCR, the committee must consider it within four days and report it within six days. The resolution's path to the floor and terms of consideration are not specified. The House can withdraw expedited consideration from an implementing bill using resolutions reported by the Committee on Rules. The expedited procedures provided by TPA statutes are procedural rules that can be changed or overridden by each house. The House usually considers implementing bills under special rules from the Committee on Rules, allowing for amendments. The House can withdraw expedited consideration from an implementing bill using resolutions reported by the Committee on Rules. Special rules from the Committee on Rules usually retain the statutory prohibition against amendment for revenue bills. The Senate typically considers implementing bills under expedited procedures to avoid the need for a super-majority vote for cloture. Congress lacks the constitutional authority to prevent the President from entering into trade agreements. Under the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Congress could deny expedited consideration of a trade agreement bill within a 60-day period. The TPA legislation provides procedural means for Congress to maintain control over the executive branch's trade authority. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) statutes allow Congress to preserve its authority over trade agreements by including specific negotiating objectives and requirements for notification and consultation during negotiations. This enables the House and Senate revenue committees to monitor and ensure the acceptability of trade agreements reached. The procedural mechanisms discussed enable Congress, particularly the revenue committees, to control the content and consideration of trade agreements. Implementing bills cannot be amended under the expedited procedure, so the revenue committees shape the bill before introduction. Each house retains the ability to consider implementing bills under its general rules. TPA-2015 allows for implementing bills to be considered under general rules, not just the expedited procedure. It ensures that trade agreements cannot override US laws or prevent their amendment. Any agreement adopted under TPA authority is not self-executing and would require further legislative action to displace any federal, state, or local law. Under TPA-2015, implementing legislation amending U.S. law must be \"strictly necessary or appropriate\" to implement trade agreement commitments. The U.S. would be bound by international law in agreements with foreign countries, potentially facing consequences like increased tariffs if laws violate the agreement. Governments may need to amend inconsistent laws to avoid penalties. To comply with trade agreements, the United States may need to amend laws that conflict with the agreement to avoid penalties."
