The Congress finds disparities in health outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups, including higher infant death rates among African-Americans, increased cancer death rates for African-Americans compared to Whites, and higher diabetes incidence among Native Americans and African-Americans. Additionally, new cases of hepatitis and tuberculosis are more common in Asians and Pacific Islanders living in the United States. (6) Same-sex couples report delays in getting necessary prescriptions.\n(7) Black women have higher infant mortality rates compared to other races.\n(8) Low-income children have higher mortality and disability rates.\n(9) White children are healthier than Black and Latino children.\n(10) African-Americans have the highest obesity rate among U.S. adults. African-Americans have the highest obesity rate at 47.9%, followed by Hispanics at 42.5%, Whites at 32.6%, and Asians at 10.8%. African-Americans have a higher risk of stroke and HIV infection, with Black men who have sex with men having the most new infections among youth. In the same urban community, those below the poverty line were twice as likely to contract HIV. Persons with less than a high school diploma and high school graduates were more likely to report major depression than those with at least some college education. Only about 10 percent of physicians practice in rural America despite nearly one-fourth of the population living in these areas. Rural residents are less likely to have health care coverage or prescription drug coverage, and the rural poor are less likely to be covered by Medicaid benefits than urban counterparts. Twenty percent of nonmetropolitan counties lack mental health services compared to 5 percent of metropolitan counties. In nonmetropolitan counties, 20 percent lack mental health services compared to 5 percent in metropolitan counties. Fifteen percent of persons with disabilities don't see a doctor due to cost, while only 6 percent of the general population face the same issue. SEC. 3. INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE STUDY. The Secretary will arrange for the Institute of Medicine to study health disparities in preventive interventions, factors contributing to inequities, existing programs to reduce disparities, successful strategies, intervention program priorities, and opportunities for program expansion. The Institute of Medicine will submit a report to the Secretary and Congress on the results of the study on health disparities in preventive interventions and existing programs to reduce disparities. SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTH DISPARITIES REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. The Secretary will develop guidelines for entities to reduce health disparities and may award grants for programs aligned with these guidelines. The Department of Health and Human Services will incorporate these guidelines into its activities. Entities applying for a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with specific information as required. This includes a description of the target population and public health concern, an outreach plan for those in need, strategies for program development and implementation, and ensuring sustainability of interventions. Entities applying for a grant must provide data on the population served, improvements in reducing health disparities, and effectiveness of interventions. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2016, with additional funding for fiscal years 2017 through 2020. SEC. 5. TESTING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND DELIVERY MODELS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. The Secretary will test a payment and service delivery model through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to reduce health disparities. The model must include incentives and meet cost and quality criteria. Documentation for model testing must include targeting a health disparity, root-cause analysis, performance targets, and payment contingency proposals. The Secretary will test a payment and service delivery model through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to reduce health disparities. This includes incentives, cost and quality criteria, targeting a health disparity, root-cause analysis, performance targets, and payment contingency proposals. The proposal aims to make payments contingent on reducing health disparities and monitoring progress towards that goal. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"health disparity\" as significant differences in disease rates compared to the general population, \"intervention\" as activities to reduce health disparities, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
