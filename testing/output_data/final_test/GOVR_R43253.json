The act typically includes special federal payments for specific initiatives, the District's operating budget for day-to-day functions, and enterprise funds. The District's operating budget covers day-to-day government functions, enterprise funds for facility maintenance, and long-term capital projects like road improvements. Revenue sources include local taxes, federal funds, and fees. General provisions in the budget address fiscal directives, administrative controls, and limitations on lobbying for statehood or voting representation. Congress has authority over the District of Columbia's budget, including funding for new initiatives like public charter schools and a school voucher program.

The District of Columbia Council approved an FY2014 budget with $12.2 billion in operating funds and $2.2 billion in capital outlays, granting the District greater self-governance. The act proposed budget and legislative autonomy for the District of Columbia by enacting the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012.

Additionally, the act included provisions for advancing legislative autonomy by eliminating the requirement for proposed charter amendments. The act proposed budget and legislative autonomy for the District of Columbia by enacting the Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012. It aimed to remove congressional approval for the District's local budget, making it effective if Congress did not disapprove within 30 days. Additionally, the act included provisions for advancing legislative autonomy by eliminating the requirement for proposed charter amendments. The recent changes have eliminated the need to transmit proposed charter amendments to Congress, removed the 35-day congressional review period, and shortened the congressional review period by excluding certain days. The Appropriations Committee reported S. 1371, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for FY2014, recommending $676.2 million in special federal payments to the District. This is slightly more than FY2013 but less than requested by the Administration. The bill allocated funds for court operations and education initiatives, including public school improvements, support for charter schools, and a private school voucher program. The Senate committee bill, S. 1371, allocated $20 million for a private school voucher program and noted sufficient unexpended funds from previous appropriations. It mirrored provisions from the House committee bill, including budgetary controls and restrictions on federal funds for District statehood. The Senate committee bill included provisions related to the District of Columbia, such as funding for a private school voucher program and restrictions on federal funds for District statehood efforts. It also addressed issues like abortion services, medical marijuana regulation, and needle exchange programs. The Senate measure aimed to grant the District budget autonomy over locally raised funds by decoupling its fiscal year from the federal fiscal year. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill with $635.8 million in federal payments to the District, which was less than previous years and requested amounts. The House committee bill proposed $39 million less in funding compared to the Senate committee bill. It did not include funding for the District's Water and Sewer Authority and reduced the amount allocated for the Resident Tuition Support program by $20 million. The bill allocated $54 million to support District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, and private school vouchers. It also included provisions for budgetary controls and restrictions on fund reprogramming. The city's Chief Financial Officer would be required to submit a revised operating budget. The House committee bill required the city's Chief Financial Officer to submit a revised operating budget for all District government agencies and public schools within 30 days. It included provisions related to statehood and congressional representation, such as prohibiting the use of federal funds for certain purposes and supporting voting representation efforts. Unlike the Senate committee bill, H.R. 2786 also prohibited the use of District funds for certain purposes. H.R. 2786 prohibited the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, needle exchange, and decriminalizing/regulating medical marijuana. Congress approved a continuing appropriation measure, P.L. 113-46, providing funding for federal agencies until January 15, 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, P.L. 113-76, appropriated funds for federal agencies.

Congress retains the power to review and approve all legislative acts of the District government, including its annual budget. Despite the lack of congressional approval, District officials tapped into a $144 million contingency reserve fund to provide essential services during a 16-day government shutdown in October 2013. Congress later passed a bill providing continuing appropriations through January 15, 2014. The District of Columbia's FY2014 budget of $12.2 billion was approved through the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, allowing the District to spend locally raised revenues as outlined in its budget request.

AIDS among intravenous drug abusers is a key policy issue for Congress in reviewing the District's FY2014 appropriations. The debate over funding a needle exchange program involves home rule, public health policy, and government involvement in illegal drug use. Proponents argue that needle exchange programs reduce HIV spread by preventing needle sharing, while opponents believe it sanctions drug use and advocate for drug treatment programs instead. The issue also raises questions about the city's autonomy in using local funds for such programs. The debate over funding a needle exchange program in the District of Columbia involves home rule and the city's ability to use local funds free from congressional restrictions. Congress must decide whether to use federal funds for this issue. Previous acts prohibited the use of federal and District funds for needle exchange programs, with restrictions on privately funded activities as well. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act of FY2002 initially included a provision banning the injection of illegal drugs within 1,000 feet of schools, which was later removed. The act allowed private funds for needle exchange programs but prohibited the use of District and federal funds. Prevention Works operates a needle exchange program in the district, required to track public and private fund usage. District officials tried unsuccessfully to lift the funding prohibition in the FY2004 Appropriations Act. The FY2004 bill lifted the prohibition on District funds for needle exchange programs, allowing private funds and requiring separate accounting for needle exchange funds. The FY2008 Appropriations Act allowed District funds for needle exchange programs to combat HIV and AIDS among drug users. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. 113-76, continued to prohibit the use of federal funds for needle exchange programs in the District of Columbia. The act also addressed the city's HIV/AIDS health crisis and the controversy surrounding the medical marijuana initiative. The FY1999 Appropriations Act included a provision prohibiting the counting of ballots for a 1998 voter-approved medical marijuana initiative in DC. A lawsuit challenged Congress's power to block the initiative, with a ruling allowing the city to tally the votes. Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution to prevent the initiative's implementation. To prevent the implementation of the medical marijuana ballot initiative (Initiative 59), Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval. Language prohibiting the initiative was included in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2000. Opponents argued that this undermined home rule. The FY2002 Appropriations Act continued to block the initiative's implementation. Legal challenges were made in court by the Marijuana Policy Project and the Medical Marijuana Initiative Committee. In March 2002, a lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court to allow a medical marijuana initiative on the November 2002 ballot. The court ruled the congressional ban on using public funds for the initiative unconstitutional, citing a violation of First Amendment rights. However, the ruling was later reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals in September 2002. The appeals court ruled on September 19, 2002, allowing Congress to regulate interstate drug marketing. District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2010 removed language prohibiting the use of District funds for medical marijuana regulation. In 2010, the District of Columbia Council approved legislation regulating medical marijuana. The legislation allowed the licensing of medical marijuana dispensaries in the District of Columbia, with the first one opening in July 2013. Both House and Senate committee bills aimed to prohibit the use of federal funds for legalizing or reducing penalties for medical marijuana. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014 also prohibited the use of federal funds for decriminalizing or regulating medical marijuana. Since 1979, Congress has restricted public funding for abortion services for District of Columbia residents, citing it as congressional intrusion into local matters. The District was initially allowed to use its funds for abortion services, but restrictions were imposed in 1989 with the passage of the District of Columbia Appropriations Act. In FY1989, P.L. 100-462 restricted the use of District and federal funds for abortion services to cases where the woman's life would be endangered. President Reagan endorsed the inclusion of District funds and elimination of rape or incest as qualifying conditions for public funding of abortion services. President George H.W. Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue. P.L. 101-168 was signed after Congress included language prohibiting the use of District revenues for abortion services except in cases where the woman's life was endangered. The provision limiting District funding of abortion services was successfully removed when Congress passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act. In FY1994, Congress passed the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, reinstating rape and incest as qualifying circumstances for public funding of abortion services. However, in FY1996 and subsequent years, restrictions were placed on the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, limiting them to cases where the woman's life was endangered or in cases of rape or incest. In FY2010, Congress lifted the prohibition on District funds for abortion services but maintained restrictions on federal funds, except in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the woman's life. During the 112th Congress, appropriations acts for FY2011 and FY2012 included provisions restricting federal and District funds for abortion services, allowing exceptions for rape, incest, or endangerment to the woman's life. The House passed H.R. 3, which aimed to permanently prohibit the use of funds for abortion services except in specific circumstances. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee ordered reported H.R. 3803, the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, H.R. 3803, aimed to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for endangerment to the woman's life. It included fines and imprisonment for violating doctors, allowed civil actions against those performing late-term abortions, and required reporting of abortion details to the District health agency. The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, H.R. 3803, aimed to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for endangerment to the woman's life. It included fines and imprisonment for violating doctors, allowed civil actions against those performing late-term abortions, and required reporting of abortion details to the District health agency. The Obama Administration's FY2014 budget request included provisions regarding the use of federal funds for abortion services, with S. 1371 supporting restrictions on federal funds and H.R. 2786 restricting both federal and District funds for abortion services. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2014, P.L. 113-76 prohibits the use of District and federal funds for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the woman's life is endangered. It also authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia, providing scholarships for students to attend private schools. The federal government provides funding for DC Public Schools, public charter schools, and vouchers in the District of Columbia. This three-prong approach supports elementary and secondary education. The Opportunity Scholarship program, reauthorized through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, allocates $60 million annually for FY2012 through FY2016, divided evenly among DCPS, public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program. The reauthorized Opportunity Scholarship program is part of a broader approach to supporting education in the District of Columbia. The proposed budget includes $30 million for DC Public Schools, $20 million for public charter schools, and $2.2 million for the Opportunity Scholarship program. S. 1371 and H.R. 2786 would have allocated a total of $52.2 million and $54 million respectively for school improvement funding. H.R. 2786 would have provided $54 million for school improvement, divided evenly among public schools, charter schools, and scholarships to private schools in the District of Columbia. Congress granted limited home rule powers to the city in 1973, allowing for the election of a mayor and city council, but retained the power to review and approve all District laws, including the annual budget process. The District of Columbia's budget is sent to Congress for approval, going through various stages including subcommittee hearings, markups, committee reports, and final passage within 120 days before the fiscal year starts on October 1. Delays in Congress's approval hinder the city's financial management according to District leaders. The District of Columbia's budget approval process has been delayed for the past 18 years due to complications in the congressional appropriations process. This has hindered the city's financial management and delivery of public services. In FY1997, the D.C. appropriations act was the only one enacted before the fiscal year. The Senate committee's FY2014 appropriations act included provisions for the District to have some autonomy over locally raised revenues. The District of Columbia has faced budget approval delays for 18 years due to congressional appropriations issues. The FY2014 Senate committee bill aimed to give the District autonomy over local revenues, allowing them to spend local funds if federal appropriations were not enacted before the start of the fiscal year. Before the start of the District's 2015 fiscal year, Congress included language in budget resolutions to allow the District to use local funds for operations. In FY2014, the House passed a resolution to use locally raised revenues until December 15, 2013, but the Senate did not consider the bill during the 16-day shutdown. City officials urged the Senate to act on the House bill, citing a $144 million contingency fund. The Senate will consider a bill passed by the House, as a $144 million contingency fund used to keep the city operating is running out. Mayor Vincent Gray stated that the lack of a congressionally approved budget has caused delays in payments to Metro and threatened payments to the District's charter schools. Congress passed a bill providing continuing appropriations through January 15, 2014, releasing the District of Columbia General Fund Budget for FY2014 from further congressional review and approval. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2014, P.L. 113-76, appropriated funds for the District's General Fund Budget and special federal payments, allowing access to locally raised revenues outlined in the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Request Act of 2013 (D.C. Act 20-0127)."
