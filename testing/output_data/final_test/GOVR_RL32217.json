    "content": "President Bush announced a 48-hour deadline for Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq to avoid war, citing the regime's history of aggression, hatred towards America, and support for terrorists, including Al Qaeda. The Administration argued for an Iraq-Al Qaeda linkage based on contacts between Iraqi intelligence and Al Qaeda, ties to Ansar al-Islam in northern Iraq, and potential involvement in the September 11 plot, which is widely disputed. The Administration's stance on Iraqi involvement in the September 11 attacks is widely disputed. President Bush and some officials have ruled out Iraqi involvement, while others, like Vice President Cheney, believe the issue is still open. Secretary of State Powell presented the Administration's view at the United Nations Security Council, focusing on Iraq's alleged WMD programs and potential ties to terrorism, including Al Qaeda. Iraq is said to have a long history of connections to terrorism, with a potentially dangerous link to the Al Qaeda network. Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda. There were multiple high-level meetings between members of both organizations since the early 1990s, with Iraqis visiting bin Laden in Afghanistan. The Iraqi embassy in Pakistan served as a liaison to Al Qaeda, facilitating the exchange of knowledge on bomb-making and document forgery. Al Qaeda sought expertise from Iraq on building bombs and forging documents. Secretary Powell's briefing did not mention Iraq's involvement in 9/11. Post-Saddam analysis challenges the Administration's argument on Saddam-Al Qaeda links. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence of a connection. The 9/11 Commission found no evidence of a \"collaborative operational linkage\" between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Former CIA Director George Tenet suggested that contacts between Saddam's regime and Al Qaeda were for assessing each other rather than collaborating. A study based on documents captured in post-Saddam Iraq revealed support for Egyptian Islamic Jihad, which later merged with Al Qaeda. The documents do not show direct coordination between Saddam Hussein's regime and Al Qaeda. Intelligence information used by the Bush Administration to assess linkages between Iraq and Al Qaeda was publicized in Secretary of State Powell's briefing and in an article in The Weekly Standard. The article contains excerpts from a memorandum by Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith to Senators Roberts and Rockefeller. The \"Office of Special Plans\" within the Department of Defense conducted research on Iraqi intelligence and its alleged relationship with Al Qaeda in the early 1990s. The Administration believed that Iraq provided Al Qaeda with weapons in exchange for not undermining Saddam's regime. This occurred when Osama bin Laden was in Sudan before moving to Afghanistan. Iraq was seen as isolated in the Arab world after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. In the early 1990s, Iraqi intelligence officers visited bin Laden's camp in Sudan and discussed cooperation in manufacturing explosive devices. Meetings continued in Afghanistan and Pakistan until the late 1990s, with Al Qaeda operatives instructed to travel to Iraq for training in chemical weapons. Secretary of State Powell mentioned in a U.N. briefing that Iraq had received Al Qaeda operatives for help in acquiring poison gases. Some evaluations of the intelligence suggested inconclusive evidence of sporadic contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda, with CIA experts noting ideological differences between the two groups. Bin Laden sought to raise an Islamic army to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1990. Bin Laden's idea to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1990 was rebuffed by the Saudi royal family, leading to a split between bin Laden and the Saudi leadership. Bin Laden left Saudi Arabia for Sudan in 1991 due to ideological differences with Iraq. In a 2003 statement, bin Laden referred to Saddam Hussein's regime as \"socialist and infidel,\" but also urged the Iraqi people to resist U.S. military action. Iraq had an embassy in Pakistan, which the Administration claimed was its link to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The skepticism of a Saddam-Al Qaeda link is based on the fact that Iraq did not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan during their rule from 1996-2001. None of the 12 identified Al Qaeda leaders in 2003 were Iraqi nationals, suggesting that Iraqis did not have Saddam Hussein's approval to join Al Qaeda. Additionally, few Iraqis had the opportunity to join Al Qaeda during its formative years in Afghanistan due to their involvement in the Iran-Iraq war. During the Iran-Iraq war, Iraqis were not available for regional causes. The presence of Ansar al-Islam in Iraq, considered the forerunner of Al Qaeda in Iraq, became a concern after Al Qaeda activists fled to Iraq in 2001. Ansar al-Islam formed in 1998 as a breakaway faction of Islamist Kurds. At its peak, around 600 Arab fighters were associated with the Ansar al-Islam movement near Khurmal. They clashed with Kurdish fighters from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in December 2002 and were linked to an assassination attempt against Barham Salih in April 2002. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian Arab leader, was part of the Arab contingent within Ansar al-Islam and was connected to Al Qaeda plots in the 1990s and early 2000s. During the December 1999 millennium celebration in Jordan, there were reported attempts to spread chemical agents in Russia, Western Europe, and the United States. U.S. officials claimed that Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq was connected to the terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, an associate of Osama bin Laden. Zarqawi had links to Ansar al-Islam and had received medical treatment in Baghdad in 2002. Nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there. Zarqawi can direct his network in the Middle East and beyond from his terrorist network in Iraq. Questions arise about the extent of links between Baghdad and Ansar al-Islam, as Baghdad did not control northern Iraq even before Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Administration's view is that Saddam saw Ansar as a means of pressuring his Kurdish opponents. Allegations of contacts between lead September 11 hijacker Mohammad Atta and Iraq intelligence are reportedly included in a DOD memorandum. The DOD memo alleges meetings between Atta and Iraq's intelligence chief in Prague, where funds were provided. Reports suggest Iraqi intelligence officers facilitated meetings with Al Qaeda operatives in southeast Asia, possibly linked to the USS Cole attack and September 11 plot. Powell and Bush had reservations about the uncertain information. President Bush did not mention the allegation of Iraq's involvement in the September 11 plot in his State of the Union message. There is dispute within Czech intelligence about the Iraq-Atta meetings, particularly the April 2001 meeting. Czech officials initially confirmed a meeting between Atta and al-Ani, but later clarified that they discussed an attack on anti-Saddam broadcasts. U.S. officials suspected a meeting between Atta and al-Ani in Prague to plan an attack on anti-Saddam broadcasts. However, investigations by the FBI and CIA found no concrete evidence of Iraqi regime involvement in the September 11 attacks. Al Ani denied the meeting took place when captured by U.S. forces in 2003. The United States is concerned about the threat posed by Al Qaeda elements in post-Saddam Iraq. President Bush emphasized the fight against terrorism in Iraq, calling it the \"central front\" in the war on terrorism. The United States is focused on combating Al Qaeda in Iraq to prevent the group from organizing attacks within the country. President Bush highlighted the ongoing threat posed by Al Qaeda in Anbar Province, where they aim to destabilize Iraq's democracy and launch attacks on the United States. The enemy in Iraq is more ruthless than Al Qaeda, using suicide bombers and beheading captives. Critics argue that the U.S. invasion of Iraq has fueled Al Qaeda's presence in the country, leading to new followers and increased attacks against the United States. This view is supported by a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate. The Administration has emphasized an \"Al Qaeda\" component of the insurgency in Iraq to bolster U.S. public support for the war effort. There is debate over the degree to which AQ-I has driven the insurgency against U.S. forces and the government of Iraq. There has been a \"foreign fighter\" component in the insurgency since mid-2003. The U.S. commander in Iraq stated that most attacks on U.S. forces were by former regime loyalists and other Iraqis, not foreign fighters. However, other commanders highlighted the impact of high-profile suicide bombings by foreign fighters, such as the August 2003 bombings of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad and a mosque in Najaf. These attacks raised doubts about the U.S. ability to stabilize post-Saddam Iraq. The United States focused on combatting Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his successors in Iraq, leading to the renaming of his organization to Al Qaeda in Iraq. The group was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, prompting increased U.S. military efforts to target them. On June 7, 2006, U.S. forces tracked Zarqawi to a safe house in Hibhib, near Baqubah, Diyala province, and an airstrike mortally wounded him. Ansar al-Sunna, an offshoot of Zarqawi's network, operated in northern Iraq and was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The group later changed its name back to Ansar al-Islam in November 2007. The AQ-I umbrella group, also known as the \"Islamic State of Iraq,\" claimed responsibility for significant attacks in Iraq, including twin suicide attacks in Irbil in 2004 and a suicide bombing at Camp Marez in Mosul in 2004. Ansar al-Sunna, linked to Zarqawi's network, continued to carry out attacks targeting various groups in Iraq. Zarqawi's strategy aimed to incite civil war between Shiite Arabs. AQ-I's strategy under Zarqawi aimed to provoke a civil war between Shiite and Sunni Arabs in Iraq, with the goal of undermining Shiite political control and forcing U.S. forces to leave. This strategy was controversial within Al Qaeda, as Zawahiri questioned the targeting of Shiite civilians, fearing it would alienate Iraqi support for AQ-I and the Sunni insurgency. AQ-I under Zarqawi focused on suicide bombings targeting Shiites to provoke a civil war in Iraq. The February 22, 2006, bombing of the Shiite \"Golden Mosque\" in Samarra is widely attributed to AQ-I and is considered to have started the civil war that lasted until late 2007. President Bush acknowledged Zarqawi's success in his strategy. AQ-I, identified as a driving force of the insurgency in Iraq, carried out the deadliest attack in August 2007, killing around 500 Yazidis. Gen. Michael Maples labeled AQ-I as the largest terrorist group in Iraq, while Gen. David Petraeus called them \"public enemy number one.\" AQ-I, labeled as \"public enemy number one\" in Iraq, was responsible for 80 to 90% of suicide bombings in the country. US commanders focused on defeating AQ-I, noting that most combat deaths were caused by roadside bombs and munitions likely wielded by Iraqi Sunni insurgent fighters. President Bush implemented a new counter-insurgency strategy in January 2007. The new U.S. strategy aimed to increase troops in Baghdad and Anbar Province to protect civilians from sectarian violence and insurgency. The troop surge began in June 2007 to take advantage of a growing rift within the insurgency and counter AQ-I's tactics of provoking civil war. Iraqi Sunnis had discernible political goals and not all supported AQ-I's ideology. Iraqi Sunnis have political goals in Iraq, including preventing power sharing compromise with Shiites. AQ-I fighters aim to defeat the United States and establish a Sunni-led Islamic state in Iraq. Some Sunnis resent AQ-I's strict practices and attacks on civilians. AQ-I fighters killed Iraqi Sunnis who violated strictures, causing strains with Iraqi Sunni insurgent fighters competing for power. Iraqi Sunnis initially cooperated with AQ-I to overturn the Shiite-dominated power structure but tensions emerged in 2005 with reported battles. U.S. commanders had not yet addressed these strains. In January 2006, AQ-I formed the \"Mujahidin Shura Council\" with six groups, including five Iraqi Sunni insurgent groups, to show cooperation. Abdullah Rashid al-Baghdadi was appointed as the leader, though doubts existed about his true identity. After Zarqawi's death, Abu Ayub al-Masri took over as leader of the Mujahidin Shura Council and continued targeting Coalition forces and Shi'a civilians to incite sectarian strife. He later declared the formation of the \"Islamic State of Iraq\" (ISI) under which AQ-I and its allies carried out attacks. The Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) was formed by Abu Ayub al-Masri after Zarqawi's death, with a \"cabinet\" named in April 2007. Efforts to improve cooperation with Iraqi insurgents did not satisfy the Sunni community, leading to the formation of the Anbar Salvation Council in September 2006. U.S. commanders began cooperating with Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar Province in the \"Awakening\" movement to expel AQ-I and secure the region. The Anbar Salvation Council, led by tribal sub-leader Abd al-Sattar Al Rishawi, recruited 13,000 young Sunnis to secure Anbar cities. After Rishawi's death in 2007, his brother took over the group. The Council, along with Anbar governor and tribal figures, visited Washington D.C. to discuss security progress. The U.S. troop surge included 4,000 Marines in Anbar, which encouraged the Council to continue recruiting volunteers and cooperate with U.S. forces to prevent violence. The U.S. commanders worked with locally recruited Sunni security forces, known as \"Sons of Iraq,\" offering funds and training but not weapons. The Shiite-dominated Maliki government is hesitant to integrate all Sons of Iraq fighters into the official Iraqi Security Forces, fearing Sunni power resurgence. This reluctance risks driving Sunnis back into insurgent ranks. The Maliki government's reluctance to integrate all Sons of Iraq fighters into the official Iraqi Security Forces risks driving Sunnis back into insurgent ranks. Despite security improvements in Anbar Province, some Sons of Iraq have abandoned their positions out of frustration. General Petraeus praised the security improvements in Anbar, reporting a significant decline in security incidents. He estimated that Anbar Province could be turned over to Provincial Iraqi Control by July 2008. The handover delay in Iraq is due to a power struggle between Awakening tribal figures and Iraqi Sunni parties. Positive trends in Anbar led to more Sunnis joining the Awakening movement. In Diyala, a Salvation Council was formed to stabilize the province. Former Sunni insurgents in Amiriyah formed the \"Amiriyah Freedom Fighters\" with US support. Similar transformations occurred in other Baghdad neighborhoods. The US military established combat outposts and Joint Security Stations to clear neighborhoods of AQ-I. Security Stations were established in partnership with the ISF to clear neighborhoods of AQ-I and gather information. Prime Minister Maliki stated that AQ-I had been largely driven out of Baghdad, a claim supported by Gen. Petraeus. Operations like Phantom Thunder and Phantom Strike aimed to combat AQ-I and clear their sanctuaries, including surrounding Baquba to prevent their escape. In August 2007, Operation Phantom Strike was conducted to prevent AQ-I from establishing new sanctuaries. In January 2008, Operation Iron Harvest and Operation Iron Reaper were carried out to disrupt AQ-I in northern Iraq. General Petraeus testified before Congress in April 2008, stating that the assistance from Sons of Iraq and relentless pursuit by U.S. forces had significantly reduced the threat posed by AQ-I. By May 2008, CIA Director Michael Hayden mentioned that Al Qaeda was on the verge of a strategic defeat in Iraq due to reduced presence and activity. Gen. James Conway stated in August 2008 that AQ-I had permanently lost its foothold in large parts of Iraq. In late July 2008, a reputed AQ-I leader in Anbar told the Washington Post that AQ-I leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri had left Iraq to go to Afghanistan or Pakistan. General Petraeus testified that AQ-I remains active in Mosul and views it as key to its survival in Iraq. He emphasized the need to maintain pressure on AQ-I and its support networks. The U.S. National Intelligence Officer for Transnational Threats stated that despite setbacks, AQ-I remains Al Qaeda's most prominent regional affiliate, with leaders still viewing Iraq as a central front. Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri have issued statements to rally support for the fight in Iraq. The Iraq jihad is portrayed as part of a wider regional cause to \"liberate\" Jerusalem. Estimates suggest around 3,000 non-Iraqi fighters in Iraq, making up about 10% of the insurgency. The State Department report on terrorism for 2007 indicates that AQ-I is the largest Sunni extremist group in Iraq with a membership estimated at 5,000 - 10,000. U.S. commanders reported a flow of 60-80 foreign fighters entering Iraq per month in July 2007, which decreased to about 40 in October 2007 due to U.S. operations. General Petraeus testified in April 2008 that approximately 50 - 70 foreign fighters were still entering Iraq. In April 2008, General Petraeus testified that 50-70 foreign fighters were still entering Iraq from Syria, with estimates in June and July 2008 showing a flow of 20-30 fighters per month. Saudi Arabia and Libya accounted for 60% of the 700 foreign fighters entering Iraq over the past year, according to a study by the Combating Terrorism Center of West Point. The Sinjar records from February 2008 showed that a significant number of foreign fighters in Iraq were of Saudi, Libyan, Syrian, Yemeni, Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian, Jordanian, and Egyptian origin. There were also reports of AQ-I relocating to Pakistan tribal areas, suggesting closer links between AQ-I and Al Qaeda's central leadership. Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be hiding in Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be hiding in Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's capabilities may have increased with the influx of AQ-I fighters from Iraq. U.S. commanders in Afghanistan are observing growing signs of Al Qaeda involvement in the insurgency, but it is unclear if assistance is coming from fighters relocated from Iraq. The United States is combating the Afghan insurgency through direct action on the Pakistani border. The links between AQ-I and Al Qaeda's central leadership are tightening, as President Bush stated in a speech that Zarqawi formally joined Al Qaeda in 2004 and pledged allegiance to bin Laden. Zarqawi had met both bin Laden and Zawahiri, strengthening the connection between AQ-I and Al Qaeda's central leadership. After Zarqawi's death, bin Laden sent an aide named Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi to help Zarqawi's successor, al-Masri. AQ-I leader Khalid al-Mashhadani told U.S. authorities that Baghdadi was fictitious. Brig. Gen. Bergner stated that Mashhadani is an intermediary between al-Masri and bin Laden and Zawahiri. AQ-I is the only insurgent group in Iraq with ambitions to use the country as a base for attacks outside Iraq. President Bush mentioned AQ-I's involvement in terrorist attacks in Jordan and other incidents. AQ-I attempted to launch a rocket attack on U.S. Navy ships in Jordan in August 2005. Experts debate the extent of the relationship between Al Qaeda's central leadership and AQ-I, with some suggesting a limited connection. There is little evidence that AQ-I seeks to attack outside Iraq, with incidents mainly occurring in Jordan. Since the 2005 attacks, there have been no attacks outside Iraq directly attributed to AQ-I."
