    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 56804 of the Government Code is amended to require a comprehensive fiscal analysis for any proposal involving disincorporation. The analysis must include direct and indirect costs incurred by the city for providing public services in the three fiscal years before the proposal. The comprehensive fiscal analysis for a disincorporation proposal must include costs for current and proposed improvements, funding sources for assuming obligations, anticipated costs for providing services, transfer of public services to state agencies, and city revenues for the three preceding fiscal years. The comprehensive fiscal analysis for a disincorporation proposal must include all current and long-term liabilities, potential financing mechanisms for addressing shortfalls, and any other necessary information for making required findings. Section 56816 of the Government Code is amended to ensure that any proposal for disincorporation of a city includes a determination of the city's debt and obligations, which will remain the responsibility of the territory for repayment. The city must provide detailed financial information to the commission before the disincorporation proposal can proceed. The city must provide detailed financial information including current and future liabilities, internal and external debt, contractual obligations, retirement obligations, and revenue streams. Additionally, the city must identify the successor agency to the former redevelopment agency. Section 57405 of the Government Code states that the county tax collector will collect any uncollected taxes or assessments from a disincorporated city on behalf of the designated successor agency or county. Section 57412 requires the governing body of the successor to collect debts due to the city and wind up its affairs as ordered by the commission. Reimbursement for mandated costs in this act will be provided to local agencies and school districts by the Commission on State Mandates according to the Government Code."
