    "content": "The Congress finds that advancements in technology allow for the delivery of a wide range of information and services to homes, schools, and communities, improving education and quality of life for all Americans. Interactive multimedia programs offer opportunities for learning in various subjects. The Act aims to establish State-based electronic libraries that offer a wide range of educational programs, research data, and networking opportunities accessible to all Americans through public libraries and online platforms. These libraries also provide computer program support services for search and retrieval. The Act establishes State-based electronic libraries with educational programs and resources accessible through public libraries and online platforms, including mechanisms for user guidance and training programs. The National Science Foundation is authorized to make multiyear grants to States for developing electronic libraries providing access to various databases, educational materials, and research information over the Internet and similar networks. To qualify for a grant, a State must establish a committee with representatives from various sectors to develop and implement a statewide plan for an electronic library accessible from schools and homes, providing data, multimedia programs, and informational services. The plan includes hardware and software for instructional programs on library access, such as computer servers, workstations, CD-ROMs, network access, search and retrieval programs, adhering to open architecture standards. The plan includes multimedia educational programs, information from Federal departments and agencies, State and local governments, colleges, universities, libraries, and research institutions, all available electronically. Networking is also emphasized. The plan includes networking for connectivity to the Internet, dial-in access, and advanced access to library materials. It also includes programs for creating computer graphics and software for educational use, and access to bibliographic information. The plan includes access to bibliographic information, databases on government services, coordination with other systems, and an education program for technology utilization. The plan involves utilizing technology to access electronic information resources, advancing networking efforts, and ensuring interoperability with other State systems through coordination with designated mechanisms. Additionally, there is a requirement for providing matching funds from State or private sources equal to at least 30 percent of the total grant cost. States meeting section 4 criteria can apply for grants under this Act. The National Science Foundation can transfer funds to other federal agencies for participation. Authorization of appropriations: $10,000,000 for 1994, $25,000,000 for 1995, and necessary sums for subsequent years."
