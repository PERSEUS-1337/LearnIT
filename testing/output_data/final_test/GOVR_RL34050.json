    "content": "The Missing and Exploited Children's (MEC) program, administered by the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, aims to prevent cases of missing and sexually exploited children. It includes the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in Alexandria, VA, which serves as a resource center for law enforcement agencies, families of child victims, and the public. NCMEC personnel take reports of missing and exploited children, provide technical assistance to locate abductors and recover missing children, and help identify child victims of sexual exploitation. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) receives approximately $28 million annually to help identify child victims of sexual exploitation and recover missing children. The Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force program, funded at around $27 million annually, supports state and local law enforcement units in investigating online child sexual exploitation. The AMBER Alert program, funded at approximately $2 million annually, provides technical assistance to states in alerting the public when children are abducted and believed to be in imminent danger. The Missing and Exploited Children (MEC) program receives approximately $4 million annually for grants and training on child victimization. The report covers federal involvement in missing children's issues, definitions of missing and sexually exploited children, and details of the MEC program. Congress has a long history of concern for missing children, dating back to the early 1970s. In the 1970s, Congress addressed runaway youth issues, leading to the Runaway Youth Act of 1974. Highly publicized cases of abducted and missing children in the late 1970s prompted policymakers to recognize a missing children problem. Prominent cases, like that of Adam Walsh, raised awareness of child abduction and abuse. In response to the missing children problem highlighted by cases like Adam Walsh's abduction, Congress passed the Missing Children Act of 1982. This act directed the Attorney General to maintain records on missing children in the NCIC's Missing Persons File and disseminate them to state and local authorities. The Missing Children Act of 1982 directed the FBI to maintain records on missing children and share them with state and local agencies. The Missing Children's Assistance Act of 1984 established OJJDP as the lead in recovering missing children and NCMEC as the national resource center. OJJDP provides support for training and technical assistance in child victimization cases. Funding authorization under the act is $40 million for FY2014 through FY2018. The Missing Children's Assistance Act authorizes $40 million for FY2014-FY2018, with up to $32.2 million allotted to NCMEC. The federal government has provided additional resources for missing and exploited children, including funding for the ICAC Task Force program to combat online child enticement and pornography. The PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 authorized $60 million for FY2009-FY2013 for ICAC activities and $2 million for FY2009-FY2016 for the National ICAC Data System. The Child Protection Act of 2012 and the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2017 authorized annual appropriations of $60 million for the ICAC Task Force program through FY2022. OJP first provided funding in 2002 for states and localities to develop AMBER Alert programs. The PROTECT Act of 2003 also provided resources to combat child exploitation. The PROTECT Act of 2003 established the national AMBER Alert program to address child exploitation, providing funding for states to develop communication plans and technologies. The program has continuously supported states' AMBER Alert plans and responses to child abductions since FY2004. Missing and sexually exploited children are distinct but overlapping populations, with missing children defined as individuals under 18 whose whereabouts are unknown to their legal custodian. The Missing Children's Assistance Act does not define child sexual exploitation, but federal statutes specify acts of sexual exploitation. The actual number of missing or sexually exploited children is unknown, but studies estimate the rate. The Act requires studies on missing children, including those missing due to abduction. DOJ has supported national incidence studies since 1984. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has conducted three national incidence studies on missing children, known as NISMART-1, 2, and 3. NISMART-3, conducted in 2013, includes findings from a survey of households and categorizes missing children into five groups. Cases are classified as \"caretaker missing\" or \"reported missing.\" The NISMART-3 study showed a decrease in rates of caretaker missing and reported missing children compared to NISMART-2. The decline was attributed to improved communication between parents and children, possibly due to increased cell phone use. The NISMART-3 report highlighted methodological challenges in reaching households due to the prevalence of cell phones. It focused on stereotypical kidnappings involving nonfamily abductions of children, with 105 victims identified in 2011. The report also mentioned criteria for such kidnappings, including overnight detention, transportation over 50 miles, ransom demands, intent to keep the child permanently, or death. The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence in 2008 revealed a significant number of children under 18 have been sexually victimized, but the true extent of sexual exploitation incidents remains unknown due to underreporting and varying definitions of exploitation. The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence in 2008 found that 6.1% of children were sexually victimized in the past year and 9.8% over their lifetimes. Girls were more likely to report victimization than boys. The National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence in 2008 found that 6.1% of children were sexually victimized in the past year and 9.8% over their lifetimes, with girls more likely to report victimization. Female adolescents ages 14 to 17 had the highest rate of victimization, with nearly 8% reporting victimization within the past year and 18.7% over their lifetimes. The MEC program received funding increases over the years, reaching $70 million in FY2009 following reauthorization and funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided funding for various federal programs to address the economic recession from 2007 to 2009. Specifically, $50 million was allocated for the ICAC Task Force program. NCMEC received the most funding each year, followed by the ICAC Task Force program. The FY2017 appropriation for the MEC program was $72.5 million. DOJ allocated $63.1 million for the program. The DOJ allocated $63.1 million for the MEC program, with $9.3 million for other expenses within OJP and OJJDP. NCMEC, a primary component of the program, employs over 300 people at its headquarters and regional offices in various states, providing case management and support for missing and exploited children. They offer various activities and services for families of missing children, training, and partnerships with state clearinghouses. NCMEC, funded through various sources including private contributions and DOJ grants, provides services for missing and exploited children. The USSS provides forensic assistance as mandated by Congress. The Call Center responds to calls on a 24-hour hotline. In FY2017, over 224,600 calls were received. The NCMEC Call Center responds to calls reporting missing children, sightings, and requests for assistance. Since 1987, reports of child sexual exploitation are routed to the Call Center. They provide various assistance activities, including sending educational materials, providing technical support to law enforcement and families, and offering information on transportation services for reunification. The Call Center has access to the FBI's NCIC Missing Person File. The NCMEC Call Center reviews the Missing Person File for records of missing children added by law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies must notify NCMEC of missing children from foster care and maintain liaison with NCMEC for information exchange. Cases of children at serious risk are flagged in NCIC for NCMEC. NCMEC can search the Missing Person File for long-term missing children over 18. Each missing child case is entered into NCMEC's database, and a case manager is assigned to provide assistance to locate abductors and recover the child. The Project ALERT program, established in 1992, assists law enforcement agencies in recovering missing children, particularly in long-term cases. It is comprised of retired law enforcement officials who provide case review, investigative strategies, and support to the families of missing children. Team Adam, created in 2003, offers rapid onsite response and investigative assistance. Team Adam, established in 2003, provides rapid onsite response and support to local law enforcement agencies in crimes-against-children investigations. The team, consisting of retired investigators, offers investigative and technical assistance at no cost. The Forensic Services Unit includes the Forensic Imaging Unit and Biometrics Team, aiding in the recovery of missing children and identification of deceased children and young adults. The NCMEC Forensic Unit, established in 1990, creates age-progressed images of missing children using software programs. These images are distributed to law enforcement, families, and media. They also produce age-regressed images for undercover operations. The Biometric Team provides support for long-term missing child cases and unidentified human cases. The NCMEC Forensic Unit supports long-term missing child cases and unidentified human remains by collecting DNA, dental records, fingerprints, and other identifying information. This data is uploaded to NamUs, a central repository for missing persons and unidentified decedent records, to aid in identifying unknown children. NCMEC assists with cases of children abducted to and from the United States under The Hague Convention. The State Department now handles international abduction cases, with NCMEC providing support by developing and distributing missing children posters. NCMEC also coordinates cases of American children abducted abroad and provides technical assistance to law enforcement. NCMEC provides technical assistance to law enforcement in cases of international child abduction, coordinates legal support for victim families, and receives forensic assistance from the Secret Service. The Exploited Children's Division was established in 1997. The Exploited Children's Division (ECD) at NCMEC, established in 1997 with funding from USSS, administers the Child Victim ID Program (CVIP) and CyberTipline. It analyzes data, monitors online sources for new cases, and collaborates with law enforcement agencies on child sexual exploitation cases. Additionally, the Sex Offender Tracking Team and Child Sex Trafficking Team within NCMEC also focus on exploited children's issues. CVIP started in 2002 in response to a Supreme Court decision on federal laws prohibiting pornography. CVIP analysts at NCMEC assist law enforcement with child pornography cases by examining seized images to identify child victims. They use computer software and visual analysis to determine if any images contain identified children. NCMEC also provides a secure website for authorized users to examine sanitized images for clues about a child's whereabouts and share comments and suggestions. The CyberTipline, established in 1998, is a national clearinghouse for reporting child sexual exploitation online. It operates 24/7 and requires electronic service providers to report such incidents. NCMEC administers the CyberTipline as authorized by the PROTECT Act of 2003. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 expanded requirements for tracking and registering sex offenders. NCMEC's Sex Offender Tracking Team assists law enforcement in locating noncompliant offenders by providing technical assistance and analysis. They developed a standard protocol for locating fugitive sex offenders using public databases. The Child Sex Trafficking Team at NCMEC provides technical support and analysis to law enforcement agencies to identify and recover children victimized by sex trafficking in the United States. They compare reports of suspected child sex trafficking victims with reports of missing children and collaborate with the FBI's Innocence Lost National Initiative. The team also assists in locating fugitive sex offenders through public databases and search tools. NCMEC's Family Advocacy Division supports families and law enforcement in cases of missing children linked to sex trafficking. Team HOPE, a part of the division, offers assistance to families coping with the disappearance of a child. NCMEC trainers provide training on child sexual exploitation and missing-child case detection to professionals nationwide and in Canada. NCMEC works closely with federal agencies, analysts follow CyberTipline leads, develop policies, and work with missing children's clearinghouses to disseminate information and provide assistance in cases of missing and exploited children. NCMEC provides training, technical assistance, and information to help handle missing-children cases. They serve as the national clearinghouse for AMBER Alert information and work with international institutions to combat online child pornography. The ICAC Task Force program, authorized under the PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008, supports state and local law enforcement in responding to online crimes against children. It aims to increase officers' capabilities, conduct investigations, and provide training and assistance in detecting and apprehending offenders. The ICAC Task Force program supports state and local law enforcement in investigating online crimes against children through assistance in investigation, forensics, prosecution, community outreach, and capacity-building. Currently, 61 regional task forces operate, receiving leads from CyberTipline analysts at NCMEC and conducting proactive investigations and undercover operations. The Attorney General awards grants to state and local ICAC task forces based on a formula established by DOJ, distributing 75% of funds with the remaining 25% based on need. Factors considered include population, investigative leads, criminal cases, successful prosecutions, training, and public education on child exploitation offenses. DOJ established the ICAC Training and Technical Assistance program to provide training on improving investigation, technologies, and prosecutorial capabilities for ICAC task forces. The National ICAC Data System (NIDS) was established to build upon Operation Fairplay, facilitating online law enforcement investigations of child exploitation and data collection. The National ICAC Data System (NIDS) was created by the DOJ to combat child exploitation by providing real-time data collection, undercover infrastructure, suspect identification, and secure online data storage. Despite a grant solicitation in 2009, DOJ decided not to award any grants and pursued a different system for investigation. Another solicitation in 2010 aimed to select a grantee for a national needs assessment and other tasks to support future efforts. The DOJ awarded funds to the West Virginia State Police to develop and implement the ICAC Deconfliction System (IDS) in December 2014. IDS allows law enforcement users to share and access data to resolve case conflicts related to crimes against children. It alerts users if information on a potential perpetrator is found in other databases and informs them of other agencies working on the case. The ICAC authorizing law mandates the creation and implementation of a National Strategy for Child Exploitation. The Attorney General is directed by law to create a National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, involving setting goals, coordinating with various agencies, and assessing the effectiveness of ICAC task forces. Reports on the strategy are to be submitted to Congress every other year. The ICAC Task Force program, threats to children, and federal agencies' efforts to combat child sexual exploitation are discussed in reports issued in August 2010 and April 2016. AMBER Alert systems are state-administered communication systems to alert the public about abducted children in grave danger, starting in 1996 after the abduction and murder of Amber Hagerman. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) was used to send out alerts about missing children, leading to the creation of regional alert programs in Texas and other states. Funding was provided in 2002 for AMBER Alert programs, with the PROTECT Act in 2003 establishing a national program and appointing a coordinator. The Act also authorized funding for communication plans and technologies to support states in issuing alerts. The DOJ AMBER Alert coordinator was appointed in 2003 to oversee the national initiative, create standards for alerts, submit reports to Congress, and collaborate with the FBI and FCC. The DOJ appointed an AMBER Alert coordinator in 2003 to oversee the national initiative, create standards for alerts, collaborate with the FBI and FCC, and make recommendations on criteria and technologies. Guidelines were issued for issuing an alert based on recommendations, including criteria such as law enforcement's reasonable belief of an abduction, imminent danger to the child, descriptive information availability, victim's age, and data entry into NCIC. A new AMBER Alert \"flag\" was created in the NCIC for abducted children. DOJ submitted a report to Congress in 2005 outlining the national AMBER Alert plan and alert criteria. The DOJ implemented a national AMBER Alert plan with criteria for issuing alerts. P.L. 108-21 authorized funding for states to develop and enhance AMBER Alert communication programs and technologies. DOJ grants were provided to states for communication plans, while DOT grants focused on highway communication systems. The federal government aimed for geographically equitable distribution of grants. The federal government provides funding for enhancing AMBER Alert communication plans, with DOJ focusing on training and technical assistance for law enforcement and state officials. OJJDP issues competitive solicitations for technical assistance every five years, awarding funding to Fox Valley Technical College in Wisconsin. P.L. 108-21 authorized $20 million for DOT to fund states in developing highway communication systems for alerts and information. The Missing and Exploited Children (MEC) program provides funding for enhancing communication systems along highways to assist in the recovery of abducted children. States can receive up to $400,000 each for implementing communication programs using changeable message signs. As of FY2017, 40 states and the District of Columbia had received funding, with approximately $3.1 million still available. The program also supports training and technical assistance for public and private nonprofit organizations through a contract with Fox Valley Technical College in Wisconsin. The program partners with Fox Valley Technical College in Wisconsin to provide technical assistance for strengthening responses in child victimization cases through various formats. It also supports program administration, printing publications for Missing Children's Day, and grants like the DOJ mentoring grant in FY2017 focusing on mentoring for child victims of exploitation and trafficking."
