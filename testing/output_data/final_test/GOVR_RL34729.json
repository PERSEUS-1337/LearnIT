    "content": "Human rights conditions in China are a key issue in U.S.-China relations. Some believe U.S. engagement has not led to political reform, while others argue it has helped with economic and social changes. Violations of civil liberties and political persecution have increased, with China's leadership remaining authoritarian. Economic development, largely reliant on trade with the U.S., has strengthened. The Communist government in China has been strengthened by economic development through trade with the United States, rather than empowering the people. Despite some analysts and Chinese citizens noting increased economic and social freedoms, government control over people's lives has decreased, allowing for more opportunities to voice opinions on policies. Disagreements on progress often arise from differing emphasis on indicators like central government policies, local actions, civil society, and short-term versus long-term trends. Simultaneously, there have been growing government restrictions on political, religious, and other freedoms, alongside increased civil rights activism. The 2011 crackdown in China was driven by government nervousness about social unrest, rights activism, and the upcoming leadership change. Analysts also point to decreased US leverage on Chinese human rights policies. The impact on social stability, civil society, and political reform remains uncertain. Some experts see it as a major setback for liberalization, while others believe the government will limit repression to avoid a popular backlash. The PRC government seeks to limit repressive actions to key activists and dissidents to avoid backlash. Human rights abuses persist, especially towards political dissent, freedom of speech, and challenges to government authority. Some improvements in rights activism have been seen through government policies and civil society development. Laws have been enacted to address violations of human rights and abuses of power. The Chinese government has taken steps to prevent human rights violations and abuses of power, while social groups engage in protests to defend their rights. The Internet has provided citizens with information and the ability to express opinions publicly, despite government censorship. Independent online news has helped hold government officials accountable. The growth of protest activity in China includes a wide range of social groups, from marginalized farmers and workers to the urban middle class and professionals. The U.S. government has implemented tactics to promote democracy in China, but their impact has been limited. The U.S. government's policies on promoting democracy in China have had limited impact due to the country's authoritarian regime led by the Chinese Communist Party. Despite some calls for political reforms by liberal leaders like Premier Wen Jiabao, the CCP remains firmly in power and shows no intention of relinquishing control. Under the leadership of CCP General Secretary and President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, the PRC government has developed along the lines of maintaining state security, social stability, economic development, and providing for economic and social rights. The government does not fully respect civil liberties despite constitutional protections, and criticizes foreign interference in its human rights policies. The PRC government, under the leadership of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, has developed \"responsive authoritarianism\" by becoming more accountable and law-based. While sensitive to popular views, it rejects political reforms challenging its power monopoly and responds forcefully to social instability. Progress has been made in enacting laws to curb human rights abuses, but institutions to enforce these laws are lacking. Many activists seeking to protect rights face challenges. Lawyers, activists, and journalists in China face harassment and imprisonment for protecting rights or exposing violations. PRC leaders have allowed some protests but also arrested protest leaders. There is disagreement on the best policy approaches for human rights in China, with differing U.S. goals including promoting political change and supporting incremental progress. Policy tools range from private discussions to sanctions and open criticism. Since the late 1980s, U.S. administrations have used various strategies to promote human rights in China, including diplomatic engagement, economic ties, and advocating for democracy without directly challenging Communist Party rule. This approach has been referred to as \"peaceful evolution\" or \"constructive engagement.\" President Bill Clinton emphasized the importance of fostering diplomatic and economic relations while pushing for open markets and democracy as a way to advance both U.S. interests and values, as well as China's. President George W. Bush and President Obama saw U.S. engagement with China as crucial for promoting U.S. interests and freedom. Both administrations aimed for bilateral cooperation while disagreeing on human rights issues. President Obama emphasized the importance of freedoms like speech and religion, suggesting that respecting human rights in China would benefit global stability. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the Administration's human rights policy in December 2009. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the Administration's human rights policy as \"principled pragmatism,\" focusing on quiet diplomacy for change in China. Critics have noted Obama's reduced emphasis on human rights in favor of economic and security issues. Some argue that cooperation with China in other areas could lead to better opportunities for promoting human rights. Concerns were raised over actions like postponing a meeting with the Dalai Lama and downplaying human rights issues. The Obama Administration has faced criticism for its human rights policy towards China, with some policymakers arguing for more concessions from the Chinese government. Despite this, the Administration has pushed China on human rights issues, including President Obama mentioning human rights and Internet freedom during a visit to China in 2009. Secretary Clinton has also spoken out against China's Internet censorship and hacking of U.S. companies in 2010. In 2010-2011, the US criticized China for internet censorship, hacking of US companies, and human rights violations. President Obama supported human rights in Tibet and dialogue with the Dalai Lama. The US Congress has implemented sanctions and resolutions to uphold human rights in China and Tibet. Members of Congress have introduced resolutions addressing human rights abuses in China, including imprisonment of political, religious, and minority figures, persecution of Tibetans, Uighurs, and Falun Gong adherents, censorship of the Internet, coercive abortions, and deportation of North Korean refugees. Various congressional bodies have investigated and reported on human rights conditions in China, while appropriations measures have funded democracy, human rights, and rule of law programs in China and Tibet, as well as Internet freedom efforts. In 2011, the Chinese government intensified efforts to suppress civil society, targeting rights defenders, activist lawyers, bloggers, NGOs, independent churches, and ethnic minority groups. Security forces detained, arrested, or surveilled around 250 people for political reasons, with 20 facing prosecution for subversion. The crackdown was considered unprecedented under the current PRC leadership, with notable events including police presence to prevent anti-government demonstrations and the arrest of a prominent figure in April 2011. In 2011, the Chinese government intensified efforts to suppress civil society, targeting rights defenders, activist lawyers, bloggers, NGOs, independent churches, and ethnic minority groups. Security forces detained, arrested, or surveilled around 250 people for political reasons, with 20 facing prosecution for subversion. The recent spate of arrests appeared to be part of a broader and longer-term policy of adapting to and regulating a fast-changing and increasingly dynamic society while selectively applying tactics of intimidation and coercion against individuals and groups challenging its authority. The Chinese government has intensified efforts to suppress civil society in 2011, targeting rights defenders, activist lawyers, bloggers, NGOs, independent churches, and ethnic minority groups. Around 250 people were detained, arrested, or surveilled for political reasons, with 20 facing prosecution for subversion. The government has increased security measures and control methods, including coercive tactics and threats against family members, to silence critics and subdue social forces. This crackdown is attributed to political unrest in the Middle East and the CCP's fear of large-scale protests at home. China's government faces popular grievances and increasing social unrest, with around 90,000-100,000 \"mass protests\" reported annually. In 2010, there were 72 \"major\" incidents of social unrest, a 20% increase from the previous year. Awareness of legal and human rights is growing among Chinese citizens, leading to concerns for the government's ability to respond to democratic forces in society. In February 2011, an online appeal by Chinese activists called for peaceful \"protest walks\" in major cities to advocate for greater democracy. Government authorities responded by detaining activists, charging dissidents with subversion, and threatening foreign reporters. In October 2010, Liu Xiaobo, a former professor and political dissident, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for human rights. He had been imprisoned for his involvement in the 1989 democracy movement and for questioning Communist Party rule. Liu also played a key role in drafting \"Charter '08,\" calling for human rights and reforms in China. In December 2009, Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Beijing court for \"inciting subversion of state power.\" Following his Nobel Peace Prize win, the Chinese government harassed, detained, and restricted the movements of dissidents, activists, and Liu's family members. They also blocked western media and lobbied foreign governments against attending the award ceremony. In 2010, the Chinese government lobbied against diplomats attending the Nobel ceremony. Labor disputes surged in China, with strikes at foreign-owned factories in Guangdong province. Wage pressures, demographic changes, and rising expectations among workers fueled the unrest. In 2010, strikes at Foxconn factories in China followed the suicides of 11 employees, attributed to stressful working conditions. Labor protesters sought higher wages, better working conditions, and the right to elect union representatives. Some experts supported higher wages and collective bargaining. In 2010, labor strikes in China resulted in positive outcomes for workers, including pay raises. Workers used social networking tools and some strikes had direct negotiations with management. However, the activism did not lead to a national labor movement as workers' goals were narrow and focused on wages and working conditions. Some strikes exploited nationalistic sentiments, reducing conflict with the government. China's leaders remain wary of a national labor movement and do not allow independent unions or democratic elections. The labor movement in China faces restrictions on forming independent unions and holding democratic elections for ACFTU representatives. Human rights conditions in China have been reported as worsening, with no significant improvements for persecuted groups like Tibetans, Uighur Muslims, Christians, Falun Gong practitioners, political dissidents, and human rights defenders. The 2010 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Liu Xiaobo, a jailed dissident, was criticized by the Chinese government as a western political maneuver. The Chinese government faces criticism for human rights violations, including excessive use of violence, unlawful detention, torture, and coercion in family planning policies. The official press has become more critical of some abuses, but major violations persist. The ongoing human rights abuses in China include harassment, beatings, house arrest, unlawful detentions, unlawful killings in state custody, physical abuse, torture, and arbitrary use of state security laws against political dissidents and others. Government efforts to reduce human rights abuses in China have been met with arbitrary use of state security laws against political dissidents, Tibetans, Uighur Muslims, Internet bloggers, and others. There are reports of coercive abortions, forced sterilizations, and other unlawful actions against women. Strict controls and punishments are imposed on public speech regarding sensitive topics like Tiananmen events, Taiwan relations, Tibet, Falun Gong, and the Chinese Communist Party. Christians worshipping in unofficial churches face harassment and arrests. Tibetans and Uighur Muslims suspected of anti-government activities are detained. Falun Gong adherents are persecuted. North Korean nationals in China are repatriated, violating the U.N. Refugee Convention. The Dui Hua Foundation estimates that around 25,000 individuals in China, including political and religious prisoners, are held in prisons and reeducation centers for various reasons such as involvement with \"cults\" like Falun Gong or state security crimes. Many petitioners from rural areas seeking redress for government abuses are reportedly sent to secret detention centers or \"black jails\" without legal protections. In Beijing, thousands of people are reportedly detained illegally in secret detention centers or \"black jails\" each year. Various individuals, including petitioners, activists, dissidents, and Falun Gong practitioners, have also been held in psychiatric hospitals for the criminally insane, where they face rights abuses. Over 100 Chinese lawyers have urged the government to stop detaining sane individuals in mental health facilities. Reeducation through labor (RTL) allows police to sentence people for minor offenses like theft, prostitution, and disrupting social order. Reeducation through labor (RTL) in China allows for individuals to be sentenced for minor offenses such as theft, prostitution, and disrupting social order, leading to imprisonment in labor camps without trial. Approximately 300 RTL centers hold around 250,000 people, with 2% to 10% of the population being held for political reasons. There have been discussions about reforming the RTL system to reduce its use, shorten terms, improve conditions, provide better legal protections, and enhance judicial oversight. In 2010, Chinese legal scholars debated reforming the RTL system. Xue Feng, a U.S. citizen, was sentenced to 8 years in prison for providing state secrets. Another U.S. citizen, David Wei Dong, was sentenced to 13 years for espionage. In 2010, Dong's sentence was reduced by 18 months. The Chinese government has enacted laws to address human rights abuses, including protections for criminal defendants, torture, labor conditions, and government transparency. In 2009, procuratorial organs found 22,268 unlawful actions related to people in detention. In 2010, the Chinese government enacted laws to address human rights abuses, including prohibitions on torture and requirements for video-recorded interrogations of criminal suspects. Despite regulations to reduce physical abuses of detainees, reports of torture persist, and compensation for wrongful detention and abuse remains rare. Regulations banning the trade of human organs went into effect in 2006 and 2007, stipulating that organ donation for transplant must be voluntary. The Chinese government enacted laws in 2010 to address human rights abuses, including prohibitions on torture and requirements for video-recorded interrogations. Restrictions were also placed on the trade of human organs, stipulating that organ donation for transplant must be voluntary. Additionally, amendments were made to the State Secrets Law to reduce arbitrary use and the Death Penalty was addressed with the Supreme People's Court granted sole power to review and ratify all death sentences. In 2010, the National People's Congress amended the Criminal Law to reduce crimes punishable by death from 68 to 55. The Supreme People's Court instructed lower courts to suspend death sentences for two years for cases not requiring immediate execution. In March 2007, China passed the Labor Contract Law to enforce workers' rights, leading to a rise in labor disputes. The National People's Congress also passed a constitutional amendment in 2007 to protect property rights. The new property law in China, passed in 2007, protects private entrepreneurs, urban home owners, and farmers from government seizure of their lands. Government transparency measures were also introduced in 2007 to increase disclosure of official information and promote accountability. The government has been seeking public input on policy issues through various channels like expert consultations and public hearings. The Chinese government has been seeking public input on policy issues through various channels like expert consultations and public hearings. In April 2009, the PRC State Council released a two-year \"action plan\" to increase government commitment to human rights, including farmers' rights over land use, due process, freedom from torture, and expanded citizen participation and consultation. Many human rights activists criticized the plan for its limited scope and emphasis on economic and social rights over political and civil rights. In July 2011, the Chinese government announced a four-year human rights plan focusing on economic and social grievances. Non-state actors are playing a growing role in policy-making and social activities, with civil society activists facing risks to promote human rights. Lawyers, journalists, and activists are working to protect human rights despite severe restrictions. The Chinese government has acknowledged the role of civil society organizations in promoting human rights, but also has concerns about their autonomy and foreign connections. There are over 430,000 registered social organizations in China, with potentially millions more that are not officially registered. These groups face challenges related to legality, financing, and political survival. Environmental groups and other civil society organizations in China operate in various sectors such as legal aid, public health, education, poverty alleviation, and rural development. Beijing has tightened restrictions on social organizations, expressing concerns about foreign funding and NGOs potentially causing political unrest. The government monitors foreign NGOs and their Chinese partners, fearing their influence on China's civil society. In 2010, the Chinese government increased pressure on civil society groups to prevent a potential \"color revolution\" fueled by foreign democracy assistance and international NGOs. Restrictions on social organizations include prohibiting branches and public fundraising, with many relying on foreign grants. New regulations make it challenging for non-officially registered groups to accept foreign donations. The Chinese government has imposed restrictions on social organizations to prevent activities against social morality and public interests. In Shenzhen, reforms have been implemented to ease legal restrictions on civil society organizations, allowing them to register without direct government supervision, solicit funding domestically and internationally, and hire foreigners. However, some labor groups in Shenzhen have reported being denied registration rights. China's legal system has improved significantly since the Cultural Revolution. Legal reforms in China have progressed since the Cultural Revolution, leading to increased legal awareness and activity among citizens. Despite the state's continued disproportionate power, there is a growing expectation for the government to respect basic legal rights. The development of the legal system has compelled the government to address some claims of legal rights violations. The legal activity in China is growing, with citizens increasingly turning to courts to sue public officials. Over 150,000 cases are filed annually against the government, with a trend of modest growth in cases and a significant increase in appeals. The legal profession has rapidly expanded, with around 190,000 lawyers in the country. This changing legal environment has created opportunities for human rights attorneys, despite personal risks involved. In China, human rights attorneys face personal risks when taking on sensitive cases against the government or economic entities. Many lawyers have faced troubles such as closure of law offices, disbarment, detention, house arrest, and prison sentences. The PRC government has increased harassment of lawyers working on human rights or politically sensitive cases, with licenses suspended and legal reforms implemented. In 2008, legal reforms in China allowed defense lawyers more freedom to meet with clients, access case files, and present in court without fear of prosecution. Despite these improvements, defense lawyers still face challenges in accessing detained clients, reviewing case files, and collecting evidence. Despite some legal reforms in China allowing defense lawyers more freedom, the legal and judicial systems in China remain flawed. Lawyers can be detained, arrested, and prosecuted for perjury under Article 306 of China's Criminal Law. The Communist Party does not support an independent judiciary, and there are no protections like presumption of innocence or double jeopardy. Police, prosecutors, and judges often ignore legal safeguards. In China, legal and judicial systems are flawed as police, prosecutors, and judges often disregard legal safeguards. In criminal cases, sentences are determined by a Party-named court committee, leading to a high conviction rate of over 99% for defendants without legal counsel. Despite the large number of Internet users in China, the government manages to control politically sensitive information online. The Chinese government employs various methods to control online content and expression, including website blocking, keyword filtering, and regulating Internet service providers. They also arrest cyber dissidents and block access to certain websites and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The Chinese government uses various tactics to control online content, including hiring students to promote pro-government views and shutting down blogs of prominent figures. Reporters Without Borders reported that many journalists and cyber dissidents are imprisoned in China. Despite government censorship, some Chinese internet users bypass filters using proxy servers or virtual private networks. The Chinese government uses tactics to control online content, including imprisoning journalists and cyber dissidents. Despite censorship, Chinese internet users bypass filters using proxy servers or virtual private networks. This allows access to Twitter and other platforms for information dissemination. Social media outlets provide a platform for public discourse and sharing of information, even though the government periodically blocks access to blogs and micro-blogging sites. The blogosphere and social media platforms in China have played a significant role in spreading critical opinions and diverse perspectives, including discussions on ecological damage caused by the Three Gorges Dam. Internet and cellular technologies have empowered activists and citizens to organize protests, expose human rights abuses, and share protest strategies both domestically and internationally. The Chinese government has acknowledged the Internet's role in supervision and has seen a rise in \"Internet protests\" leading to punishment of officials. Government departments have set up informant websites to report corruption, and official news outlets are quicker to respond to independent news spread online. The government is nervous about the Internet's influence on society and politics. The Chinese government has increased surveillance on Internet users, requiring real names and identification numbers for online activities. This has had a chilling effect on political content and discourse, with Internet cafes also being monitored for online activity. The Chinese government has increased surveillance on Internet users, requiring real names and identification numbers for online activities. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has pressured Internet service providers to monitor online content and activities, including the transfer of state secrets. The State Internet Information Office was established in 2011 to coordinate Internet oversight. Despite expectations, political use of the Internet is limited, with only a small minority accessing proxy servers to bypass government firewalls. The Chinese government has increased surveillance on Internet users, requiring real names and identification numbers for online activities. The State Internet Information Office was established in 2011 to coordinate Internet oversight. Despite limited Internet freedom in China, a small community of dissidents and political activists use the Internet to advocate for political causes such as prisoner advocacy, political reform, ethnic discrimination, corruption, and foreign policy concerns. Google, the second-most popular search engine in China, played a significant role in the country's online landscape. Google, the second-most popular search engine in China after Baidu, faced cyber attacks from Chinese hackers. In response, Google announced it would no longer censor search results on Google.cn, leading to tensions with the Chinese government. Despite this, China renewed Google's license in 2010 after the company linked to its uncensored Hong Kong search engine. Google's share of China's search-engine market fell to 19.6% in the fourth quarter of 2010 from 30% a year earlier, while Baidu's market share rose to 75.5%. In June 2011, Google claimed Chinese hackers attempted to access Gmail accounts, including those of U.S. government officials. The PRC government denied involvement in the hacking incidents. The PRC government exercises less control over news and information than a decade ago, with a growing range of permissible public discourse. State control of the media has shifted from omnipresence to selective enforcement. The press has become more open about issues like food safety and official corruption, with the Internet playing a significant role in maintaining the flow of information. The press in China has become more open about issues like food safety and social unrest, navigating a delicate balance between public demands for information and government restrictions. A burgeoning private media industry has pushed the limits of social, cultural, and political content, forcing traditional state media to provide more provocative content to stay competitive. The chief editor of a major official publication in China faces pressure from both the market and Communist Party bosses, with the market having a growing influence. Reporting that is too provocative may lead to government sanctions and loss of advertising revenue. The state continues to control social and political narratives, intimidating journalists and authors through various means. China's leaders emphasize the duty of reporters to serve the state, with journalists required to have knowledge of Communist Party journalism and Marxist views of news. In March 2010, the top editor of the independent Economic Observer was dismissed for criticizing China's household registration system. Growing numbers of Internet users are challenging information controls online. Journalists are increasingly advocating for their right to report on corporate scandals and local corruption. In October 2010, Party elders called for an end to speech and press restrictions in China. Religious freedom varies by region, with millions openly practicing Buddhism, Protestantism, Catholicism, Daoism, and Islam. The government disapproves of unincorporated religious groups, leading to potential shutdowns by authorities. The PRC government imposes strict measures on unofficial religious groups in China, including Christians, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners. Despite restrictions, Christian worship has grown, with millions practicing in state-sanctioned churches and unregistered Protestant congregations. Unofficial \"house churches\" lack legal protections and are vulnerable to human rights abuses by local officials. Many unofficial congregations in China face harassment and human rights abuses by government authorities, with leaders being detained, imprisoned, and properties destroyed. Issues with house churches stem from registration requirements and distrust with the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Some Chinese Protestants reject the official church for political or theological reasons, while house churches struggle to obtain official status due to rejections by local religious affairs bureaus. Foreign missionaries have been accused of discouraging unofficial congregations. In China, government officials claim foreign missionaries discourage unofficial churches from registering. Catholics are divided between those who follow the Pope and the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association. Beijing and the Vatican disagree on appointing bishops. Persecution of Christians has worsened, with arrests increasing by 43% from 2009 to 2010. Over 500 members of unofficial churches were detained, and efforts to prevent unsanctioned congregations from worshipping have intensified. In China, the government has intensified efforts to prevent unsanctioned congregations from worshipping, with at least 40 unregistered Chinese bishops facing surveillance, detention, or disappearance. The 1,000-member Shouwang Protestant church was evicted from its premises in 2011, with church leaders under house arrest and members detained for gathering. Tibetans also resent political controls, loss of culture, and economic domination by Han Chinese. The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) faces limitations on international contacts and adverse environmental effects from Beijing's development projects. Han Chinese, a minority in TAR, believe in positive economic and social development brought by the PRC government. In 2008, Tibetan monks peacefully demonstrated for the release of prisoners, sparking protests for independence or greater autonomy, leading to violent clashes in Lhasa. In 2008, Tibetan protesters clashed with PRC police, leading to riots in Tibet and neighboring provinces. The government blamed the Dalai Lama for instigating the violence, but he denied involvement. Around 100 to 218 people were killed in the unrest, with many Tibetans sentenced to prison terms. In 2010, there were reportedly 824 Tibetan prisoners of conscience. China's government has intensified \"patriotic education\" in Tibetan monasteries and nunneries, while also focusing on economic development and social services in Tibet. However, there is little flexibility on autonomy and religious freedom issues. Dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama's envoys has not made significant progress on greater autonomy for Tibet. In April 2011, PRC security forces continued to clamp down on the Kirti Tibetan monastery in Sichuan province after unrest earlier in the year. Tibetan exiles in India elected Lobsang Sangay as their new prime minister, who will take on some political duties of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama's representatives will continue to represent Tibetan exiles in dialogue with Beijing. The Chinese government refuses to talk to the new prime minister, considering them an illegal organization. Muslim communities in certain regions of China coexist peacefully with non-Muslims, but Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region faces social and political tensions due to harsh religious policies. Uighurs in Urumqi face restrictions on religious practices, including limitations on imams, Ramadan celebrations, and hajj participation. Children are banned from mosques, and government workers cannot openly practice Islam. Other grievances include loss of ethnic identity, economic discrimination, and lack of democracy. The demolition of Kashgar's old city has sparked anger among Uighurs, who feel the policy aims to control the local population. Han Chinese support PRC policies, believing they benefit Uighurs and prevent terrorism. The Chinese government fears Uighur demands for religious freedom and their links to foreign Islamic organizations. They claim the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is responsible for terrorist attacks in China and has ties to Al Qaeda. Due to security concerns, the government restricts Uighurs' religious and cultural practices in Xinjiang. Several hundred to a few thousand Uighur demonstrators gathered in Urumqi to demand justice for the deaths of two Uighur men in a brawl with Han factory workers. Paramilitary police attacked the demonstrators, leading to riots and violence against government property and Han residents. The Chinese government blamed Uighur separatists and exile groups for the unrest, resulting in nearly 200 deaths and 1,700 injuries. 26 people were sentenced to death for their involvement in the violence. Following the July 2009 unrest in Xinjiang, the government imposed strict restrictions on speech, assembly, and internet access in Uighur areas. Over 1,000 people, including Uighur journalists and webmasters, were arrested on state security charges. Efforts to address social instability focused on economic development and cultural preservation, rather than religious and political freedoms. Additionally, 26 people were sentenced to death and nine received suspended death sentences, with most being Uighur individuals. Falun Gong, a spiritual practice combining exercise, meditation, and moral values, gained millions of followers in China in the late 1990s. After a government crackdown in 1999, the group, labeled as a dangerous cult, ceased practicing openly. Despite this, the government continued to persecute Falun Gong, intensifying its efforts over the years. The government intensified persecution of Falun Gong during the 2008 Olympics and 2009 Shanghai World Expo, with practitioners facing reeducation camps, torture, and abuse. A three-year campaign was launched to \"transform\" adherents, leading to arrests of rights lawyers defending them. Falun Gong adherents in China have faced persecution, with thousands imprisoned and hundreds to thousands reportedly dying in state custody. The deaths have been concentrated in seven provinces, and the group claims nearly 3,500 documented cases between 1999 and 2011. The rising rights consciousness of PRC citizens is evident in daily social unrest in China, driven by widening income disparities and the government's inability to address grievances adequately. The government uses a mix of sympathy and repression towards disgruntled groups, while the growing awareness of human rights among Chinese citizens, along with support from activists, suggests continued pressure for rights advancement. Major types of social unrest in the past decade include protests by state-owned enterprise workers against layoffs and migrant laborers. Social unrest in China includes demonstrations by state-owned enterprise workers against layoffs, protests by migrant laborers over lack of pay, objections from farmers regarding unfair taxation and land confiscation for development projects, and opposition from homeowners facing forcible evictions. Anger is often directed at collusive deals between officials and private investors, lack of fair compensation, and new sources of unrest such as factory closures, inflation, and enforcement of the one-child policy. High unemployment among college graduates is also a potential source of unrest. The unemployment rate among recent college graduates in China is estimated to be around 26%. Resentment towards government restrictions in Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as anger against the economic dominance of Han Chinese, remain deep-seated issues. Social protests have not evolved into broad-based political movements, with citizens generally demonstrating against local officials and enterprise managers. China's leaders have quashed attempts by protest groups to join forces. The urban middle class, while generally supportive of the status quo, has begun to show signs of discontent. The urban middle class in China has started engaging in targeted demonstrations, potentially significant due to their ability to organize and articulate interests. They have been hesitant to align with other social groups. The growth of the middle and entrepreneurial classes in developing economies is believed to create pressure for democracy, driven by desires to protect economic interests and participate in decision-making. The rising middle class in China values incremental political change over disruptive reform, prioritizing political stability to protect their economic gains. Surveys show they desire clean government but are conservative and reliant on the state for economic well-being. While critical of the state on economic issues, they are not inclined to push for democracy if their economic needs are met. The Chinese middle class, comprising 25% of the population, is critical of political corruption and crony capitalism affecting their economic opportunities. They support civil liberties but are less interested in multi-party elections, preferring existing channels to contact local officials. They want access to information, their voices heard, and opportunities for social action, while being defensive of China's achievements and resentful of international criticism. Many Chinese youth are liberal, career-oriented, and patriotic, critical of their government but defensive against Western criticism. The business sector in China remains heavily dependent on the state, with entrepreneurs seeking close relations with government agencies for survival. The Chinese Communist Party welcomes business persons into the Party, exerting influence over the private sector through controls in finance and property due to the weakness of China's legal system. The weakness of China's legal system forces business persons to rely on government officials to protect their assets and enforce contracts. Private entrepreneurs support strengthening the legal system and political reform, but also value social stability and are content with the slow pace of change. The US has implemented tactics to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in China, but their impact has been limited to the margins of the political system. The US has supported programs in China to strengthen the rule of law, civil society, and human rights. Some experts believe that diplomatic and economic engagement with China has not led to significant political change. There are calls for tangible improvements in China's human rights policies as a condition for full diplomatic and economic relations. Many U.S. experts and policymakers have differing opinions on promoting democracy and human rights in China. Approaches range from placing conditions on the bilateral relationship to inducing change through engagement. Sanctions and criticism of China's human rights policies have been debated for their effectiveness. The U.S. has implemented sanctions and open criticism of China's human rights policies, coordinating international pressure and supporting dissidents. Sanctions from the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 are still in effect, including restrictions on foreign aid. Congress also requires support for projects in Tibet that do not encourage migration or property transfer to non-Tibetans. Some analysts argue for more frequent, open, and forceful U.S. government stands against China's human rights abuses. Dissidents claim international pressure protected them from harsh treatment by PRC authorities. The Chinese government has made small concessions to avoid global criticism. Some analysts suggest that Beijing made small concessions to avoid criticism, such as restarting the U.S.-China human rights dialogue in 2008. Congressional actions have included resolutions, bills, and visits to address human rights violations in China. Some bills have aimed to restrict U.S.-China trade due to human rights abuses in China. In the 112th Congress, Representative Chris Smith introduced the China Democracy Promotion Act of 2011 to deny entry into the U.S. for certain Chinese government leaders and individuals involved in human rights abuses. Senator Robert Menendez also took action on human rights issues in China. Senator Robert Menendez introduced a resolution (S.Res. 232) calling for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China. Representative Kevin Brady has urged for the release of U.S. citizen Xue Feng, who is imprisoned in China. The People's Republic of China uses its soft power to reduce international pressure on its human rights policies. The United Nations Human Rights Council was established in 2006 to replace the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The United States sponsored resolutions at the UNCHR criticizing China's human rights record, but China blocked most resolutions through \"no-action motions.\" The Bush Administration opposed the Human Rights Council, citing lack of improvement over the UNCHR and focus on Israel. The Obama Administration joined the Council in 2009. The UPR mechanism was established for assessing human rights records of U.N. members every four years, with China reviewed in 2009. Some countries expressed concerns about China's human rights record during the review. The U.S.-China human rights dialogue was established in 1990, with talks suspended in 2004 and resumed in 2008. The Obama Administration participated in rounds in 2010 and 2011, co-chaired by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Michael Posner. In 2010 and 2011, U.S.-China human rights dialogue discussed Chinese political prisoners, freedom of religion, labor rights, and conditions in Tibet and Xinjiang. The talks were described as tough with discussions on China's backsliding on human rights. No concrete outcomes were reported. Despite no breakthroughs or concrete outcomes being reported in the latest rounds of the U.S.-China human rights dialogue, Administration officials view it as crucial to emphasize U.S. positions on human rights issues. The dialogue is seen as a positive step, with concerns raised about separating it from the Security and Economic Dialogue. Some experts believe that China uses the talks to deflect international criticism on human rights. The U.S. government has allocated significant funds for programs in China focused on human rights, democracy, rule of law, Tibetan communities, and the environment. These programs aim to promote the rule of law, civil society, democratic norms, judicial capacity building, criminal justice reform, sustainable livelihoods, and cultural preservation in Tibetan communities. The U.S. government funds programs in China promoting democracy, rule of law, civil society, and sustainable livelihoods in Tibetan communities. The National Endowment for Democracy supports Chinese pro-democracy organizations and the development of Tibetan communities. The U.S. government supports programs in China promoting democracy, rule of law, and labor rights. This includes funding for NED's China programs, monitoring PRC compliance with international labor standards, and providing assistance for worker rights protection. The U.S. government supports various activities in China related to rule of law development, labor rights, legal aid, labor dispute resolution, mine safety, occupational safety and health, and HIV/AIDS education. Exchanges and discussions have been conducted on wage and hour administration, unemployment insurance, pension security, labor market statistics, law enforcement, collective bargaining, and other issues between the U.S. and Chinese governments. Efforts have also been made to promote Internet freedom in countries like China and Iran through the Global Internet Freedom Task Force. The U.S. government allocated funds for global Internet freedom efforts, focusing on censorship circumvention technology, communications security, media training, and public policy. Efforts target countries like China and Iran, supporting counter-censorship technologies to access censored websites. The Global Internet Freedom Caucus was established to promote online freedom of information and expression. The Global Online Freedom Act of 2011 (H.R. 1389) was introduced to prevent US businesses from aiding repressive governments in censoring the internet. US public diplomacy programs expose Chinese elites to American politics, culture, and academia, promoting mutual understanding. The Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Asia (RFA) provide independent news to Chinese audiences, despite government censorship. Both media services aim to offer U.S.-style broadcasting and cover critical world events. The PRC government blocks their broadcasts and websites, but VOA English services face less interference. VOA and RFA are working on improving their Internet services and counter-censorship technologies. The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) estimates that a small percentage of China's population listens to or views VOA radio, television, and Internet programs, with VOA's \"Special English\" news programs being popular among young, educated, and professional Chinese. RFA has a politically oriented audience estimated to be one-third to one-half of VOA's, while Phoenix (Hong Kong) satellite television has the highest public awareness in China. RFA is seen as a vital news source in dissident and ethnic minority communities."
