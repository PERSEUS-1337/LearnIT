The \"National Sex Offender Registry Act of 2004\" defines terms such as criminal offense against a minor, minimally sufficient sexual offender registration program, and sexually violent offense. The Violent Offender Registration Act defines a \"sexually violent predator\" as per the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act. SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF DATABASE. The Attorney General will establish a National sex offender registry that publicly discloses information submitted by States and allows users to find registered sex offenders near a specified location. If convicted of certain offenses, individuals must register with a State sexual offender program. Under the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, States must submit detailed information about registered sex offenders to the Attorney General, including names, aliases, date of birth, current address, physical description, offense details, and release dates. States without their own registration programs must comply with federal requirements. The Federal Bureau of Investigation collects information from individuals required to register under the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act and submits it to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National sex offender registry. SEC. 4. RELEASE OF HIGH RISK INMATES. (a) Civil Commitment Proceedings: States with civil commitment proceedings must notify the attorney general before releasing sexually violent predators or high-risk individuals. The attorney general will then decide whether to initiate a civil commitment proceeding. \n\n(b) Monitoring of Released Persons: Each State is required to intensively monitor released individuals. Each State must closely monitor individuals released from incarceration for at least 1 year if they are sexually violent predators or deemed high-risk for reoffending. This monitoring does not apply to those civilly committed. States have 3 years to comply with sections 3 and 4 of the Act. Failure to comply will result in a 25 percent reduction in allocated funds, which will be reallocated to compliant states."
