The Congress finds that poaching of African elephants and rhinoceros has increased dramatically since 2006, driven by demand for ivory and rhinoceros horn in Asia. This has led to rising prices, attracting organized criminal elements into the illegal trade. Transnational crime rings involved in trafficking drugs, guns, and humans are also responsible for trafficking poached ivory and rhinoceros horn from Africa to Asia. The poaching crisis of African elephants and rhinoceros has worsened due to demand for ivory and horn in Asia. Terrorist groups are funding their activities through illegal ivory sales. Conservation efforts are failing as poachers use sophisticated tactics. Some countries are unable to stop the illegal trade. Strategies to reduce demand through education are needed. The purpose of this Act is to address the demand for African elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn by requiring other countries to end the illegal trade as a condition for access to US markets. Efforts to conserve these populations through education and other means are important but not enough. The African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to define illegal trade as any sale, purchase, barter, transit, or exchange of ivory that violates laws of ivory-producing countries or international wildlife trade agreements. Additionally, amendments are made to address the demand for African elephant ivory and rhinoceros horn by requiring countries to end illegal trade to access US markets. SEC. 102 of the African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to address the global crisis of poaching and trafficking of wildlife, particularly African elephant ivory. Immediate action is deemed necessary to eliminate the demand for ivory and the profit incentive for poachers and traffickers. SEC. 103 of the African Elephant Conservation Act is amended to prevent additional African elephant ivory from entering global commerce and reduce demand for ivory driving elephant poaching by limiting trade with countries engaged in illegal ivory trade. SEC. 104 amends the African Elephant Conservation Act to issue certifications under the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 for countries identified as significant sources of illegal ivory trade. SEC. 105 adds consultation and sanction provisions to the Act. The President, through the Secretary of the Interior, must consult with countries to reduce illegal ivory trade within 30 days of certification. If consultations are not successful within 90 days or a country refuses, the importation of wildlife products from that country to the US will be prohibited. The Secretary will prohibit the importation of wildlife products from a country if consultations to reduce illegal ivory trade are unsuccessful within 90 days. The prohibition will remain until an agreement is reached or the country is no longer a significant source of illegal ivory trade. Public notice of the prohibition will be given 30 days in advance, and the effectiveness of the sanctions will be reported to Congress within 180 days. The African Elephant Conservation Act prohibits illegal ivory trade in countries identified by CITES. The President will consult to address the issue, and sanctions will be imposed if necessary. The African Elephant Conservation Act requires consultations with countries involved in illegal ivory trade within 30 days of the Act's enactment. AMENDMENTS TO THE RHINOCEROS AND TIGER CONSERVATION ACT: Section 2 of the Act is amended to address the global crisis of poaching and trafficking of wildlife, particularly rhinoceros horn, which funds criminal syndicates and terrorist organizations. Immediate action is needed to eliminate the demand for rhinoceros horn and the profit incentive for poachers and traffickers. SEC. 202 of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act is amended to address illegal trafficking of rhinoceros horn by requiring other countries to end the trade as a condition for access to US markets. SEC. 203 defines illegal trade. SEC. 203 of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act defines illegal trade as any sale, purchase, barter, transit, or exchange of rhinoceros horn taken in violation of laws or international agreements. The CITES Standing Committee may identify countries of primary concern for illegal rhinoceros horn trade, leading to certification by the Secretary under the Fishermen's Protective Act. The President will then seek consultations with the country to reduce and terminate illegal trade. Additionally, there is a prohibition on trade in related natural resources. The President may direct the Secretary to prohibit the importation of wildlife, fish, and plants from a country if consultations are not successful within 90 days or if the country refuses to engage in consultations. This prohibition will remain until an agreement is reached or until the country is no longer a significant source of illegal rhinoceros horn trade. The Secretary must publicly announce any such prohibition. The Secretary must notify of any prohibition under this subsection at least 30 days before it takes effect. Within 180 days of the prohibition, the Secretary must assess if it has effectively reduced illegal rhinoceros horn trade in the country and if the country has retaliated against the US. This prohibition applies to countries identified before the enactment of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The President, through the Secretary of the Interior, must consult with countries identified as primary concerns for illegal rhinoceros horn trade within 30 days of the Act's enactment."
