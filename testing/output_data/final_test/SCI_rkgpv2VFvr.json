    "content": "We study the benefits of sharing representations among tasks in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning to improve feature extraction and generalization. Theoretical guarantees highlight conditions for sharing representations, extending finite-time bounds of Approximate Value-Iteration. Empirical evaluation of multi-task extensions of three Reinforcement Learning algorithms shows significant improvements over single-task counterparts. Multi-Task Learning aims to jointly learn multiple tasks, leveraging common properties to improve sample efficiency and performance. Features extracted in neural networks trained on multiple tasks provide a general representation, enhancing learning for each task. This shared representation can also be used for Transfer Learning, improving the effectiveness of learning new similar tasks. Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) allows a single agent to be trained on multiple Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems with common structures, leading to more effective learning. Deep Learning (DL) models, such as deep neural networks, are popular for extracting features in MTRL to handle complex experimental benchmarks. Deep Learning models are used in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) to extract common features among tasks. Challenges arise when unrelated tasks are combined or when training is not balanced among tasks. Recent developments in MTRL address these issues by using algorithms specifically designed for feature extraction. Some approaches use a single deep neural network for the multi-task agent, while others employ multiple deep neural networks, one for each task. In MTRL, the use of shared representations among tasks is studied to improve results with a single deep neural network. The method is theoretically motivated, showing that the cost of learning the shared representation decreases with a factor O(1/\u221aT), where T is the number of tasks. The main contribution of this work is twofold. It extends the approximation error bounds in Maurer et al. (2016) to multiple tasks with different dimensionalities and proposes the first extension of AVI/API to MTRL. A neural network architecture is proposed to learn multiple tasks with a single regressor, extracting a common representation, with theoretical justification on error propagation benefits. The study extends error bounds to multiple tasks with different dimensionalities and introduces a neural network architecture for learning tasks with a single regressor. Empirical evaluation on multitask variants of DQN and DDPG algorithms shows significant performance improvements in various RL problems.

Empirical evaluation on multitask variants of DQN and DDPG algorithms shows significant performance improvements in various RL problems compared to the singletask version of the algorithms. The optimal policy in the MDPs maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward. The complexity of representation is crucial in the MTRL problem, measured by Gaussian complexity. The theoretical study focuses on deriving guarantees for MTRL in the AVI framework, building on previous work by Farahmand (2011). The bounds for the approximation error term in the AVI bound are extended from Maurer (2006) to MTRL, highlighting the benefits of sharing representation. This is the first general result in this area. The first general result for MTRL is presented, focusing on the problem of minimizing task-averaged risk using a 1-Lipschitz loss function. The minimizers are defined as \u0175, h, and f, with the expected loss over tasks leading to the task-averaged risk \u03b5 * avg. The results can be scaled to the general case by using a generic loss function and appropriate scaling. The AVI framework provides bounds for single-task and multi-task scenarios. In the multi-task scenario, the average approximation error across tasks is computed. The AVI bound is extended to the multi-task scenario by computing the average loss across tasks. Theorem 2 retains most properties of the previous theorem, with the regression error included in the bound. The properties of Theorem 3.4 of Farahmand (2011) are extended to include task-averaged regression error in the bound. The second term in Equation (8) depends on the average maximum reward for each task. An overly pessimistic bound on \u03b3 and concentrability coefficients is used to obtain this result, which is not too loose if MDPs are similar. The task-averaged approximation error \u03b5 avg at each AVI iteration k is bounded following a derivation similar to Maurer et al. (2016). The Gaussian complexity for function classes can be bounded by O( \u221a nT ). The cost of learning meta-state space and task-specific mappings is O( 1 / \u221a n), while the cost of learning multi-task representation vanishes in the multi-task limit. The minimum average approximation error at each AVI iteration needs to be bounded. The bound for MTRL is derived by composing the results in Theorems 2 and 3, and Lemma 4, highlighting the advantage of learning a shared representation. The cost of learning the shared representation at each AVI iteration is mitigated by using multiple tasks, especially beneficial for complex feature representations like deep neural networks. The benefit of MTRL is evident in the cost of learning h, which decreases with an increase in tasks. The cost of learning a shared representation in MTRL decreases with an increase in tasks, introducing a tradeoff between the number of features and tasks. The neural network architecture proposed can learn T tasks simultaneously, with a shared set of layers extracting a common representation specialized for each task. The number of features used in the single-task case is sufficient for a reasonable number of tasks, as shown in experiments in Section 5. The AVI/API framework by Farahmand (2011) facilitates including approximation error of a function approximator in MTRL. Results show the theoretical benefit of sharing representation in MTRL, providing motivation for practical algorithms. Empirical evaluation is aimed at jointly learning T tasks using a neural network architecture that adheres to the proposed theoretical framework. The architecture involves mapping inputs from different tasks to shared layers, with separate layers for each task, leading to a shared representation that reduces overfitting and improves generalization. This approach leverages the regularization effect of jointly learned tasks, as seen in DQN variants and MTRL literature. The proposed network architecture can be used in any MTRL problem involving regression processes, such as Q-function regressor or policy regressor. It allows for easy extension of RL algorithms to multi-task variants without major changes. An extension of FQI called MFQI is introduced to empirically evaluate the approach in challenging RL problems. In multi-task reinforcement learning problems, two well-known DRL algorithms, DQN and DDPG, have been adapted into Multi Deep Q-Network (MDQN) and Multi Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MDDPG) respectively. The experiments show the benefits of learning multiple tasks with a shared representation compared to learning a single task. In multi-task reinforcement learning, experiments using the MushroomRL library show the benefits of learning multiple tasks with a shared representation. An empirical evaluation considers FQI and the Car-On-Hill problem, running separate instances of FQI with a single task network for each task and one of MFQI considering all tasks simultaneously.

An empirical evaluation considers FQI and the Car-On-Hill problem, running separate instances of FQI with a single task network for each task and one of MFQI considering all tasks simultaneously. Figure 1(b) demonstrates how MFQI gets closer to the optimal Q-function, providing empirical evidence of the AVI bounds in Theorem 2. Additionally, Figure 1(c) shows the advantage of increasing the number of tasks in MFQI in terms of quality and stability. Minor changes to the vanilla DQN algorithm are introduced in MDQN, such as using separate replay memories for each task and building the batch with the same number of samples from each memory. The time complexity of MDQN is considerably lower than vanilla DQN. The time complexity of MDQN is lower than vanilla DQN due to learning multiple tasks with a single model. Five problems with similar state spaces, sparse rewards, and discrete actions are considered. MDQN outperforms DQN in most cases, with slightly slower performance in Car-On-Hill but eventually reaching similar levels. Car-On-Hill, MDQN is slightly slower than DQN initially but becomes more stable. In the Inverted-Pendulum experiment, both approaches find it easy, but MDQN benefits from shared feature extraction. Results suggest better feature quality in MDQN compared to DQN. In Acrobot, DQN's performance improves when initialized with weights from a multi-task network trained with MDQN on other problems. The performance of DQN with weight initialization is compared in different settings, showing that adjusting shared weights after epoch 10 yields the best results. This approach allows for multi-task reinforcement learning in policy search algorithms, as demonstrated by MDDPG. MDDPG is proposed as a multi-task variant of DDPG for policy search algorithms. It requires building actor and critic networks following a specific structure. Experiments on MuJoCo problems show MDDPG outperforming DDPG in certain tasks. The advantage of MDDPG over DDPG is evident in Figure 3, performing better in Hopper and equally well in other tasks. Pre-training shared weights in DDPG shows significant benefits, inspired by theoretical and empirical studies in MTL and MTRL literature. Theoretical analysis supports the advantages of MTL algorithms based on linear approximation. In MTL, Maurer (2006) proves advantages with linear approximation, while Maurer et al. (2016) extends results to non-linear approximators. Lazaric & Restelli (2011) and Brunskill & Li (2013) provide theoretical proofs for learning from multiple MDPs in MTRL. Bayesian approaches, like Wilson et al. (2007), assume tasks are generated from a common model. The advantages of Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) have been demonstrated in recent years, particularly in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) using deep neural networks. Various studies have explored deriving multi-task policies from separate task experts trained by DQN, with comparisons to different variants like MDQN. These advancements have shown improvements in benchmarks such as the Atari benchmark. Bellemare et al. (2013) and subsequent studies have extended the analysis to policy search and multi-goal RL. Hessel et al. (2018) proposed a method for balancing learning multiple tasks with a single deep neural network. The advantage of using a shared representation for learning multiple tasks in RL has been theoretically proven. The analysis shows that error propagation during iterations is reduced with the number of tasks, leading to a practical way of exploiting this benefit. Theoretical benefits of shared representations for learning multiple tasks in RL were empirically demonstrated through experiments on challenging RL problems. The proposed method introduced multi-task extensions of FQI, DQN, and DDPG based on a neural network structure.

The proof of Theorem 6 is similar to AVI, computing the average expected loss across tasks and deriving API bounds averaged on multiple tasks. The average expected loss across tasks can be bounded using Hoeffding's inequality. To minimize the last term, choosing y0 = 0 is possible.
