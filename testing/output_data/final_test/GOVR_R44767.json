    "content": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates interstate energy transactions, ensures a reliable energy infrastructure, and protects wholesale customers from unfair rates. With a usual five-member commission, a quorum of three is needed for decision-making. Currently, only two commissioners are in office, impacting FERC's ability to carry out its responsibilities. In 1920, the Federal Water Power Act (FWPA) established the Federal Power Commission (FPC) to regulate nonfederal hydropower projects. Companies in the electric power industry began to consolidate under larger holding companies to avoid state regulation. In 1935, the Public Utility Act (PUA) aimed to address market power abuses. Title I of the PUA, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA; P.L. 74-333), addressed oversight over holding companies by giving the SEC authority over transactions and limiting power industry mergers. Title II amended the FWPA to create the Federal Power Act (FPA), granting the FPC authority to regulate interstate transmission and sales of electricity and natural gas. Part II of the FPA authorized the FPC to regulate interstate transportation and wholesale sale of electric energy. The Federal Power Act (FPA) granted the Federal Power Commission (FPC) authority over interstate transmission and sales of electricity and natural gas, ensuring rates were just and reasonable. In 1977, the FPC was terminated and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was created under the Department of Energy Organization Act (EOA) due to doubts about the FPC's effectiveness. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is composed of five members appointed by the President, with one designated as Chairman. Members serve a four-year term and can be removed for inefficiency. FERC's jurisdiction includes hydroelectric dam licensing, safety, and regulation of rates for electric energy transmission and wholesale sale. The EOA transferred FPC's obligations and administrative functions to FERC. The Energy Organization Act (EOA) transferred authority under the Natural Gas Act to FERC for regulating rates and charges for natural gas transportation and sale. FERC also regulates transmission and wholesale sales of electricity, reviews mergers and acquisitions by electricity companies, and approves the siting of natural gas pipelines and LNG terminals. FERC oversees the construction, operation, and abandonment of interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, and storage facilities. It reviews siting applications for electric transmission projects and ensures the safe operation of LNG terminals. FERC also licenses and inspects hydroelectric projects, enforces reliability standards for the transmission system, monitors energy markets, and administers financial regulations for regulated companies. Its focus is on interstate energy transactions and developing a reliable energy infrastructure. FERC is structured to oversee interstate energy transactions, develop energy infrastructure, and protect wholesale customers. It consists of 12 offices, each handling specific regulatory duties. The Commission typically has five commissioners, with one serving as chairman. President Trump appointed Cheryl LaFleur as acting chairwoman in 2017, replacing Norman Bay. Bay resigned, leaving FERC with only two members, LaFleur and Colette Honorable. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) currently has three members, including LaFleur and Commissioner Colette Honorable. A quorum of three members is required to transact business, with each member having one vote. The Commission typically has three members from the party of the incumbent President and two from the minority party. However, FERC has been operating with only three Democratic commissioners since September 2016, as two Republican commissioners left without replacements. Commissioner Honorable's term expires on June 30, 2017. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has been operating with only three Democratic commissioners since September 2016. A quorum is needed for FERC to issue orders, but it will not be restored until at least one new member is seated. To address this, FERC issued an order delegating authority to staff for certain agency functions to ensure regulatory obligations are met efficiently. This delegation order was also done in 1993 when a quorum was lost. FERC delegated authority to staff in 1993 and again recently due to a lack of quorum. The delegation order allows staff to prevent certain rate filings from taking effect without FERC oversight. The Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation can accept and suspend rate filings, make them effective subject to refund and further order, or set them for hearing and settlement judge procedures. FERC staff can extend time for action on matters permitted by statute and take appropriate action on uncontested filings seeking waivers of tariffs, rate schedules, and service agreements. The Director of OEMR has authority to accept uncontested settlements and cannot issue new agency policies or rules until there is a quorum. As of February 9, 2017, FERC staff can gather information and prepare analyses for various energy projects, but cannot issue new policies or make final decisions without a quorum. There are nearly 46,000 applications filed for certificates of public convenience and necessity, over 600 tariff requests, and almost 60 pending pipeline projects. Commission decisions are often challenged or enforced. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has almost 60 major pipeline projects pending, with many decisions being challenged or enforced in federal courts. The Office of the Solicitor has the authority to defend FERC in court. FERC's major activities in the electric, natural gas, and oil industries are summarized, with a focus on fostering competition in wholesale power markets as a national policy. FERC emphasizes fostering competition in wholesale power markets through regional transmission organizations (RTOs), where power generators compete to sell electricity to retail suppliers. RTOs facilitate the purchase, sale, and delivery of wholesale electricity, ensuring fair value and access for renewable generation and demand response resources. The Commission evaluates RTO market rules to support procurement of new power generation resources for future reliability needs. Capacity market mechanisms aim to retain efficient resources and attract new ones where needed. FERC, under EPACT 2005, oversees bulk power system reliability and approves security standards proposed by EROs. FERC oversees bulk power system reliability and approves security standards proposed by NERC, the designated Electric Reliability Organization. FERC prioritizes grid security and infrastructure investment, including Smart Grid development and transmission investments for renewable resources. The Commission also aims to align state renewables development policies with transmission development priorities. FERC is responsible for licensing new hydropower projects and relicensing existing ones, overseeing project operations, dam safety inspections, and environmental monitoring. The Commission updates regulations to improve hydropower development processes, especially for projects with minimal impoundment of water. FERC also regulates natural gas industry activities related to interstate transportation and storage. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) oversees rates, terms, and conditions of natural gas transportation and sales for resale in interstate commerce. FERC determines fair rates for intrastate pipelines under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The Commission's jurisdiction is limited by certain acts, and it reviews applications for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications for natural gas pipelines, ensuring compliance with safety standards. FERC has authority over LNG facilities under the Natural Gas Act, including design reviews and issuing permits. FERC also handles cross-border pipeline permits, while DOE manages electric permits. FERC oversees rates and conditions for interstate oil pipelines, including those transporting crude oil, refined products, natural gas liquids, and liquefied petroleum gas. The commission aims to ensure equal access for shippers and reasonable transportation rates. FERC does not approve new oil pipeline construction or regulate safety but reviews rate change requests and complaints from public utilities under FPA Section 205. FERC oversees rates for interstate oil pipelines, ensuring equal access for shippers and reasonable transportation rates. It reviews rate change requests and complaints from public utilities under FPA Section 205 and NGA Section 4, which require rates to be just and reasonable. Rates can be challenged if deemed unduly discriminatory or preferential. Under FPA Section 206, FERC can adjust rates if they are found to be unjust or discriminatory, with the possibility of retroactive refunds up to 15 months. Remedies for violations in electricity cases are more robust than in natural gas cases. Recent policy activities at FERC may require a vote. Recent policy activities at FERC may require a vote by FERC Commissioners for final decisions on mergers, corporate applications, and hydropower licenses. FERC examines the effects on competition, rates, and regulation, with a focus on potential cross-subsidization and market power concerns. Comments are invited on revising the policy for establishing the length of hydroelectric licenses. FERC proposes to integrate electric storage resources into organized wholesale markets to enhance competition and ensure just and reasonable rates. The proposal addresses concerns about barriers limiting participation in these markets. The Commission also seeks comments on revising the policy for establishing the length of hydroelectric licenses. Requests for information on rules affecting electric storage resources in wholesale markets and potential barriers to their participation."
