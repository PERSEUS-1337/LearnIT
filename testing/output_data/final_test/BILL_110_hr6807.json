    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new tax credit for new neighborhood electric vehicles under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A new tax credit is introduced for new neighborhood electric vehicles under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The credit allows for the amount paid or incurred for each new vehicle placed in service during the taxable year, with a dollar limitation not exceeding $1,000. The credit can be applied along with other business credits. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart A for such year, with limitations based on the amount of tax. The tax imposed by section 55 is calculated by subtracting the sum of credits allowable under subpart A and sections 27, 30, 30B, and 30C from the tax defined in section 26(b). A neighborhood electric vehicle is defined as a vehicle that draws energy solely from onboard sources and meets specific safety standards. The tax credit for a neighborhood electric vehicle is available for vehicles meeting specific criteria, including having 4 wheels, a top speed between 20-35 mph, a weight rating under 2,500 pounds, being used by the taxpayer, not for resale, and made by a US manufacturer. Special rules include reducing the property's basis by the credit amount and recapture regulations. The tax credit for neighborhood electric vehicles includes provisions for recapturing credits if the property is no longer eligible. No credit is allowed for property used outside the US or if the taxpayer elects not to apply the credit. The section does not apply to property purchased after December 31, 2013. The tax credit for neighborhood electric vehicles is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the portion of the credit to which a specific section applies. Conforming amendments are made to other sections of the tax code to align with this change. The tax credit for neighborhood electric vehicles is amended to include a new section effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2008."
