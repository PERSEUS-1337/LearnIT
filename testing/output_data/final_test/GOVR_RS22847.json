    "content": "NATO held a summit in Bucharest, Romania in April 2008 to address challenges in stabilizing Afghanistan and discuss admitting Croatia and Albania. However, disputes over Macedonia's name and Georgia and Ukraine's potential membership in the Membership Action Plan were not resolved. The summit failed to make definable progress on NATO's mission and the drafting of a new \"Strategic Concept\" was postponed until the following year. NATO's challenges include debates on WMD proliferation, stabilization of key regions, and peacekeeping in the drafting of a new Strategic Concept. The alliance struggles to differentiate between security threats and interventions best left to other organizations. Stabilizing Afghanistan tests allied capabilities and political will, with some members hesitant to engage the Taliban directly. The allies, including the United States, Canada, Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, have approximately 42,000 troops in Afghanistan and 25 Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) to rebuild the country. They face challenges with the expanding narcotics trade fueling the Taliban insurgency. A \"strategic vision\" statement commits the allies to remain in Afghanistan, improve governance through training Afghan officials, and pursue a comprehensive approach. The NATO summit discussed greater training of Afghan officials, combat and economic reconstruction for stabilization, improving relations with Afghanistan's neighbors, and addressing emerging threats like cyber attacks. France pledged more combat troops, and allies agreed to share information on cyber threats. At the NATO summit in Bucharest, allies agreed to share information on cyber threats and discussed countering disruptions in energy supplies by Russia. NATO governments aim to address energy security through conservation and alternative fuels. The summit did not result in major progress on the issue, but officials traveled to Kazakhstan to explore ways to protect its energy infrastructure. NATO is not yet at the point where a cyber attack or energy disruption would trigger a mutual defense response under Article V. At the NATO summit in Bucharest, allies discussed cyber threats and energy security. The Bush Administration proposed missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, which Russia opposes. Public opinion in Poland and the Czech Republic is against the sites. The United States and the Czech Republic signed an agreement to place a radar site on Czech territory. Warsaw is requesting resources to upgrade its air defense system in case of an attack provoked by the interceptors. The NATO summit in Bucharest discussed missile defense, with the U.S. proposing defense assets to protect from long-range missiles. NATO is studying various defense systems to be integrated with the U.S. system for allied protection. Critics argue for further testing of the U.S. system before implementation. Extensive testing is needed before implementing the U.S. missile defense system. Questions were raised about European funding for the system at a congressional hearing. The NATO summit in Bucharest also discussed the candidacies of Albania, Croatia, and Macedonia for alliance entry, as well as Georgia and Ukraine's request to join NATO's Membership Action Plan. These candidate states are working on developing specialized capabilities to contribute to allied security. Membership for them would not be a major strategic event due to their limited military forces. Continuing instability in southeastern Europe due to Serbia's opposition to Kosovo's independence. NATO invited Croatia and Albania to join, with Croatia making progress in governance and military modernization. Concerns remain about Croatian public support for NATO. Albania, a small country with modest military resources, faced irregularities in recent elections according to OSCE reports. Croatia's recognition of Kosovo could facilitate discussions to bring Serbia back into the western-oriented European states. Albania's recent elections had irregularities, raising doubts about adherence to international standards. The government is professionalizing its military and has passed anti-corruption legislation. Albania has recognized Kosovo's independence and is pursuing NATO membership with protocols being prepared. The protocols for Croatia and Albania to join NATO are expected to be completed by the end of July. Each member government will need to amend the NATO Treaty to admit new states, a process that typically takes about a year. A dispute with Greece over Macedonia's name has hindered Macedonia's application, with Greece citing concerns about territorial claims. The allies have urged the two countries to resolve the dispute. The allies urged Macedonia and Greece to resolve their territorial dispute, with NATO foreign ministers given authority to invite Macedonia for accession talks. The Macedonian government fell after the summit, delaying progress. A contentious discussion at Bucharest occurred over admitting Georgia and Ukraine to the MAP, with broader opposition than initially reported. NATO decisions are based on consensus, and in this case, no vote was taken due to unresolved issues. Several governments, including Germany and France, opposed Georgia's and Ukraine's entry into the MAP at the NATO summit. While some cited not wanting to antagonize Russia, larger issues were also considered. Majority of Ukraine's population opposes NATO membership, and some allies believe Kiev must first convince its population of the benefits before starting the MAP process. Georgia is expected to hold parliamentary elections and resolve its conflicts before progressing towards NATO membership. Some allies criticized the Administration's handling of the MAP issue at the NATO summit, noting opposition to Georgia and Ukraine joining. They emphasized the need for progress on energy security and resolving territorial conflicts. The NATO allies agreed that Georgia and Ukraine will become members of NATO, signaling confidence in their ability to reform. This decision also sends a message to Moscow that it cannot determine NATO membership. No specific timeline was provided for their membership. NATO previously conducted a successful bombing campaign in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing, leading to the establishment of a UN protectorate mission. Russia opposed a plan for Kosovo's supervised independence developed by U.N. envoy Martti Ahtisaari. The European Union and the United States implemented the Ahtisaari plan for Kosovo's independence, which Serbia and Russia oppose. The United States contributes troops to NATO's KFOR mission in Kosovo to maintain peace. NATO aims to persuade Serbia to join the Euro-Atlantic community and give up nationalism. France's upcoming presidency of the EU may lead to efforts to strengthen the Union's defense capabilities. Some governments are considering drafting a new Strategic Concept for NATO, but the debate is postponed until after the new US Administration takes office in January 2010."
