    "content": "The Dominican Republic, located on the eastern two-thirds of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, has a population of about 10.3 million. Between 900,000 and 1.2 million people in the country are undocumented, many of whom are Haitians or of Haitian descent. The country has a per capita GDP of roughly $5,770, classified as an upper middle-income country by the World Bank. This is in contrast to Haiti, its neighbor, which is a low-income country with a per capita GDP of just $810. Haiti's economy has struggled, especially after the 2010 earthquake, while the Dominican Republic has shown growth over the years. The Dominican Republic has experienced significant economic growth, with its per capita GDP quadrupling despite a history of political instability. Dictators like Rafael Trujillo and Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer ruled the country until the 1990s when it transitioned into a modern democracy. In 1994, the \"Pact for Democracy\" removed Balaguer from power, leading to free elections in 1996. The Dominican Republic saw economic growth and democratic development, with high corruption levels. Fern\u00e1ndez succeeded Balaguer in 1996, followed by Mej\u00eda in 2000. Mej\u00eda's presidency was marked by economic growth but lost support due to excessive spending. During his last two terms, Leonel F\u00e9rnandez restored confidence in the Dominican economy, enacted significant political reforms, and played a key role in regional politics. F\u00e9rnandez helped the Dominican Republic resume its position as one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, with GDP growth averaging 7% per year from 2005-2011. Poverty rates decreased from 43% in 2004 to 34% in 2010 under his leadership. Former President F\u00e9rnandez's PLD party achieved significant political victories in 2010, securing a majority in the Dominican Senate and Chamber of Deputies. The new constitution approved in 2009 allowed F\u00e9rnandez to run for re-election in 2016. F\u00e9rnandez maintained close ties with the United States while also diversifying trade relations and supporting regional conflicts and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. Former President F\u00e9rnandez mediated regional conflicts and supported reconstruction efforts in Haiti, resolving disputes between Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Despite some criticism, the Dominican Republic responded generously to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. However, F\u00e9rnandez's government left major issues unaddressed, including electricity shortages, high crime rates, and corruption. The Dominican Republic's weak education system and corruption were major obstacles to its competitive economy. The government's decision to let an agreement with the IMF lapse led to fiscal challenges. Danilo Medina became president in 2012, focusing on reducing poverty, increasing education spending, ending illiteracy, and creating new jobs. His policies are expected to align with the National Development Plan 2010-2030. President Medina, following the National Development Plan 2010-2030, has achieved goals of boosting tax revenue and increasing education and healthcare spending. He implemented fiscal reforms to increase revenue and reduce the fiscal deficit, despite being unpopular. The IMF praised these reforms for restoring macroeconomic stability. Medina also increased education funding to 4% of GDP in 2013. President Medina has increased education funding to 4% of GDP in 2013 and implemented new social programs with positive results, including education programs benefiting 200,000 students, literacy programs for 800,000 people, and subsidized health initiatives reaching 460,000 people. Despite progress, efforts to address crime and corruption are ongoing, with a national security plan launched in 2013. In 2014, President Medina credited government efforts for reducing homicides by 13%. The homicide rate further dropped from 20 to 18 per 100,000 in 2014. However, violent crime in the Dominican Republic is fueled by drug flows and corruption among officials. The former head of the anti-drug agency was arrested for stealing confiscated cocaine. Corruption remains a top concern, with the country ranked 115 out of 175 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The Dominican government has faced criticism for its migration policies and treatment of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent. A ruling in September 2013 by the Constitutional Tribunal of the Dominican Republic could render as stateless an estimated 200,000 Dominican-born persons, mostly of Haitian descent. This ruling has the potential to impact thousands born in the Dominican Republic. The case involved Ms. Juliana Dequis Pierre, a 29-year-old Dominican-born woman whose nationality was revoked retroactively based on the 2010 constitution's criteria. The ruling by the Tribunal could potentially render thousands stateless. The Tribunal ruling in the Dominican Republic has sparked international criticism for potentially rendering thousands stateless. It contradicts previous judgments by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and has been denounced by the U.N., OAS, foreign leaders, and human rights groups for violating international human rights obligations. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that the ruling discriminates against Dominicans of Haitian descent. In response, the Dominican Congress approved legislation in May 2014. In May 2014, the Dominican Congress approved legislation allowing individuals born in the country to keep their citizenship by re-registering with the government. The law also provided an expedited path to citizenship for those born to parents without legal status. However, many have not received their birth certificates despite applying. Many human rights groups are concerned about people in the Dominican Republic not receiving birth certificates, potentially facing deportation. The government has issued a decree halting deportations until June and offers a path to citizenship through a regularization plan. However, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that the process violates rights of Dominicans of Haitian descent. The Dominican Tribunal rejected this ruling. The Dominican Tribunal rejected the ruling that the government had improperly submitted to the IACHR's jurisdiction. The government implemented a regularization plan for undocumented migrants, providing a path to legal residency. The plan is open to those who did not make it through the naturalization plan and has set up 24 centers around the country. Over 150,000 individuals have applied to the program. Over 150,000 individuals applied to the Dominican Republic's regularization program, with 40,000 meeting requirements by February 2015. The process, though free, involves obtaining various documents, including a Haitian birth certificate. This has been challenging due to limited centers in Haiti and strained relations between the two countries. If Dominicans of Haitian descent are rendered stateless and deported, it could have a significant impact on Haiti. The Haitian government recalled its ambassador from the Dominican Republic in response to a ruling by the Tribunal. Bilateral talks between Haitian and Dominican officials addressed migration and other topics, with the Dominican government refusing to negotiate the Tribunal's decision. Haiti recognized Dominican sovereignty on migration policy, and concrete measures were promised to protect the rights of people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic. Agreement was reached on immigration issues, including a new type of Dominican visa for workers, during the second round of talks in February 2014. The Haitian government is committed to expediting passport issuance for Haitian students in the Dominican Republic. Dominicans are concerned about illegal immigration due to political instability in Haiti. The Dominican military is increasing efforts to secure the border. Haiti's Ambassador to the Dominican Republic resigned amid criticism for not assisting Haitians with regularization. Haiti remains concerned about its citizens in the Dominican Republic. Anti-Dominican rallies in Haiti have increased tensions. In the Dominican Republic, concerns have risen over anti-Dominican rallies in Haiti following the violent deaths of two Haitians in 2015. Dominican consulates in Haiti were temporarily closed due to the unrest. Attention is shifting towards the 2016 presidential and legislative elections, with President Medina unable to seek consecutive reelection. There is support for an amendment to allow him to run again, but most observers do not expect him to pursue it. If Medina does not run, the PLD may choose Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez as its candidate. The main opposition party in the Dominican Republic, the PRD, remains divided between supporters of Miguel Vargas Maldonado and former President Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda. Other likely candidates for the 2016 presidential election include Luis Abinader and Guillermo Moreno. Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of one-party dominance on democracy in the country. The Dominican Republic's economic growth was driven by the industry and free-trade zone sector, with remittances from abroad contributing significantly. Market-friendly reforms in the late 1990s helped facilitate economic expansion, but poverty, inequality, and high unemployment rates persisted. In 2003, the economy contracted due to banking scandals and competition from cheaper Asian producers. During President Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda's term, the Dominican Republic faced economic strain due to the collapse of Banco Intercontinental (Baninter) in 2003, where $2.2 billion was defrauded from depositors. Under President Fern\u00e1ndez's second term (2004-2008), the economy recovered with inflation decreasing, growth resuming, and the peso regaining its value. A $665 million standby agreement with the IMF was signed in 2005, praising the government's recovery efforts but also urging for energy subsidy reductions and tax base expansion for better fiscal position and social program funding. The Dominican Republic's economy has shown resilience, with growth in sectors like construction, telecommunications, and tourism. It is classified as an upper middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $5,570. The country has experienced strong GDP growth, high levels of foreign investment, and diversified exports. Remittances have exceeded $3.0 billion annually since 2010, and it has the largest stock of foreign direct investment among DR-CAFTA countries. The Dominican economy has seen growth due to high foreign investment, strong performance in mining and telecommunications, and tourism revenues. Despite resilience, it remains vulnerable to external shocks. Recent revenue increases from consumption taxes and tariffs on mining exports have given the government more flexibility. Debt was reduced by paying off $2.5 billion owed to Venezuela's PDVSA. Efforts are being made to reduce reliance on Venezuelan oil imports and address challenges in the electricity sector. The Dominican Republic has reduced its dependency on oil for electricity generation from 93% in 2000 to 36% in 2011. The government is increasing the use of natural gas, renewable sources, and coal, while also preparing for a possible end to subsidized oil from Venezuela's PetroCaribe agreement. The Dominican Republic reduced its oil dependency for electricity generation from 93% in 2000 to 36% in 2011. The government now uses natural gas, coal, and renewable sources for electricity, with plans to import LNG from the United States and build a new natural gas terminal. Legislation in 2007 provided tax incentives for renewable energy production. The Dominican Republic has made significant progress in promoting renewable energy sources since 2010, attracting foreign investment for solar, biomass, and wind energy projects. The government is also investing in coal-powered generators to address electricity shortages. State electrical distribution companies have improved services by adding customers, reducing losses, and implementing reforms to combat corruption and improve customer service. The Dominican government is working to combat corruption and improve customer service in the electricity sector. Despite efforts to target subsidies to the poorest households, the grid remains fragile with significant losses and blackouts. President Medina initiated a dialogue process to address sector challenges, with hopes of implementing reforms to improve reliability. Analysts are optimistic about the potential for recommendations to enhance the Dominican electricity sector. The Dominican Republic has struggled to reduce poverty and inequality despite rapid economic growth. Unemployment, especially among youth, remains high. Economic mobility is lower than the Latin American average. Anti-poverty programs have been ineffective due to poor targeting. Poverty has decreased under President Medina, but sustainability is uncertain. Conditional cash transfers have been used to help impoverished families. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank provided $370 million in loans and technical assistance to support programs that incentivized families to comply with health interventions and keep their children in school, resulting in positive nutrition outcomes and increased school attendance rates. The government combined Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) with school-based intervention programs to create the Progresando con Solidaridad (PROSOLI) program in 2012. An additional $100 million loan from the IDB in 2013 expanded PROSOLI's reach to benefit over 710,000 families. President Medina's administration has also focused on improving the social safety net, healthcare, education, employment, and agricultural productivity. President Medina's administration in the Dominican Republic has created almost 300,000 jobs by December 2014, with a goal of reaching 400,000 jobs in four years. The government supports micro, small, and medium-sized businesses with credit and subsidized loans, aiming to boost agricultural productivity and create more jobs. With assistance from the IDB, the government also works to improve companies' productivity and enhance access to profitable markets, resulting in the creation of 35,000 jobs in the sector. The Dominican Republic has strong ties with the United States, with over 1.5 million Dominicans residing there. The Dominican Republic is a top country of origin for the U.S. foreign-born population, with strong ties to the United States. The U.S. supports the country's democratic and economic development, including efforts to strengthen governance, improve social services, boost competitiveness, and address citizen security. Close security cooperation is ensured through initiatives like the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) and a bilateral extradition treaty. Economic relations are maintained through agreements like CAFTA-DR. President Obama expressed interest in working with President Medina on bilateral issues. President Obama and Vice President Biden expressed support for working with President Medina on bilateral and regional issues. The Obama Administration officials have concerns about a Tribunal ruling affecting people of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic. Vice President Biden praised President Medina for passing a naturalization law to help Haitians and their descendants. The United States is a major donor to the Dominican Republic, providing $25.3 million in assistance in FY2014. The Obama Administration provided $25.3 million in assistance to the Dominican Republic in FY2014. Additional funding requests were made for FY2015 and FY2016. Assistance focuses on improving transparency, rule of law, education quality, climate change resilience, and healthcare access, particularly for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Funding for the Dominican Republic declined from FY2010 to FY2014, with a larger decrease in Development Assistance compared to global health programs. In FY2009, the Dominican Republic received $5 million in assistance under the M\u00e9rida Initiative for anticrime and counterdrug programs. In FY2010, assistance shifted to the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) for regional security. The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) is a regional security program aimed at reducing illicit trafficking, promoting public safety, and advancing social justice. Congress allocated $327.0 million for CBSI programs from FY2010 to FY2014. The Obama Administration requested additional funding of $56.5 million for FY2015 and $53.5 million for FY2016. CBSI aid to the Dominican Republic totaled $5.4 million in FY2010, $15.2 million in FY2011, and $11.9 million in FY2012, with a total of $32.5 million allocated for FY2010-FY2012. The Dominican Republic receives funding from the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative for various programs including training for military, police, and prosecutors, at-risk youth programs, combating human trafficking, and weapons destruction. President Obama designated the country as a major drug transit country and a jurisdiction of primary concern for money laundering. The Dominican Republic is a key transit point for cocaine destined for the U.S. and Europe, with ties between international traffickers and corrupt officials exposed through high-profile arrests. Cooperation with the United States includes joint operations, seizures, and extraditions of drug-trafficking suspects. In 2013, the Dominican government improved coordination between police and military units to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, resulting in high seizures. Port security remains a problem, with only one port meeting U.S. Container Security Initiative standards. Bilateral cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Southern Command is strong, with efforts to improve coordination with Haitian National Police and other Caribbean partners ongoing. The Dominican government has improved coordination between police and military units to combat drug trafficking and money laundering, resulting in high seizures. CBSI funding is helping train Dominican police and prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting cases, creating a money-laundering agency, and improving port security. However, obstacles exist in U.S.-Dominican counterdrug and anticrime cooperation due to corruption and impunity affecting efforts. Dominican police and military personnel continue to be arrested for drug-trafficking-related crimes despite initiatives to root out corrupt officials. The Dominican government is struggling to absorb deportees with criminal records arriving from the United States. The U.S. government does not assist the Dominican government with deportee reintegration. Trade and investment linkages between the U.S. and the Dominican Republic have increased over the years. Under CAFTA-DR, the Dominican Republic has implemented reforms to improve its tax structure, strengthen intellectual property rights, and facilitate trade flows. U.S. industrial and consumer goods now enter the Dominican Republic duty-free, with most U.S. agricultural exports set to enter duty-free by 2020. Since implementing reforms under CAFTA-DR, the Dominican Republic has seen an increase in foreign investment, becoming a leader in manufacturing and Foreign Direct Investment in the region. The United States is the country's main trading partner, with two-way trade totaling nearly $12.5 billion in 2014. Dominican imports from the U.S. have increased by 49% since 2006, with a shift towards more technology-intensive and mining exports. The Dominican Republic has seen an increase in technology-intensive and mining exports to the United States. Agricultural exports like sugar and tobacco are declining in percentage of overall trade. Concerns have arisen about the potential impact of the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement on textile and apparel industries in the region. Tariff preferences under CAFTA-DR are crucial for keeping apparel producers competitive in the U.S. market. The potential impact of a TPP agreement on textile and apparel industries in the Dominican Republic and Central America could displace apparel manufactured with U.S. fabric. The labor chapter of CAFTA-DR aims to ensure respect for labor standards in the Dominican Republic, including the right to organize, child labor, and minimum wages. The Department of Labor (DOL) has produced reports on implementing the labor chapter of CAFTA-DR, with funding for projects in the Dominican Republic and regional efforts. The Dominican Republic increased its labor enforcement budget, leading to more workplace visits, but concerns were raised about labor inspections, especially in the sugar sector. The DOL received a submission alleging labor abuses in the Dominican Republic's sugarcane plantations, mainly affecting Haitian and Dominican workers without proper documentation. The Dominican sugar industry and government denied the allegations. The Dominican sugar industry and government rejected allegations of labor abuses in the sugarcane plantations, questioning the transparency of the DOL's acceptance of the 2011 submission. A DOL report in September 2013 cited violations of labor laws in the sugar sector, including low wages, long work hours, lack of safety equipment, child labor, and forced labor. Concerns were raised about the sector's compliance with labor laws on freedom of association and collective bargaining. The DOL identified issues in the inspection process in the Dominican Republic that hinder the identification of labor violations. Recommendations were made to the government, but in a follow-up report, the Dominican government had not shown progress in addressing the concerns. DOL continues to engage with the government and sugar industry to address the issues, with the possibility of the United States taking formal action if progress is not made. The United States may take formal action if the Dominican Republic does not address human rights concerns, including discrimination against Haitian migrants, violence against women, abuses by authorities, and trafficking in persons. Progress has been made in some areas, but challenges remain. The Obama Administration has expressed concern about the treatment of Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent in the Dominican Republic, particularly regarding a ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal. The United States has engaged with the Dominican Republic on this issue. The United States is hopeful for a conclusion through legislation to address the issue of Haitians and their descendants in the Dominican Republic. Vice President Biden praised President Medina for passing a naturalization law, emphasizing the importance of its implementation. Without proper identity documents, individuals face challenges in healthcare, education, travel, voting, job opportunities, property ownership, and education. Police abuses are often directed towards undocumented Haitian migrants in urban areas and along the border with Haiti. Violence against women is a major human rights issue in the Dominican Republic, with laws against rape and domestic violence often not enforced. Authorities received 60,000 gender-based violence complaints in 2013, and over 1,100 Dominican women died due to gender-based violence between 2008 and 2013. Few victims reported the abuse, leading to the establishment of special services for domestic violence victims by the Attorney General's office. The Dominican Republic has set up special services for victims of domestic violence, created a female-led police unit for emergency calls, and opened two shelters. It is a source, transit, and destination country for human trafficking, with tens of thousands of women trafficked globally. Women are trafficked into prostitution and the sex industry domestically, while children are vulnerable to sex trafficking, forced begging, and labor exploitation. Labor trafficking is evident in various sectors, with Haitian descent individuals at high risk. The State Department issued a report on trafficking in persons in June 2014. The Dominican Republic is classified as a Tier 2 country in the congressionally mandated report on trafficking in persons. The report highlights progress in prosecuting sex and labor trafficking cases, providing temporary immigration permits for foreign victims, but also notes areas needing improvement such as lack of assistance for victims and difficulty in identifying trafficking victims. Police reforms have led to a decrease in extrajudicial killings. The Dominican Republic has seen a decrease in extrajudicial killings by security forces, with 117 people killed in 2013. Despite efforts to improve police conduct, abuses still occur, as reported by the National Human Rights Council. Prison conditions vary from fair to harsh, with newer facilities slightly better. The government is implementing a new criminal procedures code to address these issues. The Dominican Republic is implementing a new criminal procedures code to address issues with pretrial detentions and corruption in the justice sector. The country is experiencing political stability and economic growth, with President Medina expected to pass reforms easily. Challenges lie in implementing a regularization program to address nationality issues and concerns for Haitians and Dominicans of Haitian descent. Addressing poverty and energy shortages are also key priorities for the government. The PLD has a good chance of securing another presidential term in May 2016 if they address poverty, energy shortages, and corruption. Medina may run again in 2020 despite being barred from consecutive reelection. Dominican-U.S. relations are likely to remain strong due to cultural, geographical, and economic ties, but could be strained by U.S. concerns about human rights and labor issues."
