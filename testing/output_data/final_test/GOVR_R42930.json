    "content": "Rising tensions over maritime territorial claims in East Asia pose challenges for U.S. policy makers, including oversight of policies in Asia, military priorities, support for disputant nations, and managing relations with China, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The disputes are long-standing, with a recent increase in incidents and diplomatic tensions. Maritime incidents and diplomatic tensions in East Asia, particularly in the East China Sea and South China Sea, are a major challenge for U.S. strategic \"rebalancing\" towards the Asia-Pacific. China's actions in asserting its maritime territorial claims, involving the PLA and maritime law enforcement authorities, are of particular concern. Other disputes involve countries like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The South China Sea, East China Sea, and Sea of Japan are busy waterways with incidents arising due to nations asserting sovereignty and economic interests. The US does not claim any waters but opposes the use of force to strengthen sovereignty claims. The US supports resolving disputes peacefully using international law and arbitration mechanisms, particularly in the South China Sea. China's actions in the region are seen as crucial for regional security and its role as a global actor. China argues it is responding to other nations' actions rather than acting aggressively, reacting strongly to perceived US support for other claimants. The United States faces challenges in managing tensions in East Asia, with disputes over territorial claims escalating. U.S. policy makers aim to deter aggressive Chinese behavior while maintaining a productive relationship with Beijing and supporting allies. The region is experiencing growing maritime incidents, and tensions are expected to persist for years. This report will address the territorial disputes, U.S. interests, drivers of tensions, and potential options for Congress to consider. The curr_chunk discusses factors driving tensions in East Asia, focusing on disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. It mentions various CRS reports addressing these issues and possible options for Congress to consider. Maritime territorial disputes in East Asia, particularly involving China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam, are a significant challenge for U.S. diplomacy in the region. These disputes impact treaty alliances, such as those with Japan and the Philippines, where treaty obligations could be invoked in case of conflict. The Obama Administration is actively involved in resolving maritime territorial disputes in East Asia, particularly with China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The U.S. supports freedom of navigation and opposes coercion by claimants asserting territorial claims. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the U.S. national interest in freedom of navigation at the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2010. The United States asserts its national interest in freedom of navigation and respect for international law in the South China Sea, causing tension with China. The Obama Administration also emphasizes the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty's coverage of territories under Japan's administration in the East China Sea. The U.S. asserts its national interest in freedom of navigation and respect for international law in the South China Sea, causing tension with China. The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty covers territories under Japan's administration in the East China Sea, including the Senkaku islets. President Obama's public statement on this issue during a 2014 visit to Japan angered China. Japanese observers see the Sino-Japan maritime confrontation as a threat from China's rising power, highlighting Japan's reliance on the U.S. security guarantee. The rebalancing strategy has reassured many Japanese leaders. The U.S. rebalancing strategy has reassured Japanese leaders, but there are concerns about Japan being provocative in disputes with its neighbors. China sees Japan as a threat due to its re-militarization and U.S. support. Tensions were sparked in 2012 when Japan purchased islets, and the U.S. rebalancing has worsened the situation. Efforts to reduce tensions in the South China Sea involve multilateral dialogues. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in resolving territorial disputes in the South China Sea, emphasizing the importance of a Code of Conduct between China and ASEAN. The Obama Administration has called for adherence to international law, specifically UNCLOS, to clarify claims. Disagreements over the content and enforcement of the Code have hindered progress in negotiations. In February 6, 2014, Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel emphasized that maritime claims must align with international law. President Obama supported the Philippines' arbitration in maritime disputes with China. The United States transferred high-endurance cutters to the Philippines to enhance their maritime capabilities in the South China Sea. In December 2013, the US provided security assistance packages to the Philippines, including two high-endurance cutters to enhance maritime capabilities. The packages aimed to improve maritime domain awareness, logistics, communication, and vessel maintenance. Additionally, a regional assistance package was announced, including maritime law enforcement training courses in Thailand for coastal patrol units. These efforts address maritime disputes in East Asia and raise oversight questions for Congress regarding US policies and relations with claimant nations. Congress is facing questions on how to support Southeast Asian disputants' military capabilities in their disputes with China, as well as managing relations with China and Japan in the East China Sea. There are concerns about the United States being drawn into a conflict in the region, with analysts pointing to the risk of conflict scenarios involving Chinese actions. China's actions in the East China Sea pose risks of conflict scenarios, including blocking U.S. surveillance activities and potential armed conflicts with Japan or the Philippines. The U.S. has treaty alliances with both countries, raising concerns about being drawn into regional conflicts. The 113th Congress may consider legislation related to East Asian maritime territorial disputes, particularly in the South China Sea. This includes defense authorization and appropriation bills that could impact the reallocation of military resources in the Asia-Pacific region. H.R. 4495, introduced in April 2014, called for a Department of Defense assessment of maritime forces in the region over the next decade. Congress has the ability to support the U.S. defense commitment to the region. Congress has the ability to support the U.S. defense commitment to the region by urging for processes to lower tensions and seek resolution of disputes. For example, in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress inserted a resolution reaffirming the U.S.' acknowledgment of Japan's administration over the Senkaku Islands. The Senate has also considered resolutions regarding maritime security in East Asia. The United States strongly supports peaceful resolution of disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains, condemns coercion, and urges self-restraint. Senator Robert Menendez introduced S.Res. 412 to reaffirm support for freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of territorial disputes. H.R. 4495 aims to strengthen U.S. partnerships and military engagement in the region. The United States supports peaceful resolution of disputes in the Asia-Pacific maritime domains and condemns coercion. H.R. 4495 aims to strengthen U.S. partnerships and military engagement in the region. The Senate could offer advice and consent to U.S. adherence to UNCLOS, the governing regime for oceans and maritime territorial disputes. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on UNCLOS in the 112th Congress but did not vote on it. The persistence of complex territorial disputes in the South China Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, and Yellow Sea has led to tensions for decades. Different interpretations of history and UNCLOS, along with disputes over settlement procedures, have hindered negotiations among claimant states. The lack of a unified venue for resolving maritime territorial disputes complicates the situation. UNCLOS provides a potential framework for formal claims and dispute resolution. China's claims in the South China Sea are not based on UNCLOS but on historical documents showing centuries of administrative control. UNCLOS does not govern land ownership but maritime rights around sovereign territory. Countries use various tools to demonstrate sovereignty claims, such as historical or de facto administrative control. The rising frequency of territorial disputes in the South China Sea, including Sino-Japan incidents in the Senkakus and China's disputes with the Philippines and Vietnam, are driven by efforts to demonstrate administrative control over uninhabited islets and landmasses. This behavior is a result of nations trying to assert their sovereignty claims through various means. Efforts to demonstrate administrative control over islands and rocks in the South China Sea have been ongoing since the 1940s by claimants like China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. UNCLOS allows claimants to establish sovereignty over landmasses, granting them rights to adjacent maritime territory based on habitability. Landmasses are entitled to Exclusive Economic Zones up to 200 nautical miles if habitable, while rocks are limited to a 12 nautical mile territorial sea. This distinction has led to the construction of structures by claimants in the region. Maritime boundaries in the South China Sea are complex due to multiple claimants and disputed land features. The area is surrounded by Brunei, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam, with many small islands, shoals, reefs, and rocks. China, Taiwan, and Vietnam claim the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the sea. China currently controls these islands. China controls the Paracel Island chain in the northern part of the South China Sea, having forcibly taken control in 1974. Further south, the Spratly Island chain is claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Control over these islands could provide access to energy resources. Some claimants have built structures on the islands to demonstrate control. China's claim to around 80% of the sea is a major source of dispute. China's ambiguous claim to around 80% of the South China Sea through a U-shaped nine-dash line creates uncertainty and overlaps with the exclusive economic zones of other coastal states, leading to disputes over offshore energy exploration and maritime policing rights. The standoff in 2012 over the Scarborough Shoal dispute involved rival claimants asserting control over disputed waters in the South China Sea. The PRC claims to have discovered and named the islands in the region, exercising political jurisdiction over them. The PRC claims political jurisdiction over landmasses, islets, and shoals in the South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands. It asserts historical rights dating back to the Ming and Yuan Dynasties, and uses a nine-dash line on maps to claim around 80% of the sea. China's claim is based on historical maps from the pre-revolution Republic of China government. The extent of China's sovereignty within the nine-dash line is unclear. China's claim to the South China Sea is based on historical rights and the use of a nine-dash line on maps. This claim has led to tensions with other claimants in the region and raised questions about its legality under international law. The PRC asserts sovereignty over the islands and waters in the South China Sea, referring to it as China's territory. In 2012, the PLA Navy submarine base commander discussed the South China Sea as China's \"maritime national territory\" and emphasized the nine-dash line as China's boundary. China upgraded Sansha city's administrative level to administer disputed areas in the South China Sea and established a PLA garrison there. These actions were criticized by the State Department for escalating tensions in the region. Additionally, in 1999, China imposed a unilateral fishing ban in the northern part of the South China Sea. China re-imposed an annual fishing ban in the South China Sea, leading to periodic detentions of foreign fishermen by PRC maritime patrol ships. Amended regulations in 2014 required foreigners to seek permission to fish in Hainan's waters, covering more than half of the sea. The State Department criticized these restrictions as provocative and potentially dangerous. China's extensive maritime claims in the South China Sea, including the Paracel Island chain and reefs in the Spratlys, have not been justified under international law. The PRC forcibly took over territories like Mischief Reef from other countries and has made territorial assertions through actions like building platforms on rocks. China's territorial assertions in the South China Sea have led to confrontations with Vietnam over an oil rig near the Paracel Islands. Chinese ships used water cannons to disperse Vietnamese patrol boats, claiming the rig is in China's territory. Additionally, the PLA challenged the U.S. military in international waters, with a PLA Navy ship forcing a U.S. cruiser to take evasive action to avoid a collision in the South China Sea. The incident in the South China Sea involved the Cowpens taking evasive action to avoid a collision with a Chinese ship. The Chinese ship's actions may have violated international regulations on preventing collisions at sea. Taiwan has historical claims to islands in the South China Sea. In 1947, the ROC's Ministry of Internal Affairs printed a map with an 11-dash line around islands in the South China Sea. Taiwan has occupied Itu Aba Island since 1956 and stationed Coast Guard personnel on Pratas and Taiping Islands. The Philippines has emerged as a key player in the disputes in the South China Sea. Since 1952, the Philippines has been a key player in disputes over claims in the South China Sea, particularly in the Spratly chain. The Philippines asserts historical exploration and fishing rights in the region, designating islands as part of Palawan Province and stationing troops at Second Thomas Shoal. In 2009, a law was passed to clarify its claims. In 2009, the Philippines clarified its maritime borders and brought its Spratly claims closer to UNCLOS compliance. Disputes with China have escalated, including the seizure of Mischief Reef and the Scarborough Shoal standoff in 2012. Recent tensions include China blocking supplies to Philippine personnel on Second Thomas Shoal. Manila has explored various means to resolve these disputes. In 2012, the Philippines offered China the opportunity to resolve their dispute over Scarborough Shoal through international mechanisms, which China declined. In 2013, the Philippines requested an ITLOS Arbitral Tribunal to rule on China's claims within the nine-dash line. The Philippines argued that China's nine-dash line has no standing in international law. China has argued that the tribunal does not have legal standing to hear the case regarding maritime boundaries and sovereignty. The Philippines submitted its argument to the tribunal in 2014, but a ruling has not been made yet. Vietnam also makes claims to the Spratly and Paracel Island chains based on historical activity dating back to the 17th-19th centuries. The Paracel chain's ownership, originally claimed by French colonial administrators in 1933, now belongs to the Vietnamese government. In 2012, Vietnam passed a Maritime Law outlining its claims to the Paracel and Spratly chains based on baselines drawn in 2003. Vietnam and Malaysia jointly submitted a claim to UNCLOS in 2009, prompting China's response with its nine-dash line map. Vietnam patrols its claimed EEZ and occasionally detains fishing vessels in disputed waters to balance public diplomacy with China. Vietnam maintains positive ties with Beijing due to shared border and economic links. It actively seeks international support for its claims, including from the US. Vietnam has urged others to promote maritime security in the South China Sea while also engaging in regular communications with Beijing. Analysts believe Vietnam's diplomatic mechanisms for managing disputes with China are more advanced than other claimants. Malaysia has delineated its maritime boundaries with China in the South China Sea, including islets also claimed by the Philippines and Vietnam. Malaysia's disputes with China have been less contentious compared to Vietnam and the Philippines, likely due to its distance from China and smaller fishing industry. Chinese maritime law enforcement vessels have reportedly interfered with Malaysia's claims in the region. Malaysia has resolved territorial disputes with Brunei and sought cooperation with Southeast Asian claimants, including Vietnam. Malaysia's state energy company, Petronas, has been involved in joint development agreements with Brunei. Brunei has narrow claims in the South China Sea, overlapping with China, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Disputes with Malaysia were resolved through a 2009 agreement for joint energy development. Malaysia will chair ASEAN in 2015, influencing discussions on maritime disputes. The East China Sea is embroiled in territorial disputes over the Senkaku/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai islets between Japan, China, and Taiwan. There is also a maritime sovereignty dispute between China and Japan over the continental shelf to the Okinawa Trough. The historical basis for the claims over the islets is a contentious issue. China and Taiwan claim that the Diaoyu Islands were historically considered part of China's territory, with the Qing Dynasty placing them under Taiwan's jurisdiction. They argue that Japan should have relinquished the islands along with Taiwan after World War II. Geographically, China asserts that the Okinawa Trough separates the islands from Japan's Ryuku Islands. Japan maintains there is no territorial dispute. Japan claimed the Senkaku Islands in 1895, stating they were uninhabited and not under China's control. The Treaty of Shimonoseki did not mention the islands, leading Japan to incorporate them separately from the Sino-Japanese War. The Senkaku Islands were claimed by Japan in 1895, separate from the Sino-Japanese War. China and Taiwan argue that Japan used its victory in the war to annex the islands, with the ROC asserting sovereignty over the islands since Japan's surrender in 1945. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry claims historical records dating back to the Ming Dynasty support their ownership of the Diaoyutai Islands. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that post-World War II agreements confirmed Taiwan's rights over the islands. The speaker argued that international agreements after World War II confirmed Taiwan's return to the Republic of China, including the Diaoyutai Islands. The United States administered the islands from the 1950s to 1972, then turned administration over to Japan. China considers the U.S.-Japan agreements regarding the islands as \"illegal and invalid.\" The sovereignty of the Senkakus/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai islands was discussed but not resolved in the 1970s. The Senkakus/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai's sovereignty issue between China and Japan was not resolved during the normalization of their relations in the 1970s. Both countries have accused each other of breaching the understanding to leave the issue for future generations. China claims maritime rights based on its continental shelf extension, submitting information to the U.N. in 2009. Japan and China have conflicting claims over the extended continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, specifically in the East China Sea. China has been exploring and building pipelines in disputed waters since the 1970s, with Japan initially taking a passive stance. However, Japan became more assertive in the late 1990s and both countries began negotiating bilateral agreements for the exploitation of undersea hydrocarbon resources in the 2000s. Both Japan and China have conflicting claims over the East China Sea's undersea hydrocarbon resources. In 2008, they reached an agreement for joint exploration in disputed areas, aiming to promote peace and cooperation. The agreement allowed Japanese companies to form a joint venture with China's state-owned companies in the Chunxiao gas and oil fields. In 2008, Japan and China agreed to joint exploration in the East China Sea, allowing Japanese companies to form a joint venture with China's state-owned companies in the Chunxiao field. Japan protested CNOOC's extraction from the field, fearing gas siphoning. No progress has been made in implementing the agreement, leading to tensions over the Senkaku Islands since 2010. Tensions escalated between Japan and China over the Senkaku Islands in 2010 when a fishing boat from China collided with Japanese patrol boats. China demanded the release of the boat's captain, accused Japan of endangering Chinese fishermen, deployed patrol ships near the islands, and imposed restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan. The situation worsened in 2012 when Japan announced plans to purchase islands in the Senkakus, leading to further protests and tensions with China. Tensions between Japan and China escalated over the Senkaku Islands in 2010 due to a collision between a Chinese fishing boat and Japanese patrol boats. In 2012, Japan's announcement of plans to purchase the islands led to further protests and tensions with China. In response, China deployed patrol ships near the islands and imposed restrictions on rare earth exports to Japan. In 2013, China increased maritime and aerial patrols around the islets, prompting reciprocal responses from Japan. The PRC also announced an Air Defense Identification Zone for the region. On November 23, 2013, the PRC announced an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) for the East China Sea, including the Senkaku Islands, overlapping with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan's ADIZs. The U.S. criticized the move as destabilizing and stated it would not change military operations. The Secretary of State emphasized that the U.S. does not recognize foreign ADIZ procedures for non-entering aircraft. In August 2012, tensions between Japan and South Korea escalated after South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited disputed islets claimed by both countries. Japan intensified its claims to the islets, known as Liancourt Rocks, while South Korea rejected Japan's efforts to take the issue to the International Court of Justice. The Noda government postponed bilateral meetings and threatened further action due to escalating tensions between Japan and South Korea over disputed islets. Despite some easing of tensions in late September, the situation remained strained in November, leading to the cancellation of routine bilateral leaders' meetings. The dispute is influenced by domestic politics in both nations, hindering the prospects of improving trilateral relations with the United States. The territorial dispute over the islets between Japan and South Korea is heavily influenced by domestic politics in both nations. South Korea has administered the islets since the 1950s, symbolizing its independence, while Japan took over the islands in 1905. The visit of President Lee has heightened tensions between the two countries. President Lee's visit to western Japan has brought the territorial dispute with South Korea into the mainstream, potentially complicating Japan-South Korean relations. The dispute involves overlapping EEZ claims in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, centered around a submerged rock administered by South Korea. This issue adds to existing tensions in the region, with Japan feeling threatened by perceived encroachment from China and Russia. South Korea's construction of a research observation station on Ieodo has led to diplomatic protests from China, who flew surveillance missions over the rock. The dispute escalated in 2013 when China's ADIZ overlapped with South Korea's, prompting South Korea to request a redraw of the ADIZ. Critics noted South Korea's lack of coordination with Japan and the U.S. in addressing the issue. South Korea expanded its ADIZ to overlap with Chinese and Japanese airspace, leading to tensions. Violent clashes between South Korean Coast Guard and Chinese fishermen have strained relations. Territorial disputes in East Asia have a long history. Tensions in the South China Sea have increased since 2005-2006 due to competition for energy and fishery resources, driven by the energy needs of growing economies and overfishing in coastal waters. This has raised concerns among those reliant on trade routes in the region. The South China Sea tensions have escalated due to competition for resources, driven by energy demands and overfishing. China's emergence as a regional power raises questions about its strategic intentions and foreign policy shift. The region's maritime nations, including China, the Philippines, and Vietnam, seek to exploit resources, leading to uncertainty and potential conflicts. The rising importance of national image in domestic politics of disputing countries like China, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Vietnam has made compromise difficult. Analysts point to UNCLOS as a formal diplomatic mechanism that fuels assertive actions and resource competition, raising tensions in the South China Sea. Resource competition in the South China Sea and East China Sea is a key driver of territorial disputes. The South China Sea is a major source of fish and energy resources for China, the Philippines, and Vietnam. New technologies are making offshore oil and gas development more feasible, but territorial competition creates uncertainties. Overfishing and high energy prices contribute to tensions in these areas. The South China Sea faces resource competition due to overfishing in coastal waters and rising energy demand, leading to offshore energy development. Estimates suggest significant oil and gas reserves, with potential for more in disputed areas. The USGS estimated 5-22 billion barrels of oil and 70-290 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the South China Sea, but it is below potential resources found in other parts of the globe. Technical and territorial issues hinder exploitation of energy resources in the deep sea. CNOOC unveiled a deep-water drilling rig in 2012 to extend its capabilities, deploying it in disputed areas in 2014, sparking protests from Vietnam. International energy companies are believed to have more technical ability for development. Most energy resources in the South China Sea are in shallow waters, with Vietnam and the Philippines relying on it for oil and gas. Disputes hinder development, frustrating governments and economic planners. UNCLOS grants coastal states rights to explore and exploit resources in their EEZ. Offshore energy development in the South China Sea is hindered by territorial disputes, leading to conflicts between countries like China and Vietnam. These disputes create uncertainties and constraints on resource exploration and development in the region. Offshore resource exploration and development in the South China Sea face uncertainties due to territorial disputes. Despite this, China, the Philippines, and Vietnam have engaged in oil-and-gas exploration in disputed areas. Vietnam has actively sought bids for offshore energy development, leading to conflicts with China. The South China Sea is a hotspot for territorial disputes, with China warning oil companies not to partner with Vietnam in disputed areas. The Philippines is also seeking to develop natural gas and oil deposits beyond its boundaries, with the Malampaya field being a significant energy resource. Tensions have risen over exploration licenses near the Reed Bank, claimed by multiple countries, leading to conflicts with China. In the 2000s, Chinese officials expressed interest in joint development of resources in the South China Sea. CNOOC signed an agreement with PNOC and PetroVietnam for seismic exploration in the Spratlys, but it was not renewed in 2007 due to controversy over sovereignty claims. Joint exploration is seen as a way to manage territorial disputes. Actions by CNOOC in Vietnam's EEZ and disputed waters have made joint activity difficult. A 2008 Sino-Japanese energy exploitation agreement remains unimplemented. Fishing in the South China Sea is a potential conflict source due to overfishing and harassment incidents. The disputed waters in the South China Sea are patrolled by coast guards and local maritime agencies, leading to potential conflicts with fishing vessels. Seizures and arrests of fishermen can escalate tensions, as seen in the 2012 Philippines-China dispute at Scarborough Shoal. Competition for valuable fishery resources drives sovereignty claims, but joint fisheries management could help reduce tensions and promote cooperation among disputing nations. China's emergence as a powerful and assertive actor in the South China Sea has heightened tensions among disputants. Its economic power has increased dependence on open trade routes, giving it leverage and financial resources for military modernization. China's growing military capabilities and assertiveness along its maritime periphery have further escalated tensions in the region. China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea has raised concerns among neighboring countries and the United States. Chinese officials suspect the U.S. of pursuing containment policies, while some argue for naval capacity to protect trade links. The U.S. rebalancing to Asia has been criticized for emboldening countries in territorial disputes with China, leading to increased regional instability. Many U.S. officials defend their policy as a response to regional calls for leadership. The PRC's increased deployment of fishing boats and patrol ships has led to more confrontations at sea. China restructured its maritime agencies in 2013, creating a unified Chinese Coast Guard under the State Oceanic Administration. This move aimed to improve coordination and control over maritime activities. The State Oceanic Administration oversees Chinese maritime patrols, which have increased in frequency. CMS and FLEC ships began regular patrols in various seas starting in 2006 and 2010 respectively. China has also expanded the scope of its naval patrols, including incidents near the Natuna Islands and James Shoal. In 2014, the PLA Navy patrolled the Paracel and Spratly Islands, as well as James Shoal. China's defense budget grew at an average rate of 11.8% annually from 2000 to 2011. PLA leader Hu Jintao announced \"New Historic Missions\" for the PLA in 2004, expanding naval resources. The PLA Navy acquired seven new classes of submarines since 1995, deploying 56 submarines in 2011. The PLA Navy has expanded its base on Hainan Island for submarines and ships, commissioning its first aircraft carrier in 2012. Improved Chinese naval capabilities have increased coercive tools in the South China Sea and East China Sea, strengthening control over disputed waters. Beijing has deployed ships near the Senkakus and Scarborough to solidify sovereign claims. China's actions in the South China Sea and East China Sea, including patrolling near the Senkakus and asserting control over Scarborough Shoal, aim to demonstrate administrative authority. U.S. policy concerns trends across the Taiwan Strait and potential cooperation between Taiwan and China on shared interests. There is debate over whether Taiwan coordinated with China in asserting sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands in 2012. Beijing urges cooperation over the islands to improve cross-strait relations. In September 2012, tensions rose between Taiwan and the PRC over the East China Sea islands. Both sides deployed patrol ships and military assets, raising concerns about accidental collisions. Taiwan's actions included deploying Coast Guard ships and military systems sold by the United States. ASEAN has been involved in diplomacy over the South China Sea since 1967. ASEAN and China have been discussing a Code of Conduct for parties in the South China Sea since the 1990s. In 2002, they agreed on a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, outlining principles for conflict resolution without creating mechanisms to solve them. ASEAN and China have been discussing a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea since the 1990s. The 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea outlined conflict resolution principles without mechanisms for solving them. Subsequent discussions have not led to a formal Code of Conduct, with disagreements on its content and enforcement mechanisms. Some see a Code as a tool for conflict prevention, while others believe it is insufficient for addressing current security crises. Negotiations on the Code of Conduct for the South China Sea have been hindered by China's actions to consolidate control. ASEAN's lack of unity and emphasis on consensus has made discussions difficult. Disagreements over specific mentions of South China Sea incidents have stalled progress, with Cambodia, seen as China's ally, blocking any mention. ASEAN-China Leaders Meeting in November 2012 also saw disagreements on a common stance for negotiating the code. Indonesia, as Southeast Asia's largest nation, has a unique position in negotiating maritime borders in the South China Sea. Its foreign minister played a key role in gaining agreement on the need for a regional Code of Conduct and the importance of self-restraint and non-use of force by all parties. Singapore has become more vocal in urging actions to lower tensions in the South China Sea region. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the need for all parties to manage disputes responsibly and avoid escalating tensions. The speech, made in Beijing, was seen as a pointed message to China's leadership. Singapore has a vested interest in seeing peaceful resolutions to the disputes in the region. Prime Minister Lee of Singapore emphasized the importance of resolving disputes in the South China Sea peacefully and in accordance with international law. The United States has treaty obligations with Japan and the Philippines, but takes no position on specific maritime territorial claims in East Asia. The United States does not take a position on territorial disputes over the Senkaku Islands, but it is bound to protect them under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. China's increased patrols around the islands since 2012 are seen as an attempt to show control. Congress inserted a resolution in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act affirming Japan's administration over the Senkakus. The Philippines has advocated for a strong U.S. role in resolving maritime disputes, with some officials suggesting the Mutual Defense Treaty should apply in disputes in Philippine-claimed waters of the South China Sea. The language of the treaty is not definitive on this issue. President Obama clarified the U.S. commitment to defend the Philippines under the Mutual Defense Treaty during a visit in April 2014. The treaty pledges mutual defense against external armed attacks, emphasizing the ironclad commitment to support the Philippines. The United States and the Philippines have strengthened their defense cooperation through the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), allowing for increased U.S. military presence in Philippine naval facilities. This agreement, signed in April 2014, enables U.S. military personnel to be deployed to the Philippines on a rotational basis for a period of 10 years. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) allows for increased U.S. military presence in the Philippines, supporting bilateral training and modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The U.S. has engaged in bilateral approaches with China, including military meetings under the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA) to discuss operational safety and freedom of navigation. The Obama Administration has expanded military engagement with the PLA, including participation in the 2014 U.S.-led RIMPAC maritime exercise. Some analysts see benefits in exposing the PLA to U.S. allied capabilities, while others worry about strengthening the PLA's warfighting capability. In recent years, disputants have explored various multilateral options to manage disputes, such as joint resource development and cooperation in non-sensitive areas. Proposals include joint management of hydrocarbon and fisheries resources to ease tensions. Another suggestion is to expand anti-piracy operations in regions like the Indian Ocean. Analysts have also recommended creating a regional coast guard forum and utilizing existing naval symposiums for building confidence and cooperation among disputants. Cooperating on maritime and legal issues through the Western Pacific Naval Symposium and the International Maritime Organization's Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. Emphasizing the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) and promoting naval cooperation in environmental protection, scientific research, and search and rescue operations. Deepening activities of ASEAN-centered bodies like the ASEAN Maritime Forum and maritime security dialogues under the ARF or the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM+). ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation for conflict-mediation. The ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, ratified by China in 2003 and signed by Secretary of State Clinton in 2009, offers conflict-mediation mechanisms through friendly negotiations. It includes a non-mandatory dispute settlement mechanism and allows for assistance from other parties if disputants do not wish to utilize it. Some suggest Indonesia or a nation outside the region could play a role in mediation. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea governs ocean activities comprehensively. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs maritime activities and territorial disputes in the oceans. The South China Sea disputants are parties to UNCLOS, with the exception of Cambodia and North Korea. The United States signed but has not ratified the convention, with discussions ongoing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2012. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the importance of U.S. navigational rights and challenging other countries' behavior. Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey highlighted the importance of the United States acceding to UNCLOS to strengthen its credibility in promoting freedom of navigation and peaceful resolutions of maritime disputes in critical areas like the South China Sea. Joining UNCLOS would provide legal certainty and enforceability in multilateral meetings across strategic regions.
