    "content": "The \"Hire a Hero Act\" allows for competitive grants to nonprofit organizations to help members and former members of the armed forces secure private sector employment. Congress finds that the unemployment rate among former military personnel who served in Iraq or Afghanistan is higher than the national average, and that career training programs have been successful in reducing this rate. It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should support private sector employment initiatives for military personnel. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau may award grants to nonprofit organizations to help National Guard members, Reserve members, and former Armed Forces personnel secure private sector employment. Grants will be awarded competitively and can be for one or more years. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau may award grants to nonprofit organizations for one or more years. The grants can be used for specific percentages of funds to be expended by certain dates. In awarding grants, consideration should be given to nonprofit organizations partnering with private sector entities in various industries where individuals with military experience would be beneficial. A nonprofit organization awarded a grant under subsection (c) can use it for operating expenses, job training, public information activities, and other activities as determined by the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. The Chief will also decide on the percentage of grant funds that can be used for salaries on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, the Chief will establish fiscal control, accountability, and program performance measures for these grants. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau will provide progress and annual reports to the congressional defense committees on the implementation and description of grants awarded under subsection (c). The term \"congressional defense committees\" is defined in section 101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code. $25,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 for the Department of Defense for operation and maintenance for the Army National Guard."
