    "content": "The Act titled \"Restricting Indian Gaming to Homelands of Tribes Act of 2006\" restricts off-reservation gaming. Section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is amended to allow newly recognized, restored, or landless Indian tribes to have lands taken in trust for gaming purposes, subject to certain criteria including approval by the Secretary and the Governor of the State. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows Indian tribes to mitigate the impact of gaming activities on county or parish infrastructure by negotiating a memorandum of understanding with the local government. If no agreement is reached within one year, either party can request the Secretary to intervene. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows tribes to host other tribes for gaming on their reservation land, as long as each invited tribe has no ownership in other gaming facilities on different Indian lands. This consolidation of gaming activities must be in accordance with Tribal-State compacts. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act allows tribes to host other tribes for gaming on their reservation land through leases, without Secretary approval. The invited tribes can establish their own lease terms, with payments to the host tribe not exceeding 40% of the net revenue. The invited Indian tribe has the sole responsibility for gaming conducted on leased land from a host tribe, with payments not exceeding 40% of net revenues. Gaming is considered to be conducted under the Act on Indian lands of the invited tribe within their jurisdiction. The gaming arrangement authorized for the invited Indian tribe must be within their jurisdiction and under their governmental power. However, gaming activities are not allowed on Indian lands in Arizona. Any gaming must comply with Tribal-State compacting laws and be approved by the state legislature. The invited Indian tribe must have their gaming arrangement approved by the Governor of the State where the gaming will take place. Host tribe compacts are not affected by the amendments. Indian tribes cannot conduct gaming outside of their residing State unless the Indian lands are contiguous to where the tribe primarily resides and governs. The statutory construction is outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by section 2 of the Act shall be applied prospectively and shall not affect existing compacts or agreements governing Indian gaming on Indian lands. There is an exception for lands where an Indian tribe submitted a fee-to-trust application before March 7, 2006, within the state where the tribe primarily resides. The amendments made by section 2 of the Act do not impact an Indian Tribe's right to conduct gaming on eligible Indian lands as determined by the National Indian Gaming Commission, Secretary of the Interior, or a Federal court prior to the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of the Interior must create regulations within 180 days to enforce section 20 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, requiring tribal applicants to have a historic connection to the gaming lands."
