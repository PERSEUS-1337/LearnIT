This includes amending certain sections and adding a new section 30 for the office. The Construction Safety, Health, and Education Improvement Act of 1997 establishes the Office of Construction Safety, Health, and Education within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Office is tasked with ensuring safe working conditions in construction work and duties include identifying high-risk employers, developing notification systems, and providing training for inspectors and personnel involved in construction safety and health. The Construction Safety, Health, and Education Improvement Act of 1997 establishes the Office of Construction Safety, Health, and Education within the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Office is responsible for establishing model compliance programs for construction safety and health standards, assisting in training programs, and establishing a toll-free line for reports and complaints. SEC. 31. CONSTRUCTION SAFETY AND HEALTH PLANS AND PROGRAMS are added to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to improve construction safety and health standards. The Secretary will require each construction project to have a project constructor responsible for safety and health plans. If there is one contractor, they will be the project constructor, otherwise, the construction owner will be unless they designate another entity. The Secretary will require a construction project to have a project constructor responsible for safety and health plans. The project constructor must develop and implement a written construction safety and health plan to protect employees against hazards. The plan should include a hazard analysis, construction process protocol, and assurance that each construction employer has a safety and health program coordinated with the plan. The construction safety and health plan must comply with the requirements and include regular worksite inspections, notification of hazardous conditions, and a method for responding to imminent dangers. The construction safety and health plan must include regular worksite inspections, notification of hazardous conditions, and a method for responding to imminent dangers. It should also ensure a competent person oversees safety implementation, coordinates activities among employers, and reviews/modifies the plan as new safety concerns arise. Copies of the plan must be provided to each construction employer before work begins. The Secretary may modify requirements for specific types of construction work or operations. The Secretary may modify safety requirements for specific construction operations based on the risks faced by employees. In emergency situations where immediate work is needed to prevent harm or property damage, notice must be given to the Secretary. Compliance with safety regulations can be made after the work is completed. The Secretary may modify safety requirements for specific construction operations based on risks faced by employees. Compliance with these requirements shall be made as soon as practicable thereafter. State construction safety and health plans under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 must be as effective as federal requirements for ensuring safe workplaces in the construction industry. Enforcement measures are also outlined in the Act. SEC. 5 amends the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to include citations for sections 5, 8, or 31. It also defines project constructors as employers. SEC. 6 adds a new section for reports to Congress in the Act. The Secretary will provide additional information on the construction industry in the annual report to the President, including details on the Office of Construction Safety, Health, and Education. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is further amended to include a new section on Federal construction contracts. The Secretary will deliver recommendations to Congress on legislative changes needed to consider safety records in awarding Federal construction contracts. Section 3 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is amended to define 'construction employer' as an employer primarily engaged in the building and construction industry, and 'construction owner' as a person with control over property. The term 'construction project' refers to construction work performed by one or more construction employers for a construction owner, as described in project documents. 'Construction work' includes activities like construction, alteration, demolition, or repair, but excludes work done under a contract between a construction employer and a homeowner. The term 'construction worksite' refers to a site within a construction project where construction work is performed by one or more construction employers. SEC. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING LAW AND REGULATIONS.\n\nThe amendments made by this Act and related regulations shall not limit or lessen the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Contract Work Hours Standards Act, or regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor. The presence of a project constructor or safety coordinator does not diminish construction employers' responsibilities for their employees' safety under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970."
