    "content": "Program eligibility requirements and payment limits are crucial for U.S. farm programs, determining who receives federal payments and how much. These requirements are debated for their impact on farm sizes and distribution of payments. Congressional interest is high due to regional and commodity differences, as well as the significant amount of annual payments involved. Annual U.S. farm program payments, including federal crop insurance subsidies, have averaged $17.5 billion per year. Payment limits and eligibility requirements vary by program and legal entity type. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Farm Service Agency oversees eligibility and payment limit determinations. Payment limits have evolved over time with changes in agriculture structure and policies. Congressional interest in farm program eligibility and payment limits is high due to regional and commodity differences. The eligibility requirements and payment limits for U.S. farm programs have evolved over time. Congressional debates have focused on attributing payments directly to individual recipients, capping payment amounts, and excluding high-income farmers from eligibility. These policy measures can impact farm management, crop choices, and farm size. The report discusses U.S. farm program eligibility requirements and payment limits, highlighting restrictions and factors affecting farmers' access to benefits. It covers various eligibility factors, legal entities participating in farm programs, participant identification, and citizenship requirements. The report does not provide a legal analysis or discuss the distribution of federal farm program payments. The curr_chunk discusses limiting requirements for farm program eligibility and payment limits, including participant identification, citizenship, \"actively engaged in farming\" definition, adjusted gross income limits, and conservation compliance. It also covers direct attribution of payments, annual payment limits for farm programs, and policy design issues. The report includes a history of annual payment limits for major commodity programs and a glossary of acronyms in the Appendix. The curr_chunk discusses farm program payment limits and eligibility requirements, including restrictions on benefits and limitations on program payments. The rules for program eligibility have evolved over time, with new methods like Adjusted Gross Income thresholds being used. The curr_chunk discusses cross-cutting eligibility requirements for farm programs, including participant identification, means tests, and conservation requirements. To be eligible for payments, individuals or legal entities must provide necessary information like names, addresses, and social security numbers or Taxpayer Identification Numbers. In joint entities, each person must have a TIN or EIN and declare their interest share using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. These forms need to be submitted once and kept current for any changes in the farming operation. Changes to a farming operation may involve expanding payment limitations, changing land rental status, purchasing additional base acres, or altering capital or equipment contributions. This information is crucial for determining active engagement in the farm operation. Different farm business entities are considered for farm program participation, including Sole Proprietorship or Family Farm. Each member must have a TIN or EIN and declare their interest share using USDA forms CCC-901 and CCC-902. Family farms or sole proprietorships comprised nearly 87% of U.S. farm operations in 2012. Joint operations and corporations are also considered for farm program participation, with each member being subject to individual payment limits. Joint operations do not require a common family relation, while corporations are treated as a single entity for eligibility and payment limit purposes. Payment limits apply to various types of entities in U.S. farm operations, with family-held operations making up the majority. Federal regulations also cover eligibility and payment limits for other types of recipients, such as spouses, minor children, and marketing cooperatives. These institutional arrangements represent a small share of U.S. farm operations. Special rules address eligibility and payment limits in the event of a previously eligible person's death. Eligibility for Title I commodity program benefits requires meeting specific criteria. To qualify for benefits in U.S. farm operations, participants must meet specific \"active participation\" requirements known as \"actively engaged in farming\" (AEF) criteria. These requirements apply to individuals and legal entities like partnerships or corporations. An individual producer must make a significant contribution to the farming operation in terms of capital, equipment, land, personal labor, and management. Their share of profits or losses should align with their contribution. In a general partnership, each partner must contribute active personal labor and/or management to the farming operation to meet AEF criteria. Contributions must be identifiable, documentable, and separate from other partners. Landowners can meet requirements by receiving income based on farm results without providing labor or management. In a corporation, each member must meet AEF criteria by contributing personal labor or active management to the farming operation, separate from other members. The collective contribution of all members must be significant and commensurate with the operation's needs. Failure to meet these criteria results in ineligibility for farm programs. Prior to the 2014 farm bill, the definition of active personal labor or management in corporations was broad, allowing passive activities to fulfill requirements. This raised concerns as passive investors could claim benefits without actively participating in the farming operation. The 2014 farm bill amended the criteria for farm program payments to address concerns about passive investors receiving benefits without actively contributing to the farming operation. The bill required more specificity on the role of nonfamily producers to qualify for benefits, limiting the number of nonfamily members who can qualify as farm managers based on farm size and complexity. Additional record-keeping requirements were also implemented for nonfamily members claiming active management status. Foreign individuals or entities must meet specific eligibility criteria for farm programs. Foreign individuals or entities can participate in most farm programs if they meet eligibility requirements, except for certain disaster assistance programs and the NAP. Foreign persons held 26.2 million acres of U.S. agricultural land as of 2013, accounting for 2% of privately held agricultural land. To be eligible for farm program benefits, foreign entities need a U.S. taxpayer ID and must be actively engaged in farming operations. Foreign individuals or entities can participate in most farm programs if they meet eligibility requirements, except for certain disaster assistance programs and the NAP. To be eligible for farm program benefits, foreign entities need a U.S. taxpayer ID and must be actively engaged in farming operations. Foreign corporations or entities without AEF criteria can receive payments based on U.S. shareholders or partners who meet the AEF criteria. There are no specific restrictions on foreign persons or entities for crop and livestock insurance premium subsidies. The dairy margin protection program does not have citizenship requirements for participation. The U.S. farm program allows foreign individuals or entities to participate if they meet eligibility requirements, except for certain disaster assistance programs and the NAP. Means testing based on average adjusted gross income (AGI) from the previous three years is used to determine eligibility for benefits. Recent farm bills have maintained the three-year average AGI as the income measure. The debate now focuses on which programs are covered by the means test and the appropriate income threshold. Most U.S. farms are taxed under individual income tax, with AGI measuring net income after expenses. Farm and nonfarm income are combined for federal income tax purposes for farm households, with most tax attributed to nonfarm income. Federal income tax paid by farm households is mainly attributed to nonfarm income. Farm operations often report operating losses for tax purposes due to various accounting practices. A significant number of farm sole proprietors reported net farm losses in recent years. Capital investment can be expensed in the first year, leading to large loss reporting. Program participants must annually consent to IRS verification for compliance with income limit provisions using a specific USDA form. Failure to comply results in ineligibility for program payments and refund requirements. The 2002 farm bill set an initial AGI threshold of $2.5 million for most farm programs, with an exemption if 75% of AGI was from farming. The 2008 farm bill replaced this with three separate AGI limits: $500,000 for non-farm AGI, $750,000 for direct payments, and $1 million for non-farm AGI (with an exclusion if 66.6% of AGI was farm-related income) for conservation benefits. Compliance with income limit provisions is verified annually by the IRS using a USDA form. Failure to comply results in ineligibility for program payments and refund requirements. The 2008 farm bill introduced a provision for married individuals filing joint tax returns to allocate AGI separately, potentially reducing the number of farms affected by the AGI cap. The 2014 farm bill set a total AGI limit of $900,000 for individuals and businesses, while retaining the provision for married couples. The payment for a general partnership or joint venture is reduced based on each individual's ownership share with an average AGI over $900,000. Conservation compliance, including sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, requires maintaining conservation on highly erodible land and not converting wetlands for USDA program benefits. Non-compliance can result in loss of farm program payments, loans, disaster assistance, and conservation programs. The 2014 farm bill extended conservation compliance to federal crop insurance premium subsidies, making it one of the only environmentally related requirements for program participation in U.S. farm policy. Legal entities receiving farm payments involve direct attribution, where payments flow down through various levels of ownership in single and multi-person entities. Direct attribution is crucial for tracking ownership shares in multi-person legal entities receiving farm payments. This process involves linking payments to individuals associated with specific farming operations, as mandated by the 2008 farm bill. Identification at the individual payment-recipient level is necessary to monitor payments against annual limits. The accumulation of an individual's payments from farming operations is subject to annual limits, tracked through levels of ownership in multi-person legal entities. If the payment limit is reached at the personal farming operation level, payments to lower-level entities are reduced accordingly. Eligibility criteria must be met for cumulative benefits across farm programs. Annual payment limits for certain farm programs, such as Title I commodity programs, have specific limits that individuals or legal entities can receive. These limits vary depending on the type of legal entity and may be subject to exceptions or expansions based on the number of participants. Payment limits have been in place since the 1970s and are not universal across all programs. Title I commodity program payment limits have evolved since 1970 and currently apply to programs like ARC, PLC, and Marketing Assistance Loan. Disaster assistance programs under Title I include ELAP, LFP, TAP, and Livestock Indemnity Program. The Farm Program benefits have annual limits for qualifying recipients under programs like LFP, TAP, LIP, and NAP. Exceeding the limits results in ineligibility for further benefits and a refund of any excess payments. Partnership payment limits are based on the number of owners, with the option to increase limits by adding new members. The payment limits for partnership or joint ventures are based on the number of owners meeting the AEF criteria and AGI limit. Adding new members to a corporation does not affect the payment limit but increases the number of members sharing it. Certain commodity program benefits are exempt from annual payment limits. The USDA offers exceptions to annual payment limits for certain programs, including marketing assistance loans and marketing loan gain benefits. One exception is when a farmer forfeits a pledged crop instead of repaying the loan in cash, allowing them to keep the value of the loan without paying interest. The USDA offers exceptions to annual payment limits for certain programs, including marketing assistance loans and marketing loan gain benefits. Farmers can choose to forfeit a pledged crop instead of repaying the loan in cash, keeping the loan value without paying interest. This option is beneficial when the market price for the crop is lower than the loan rate, resulting in a gain equivalent to a marketing loan gain or loan deficiency payment. This gain from forfeiting the crop does not count towards the payment limit of $125,000 per person, unlike a gain from repaying the loan with cash. Farmers decide whether to repay the loan with cash at the market price or forfeit the crop to retain any marketing loan gain or loan deficiency payment, depending on their circumstances. The USDA offers exceptions to payment limits for certain programs like marketing assistance loans. Farmers can choose to forfeit a crop instead of repaying the loan in cash, keeping the loan value without paying interest. This option is beneficial when the market price is lower than the loan rate, resulting in a gain equivalent to a marketing loan gain or loan deficiency payment. Farmers can also use commodity certificates to manage payment limits. Commodity certificates issued by the CCC can be used to pay off marketing assistance loans, accrue benefits, and avoid payment limits. They are purchased at the PCP or AWP for grains, oilseeds, rice, or upland cotton. Producers buy certificates at a discount to the loan rate and immediately return them to USDA to pay off the loan, re-acquiring the crop held as collateral. This benefits producers when the PCP or AWP is below the loan rate. Commodity certificates issued by the CCC allow producers to benefit from lower loan repayment rates when the PCP or AWP is below the loan rate. These certificates do not count against payment limits and were reinstated in 2015 after being eliminated in 2009. Payments received by qualifying individuals may exceed certain eligibility requirements. The provision allows for the transfer of ownership interest in farmland or agricultural commodities due to death, with the new owner becoming the successor to the previous owner's contract if all eligibility requirements are met. This also applies to ownership interest in a legal entity received through inheritance if the entity owned the land under a farm program contract at the time of the shareholder's death. The new owner's payment limit cannot exceed what the previous owner was entitled to, but it is in addition to their own farm operation's limit if all program and payment eligibility requirements are met. The provision allows for the transfer of ownership interest in farmland or agricultural commodities due to death, with the new owner becoming the successor to the previous owner's contract if all eligibility requirements are met. This provision applies for one program year for ARC and PLC, reflecting the commitment of resources by both farming operations without imposing unnecessary burdens on the inheritor. Additionally, federal farm support programs like the Title I sugar program are not subject to annual payment limits. The U.S. sugar program indirectly supports market prices by limiting sugar supply without budgetary restrictions. Sugar processors do not need to be U.S. citizens, but the sugar must be of U.S. origin. The dairy program includes the margin protection program for dairy producers, offering premium subsidies and indemnity-like payments. Premiums for the program are set in statute, making the subsidy implicit. The subsidy for crop and livestock insurance premium subsidies and indemnity payments is implicit, with no limit on participation levels. Producers must meet eligibility criteria to purchase insurance coverage, with premium subsidies and indemnity payments not subject to payment limits. Indemnity payments under crop insurance are not subject to payment limits, based on market prices and competitive conditions. Tighter payment limits would lead to more farming decisions based on market conditions rather than policy choices. Supporters of payment limits argue that large payments lead to farm consolidation, higher land prices, and disadvantage smaller family farms and new farmers. Tighter payment limits could indirectly benefit smaller farms by reducing incentives to expand, potentially lowering land prices. Large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. Advocates for limits include urban lawmakers, smaller farms, and social interest groups. Critics argue that all farms need support, especially during market price declines, and larger farms should not be penalized for their efficiencies. Farm payments help U.S. agriculture compete globally and income testing conflicts with federal policies. Concerns include payment-limit issues and eligibility requirements. A large portion of money goes to a small percentage of large operators, raising questions about who should benefit from government support. The current system of farm program payments raises concerns about equity and fairness, favoring large operations over small ones. Critics argue that payment limits are really about farm size, while supporters claim that larger farms are more efficient. Tightening payment limits could have varying effects across crops and regions, impacting U.S. competitiveness in international markets. Tighter payment limits may disproportionately affect crops with higher production value like rice, peanuts, and cotton in regions such as the Southeast, Mississippi Delta, and Western states. This could have a greater economic impact in rural, agriculture-based counties where agricultural production plays a significant role in the local economy. Under the 2008 farm bill, the annual limit on payments for Title I commodity programs attributable to a person was split into two components: a $40,000 limit. The 2014 farm bill established a single aggregate limit of $125,000 for combined annual payments under the LDP and MLG benefits of the marketing assistance loan program and the PLC and ARC programs. This significantly expanded individual limits for producers who primarily rely on either PLC or ARC programs for support. The 2014 farm bill increased the annual payment limit for PLC payments to $125,000, favoring specific crops and programs. There is potential for unlimited USDA farm support through MAL commodity certificate exchange and forfeiture options, creating an equity issue for producers with hard caps on ARC and PLC payments compared to those with access to MAL options. The 2014 farm bill increased payment limits for specific crops and programs, potentially leading to challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. Changes in eligibility requirements or payment limits may prompt producers to adjust their behavior to optimize revenue under new policy and market conditions. This could involve reorganizing farm operations, changing crop choices, or adjusting marketing practices to take advantage of payment limit exemptions. The 2014 farm bill increased payment limits for specific crops and programs, potentially leading to challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. Producers may adjust their behavior to optimize revenue under new policy and market conditions, such as changing crop choices or reorganizing farm operations. Payment limits applied per unit or base acre offer an alternative to per-person limits, with a reduction factor like the 85% reduction in base acre payments under PLC or ARC programs. This reduction factor is applied uniformly across all program payments for cost-saving reasons. The 2014 farm bill increased payment limits for specific crops and programs, potentially leading to challenges under the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. Analysis by USDA (2016) found that consolidating separate AGI farm and non-farm limits into a single AGI limit with a higher bound has restored eligibility for some farm operations previously disqualified from receiving farm program payments. Other major exemptions from the AGI limit include state and local governments, federally recognized Indian tribes, and CRP contracts entered into prior to October 1, 2008. The 2014 farm bill shifted focus to crop insurance programs, not subject to the AGI cap. Federal crop insurance subsidies averaged $6.8 billion annually from 2011-2015. Extending the AGI cap to crop insurance subsidies was debated, but concerns were raised about potential negative impacts on program participation. USDA estimates that less than 0.5% of farms and 1% of premiums would be affected by a $900,000 income cap on crop insurance participation."
