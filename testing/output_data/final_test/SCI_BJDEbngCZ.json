    "content": "Direct policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning and continuous control problems are popular due to their ease of implementation without explicit knowledge of the underlying model, their \"end-to-end\" approach optimizing the performance metric directly, and their ability to handle richly parameterized policies. Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that policy gradient methods can efficiently solve complex control problems without the need for explicit model knowledge. These methods globally converge to optimal solutions and have polynomial sample and computational complexities, bridging the gap between traditional optimal control theory and data-driven approaches. Deep reinforcement learning is popular for tackling sequential decision making problems, ranging from robotic hand manipulation to game playing. While these methods lack theoretical understanding of efficiency, control theory offers tools with provable guarantees for continuous control problems. This work bridges optimal control theory and sample-based reinforcement learning methods using ideas from mathematical optimization. The objective is to find the control input that minimizes long-term cost in continuous control problems. In practice, the linearized control problem approximates dynamics and costs with quadratic functions. This work focuses on the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, aiming to minimize long-term costs in continuous control. The importance of randomization for analyzing direct methods in optimal control theory is discussed. Planning with a known model involves solving the algebraic Riccati equation for a positive definite matrix P to determine the optimal cost. There are algebraic solution methods and convex SDP formulations to find P. The text discusses the limitations of convex formulations for planning, particularly in the model-free setting where direct policy parameterization is not clear. It introduces a non-convex approach that utilizes local search methods to find the globally optimal policy, providing rigorous guarantees. This work introduces a non-convex approach using local search methods to find the globally optimal policy in both exact and model-free cases, ensuring provable convergence with efficient computational and sample complexities. It also discusses the effectiveness of natural policy gradient methods in policy optimization. The natural gradient method is proven to have a considerably improved convergence rate over its naive gradient counterpart. This work merges ideas from optimal control theory, mathematical optimization, and sample-based reinforcement learning methods to potentially enhance existing algorithms and address issues like variance reduction. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns to act through interactions with the environment. Solution concepts are divided into model-based and model-free approaches. Model-based learning involves learning the dynamics of the system and planning for control synthesis. BID14 provides a provable learning result for LQRs, showing near-optimal policy quality. BID0 and BID10 offer efficient learning results in a regret context, with BID10 focusing on system identification and robust control synthesis. The approach is statistically efficient and works with a finite horizon, requiring only controllability of the plant. Model-free learning approaches for optimal controllers are not well understood theoretically. BID7 provides an asymptotic learnability result using Q-learning. This work focuses on characterizing the behavior of policy gradient methods with linearly parameterized policies. The text discusses gradient methods with linearly parameterized policies for optimal controllers. It explores the importance of randomization in analyzing gradient methods and provides update rules for gradient descent. The policy gradient expression and state correlation matrix are also defined. The text introduces the REINFORCE algorithm for policy gradient methods, utilizing Monte Carlo estimates and the natural policy gradient update rule. It also mentions successful related approaches and a special case using a linear policy with additive Gaussian noise. The case discussed involves a linear policy with additive Gaussian noise, utilizing the natural policy gradient. The Fisher matrix has a block diagonal form for diagonal noise. Zeroth order optimization is a generic procedure for optimizing a function without explicit access to gradients. The generic approach for optimization involves defining a perturbed function and using Gaussian smoothing to simplify the gradient calculation. Non-convexity is highlighted as a challenge in optimization problems, with a specific example provided in Section B. For non-convex optimization problems, gradient descent may not converge to the global optima. In the case of LQRs, a corollary provides a characterization of stationary points. Using a distribution over starting points ensures full rank, guaranteeing global optima. Gradient domination is a key concept in non-convex optimization literature. Gradient domination is crucial in non-convex optimization, ensuring that if the gradient is small at a point, the function value will be close to the optimal value. Despite this, characterizing the smoothness properties of the function can be challenging, impacting the convergence of gradient descent. The curr_chunk discusses the implications of C(K) being a smooth function on global convergence and convergence rate in mathematical optimization. Exact gradient methods are analyzed, leading to considerations of simulation-based, model-free methods with zeroth-order optimization. Notations and three exact update rules are defined, including natural policy gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, and Kn. The natural policy gradient descent direction is consistent with the stochastic case. The policy iteration algorithm is a special case of the Gauss-Newton method when \u03b7 = 1. The Gauss-Newton method requires access to \u2207C(K), \u03a3 K , and R+B P K B for implementation and has the strongest convergence rate guarantee. Gradient descent requires access to only \u2207C(K) and has the slowest convergence rate. The natural policy gradient requires access to \u2207C(K) and \u03a3 K , with a convergence rate between the other two methods. Global convergence of gradient methods is discussed for different step sizes. The Gauss-Newton algorithm with stepsize \u03b7 = 1 has a performance bound. The natural policy gradient descent with stepsize \u03b7 also has a performance bound. The Model-Free Policy Gradient Estimation algorithm samples policies and simulates trajectories to estimate costs and states. In comparison to model-based approaches, gradient descent enjoys performance bounds with an appropriate stepsize. The controller in the model-free setting has only simulation access to unknown model parameters. Policy gradient methods also lead to globally optimal policies with polynomial computational and sample complexities. Algorithm 1 provides a procedure for finding estimates of \u2207C(K) and \u03a3 K, which are used in policy gradient updates. The choice between zeroth-order optimization and REINFORCE is primarily technical, with REINFORCE potentially having lower variance. Theorem 6 discusses global convergence in the model-free setting under certain conditions. The work provides guarantees for model-based and model-free policy gradient methods to converge to the globally optimal solution with finite computational and sample complexity. The work provides guarantees for policy gradient methods to converge to the globally optimal solution with finite computational and sample complexity, including extensions to noisy and finite horizon cases. Future work includes addressing the assumption of finite C(K 0 ) and exploring variance reduction techniques. An interesting future direction in the field is how to combine variance reduction methods and model-based methods to decrease sample size. The Gauss-Newton algorithm has shown improvement over the natural policy gradient method, raising questions on constructing a sample-based estimator and extending the method to handle non-linear parametric policies. Additionally, robust control in model-based approaches and understanding robustness in a model-free setting are important areas of research. The section also briefly covers parameterizations and solution methods for classic LQR and related problems in control theory, particularly focusing on the finite horizon case. In control theory, the finite horizon LQR problem can be approached as a dynamic program or a linearly-constrained Quadratic Program. The problem size grows with the horizon, but the special structure due to linear dynamics allows for simplifications. The Lagrange multipliers can be interpreted as \"co-state\" variables, following a recursion known as the \"adjoint system\". This approach is equivalent to solving the Riccati equation using Lagrange duality. The LQR approach in control theory involves solving the Riccati recursion using Lagrange duality. The receding horizon LQR is commonly used in practice, where an input sequence is optimized for a T-step ahead cost. The infinite horizon LQR solution can be found by solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation. The main computational step in solving the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) involves various approaches, such as recursion, eigenvalue decomposition, and direct computation of control input. Different methods, including gradient updates and iterative computation of feedback gain, have been explored in the optimal control literature. The LQR problem can be expressed as a semidefinite program (SDP) with variable P, derived by relaxing the equality in the Riccati equation to an inequality. The optimal solution of this SDP is the unique positive semidefinite solution to the Riccati equation, providing the optimal policy. The feasible set of the SDP for the Riccati equation is not a convex characterization of stabilizing policies K. This nonconvex formulation hinders the use of local search methods for parametrizing the space of policies K. The set of 3x3 identity matrices A and B are used to analyze convergence rates of gradient-based methods for policy gradients in Markov decision processes. Lemmas are provided to aid in the analysis, defining value functions and advantages in the cost of policies. The advantage represents the cost change from a state x with a one-step policy deviation. Lemma 7 states the cost difference lemma for Markov decision processes, showing the advantage of a policy deviation. It is useful in proving that C(K) is gradient dominated. Lemma 8 discusses gradient domination in optimal policies, providing equations for cost bounds. Lemma 9 discusses the concept of \"almost\" smoothness in functions, relating it to the smoothness of gradients. The challenge in the proof lies in quantifying the lower order terms in the argument for gradient descent. Lemma 9 discusses \"almost\" smoothness in functions and the smoothness of gradients. The proof involves quantifying lower order terms in the argument for gradient descent. Lemma 10 provides spectral norm bounds on P K and \u03a3 K. Lemma 11 bounds the one-step progress of Gauss-Newton. The convergence rate of the Gauss Newton algorithm is proven using these lemmas. Theorem 5 shows that \u03b7 = 1 leads to a contraction of 1 - \u03b7\u00b5 \u03a3 K * at every step. Lemma 12 bounds the one-step progress of the natural policy gradient. The proof of the natural policy gradient convergence rate involves bounding terms and applying Lemmas 10 and 12. Lemma 13 pertains to \u03a3 K perturbation and is proven by induction. The proof involves defining linear operators on symmetric matrices and bounding terms using Lemmas 10 and 12. Lemma 15 relates to the operator T K when (A - BK) has a spectral radius smaller than 1. Lemma 15 discusses the operator T K when (A - BK) has a spectral radius smaller than 1. It is proven that T K is well defined and is the solution of a certain equation. Lemma 16 provides perturbation bounds and proves a main inequality using operator norms. The proof is completed by applying these Lemmas.

Lemma 16 provides perturbation bounds and proves a main inequality using operator norms. The proof is completed by applying these Lemmas. Lemma 17 shows T K F K \u2212 F K \u2264 1/2, which is the desired condition. Lemmas 10, 16, and 14 are used to bound the one step progress of gradient descent. Lemma 18 and 19 provide convergence rate bounds for gradient descent. The proof of the gradient descent convergence rate relies on Lemmas 8, 10, 18, and 19. By choosing appropriate parameters, progress is made at each step, ensuring that the cost decreases. Techniques from zeroth order optimization enable the algorithm to operate in a model-free setting with only black-box information. Zeroth order optimization allows the algorithm to run in a model-free setting with black-box access to a simulator. The section discusses approximating infinite horizon with finite horizon and bounding C(K) and \u03a3(K) with desired accuracy. Lemma 20 proves a bound on \u03a3 K using operators T K and F K. Lemma 21 shows that small perturbations to the policy K result in approximate preservation of the function value and its gradient. This is proven by bounding the difference between T(K)F(K) and F(K) with a small perturbation. The proof of gradient stability after perturbation is completed by combining two terms. Lemma 22 shows that the gradient remains stable even with perturbations. The smoothing procedure is analyzed, and Gaussian smoothing is not feasible due to the objective function not being finite for every K. Smoothing in a ball is suggested to avoid this issue. The algorithm uses sets representing points on a sphere, with norm r and norm at most r. Gradient descent is performed on a function, and the gradient of C r (K) can be estimated using an oracle for function value. The lemma shows that a polynomial number of samples can approximate the gradient. The lemma demonstrates that a polynomial number of samples can approximate the gradient of C r (K) using sets representing points on a sphere with norm r. The proof breaks down into more terms, ensuring each term is bounded. By using Vector Bernstein's inequality, it is shown that the difference between gradients is small with high probability. Fixed polynomials exist for gradient descent steps, ensuring a decrease in cost function with high probability. The lemma before the theorem on natural gradient estimation shows how variance can be estimated. Theorem for natural gradient proven, lemma shows accurate variance estimation.
