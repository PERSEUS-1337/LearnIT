The text chunk \"SEC. 4. FLOOD CONTROL AND FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT POLICIES.\" is a concise statement regarding flood control and floodplain management policies. The Secretary of the Army will conduct studies to assess national flood control and floodplain management policies. The studies will identify critical public facilities facing flood risks, prioritize facilities needing additional flood protection, and evaluate current floodplain management requirements to reduce potential losses caused by flooding. The Secretary of the Army will conduct studies to assess national flood control and floodplain management policies, including evaluating existing policies on nonstructural flood control measures, identifying incentives for environmental restoration, examining differences in Federal cost-sharing for flood control projects, and assessing current policies on pre-event repair and maintenance of levees.
