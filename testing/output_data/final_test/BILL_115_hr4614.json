The \"Nuclear Powers America Act of 2017\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include qualified nuclear energy property for a 30-percent credit, applicable to property placed in service before January 1, 2024. The \"Nuclear Powers America Act of 2017\" introduces a 30-percent credit for qualified nuclear energy property, defined as expenses for refueling and other expenditures related to a qualifying nuclear power plant that applied for license renewal before January 1, 2024. The \"Nuclear Powers America Act of 2017\" offers a 30% credit for qualified nuclear energy property expenses related to a qualifying nuclear power plant applying for license renewal before January 1, 2024. The cumulative amounts paid during the taxable year for a qualifying nuclear power plant are treated as the basis of the qualified nuclear energy property placed in service for that year. The qualified nuclear energy property expenses for a qualifying nuclear power plant are treated as placed in service on the last day of the taxable year in which the taxpayer pays or incurs such amounts. Regulations will provide for recapturing the credit if a qualifying nuclear power plant does not file for license renewal. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must receive license renewal applications by January 1, 2024. The 30-percent credit rate for nuclear energy property will phase out, with percentages decreasing for property placed in service after specific dates. The last sentence of section 48(a)(3) is amended by inserting \"or 45J\" after \"section 45\". Section 48 of the Code is amended to include a special rule for qualified nuclear energy property for public entities. The subsection defines a \"qualified public entity\" as a government entity, mutual electric company, or not-for-profit electric utility for tax credit purposes. The term 'eligible project partner' refers to individuals responsible for operating, maintaining, or repairing a qualifying nuclear power plant, as well as those involved in providing the nuclear steam supply system to the plant. The provision of nuclear fuel to a qualifying nuclear power plant or ownership interest in the facility qualifies for a tax credit. Special rules apply to partnerships where a qualified public entity is treated as the taxpayer for their share of the credit related to qualified nuclear energy property. The tax credit for nuclear energy property applies to partnerships with a qualified public entity as the taxpayer. The credit is taken into account in the first taxable year of the eligible project partner after the qualified public entity's taxable year. The tax credit for nuclear energy property applies to partnerships with a qualified public entity as the taxpayer. Income derived from an election under section 48(e) by an eligible project partner will not be considered as private business use. For mutual or cooperative electric companies, income from such elections will be treated as funds collected from members for covering losses and expenses. The tax credit for nuclear energy property is amended to include paragraphs (6) and (7) in Section 48(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments will apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2016, under similar rules as section 48(m) of the Code."
