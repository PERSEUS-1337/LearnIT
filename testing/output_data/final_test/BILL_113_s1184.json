    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2013\". Congress finds that obesity is prevalent among adults aged 65 and over, increasing the risk of chronic diseases and conditions. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries have multiple chronic conditions, with obesity rates doubling from 1987 to 2002. Obese individuals at age 65 have reduced life expectancy, and the cost of obesity exceeds $450 billion annually. The prevalence of obesity among older Americans is increasing at a linear rate. If left unchanged, nearly half of the elderly population will be obese in 2030, costing $450 billion annually. An obese Medicare beneficiary costs $1,964 more than a normal-weight beneficiary. The Medicare and You Handbook will now include information on the coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity, including details on eligible providers. The amendments apply to notices distributed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is given authority to coordinate programs for preventing and treating obesity, as well as expanding coverage options for obesity under Medicare. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is mandated to develop a plan to coordinate efforts across various departments to address obesity in adults, with annual updates required. The Secretary will collaborate with expert representatives to develop a plan to treat and reduce overweight and obesity, ensuring coordination with the National Prevention Strategy. The plan includes actions related to the treatment and reduction of overweight and obesity in the United States, identification of best practices, collaboration with various entities to evaluate interventions, and research initiatives using tools like the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The plan includes recommendations for coordinating budgets, grant programs, and policies across Federal agencies to address overweight and obesity. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report summarizing interagency efforts and providing a detailed strategic plan with recommendations for each office and agency involved. The annual report evaluates coordinated interventions, health outcomes, milestones, and strategic plan goals. Recommendations are made for updating the plan based on data and findings from the previous year. SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS QUALIFIED TO FURNISH INTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. The Social Security Act is amended to allow coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity by various healthcare providers, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical psychologists, and registered dietitians. The Social Security Act is amended to allow coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity by healthcare providers in specified settings or through certified lifestyle counseling programs. Coordination with referring physicians or primary care practitioners is required for collaborative efforts in treatment planning. The Social Security Act is amended to include Medicare Part D coverage for obesity medication, with specific criteria for eligibility. The amendment will take effect two years after the enactment of the Act."
