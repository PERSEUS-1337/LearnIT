    "content": "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) regulates employer pension and welfare benefit plans, requiring compliance with its provisions if such benefits are offered. ERISA aims to standardize regulations and preempts conflicting state laws. Sections 502(a) and 514(a) are key provisions, with 514(a) preempting state laws related to benefit plans and 502(a) allowing civil actions for benefit recovery and enforcement. ERISA regulates employee benefit plans offered by employers for medical, surgical, disability, and health insurance benefits, including managed care to control costs and improve health. Managed care involves coordinating health services through case management and utilization review. Participants can seek equitable relief under section 502(a) to enforce or clarify their rights under the plan. Utilization review involves evaluating information to determine medical care needs, including pre-certification and concurrent review. It is commonly used by health maintenance organizations (HMOs) to manage healthcare benefits. HMOs accept financial risk for defined benefits in exchange for a fixed premium. HMOs require healthcare to be received through providers employed by or affiliated with the HMO, favored for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Concerns over utilization review techniques and healthcare quality have led to litigation, with some federal courts applying ERISA preemption to state tort claims. This has impacted plaintiffs' ability to recover various types of claims. ERISA's preemption provisions have impacted plaintiffs by limiting their ability to recover various damages under state law. The U.S. Supreme Court has addressed the scope of ERISA's preemption clause, which explicitly preempts any state law related to an employee benefit plan. This has led to restrictions on the types of damages plaintiffs can recover in state tort actions. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted ERISA's preemption clause broadly, stating that state laws can be preempted if they have a connection to an employee benefit plan. The Court's decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co. marked a shift in its interpretation of ERISA's preemption clause. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted ERISA's preemption clause broadly, stating that state laws can be preempted if they have a connection to an employee benefit plan. In recent cases, the Court has recognized states' ability to regulate health and safety matters, concluding that state laws of general applicability are not necessarily preempted by ERISA. Section 502(a) of ERISA identifies how a participant or beneficiary may recover benefits or enforce rights under a plan. Under the doctrine of complete preemption, state claims conflicting with federal statutory schemes in ERISA can be removed to federal court. In cases like Pilot Life Insurance Co. v. Dedeaux and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor, the Supreme Court found that ERISA preempted state common law causes of actions related to employee benefit plans. The Supreme Court found in Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor that state law claims concerning benefit plans governed by ERISA are removable to federal court, limiting remedies to those provided under ERISA rather than state law. The procedure for removal is governed by FRCP \u00a71441(a). The plaintiff can choose whether a case is heard in state or federal court based on the \"well-pleaded complaint rule.\" A state claim can be moved to federal court under complete preemption. This is significant in liability cases against HMOs governed by ERISA. In cases involving medical malpractice, wrongful death, personal injury, and vicarious liability, the defendant may move the case from state to federal court, arguing that state law claims are preempted by ERISA. The federal court must first determine jurisdiction before considering dismissal of state liability claims. The court will assess if the plan is governed by ERISA and if state law claims are preempted. In Corcoran v. United Healthcare, Inc., a patient sued her employee disability plan for wrongful death and emotional distress after her unborn child died. The patient's doctor recommended hospitalization for monitoring the fetus, but United denied the request for a hospital stay, leading to the fetus's distress and death. The Corcorans sued United Healthcare after their unborn child died due to the denial of a hospital stay. The case was removed to federal court, where the district court dismissed the state tort claims, citing ERISA preemption. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit considered whether state law allowed a negligence suit for wrongful death against a third party. The court considered the possibility of a negligence suit against a third party provider of utilization review services for wrongful death. It found that ERISA preempts state laws related to ERISA plans, including negligence causes of action. The court ruled that United's decision on benefits under the health plan was considered medical advice within the context of ERISA, preempting the Corcorans' claim. They argued for extracontractual damages under ERISA, but the court rejected this, stating that only \"other appropriate equitable relief\" is allowed under section 502(a)(3). The court rejected the argument for extracontractual damages under ERISA in the Corcoran case, stating that benefit plans are guided by trust and contract law. Similar lawsuits alleging malpractice have been filed against HMOs and managed care plans. Some federal circuit courts have found no ERISA preemption, while others have found preemption. In Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., the court held that ERISA does not completely preempt state tort claims for negligence. The plaintiffs alleged negligence and medical malpractice by their HMO physicians, leading to the husband's death and the daughter being stillborn. They sued the HMO and its doctors for failing to conduct timely tests and ignoring symptoms. The plaintiffs claimed the HMO should be held liable under ostensible and actual agency theories, as well as direct negligence for negligence in selecting, training, and monitoring physicians. The plaintiffs alleged negligence and medical malpractice by their HMO physicians, leading to the husband's death and the daughter being stillborn. They sued the HMO and its doctors for failing to conduct timely tests and ignoring symptoms. The defendants removed both cases to federal court on the grounds of ERISA jurisdiction. The court clarified that ERISA preempts only state laws related to benefits under the plan. The plaintiffs argued their claims were outside ERISA's provisions, focusing on membership benefits rather than contesting membership. U.S. Healthcare argued that benefits included medical care received. The court agreed with U.S. Healthcare that the benefit to plan participants includes medical care, as well as membership in the HMO. The plaintiffs' claims were not preempted by ERISA as they were about the low quality of medical treatment received, not the failure to provide benefits due under the plan. The court in Dukes distinguished its decision from Corcoran by noting that the doctors in Dukes were employed by the HMO to provide medical care, unlike in Corcoran where they were third-party consultants. Claims based on administration of a benefits plan would be preempted by ERISA, while claims on the quality of care or medical treatment provided would not be preempted under section 502(a)(1)(B). The Third Circuit followed this reasoning in Bauman v U.S. Healthcare. In Bauman v U.S. Healthcare, the plaintiffs sued their doctor, hospital, and health plan after their daughter died. The daughter fell ill the day after being discharged from the hospital, and despite contacting the doctor and requesting a home visit, no action was taken. The daughter died from an infection that developed into meningitis. The plaintiffs alleged that the health plan was directly liable for the premature discharge and vicariously liable for the negligence of its agents. The Baumans sued the health plan for negligence in providing care to their daughter. The plan was alleged to be vicariously liable for its agents' negligence. The case was removed to federal court but remanded back to state court by the Third Circuit, as the claims dealt with the quality of care, not quantity, and were not fully preempted by ERISA. The court found that the Baumans' claims were distinguishable from ERISA preemption because they focused on the quality of care provided, not on benefits under the plan. Count Six, regarding the failure to provide an in-home visit, was viewed as a state cause of action for violating a tort duty to provide adequate medical care. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Pacificare of Oklahoma, Inc. v. Burrage considered whether ERISA preempts a claim of vicarious liability for malpractice by an HMO physician based on quality of care. The court held that ERISA does not preempt such a claim as it does not involve the delivery of benefits under the plan. As long as a state law does not affect the structure, administration, or benefits provided by an ERISA plan, it may have some economic impact without being invalidated. Other federal courts have reached different conclusions on state claims related to ERISA plans. Other federal courts have reached different conclusions on state claims related to ERISA plans. The First Circuit recently held that ERISA preempts a state action for \"negligent medical decisionmaking in the course of a precertification requirement ...mandated by an [ERISA plan].\" In a Seventh Circuit case, Jass v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., the court concluded that the plaintiff's vicarious liability claims against the HMO based on the negligence of the plaintiff's doctor were preempted by ERISA. The decision in Jass may be distinguished from Burrage because in Burrage, \"the issue of the doctor's negligence can be resolved without reference to the benefit plan.\" In Pegram v. Herdrich, Cynthia Herdrich alleged that her HMO's provision of medical services under terms that rewarded physicians for limiting medical care entailed an anticipatory breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA. Herdrich argued that the terms created an incentive to make decisions in the physicians' self-interest rather than the plan participants' exclusive interest. Dr. Pegram examined Herdrich after she experienced pain in her groin, but did not order an immediate ultrasound despite finding an inflamed mass in her abdomen. The HMO's provision of medical services led to Cynthia Herdrich's appendix rupturing and suffering peritonitis. ERISA requires fiduciaries to act in the best interest of participants and beneficiaries. The District Court dismissed Herdrich's claim, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disagreed, stating that the HMO did act as an ERISA fiduciary. The Seventh Circuit ruled that an incentive program may breach fiduciary duty if physicians delay treatment for bonuses. The Supreme Court clarified that HMOs are not fiduciaries when physicians make mixed eligibility and treatment decisions. The Court determined that HMO physicians do not qualify as fiduciaries when making mixed eligibility and treatment decisions, as they do not solely act in the participant's best interest. Recognizing such decisions as fiduciary could lead to for-profit HMOs being eliminated, with claims resembling malpractice rather than fiduciary breaches. The Court concluded that ERISA was not intended to create a federal fiduciary claim applying the same standard as state malpractice law. States have enacted statutes providing a cause of action for harm caused by managed care entities' failure to adhere to a duty of care, imposing a specific duty on these entities. Health insurance carriers in certain states have a duty of care, and if breached, participants can take legal action. The Texas Health Care Liability Act regulates managed care by providing a cause of action for negligence, establishing a review process for treatment decisions, and protecting physicians from HMO influence. The Texas Health Care Liability Act regulates managed care by providing a cause of action for negligence, establishing a review process for treatment decisions, and protecting physicians from HMO influence. Aetna challenged the act on ERISA preemption grounds, but the Fifth Circuit determined that certain provisions are not preempted. The liability, anti-indemnification, and anti-retaliation provisions are not preempted, but the independent review provisions are. The liability provisions impose liability for a limited universe of events, excluding claims based on denial of coverage by managed care entities. The Fifth Circuit ruled that claims involving coverage decisions in a plan are not preempted by ERISA. They allowed claims for negligent medical services and vicarious liability on managed care entities. The court stated that vicarious liability does not impact ERISA plans and that ERISA does not override state regulation of medical practice quality. The act's anti-indemnification and anti-retaliation provisions prohibit certain clauses in contracts with healthcare providers. The Fifth Circuit upheld anti-indemnification and anti-retaliation provisions that prevent a healthcare entity from refusing to renew a doctor advocating necessary treatment. These provisions do not mandate ERISA plan benefits structure and preserve a physician's independent judgment. The court found that these provisions align with the allowance of states to impose malpractice liability on HMOs for providing incentives. The Fifth Circuit ruled that independent review provisions attempting to impose a state administrative regime on coverage determinations are preempted by ERISA. These provisions establish an alternate mechanism for obtaining benefits under a plan, allowing participants to bypass ERISA's civil enforcement procedures. The Seventh Circuit upheld an Illinois external review statute, stating it was not in conflict with ERISA and was saved from preemption. The statute related to an employee benefit plan, regulated insurance, and applied to an insured plan offered by Rush Prudential HMO. Unlike the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit found the statute did not create conflicts with ERISA. The Seventh Circuit upheld the Illinois external review statute, stating it did not conflict with ERISA. The statute required an HMO to provide a covered service if deemed medically necessary by an independent reviewing physician. This procedure was not considered an alternative remedy under ERISA but rather an internal mechanism for decision-making. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision on appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit's decision on the Illinois external review statute, stating it regulated the business of insurance and was saved from preemption under ERISA's savings clause and the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The Court applied a multi-factor test to determine the statute's applicability to the insurance industry. The Illinois statute may be saved from preemption if it transfers risk, is integral to the insurer-insured relationship, or is limited to the insurance industry. The Court found the second and third factors satisfied, indicating potential protection under McCarran-Ferguson. Rush argued for preemption based on Congressional intent overriding ERISA's savings clause, citing similarities to preempted claims in Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux. The Court found that the Illinois statute was not preempted by ERISA, as it did not provide a new cause of action or new form of relief. Rush's argument that the state scheme conflicted with Congress' intent was dismissed, as the Court determined it was more akin to a \"mandate for a second opinion\" rather than arbitration. In Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, participants in ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans sued plan administrators for not providing coverage for recommended treatment. The cases were removed to federal district court, arguing the respondents' causes of action were not preempted by ERISA. In Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, participants in ERISA-regulated employee benefit plans sued plan administrators for not providing coverage for recommended treatment. The district court agreed that the claims were preempted by ERISA, but the Fifth Circuit disagreed, stating that the claims were not preempted. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the claims were completely preempted by ERISA and should be removed to federal court. The Court clarified that if a suit involves a denial of coverage based on an ERISA-regulated employee benefit plan without violating any other legal duty, it falls under section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. In Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, the Court found that the duty imposed by the THCLA on managed care entities to \"exercise ordinary care when making health care treatment decisions\" did not arise independent of ERISA or the plan terms in the respondents' cases. The respondents brought suit to rectify a wrongful denial of benefits promised under ERISA-regulated plans, falling within the scope of section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, completely preempted, and removable to federal court."
