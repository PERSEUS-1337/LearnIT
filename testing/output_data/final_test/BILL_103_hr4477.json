They believe more funds should be allocated to facilities benefiting nontrailerable vessels. The purpose of this section is to provide funds to states for developing public facilities for transient nontrailerable vessels. Within 18 months of enactment, states can submit a survey to the Secretary of the Interior identifying public facilities for nontrailerable vessels and areas of operation. Within 6 months of the survey, states can develop a plan for construction and renovation of these facilities. The Secretary of the Interior may provide matching grants for this purpose. The Secretary of the Interior may provide matching grants to states for constructing or renovating public facilities for transient nontrailerable vessels, prioritizing projects submitted by states in accordance with a plan.
