The District of Columbia has a substantial structural imbalance, ranging from $470,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 annually, caused by mandates and requirements imposed by the Federal Government, as highlighted in various reports. The District of Columbia faces a significant structural deficit due to Federal mandates, including tax exemptions and requirements to provide services. Despite having one of the highest tax burdens in the nation, the funding generated is insufficient to meet the District's obligations. The District of Columbia faces a structural deficit due to Federal mandates, leading to high debt levels and the need for continuous borrowing to fund critical infrastructure projects. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) emphasized the necessity for greater management efficiency in the District government. The GAO recommended against raising taxes or cutting services in the District of Columbia due to potential negative impacts on the economy. They suggested changing Federal procedures to expand the tax base or providing additional financial support to help maintain fiscal balance. The District of Columbia has had a balanced budget with surpluses for 7 years, but severe fiscal problems are inevitable due to spending pressures and structural imbalance. Financial stability requires a stable, predictable revenue source that increases modestly over time. This Act aims to transfer revenue from the Federal Government to the District government to address the annual structural imbalance. The District of Columbia faces fiscal challenges due to federal limitations on revenue generation and expenses similar to a state. This Act aims to address the annual structural imbalance by transferring revenue from the Federal Government to the District government.
