    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"21st Century Science for Nuclear Waste Disposal Act of 2004\". The Congress finds that the Yucca Mountain central repository project is estimated to cost $58 billion, but geological and hydrological conditions suggest it is not suitable. Public health and safety regulations have been altered to make it seem feasible. Storing high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain would involve transporting 70,000 tons of nuclear waste through 43 States and numerous cities, posing a risk to 50 million Americans. However, current nuclear power reactor sites can safely store waste for another 100 years, eliminating the immediate need for a central repository. The US has the capability to find long-term solutions. The United States can address long-term high-level radioactive waste storage issues by exploring new technologies to neutralize the waste. Research and development of risk-reducing technologies for safe waste disposal is feasible and the best alternative to a central repository. The Nuclear Waste Fund, with over $10 billion, should not be used for storing waste at a central repository like Yucca Mountain due to scientific evidence and safety concerns. The Nuclear Waste Fund should be used for research and development of alternative waste storage technologies instead of the Yucca Mountain Project. Congress should terminate the project and focus on developing safe nuclear waste disposal methods. The Nuclear Waste Fund is addressed in Section 3, focusing on alternative waste storage technologies rather than the Yucca Mountain Project. Section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to provide for payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund of fees for use as specified in the section. This amendment includes changes to subsection (a) by redesignating paragraphs and adjusting language for clarity. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to adjust fees to support specified uses, propose fee adjustments for full support, and annually adjust fees for inflation. The Secretary will no longer need to propose adjustments to Congress. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to adjust fees for specified uses and propose fee adjustments for full support without the need to propose adjustments to Congress. Subsections (b) and (d) are removed, and subsections (c) and (e) are redesignated as subsections (b) and (d) respectively. Additional changes are made to subsection (b) as part of the amendments. The Nuclear Waste Fund is available for research, development, and utilization of risk-decreasing technologies in the US to safely store nuclear waste for longer periods at designated sites. The Waste Disposal Act of 2004 aims to minimize transportation of nuclear waste, reduce radiation levels, and prohibits the use of funds for a central high-level radioactive waste repository. The Waste Disposal Act of 2004 aims to minimize transportation of nuclear waste, reduce radiation levels, and prohibits the use of funds for a central high-level radioactive waste repository. SEC. 4. REPEALS AND REDESIGNATIONS. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to repeal and redesignate various sections and titles. Conforming amendments include striking and redesignating specific paragraphs in section 2. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to redefine terms related to research and risk-decreasing technologies in nuclear waste management. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to restructure subsections and update the table of contents. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to repeal special rules for nuclear decommissioning costs under Section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
