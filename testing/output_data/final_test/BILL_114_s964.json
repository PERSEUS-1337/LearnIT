    "content": "The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2015\" requires reports on post-shutdown decommissioning activities. This Act amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to include these reporting requirements. The \"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2015\" defines key terms related to post-shutdown decommissioning activities, including terms like affected state, Commission, covered facility, host state, licensee, and PSDAR. The licensee must develop a proposed PSDAR for a covered facility after consulting with affected States, local governments, and tribal governments within 50 miles. After additional consultation, the licensee submits the proposed PSDAR to the Commission. The licensee must submit the proposed PSDAR to the Commission and make it available to the public. The Commission will then make the proposed PSDAR public while protecting national security. Public participation will be solicited for at least 90 days in the host State through written comments. The Commission must conduct at least 2 public hearings in the host State and solicit written comments from the public. The host State has 60 days to provide a statement of support, conditional support with recommendations, or nonsupport for the proposed PSDAR. If the host State files a statement of support, conditional support, or nonsupport for the proposed PSDAR, or fails to submit a statement by the deadline, the Commission will issue a determination on the adequacy of the PSDAR based on specified considerations and written comments. The Commission will assess the adequacy of a proposed PSDAR based on input from the host State, other States, local communities, and the public. The proposed PSDAR must ensure the protection of human health and the environment, with the licensee showing a strong likelihood of implementation within the specified timeframe. The Commission will evaluate the proposed PSDAR for compliance with applicable laws and the licensee's financial capability to implement it. If deemed adequate, the Commission will approve the PSDAR; if inadequate, a decision document will be issued. The Commission will reject inadequate proposed PSDARs and require a new submission within 2 years of plant closure. Conditional support from the host state will be considered by the Commission for permissibility under applicable laws. The Commission will review proposed changes to the final PSDAR submitted by the host State, incorporating them unless proven inappropriate by the licensee based on clear evidence of violation of laws or disproportionate costs outweighing benefits. The Commission will issue a decision document accepting or rejecting proposed changes to the final PSDAR submitted by the host State, based on determinations of appropriateness and clear evidence provided by the licensee. The Commission will issue a final order accepting or rejecting the proposed PSDAR. If approved, the PSDAR becomes final, and the licensee can implement it. If rejected, the licensee must submit a new proposed PSDAR within 2 years of plant operations ceasing. The Commission must approve a PSDAR that includes compliance with more restrictive applicable State laws regarding air, water, soil quality, or radiological standards. Licensees are notified to develop revised PSDARs for facilities with existing decommissioning activities. The Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Act of 2015 requires decontamination and dismantlement activities to commence within 1 year. States within 50 miles of the facility must consult with the licensee. Licensees can develop revised PSDARs for approval by the Commission. The revised PSDAR under paragraph (1) must be considered and approved following specific processes outlined in subsections (b) through (d) and subsection (f), as well as the process for support or nonsupport by the host State described in subsection (e). If a licensee chooses not to revise the original PSDAR, entities in subsection (b) can file a statement of support or nonsupport for the original PSDAR. The decision document for a revised PSDAR must be issued within 1 year of decontamination and dismantlement activities starting. If the Commission rejects the revised PSDAR, a new revised PSDAR must be submitted within 2 years. The Commission must receive a new revised PSDAR within 2 years of rejecting the previous one."
