    "content": "Recent years have seen significant changes in income tax treatment for families, including expansions of the earned income credit (EIC) for lower-income families, introduction of the child credit for middle-income families, and lowering of tax rates for higher-income families. The 2001-2003 tax cuts were extended in 2010 and made permanent for most taxpayers in 2012. Temporary provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 targeted middle-class and lower-income families. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included temporary provisions for middle-class and lower-income families, such as a refundable payroll tax credit, an increase in the earned income tax credit, and an increase in the refundability of the child credit. These provisions were extended through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and made permanent. The tax code provisions for families were extended through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and made permanent at the end of 2015 by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act. The child credit and earned income credit have a significant impact on low-income taxpayers. This paper focuses on the equitable treatment of families of different sizes and the effects of the tax code on marriage penalties and bonuses. The tax code provisions for families were extended through 2017 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and made permanent at the end of 2015 by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act. This paper discusses the origin of marriage penalties and bonuses, equity issues, and how tax burdens vary by family size and income level. Federal income tax law differentiates among families by type and structure, including personal exemptions, deductions, rate schedules, and various credits. Personal exemptions vary based on the type of tax return filed, such as joint returns for married couples, head-of-household returns for single heads with dependents, and single returns for singles without dependents. Personal exemptions allow a certain amount per person to be exempt from tax, combined with standard deductions based on family type. In 1986, these amounts were set at the poverty level. Exemptions can lead to marriage bonuses when only one spouse works. Tax laws have historically provided relief for family size through exemptions, with amounts increasing over time. In 1917, personal exemptions were only $200, but increased and then decreased over time. The real value of exemptions was eroded by inflation, with the personal exemption remaining constant at $600 from 1948 to 1969. By 1986, personal exemptions were increased and indexed to $4,050, reducing the tax burden on larger families. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 introduced $500 child credits, later increased to $1,000, which are not indexed for inflation. These credits benefit families with children under 17, increasing the personal exemption and deduction equivalent by 110% for families in the 15% rate bracket. The credits phase out for higher incomes over $110,000 for joint returns and $75,000 for others. The child credit, initially non-refundable, was enhanced under temporary provisions in 2001, allowing refundability for income over $10,000. This was further expanded in 2003 and 2004, and made permanent in 2015, allowing refundability for 15% of income over $3,000. The personal exemption phases out for higher incomes. The personal exemption is phased out for higher incomes, applying to very high income taxpayers. For 2016, the phaseout ranges are between $311,300 and $433,800 for joint returns, $285,350 and $407,850 for head-of-household returns, and $259,400 and $381,900 for single returns. Standard deductions vary by filing status and can affect tax burdens, especially when itemized deductions are smaller than the standard amount. Prior to 2001, standard deductions for singles and heads of household were a percentage of the deduction for joint returns. The standard deduction can lead to a marriage penalty if it exceeds half the deduction for married couples. In 2001, joint standard deductions were increased to eliminate the marriage penalty relative to singles without children and reduce it relative to heads of household. Current standard deductions for 2016 are $12,600 for joint returns, $9,300 for head-of-household returns, and $6,300 for single returns. Itemized deductions for taxes, interest, charitable contributions, and personal expenses have been allowed since the inception of the tax law. In 1964, a minimum standard deduction of $200 plus $100 for each exemption with a $1,000 ceiling was added. Beginning in 1969, standard deductions were increased to 16% with a ceiling of $2,000. A low-income allowance of $1,100, increasing to $1,300 in 1972, was substituted for the minimum standard deduction. By 1976, joint returns received a $2,100 allowance based on family type. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 raised the flat deduction amount, differentiated by family status. The 2001 act increased the standard deduction for joint returns to twice that of single returns. It is important to consider changes in all flat allowances over time, not just the personal exemption. The personal exemption has declined in real value since 1948, but current levels are larger than if indexed for inflation. Exempt allowances are more generous today for most families, with singles, heads of households, and joint returns with children all having larger relative amounts. Heads of household with four and five members have slightly larger real levels, while six-person families have about the same. The personal exemption has declined in real value since 1948, but current levels are larger than if indexed for inflation. Exempt allowances are more generous today for most families, with singles, heads of households, and joint returns with children all having larger relative amounts. Heads of household with four and five members have slightly larger real levels, while six-person families have about the same. For example, a married couple with an eligible child can have income of $24,450 plus another $10,000 to generate a $1,000 child credit at a 10% tax rate, for a total exempt level of $34,400, which is 104% larger in real terms than the 1948 value. This family will also receive an earned income credit and thus pay a negative tax rate. The current tax treatment is not based on equitable treatment of families or past standards. About a third of taxpayers itemize deductions, mainly at higher income levels. Itemized deductions increase with income and are subject to a phaseout of 3% of income above a certain threshold. The most significant itemized deductions include state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions. The rate structure considers the unit of taxation and the progressivity of tax rates. The tax rate structure includes rates of 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%. The highest rate was 35% before the 2001 tax cut, which eliminated the 39.6% rate. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the lower rates permanent, except for the highest rate for certain income levels. Married couples cannot use single rate schedules for taxation. Taxpayers have income that is taxed at various rates, ranging from no tax to 25%. The width of tax brackets varies for different filing statuses, with joint returns having the widest brackets. Higher rates and phaseouts of deductions apply to only a small fraction of taxpayers. Less than 17% of taxpayers are affected by these higher rates and phaseouts. In 1913, a single rate structure applied to all taxpayers, but in 1948, joint returns were allowed for income splitting. This change aimed to reduce the total tax burden by dividing income evenly for tax purposes. It was adopted to equalize treatment across states and prevent tax-induced disruptions in property laws, leading to the creation of joint and single returns. In 1948, joint and single returns were introduced to allow income splitting, creating a tax subsidy for marriage. This led to the introduction of a head-of-household schedule in 1951 for unmarried taxpayers with dependents. Criticism from singles in 1969 led to a singles rate schedule with wider brackets, creating a marriage penalty for certain families. The marriage penalty, which increased tax bills for working couples, was a concern due to changing social structures and increased female labor force participation. In 1981, a capped deduction for the secondary earner was introduced to alleviate this issue. This deduction allowed for 10% of income to be deducted, up to a cap of $3,000. It was repealed in 1986 when the flatter rate structure reduced the severity of the marriage penalty. In 1993, higher tax rates increased the penalty for very high-income individuals, affecting only a small fraction of the population. The tax rate structure underwent significant changes over time, with a major revision in the 1986 act reducing brackets to two (15% and 28%) and adding a new tax rate of 31% in 1990. Certain benefits, personal exemptions, and itemized deductions were phased out or reduced, impacting taxpayers differently based on their circumstances. In 1993, new marginal tax rates of 36% and 39.6% were added for upper income levels, making itemized deduction and personal exemption phaseouts permanent. The 2001 tax cut lowered top tax rates, introduced a new 10% rate, and eliminated the marriage penalty for most taxpayers by increasing standard deductions. Later legislation in 2013 eliminated the personal exemption and itemized deduction phaseouts. The earned income tax credit (EIC) is a refundable credit that provides a wage subsidy for low-income working individuals. The credit is a percentage of earned income, reaching a maximum fixed amount and then phased out. The permanent credit rates vary based on the number of children in the family. In 2016, the credit reached its maximum value of $506 for families with no children. In 2016, the earned income tax credit reached its maximum value of $506 for families with no children, and the credit phased out at specific income levels for singles and joint returns. Different maximum credit amounts and phase-out ranges apply for families with one, two, or three or more children, indexed for inflation. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) does not differentiate by family type except for phase-out ranges, depending on the number of children. It can create a marriage penalty for lower-income families where marrying may phase out more of the credit. However, marriage can reduce taxes for single individuals marrying someone with children and little income. The EIC encourages single parents to enter the workforce and was first enacted in 1975. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) was refundable and aimed to provide a work incentive, offset Social Security tax burden, and offer relief for price increases. Initially, only individuals with dependent children were eligible. Over time, revisions were made to include families with one or more children and a small credit for childless families. The 2001 tax cut expanded the phase-out range for married couples to reduce the marriage penalty. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act further modified the EIC. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act made temporary changes to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) in 2009, including an increase in the credit rate for families with three or more children and an increase in the phase-out level for married couples. These changes were made permanent by the PATH Act and benefit large low-income families by reducing the marriage penalty. Additionally, the EIC allows for credits for paid child care expenses for children under 13 and disabled dependents, with a credit rate of 35% phased down to 20% as income rises. Eligible expenses are limited to $3,000 for one child and $6,000 for two or more children, available to single parents or married couples where both parents work. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is available to single parents or married couples where both parents work, with a large flat exemption and rates of 26% and 28%. Exemptions phase out at certain income levels, and if AMT tax is higher than regular tax, the difference is added to the taxpayer's liability. The AMT does not affect many taxpayers currently, but may grow over time without legislative changes. Various temporary \"patches\" have been enacted to address this issue. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the patch for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) permanent, which indexes exemptions for inflation and prevents coverage into lower incomes. The AMT originated in 1969 as an add-on tax on tax preferences, with a focus on capital gains. The coverage of the AMT grew over time due to increasing rates and non-indexed exemptions. The 2001 tax cut further increased potential coverage. The preference for capital gains enacted in 1997 also impacted the AMT. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made the patch for the alternative minimum tax (AMT) permanent, which indexes exemptions for inflation and prevents coverage into lower incomes. The preference for capital gains enacted in 1997 and extended in 2003, and for dividends enacted in 2003, was not included in the AMT. Key provisions related to family structure include additional standard deductions for elderly and blind taxpayers, a 15% tax credit for the elderly and disabled that is phased out, and the child credit being allowed against the AMT. The tax law includes a 15% tax credit for the elderly and disabled, phased out based on Social Security offset. The \"kiddie tax\" applies to children under 18, taxing unearned income at parents' rate. Various exclusions and deductions benefit families of certain income levels. Certain families with higher incomes and at certain ages benefit from tax advantages related to owner-occupied homes and in-home provision of goods and services. Investment income is also treated favorably for upper-middle and higher-income taxpayers due to various tax preferences. Payroll tax can impact net tax for individuals. The payroll tax can affect the net tax burden for different types of families, potentially impacting equity and efficiency. The Social Security system may create a marriage bonus, increasing the implicit tax on work effort for second earners. Second-earner spouses may pay additional Social Security taxes without receiving a positive benefit, leading to a larger net tax burden. The net tax burden on second-earner spouses may be larger due to the Social Security system creating a marriage bonus. Implicit taxes can discourage work or marriage by reducing benefits. Tax proposals are evaluated for fairness, focusing on horizontal equity between families of different sizes and structures. The individual income tax is progressive, with higher-income taxpayers paying larger shares of their income. Issues of vertical equity involve value judgments. Effective tax rates for the top 20% of taxpayers have remained about the same since 1980, while rates for other families have fallen. Changes in tax credits and brackets have affected the progressivity of the income tax. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 aimed to approximate the poverty line with standard deductions and personal exemptions. Expansion of earned income credit and child credit helped taxpayers with qualifying children above the poverty line avoid taxes. Tax cuts, especially refundable ones like EIC, impact low-income individuals. An expansion of the Earned Income Credit (EIC) and child credit would impact low-income individuals. Revisions in the tax system can benefit higher-income individuals, such as widening the 15% rate bracket. Higher-income individuals are more likely to itemize deductions, and changes that increase the standard deduction will benefit them. Expansions of benefits like the Earned Income Credit and child credit would impact low-income individuals. Changes that increase the standard deduction tend to benefit higher-income individuals who are more likely to itemize deductions. Horizontal equity focuses on treating taxpayers equitably, which can be challenging in a progressive tax system. The standards of horizontal equity aim to treat taxpayers fairly, considering economic principles and the ability-to-pay concept. Tax policy lacks a consistent theory of fairness, leading to haphazard changes in family tax treatment. Income splitting and other adjustments were made in response to legal issues or complaints, rather than a coherent equity framework. For taxation purposes, families are categorized based on the type of head and size. The tax system in the U.S. differentiates between singles, head of households, and married couples. There is a debate on whether taxation should be based on individuals or families, with arguments for individual taxation related to marriage. The debate over individual versus family taxation revolves around marriage neutrality and efficiency. Some argue that taxing individuals based solely on their earnings would eliminate tax consequences of marriage. There is also discussion on adjusting for family size and dependents, with differing opinions on whether personal exemptions should be allowed. Arguments exist for taxing individuals without differentiation based on family arrangements. Individual taxation focuses on treating working adults as separate entities, regardless of family arrangements. Various principles have been proposed for how to address family characteristics in taxation, including treating living arrangements and children as personal choices, equating post-tax standards of living for families, and providing family assistance. The analysis does not consider other aspects of family taxation. The analysis does not consider the benefit principle of taxation, which would reflect the amount of government services received. Large families, especially those with children, may benefit more from public spending like education. While some taxes are based on benefits received, individual income tax is typically based on other principles. People have the freedom to choose marriage and children, and these choices should not necessarily result in tax relief. Children can be seen as part of parents' consumption, with the enjoyment they bring outweighing any costs. The argument that children are part of parents' consumption is discussed in relation to tax policy. This view suggests treating children as a consumption item, similar to food or clothing. However, using this perspective for tax policy is problematic as it only considers the well-being of the parents, not the children themselves. The material level of consumption for children and adults is influenced by family size. Some theories view children as an investment for future support, but this is not universal as many parents leave bequests to their children. Tax relief based on investment in children is not aligned with our tax system, which focuses on ability to pay through progressive taxation. The ability-to-pay standard of taxation in progressive taxation ensures equal standards of living before and after tax for families. Income splitting among family members is suggested, but the existence of \"club\" goods poses a challenge as some goods are purely private. The curr_chunk discusses how some goods have elements of a club nature, such as housing and family car, providing scale advantages in consumption within a family. It also mentions the challenge of designing income tax based on family size and characteristics. Designing a progressive income tax based on family size involves setting tax rates to achieve desired progression levels and using an averaging approach for horizontal equity. For example, a larger family with 50% more income should have the same average tax rate as a smaller reference family. This can be achieved by applying the basic tax rate schedule to two-thirds of the larger family's income and multiplying the resulting tax liability by 1.5. This ensures that both families have the same effective tax rate. When setting tax rates based on family size, larger families with more income should have the same average tax rate as smaller families. This can be achieved by applying the basic tax rate schedule to two-thirds of the larger family's income and multiplying the resulting tax liability by 1.5. This ensures equal effective tax rates for families of different sizes. Credits for child care expenses and allowances for working spouses can make the tax system more equitable for one-earner couples. Targeted family assistance, especially for lower-income families and children, involves refundable allowances based on family size differentials. Features like the Earned Income Credit and child credit have been incorporated into current law, differing from the use of personal exemptions to exempt a minimum subsistence amount from income. The 1986 revisions aimed to exempt a minimum subsistence amount from the income base and proposed child care benefits through deductions. These proposals address differentiation across family types and vertical distribution objectives, which can be achieved through exemptions, credits, or adjusting tax rate schedules for vertical equity. The 1986 revisions aimed to address differentiation across family types and vertical distribution objectives through exemptions, credits, or adjusting tax rate schedules for vertical equity. Differentiation across families at the same income level can be achieved by selecting sizes of personal exemptions for different family members. An ability-to-pay approach considers welfare of all in society rather than focusing exclusively on adults or children, and targeted family assistance might be better addressed through the welfare system. The 2006 study estimated effective tax rates in 2005 using an equivalency scale similar to variations in poverty lines across family types. The findings remain largely applicable, with updates to reflect 2016 income and tax law, including changes in earned income credit and child credit. The 2006 study used an adjustment based on research to define families with the same ability to pay taxes. It compared income levels needed for different family sizes, with a single person needing 62% of a married couple's income and a couple with four kids needing three times the income. Various provisions were considered in the calculations, such as rate structure, deductions, exemptions, credits, and alternative minimum tax. Table 1 and Table 2 report 2016 effective tax rates for low- and middle-income taxpayers at different income levels and family sizes. The rates vary for single, joint, and head of household returns. For example, a married couple with $25,000 income pays 1.7% in taxes, while a married couple with one child receives an 8.5% subsidy. These numbers assume certain tax provisions like personal exemptions, earned income credit, child credit, and alternative minimum tax. The tax rates for low- and middle-income taxpayers vary based on family size and income levels. The calculations consider factors like personal exemptions, earned income credit, child credit, and alternative minimum tax. The tax burden varies across the income scale due to factors like the earned income credit, child credit, and graduated rates. Families with the same ability to pay can have substantially different tax burdens, especially at low incomes. Families with children, whether headed by a married couple or a single parent, are favored due to the earned income tax credit and child credit. The largest negative tax rates are for returns with around three children, as EICs and child credits increase with the number of children. Larger families may be phased out of the EIC as incomes rise. Eventually, larger families are penalized as the value of child credits and personal exemptions relative to income declines. At higher income levels, the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) pushes up incomes through rate brackets, affecting more families with children. Credits and exemptions are phased out at higher income levels, leading to a flat tax for very high incomes. The AMT does not apply at the highest income levels due to higher ordinary tax rates. Head-of-household families are more likely to see tax increases under the AMT. Overall, singles are taxed more heavily than childless couples in middle-income ranges but less heavily at very high and some low income levels. The tax system favors families with children over those without at low and moderate income levels. The number of children in a family can impact the treatment they receive in terms of tax credits. Large families at higher income levels may face higher effective tax rates due to the graduated rate structure and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). The tax system favors families with children at low and moderate income levels. Large families at higher income levels may face higher effective tax rates due to the graduated rate structure and the AMT. Phase-out provisions and rate brackets should consider family size for tax structure determination. Earned income tax credit impacts family comparisons at low income levels, creating differences in tax burdens. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) rate is lower for single taxpayers or couples without children compared to families with children. The EIC should be adjusted based on ability-to-pay standard, with base and phase-out levels varying by family size. To achieve neutrality across families, the EIC rate should be the same for all families, while base and phase-out levels should be adjusted according to family size. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) rate should be adjusted based on family size to achieve equal treatment. The child credit also favors families with children, especially at middle and upper income levels. The recent law's increased refundability of the credit benefits larger families at lower-income levels. The availability of the child care credit has minimal impact, while the dependent care credit is not effectively accessible to low-income families with insufficient tax liability. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EIC) benefits low-income families with insufficient tax liability. It also lowers the tax rate for middle-income families with children. Married couples with only one working spouse benefit from imputed income, which is not taxed, reducing their overall tax burden. Imputed income valuation issues were explored in a 2005 study, focusing on child care expenses. This change impacted taxes differently across income levels, benefiting married couples with children. To enhance horizontal equity, suggestions included increasing the earned income credit for those without children, reducing the AMT, and eliminating phaseouts for certain credits and deductions. Making the child credit fully refundable could widen tax rate disparities at lower income levels. Disparities in tax rates exist at lower-income levels, influenced by family equivalency scales and child care costs. Child care credits may lower rates for families with young children. At higher-income levels, child care costs are less significant, and the child care credit has minimal impact on tax rates. Concerns about the marriage penalty stem from societal traditions. The tax law shifts to reduce the marriage penalty and expand marriage bonuses, affecting incentives and equitable treatment of singles and married couples. In middle-income brackets, singles may face higher taxes than married couples, while lower-income singles benefit from lower required incomes. At very high incomes, married couples may pay a larger share due to remaining marriage penalties. This section explores the treatment of married couples and singles in an additional dimension. Single individuals living together can have the same ability to pay as married couples, but their tax liability can be affected. If income is unevenly split, taxes may be higher for unmarried individuals. However, if income is evenly split, there can be a benefit to remaining single. Married couples have to combine their income, which can impact tax brackets. Married individuals have to combine their income, impacting tax brackets. The rate brackets for joint returns are wider than those for single individuals but not twice as wide. The earned income credit includes marriage penalties and bonuses. Comparing tax rates of married and unmarried couples with the same income shows potential penalties or bonuses. Tables show effective tax rates for different scenarios. Marriage penalties and bonuses can occur based on income splits, especially when there are children involved. Uneven income splits can lead to different tax results depending on who can claim the child-related benefits. Tables show that both penalties and bonuses exist, with bonuses for singles in middle-income ranges and penalties at lower-income levels. Marriage penalties and bonuses can occur based on income splits, especially when there are children involved. Uneven income splits can lead to different tax results depending on who can claim the child-related benefits. Both bonuses and penalties exist at lower-income levels due to the earned income tax credit. Phase-out ranges are not reached as quickly for singles if income is evenly split. Marriage penalties can also occur at very high-income levels. Provisions increasing the phase-out level for the earned income credit reduce tax burdens for low-income joint returns and reduce marriage penalties. At lower income levels, marriage penalties and bonuses can occur based on income splits, especially when there are children involved. Uneven income splits can lead to different tax results depending on who can claim child-related benefits. The combination of factors can result in a marriage bonus initially, but this can eventually turn into a marriage penalty due to various tax provisions and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). When couples divorce, the tax burden can be affected based on who can claim child-related benefits. Typically, the mother, with lower earnings, would have the child, resulting in a potential marriage bonus. If the couple never married and the child is only related to one parent, that parent, likely the mother, would claim the child. If a married couple with low incomes has only earned income, no dependent children, and no itemized deductions, they could qualify for the earned income credit. The assignment of a child to one parent, typically the mother, can result in a marriage bonus. The size of the bonus or penalty for marriage is difficult to determine in many cases. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that prior to the 2001 tax cut, 37% of married couples had penalties, 3% were unaffected, and 60% had bonuses. The net bonus was $49 billion. The CBO study analyzed marriage penalties and bonuses based on tax-minimizing strategies. 43% of married couples had penalties totaling $32 billion, while 52% had bonuses amounting to $43 billion, resulting in a net bonus of $11 billion. Between 37% and 43% of married taxpayers faced penalties. Another study using different assumptions found that 48% had penalties of $28.3 billion, and 41% had bonuses of $26.7 billion. The authors found that 48% faced penalties totaling $28.3 billion and 41% received bonuses amounting to $26.7 billion, resulting in a net penalty of $1.6 billion. The study also estimated $30.2 billion in singles penalties and found that without head-of-household status, 46% of couples had bonuses of $36.6 billion while 43% had penalties of $20.8 billion, resulting in a net bonus of $15.8 billion. Additionally, a subsequent study found a penalty of $3.7 billion without the 2001 tax cut, but a $30 billion bonus with the 2004 tax law. The 2004 tax law included marriage relief provisions, rate reductions, and bonuses for 60% of couples and penalties for 23%. The study warned that penalties could increase if the AMT grows as projected, but patches have maintained the general results. The current situation shows a shift towards bonuses rather than penalties. In 2005, there were 58 million married households compared to 5 million unmarried couple households. Under 2003 law, penalties and bonuses for cohabiting couples with children were studied. 42% would receive a bonus averaging $1,893, while 50.7% would face a penalty of $1,497. In low-income households, bonuses are more common due to the earned income credit. Bonuses are expected to increase with the 2009 additional phase-out amounts for married couples. The study found that penalties for marriage were more common among low-income families with young children in urban areas. Increasing the earned income credit for childless workers had small effects on marriage penalties. The study also noted mixed evidence on the impact of marriage penalties on marriage. Addressing the marriage penalty is challenging due to conflicting tax objectives and the lack of information on unmarried individuals' living arrangements. The current tax system tends to favor marriage overall, with families with children paying lower tax rates at lower and middle incomes but higher rates at higher incomes. The Earned Income Credit and child credits provide the most tax subsidies to families with two to four children at the lowest income levels. Families with many children receive the most favorable treatment at middle-income levels, while large families are penalized at higher-income levels. After the 2001 tax cut, most taxpayers without children receive a marriage bonus rather than a penalty, with penalties occurring only at the bottom and top income levels. There is ongoing interest in increasing the earned income credit for singles and childless couples. Marriage is generally rewarded in the tax system, but there is some conflict in the evidence for lower-income families. Increasing the earned income credit for singles and childless couples would enhance equity in the tax system based on ability to pay, with minimal impact on marriage penalties."
