SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress recognizes the importance of encouraging sexual assault survivors to cooperate with law enforcement. It is recommended that prosecutors avoid charging survivors for minor offenses like underage drinking or drug use, especially if discovered during a medical examination. Survivors should also be assured that they will not face prosecution to create a safe environment for reporting sexual violence. Survivors should be assured they will not be prosecuted for minor crimes discovered during medical forensic examinations."
