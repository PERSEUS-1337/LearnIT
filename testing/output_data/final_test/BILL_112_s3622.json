    "content": "The \"Protecting Patients and Hospitals From Price Gouging Act\" aims to prevent unfair pricing of vital drugs during shortages to safeguard public health. The \"Protecting Patients and Hospitals From Price Gouging Act\" defines \"market shortage\" as inadequate supply of FDA-regulated drugs and outlines criteria for drugs requiring professional supervision. The term \"biologic\" refers to various medical products used for disease prevention or treatment in humans, while \"vital drug\" denotes medications for serious or life-threatening conditions with limited alternatives. SEC. 4. UNREASONABLY EXCESSIVE DRUG PRICING. The President may issue an Executive order declaring a market shortage for vital drugs for 6 months, making it unlawful to sell vital drugs at unreasonably excessive prices during this period. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce penalties under this Act. Enforcement of the Act includes penalties for selling vital drugs at unreasonably excessive prices during a declared market shortage. The Attorney General can seek injunctions in district court for violations. The Act allows the United States courts to enjoin acts of charging unreasonably excessive prices for vital drugs during a market shortage. Criminal penalties include imprisonment for up to 3 years, a fine of up to $5,000,000, or both. The Act allows criminal penalties for charging excessive prices for vital drugs during a shortage, with each day of violation considered a separate offense. The penalties can be imposed by the Attorney General or Department of Justice, applying to wholesalers and distributors in the shortage area, but not to hospitals or physicians. SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF UNREASONABLY EXCESSIVE. The Attorney General considers additional costs, risks, price disparities, and marginal benefits when determining if a violator's price was unreasonably excessive. The distributor's pricing must be compared to previous earnings, market availability, and market conditions. The Attorney General consults with various stakeholders annually to reassess pricing criteria. The community organizations will reassess pricing criteria and submit a report to Congress. SEC. 7 of the Act states that any market shortage declared by the President will last for a maximum of 6 months. The shortage will end if Congress passes a law or the President issues a proclamation to terminate it. The President can renew the shortage declaration if necessary for the well-being of citizens."
