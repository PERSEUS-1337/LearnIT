    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Clean Diamond Trade Act\". Congress finds that funds from the sale of rough diamonds are used to finance military activities, overthrow governments, and commit atrocities against civilians, leading to millions of people being displaced and millions more dying in wars in Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These conflicts have affected nearly 70 million people in the region. The United Nations Security Council, along with human rights advocates and the diamond trade represented by the World Diamond Council, are working to end the trade in conflict diamonds. This action is urgently needed to address the threats to international peace and security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. The Security Council has taken measures under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to prohibit weapon exports to countries affected by such conflicts. The United States implemented sanctions restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, requiring specified certificates of origin for Angola and Sierra Leone, and fully prohibiting imports from Liberia for 12 months. The United States is taking action against trade in conflict diamonds to prevent consumer backlash and protect the economies of countries not involved in the trade. South Africa and over 30 other countries are working on a solution through the Kimberley Process. The US, as the largest consumer of diamonds, has an obligation to help end the link between diamonds and conflict. Articles XX and XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 allow World Trade Organization members to address the issue of conflict diamonds without violating their obligations. Failure to stop the trade in conflict diamonds could harm the legitimate diamond trade in countries like Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania. US initiatives aim to resolve regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa that fuel the trade in conflict diamonds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, conflict diamonds are defined as rough diamonds that are prohibited from importation by UN Security Council Resolutions due to fueling conflict, rough diamonds used by armed movements to finance human rights abuses, or diamonds funding the al-Qaeda terrorist network. The term \"diamonds\" refers to diamonds in general. The terms \"diamonds\", \"polished diamonds\", and \"rough diamonds\" are defined based on their classification under specific subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. The term \"United States\" refers to the several States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 4. MEASURES TO PREVENT IMPORTS OF CONFLICT DIAMONDS. The President has the authority to prohibit the importation of rough diamonds, and potentially polished diamonds and diamond jewelry, from countries that do not take effective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Effective measures must align with United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The President can ban rough diamonds imports from countries not complying with conflict diamond trade regulations, as per UN Security Council Resolutions. Requirements include secure packaging with validated documentation certifying origin, carat weight, and value. The regulations for rough diamonds include verifiable controls from mine to export, ensuring no conflict diamonds enter the legitimate trade, recordkeeping by all involved parties, government publication of export/import statistics, and proportionate enforcement measures. Implementation of penalties for violating laws against trade in conflict diamonds and cooperation with international bodies for monitoring the trade. Exclusions apply to rough diamonds for personal use or reimported without value addition. The importer can reimport rough diamonds without penalties if they have been advanced in value or improved while abroad, as long as the requirements are met. The President is authorized to prohibit the entry of polished diamonds and diamond jewelry into the US if there is credible evidence that they were produced with conflict diamonds. Enforcement measures are outlined. Diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds imported into the US in violation of prohibitions are subject to seizure and forfeiture laws. Proceeds from fines and forfeited goods go to the Leahy War Victims Fund and grants under the Foreign Assistance Act. Proceeds from fines and forfeited goods related to diamonds and jewelry imports in violation of prohibitions support the Leahy War Victims Fund and grants under the Foreign Assistance Act. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The President must submit annual reports to Congress detailing actions taken by diamond-exporting countries to prevent trade in conflict diamonds, new diamond marking technologies, and countries not effectively stopping conflict diamond trade. The President must submit semiannual reports to Congress on actions taken to prevent conflict diamonds from being imported into the United States, including actions by the US and other countries involved in conflicts linked to rough diamonds. The President must submit semiannual reports to Congress on actions taken to prevent conflict diamonds from being imported into the United States, ensuring effective measures are implemented by countries involved in conflicts linked to rough diamonds. GAO Report: The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress within 3 years on the effectiveness of the Act in preventing conflict diamond imports under section 4, including any recommended modifications. Congress urges the President to negotiate an international arrangement, in collaboration with the Kimberley Process, to end the trade in conflict diamonds. This agreement should establish a global control system for exporting and importing rough diamonds, include specific elements, ensure independent monitoring, gather accurate trade statistics, and establish a coordinating body. Additionally, Congress recommends seeking UN Security Council Resolutions for diamond trade from other identified countries. It is recommended that companies involved in diamond extraction and trade should financially support countries implementing effective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Authorization of appropriations of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year 2002 and 2003 to assist countries in implementing measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds. Effective date of the Act is upon enactment."
