    "content": "Attempting to predict how Supreme Court nominees may approach their work is uncertain. Justices like Felix Frankfurter and Harry Blackmun surprised early supporters with their judicial approaches. Justice Blackmun, known for his liberal views, authored the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, recognizing the right to terminate a pregnancy. Predicting a nominee's approach to the job of being a Justice is challenging, especially for federal appellate judges who are bound by precedent. Unlike the Supreme Court, appellate courts must hear many routine cases with uncontroversial legal rules. The vast majority of cases in federal courts of appeals are decided without dissent, including in the Tenth Circuit where Judge Gorsuch serves. While his opinions may offer some insight into his general approach to legal issues, they may not reveal his views on specific areas of law or how he would approach them as a Supreme Court Justice. Joining an opinion authored by another judge does not necessarily reflect the nominee's preferences. Joining an opinion authored by another judge does not always indicate full agreement with the underlying opinion. Judges may refrain from dissenting to promote consensus, and a judge's vote on procedural matters may not reflect agreement with the legal position. While joining an opinion authored by another judge may not signal full agreement, votes to rehear a case en banc should be viewed with caution as they could indicate disagreement with the panel decision's legal reasoning. En banc review is rare and typically reserved for conflicting precedent within the circuit. The Tenth Circuit, spanning six western states, has a routine caseload compared to other circuits. Judge Gorsuch's limited statements on certain legal areas due to the nature of the Tenth Circuit's docket make it challenging to predict his rulings if elevated to the Supreme Court. The Tenth Circuit has a diverse caseload, including criminal law, civil litigation, and administrative agency appeals. However, it rarely addresses topics like international law, terrorism, and major agency actions in environmental law. Judge Gorsuch's views on certain legal areas may be limited due to the nature of the Tenth Circuit's docket. Many commentators compare Judge Gorsuch to Justice Scalia in his views on the role of the judiciary, particularly in interpreting legal texts with originalism and textualism. If confirmed, Gorsuch is expected to maintain the ideological balance on the court following Scalia's death. Following President Trump's election, academic studies suggested that Judge Gorsuch would replicate Justice Scalia's judging style if elevated to the Supreme Court. President Trump expressed his desire to nominate judges in the mold of Justice Scalia. However, during his confirmation hearings in 2006, Judge Gorsuch rejected the idea of having a specific judging philosophy and emphasized the importance of not being pigeonholed. He mentioned a wide range of jurists who have influenced his approach to judging. Judge Gorsuch has noted various judges who have influenced his approach to judging, including Justice Scalia, Judge David Sentelle, and Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. Comparisons have been made between Gorsuch and these jurists based on his judicial and nonjudicial writings. His opinions and scholarly works suggest similarities to Justice Scalia's approach. Judge Gorsuch's opinions and writings indicate a shared approach with Justice Scalia towards judging. In a 2016 lecture, Gorsuch praised Scalia's traditional view of judging, emphasizing the importance of applying the law as it is and limiting the judge's role in the political system. Judge Gorsuch's opinions align with Justice Scalia's traditional view of judging, emphasizing applying the law as it is and limiting the judge's role in the political system. In cases like Cordova v. City of Albuquerque, Gorsuch rejected flexible interpretations of the Constitution in favor of originalism, stating that judges must apply the Constitution according to its original public meaning. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, emphasizes applying the law as it is and limiting the judge's role in the political system. In cases such as Hydro Resources, Inc. v. EPA, Gorsuch adopted a formalist approach to the law, rejecting the government's interpretation of what constitutes Indian land. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, emphasizes applying the law as it is and limiting the judge's role in the political system. In cases such as Hydro Resources, Inc. v. EPA, Gorsuch rejected the government's interpretation of what constitutes Indian land, favoring a simpler and clearer legal system. He has also advocated for attorney-initiated reforms to make the civil justice system more accessible and affordable. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, rejects \"results-oriented judging\" and emphasizes applying the law as it is. He believes judges should not conform to personal preferences and should interpret, not rewrite, laws enacted by the people's representatives. Gorsuch has stated that a judge who likes every result is likely a bad judge and that courts should not substitute their views for Congress's judgment. He has shown personal sympathies for parties in cases but maintains the proper role of a court is to interpret the law. Judge Gorsuch, similar to Justice Scalia, rejects \"results-oriented judging\" and emphasizes applying the law as it is. He believes judges should interpret, not rewrite, laws enacted by the people's representatives. Gorsuch's judicial writings are praised for their clarity and accessibility, with a tone that is cordial compared to Justice Scalia's pointed and acerbic style. During his career on the High Court, Justice Scalia frequently authored broad and uncompromising opinions that did not garner majority votes. In contrast, Judge Gorsuch's judicial record reflects his emphasis on collegiality and consensus-building, aiming for unanimity where possible. Judge Gorsuch's writing style, noted for its clarity and accessibility, differs from Justice Scalia's pointed and acerbic tone. Judge Gorsuch's majority opinions on the Tenth Circuit were rarely dissented from by fellow judges, with separate opinions accompanying them only 3.3 percent of the time. This low dissent rate indicates his ability to secure a unified view of the court, contrasting with other judges on the same circuit. Judge Gorsuch's approach to writing majority opinions on the Tenth Circuit suggests a high value on consensus and persuasion, contrasting with Justice Scalia's approach. While he had few dissents on his opinions, he showed more willingness to dissent from others' opinions. His dissent rate of 1.6 percent places him in the middle of his colleagues and is lower than Justice Scalia's dissent rate on the D.C. Circuit. The data on Judge Gorsuch's writing on the Tenth Circuit may be limited in its ability to fully capture his approach, as factors like case assignments and the frequency of separate opinions play a role. This could explain why his majority opinions had few dissents, potentially due to the types of cases he was assigned. The small dataset and rarity of separate opinions on the Tenth Circuit make it challenging to draw definitive conclusions about Judge Gorsuch's writing style. Judge Gorsuch's approach to judging on the Tenth Circuit is characterized by his cordial and collegial demeanor, aiming to find common ground while being respectful of all sides. His judicial temperament is described as superb by former colleagues. This contrasts with Justice Scalia's approach of deciding only what is necessary. Judge Gorsuch, unlike Justice Scalia, advocates for a more minimalist role for courts, emphasizing caution in deciding weighty questions and recognizing constitutional rights. He frequently limits the scope of majority opinions he authors, prioritizing judicial restraint and answering necessary questions over those that can be addressed. The nominee, Judge Gorsuch, often limits the scope of majority opinions he authors and has expressed concern about judges reshaping the law. The Supreme Court has only reviewed one of his approximately 180 published majority opinions, affirming it by a 5-4 vote. Judge Gorsuch has a high affirmance rate with the Supreme Court, as four out of five opinions he joined were affirmed. He follows a textualist approach to statutory interpretation, similar to Justice Scalia, focusing on the wording of the statute rather than extrinsic evidence of Congress' intent. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, follows a textualist approach to statutory interpretation, focusing on the wording of the statute. He resembles Scalia in invoking the \"rule of lenity\" for ambiguous language in criminal statutes. However, Gorsuch differs from Scalia in his concerns about \"Chevron deference\" to executive branch agencies' interpretations of statutes. Judge Gorsuch, similar to Justice Scalia, uses a textualist approach to interpret statutes. He emphasizes the plain text and grammar of legislative language, giving words their customary meaning. He differs from Scalia in his views on the rule of lenity and Chevron deference. Judge Gorsuch focuses on the grammar of legislative language, particularly the parts of speech in statutory text. In a 2015 opinion for the en banc Tenth Circuit in United States v. Rentz, he diagrammed a sentence segment to address an interpretative question regarding multiple charges under Section 924(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code. The diagram clarified that charges should not exceed the number of uses, carries, or possessions. Judge Gorsuch, in his opinions, emphasizes the importance of interpreting criminal statutes based on the grammar of legislative language. He argues that charges under Section 924(c) of Title 18 should not exceed the number of uses, carries, or possessions of a firearm in relation to crimes of violence. This approach aligns with his textualist interpretation practices, which include considering the larger statutory context and avoiding interpretations that defy grammatical logic. Judge Gorsuch emphasizes statutory interpretation, including the \"larger statutory context,\" congressional purpose, and historical context. He applies specific interpretative canons without engaging in broader debates. In a 2016 opinion, he contrasted canons he views as consistent with the judicial function. Judge Gorsuch expressed concern about the \"absurdity canon\" allowing judges to override clear statutory text based on perceived congressional purpose. This reflects his broader concerns about interpretations of statutory text using extrinsic evidence of congressional intent. Judge Gorsuch's approach to statutory interpretation is influenced by his concerns about the \"absurdity canon\" and the use of legislative history materials. He has cited legislative history in some cases, unlike Justice Scalia, but remains cautious about its use. The two other judges on the panel disagreed with Judge Gorsuch on the absurdity doctrine, with one suggesting the argument was waived. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, is skeptical of using legislative history materials in statutory interpretation due to concerns about judges cherry-picking and the lack of bicameralism and presentment requirements. He also shares constitutional concerns about the use of such materials. Judge Gorsuch, similar to Justice Scalia, has reservations about relying on legislative history in statutory interpretation. He believes courts should interpret the law, not create it based on abstract views of a statute's purpose. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, prefers interpreting statutes based on their text rather than legislative history. His views on statutory interpretation align with Scalia's. Gorsuch has expressed distinct views on administrative law cases, indicating how he might approach such matters on the Supreme Court. In administrative law cases, Judge Gorsuch's approach to judicial review and jurisdiction is highlighted. He tends to side with the majority on access to judicial relief issues and does not show a clear bias towards expansive or restrictive views on jurisdiction. In cases where he wrote separate opinions, it was often to argue lack of jurisdiction, as seen in Wilderness Society v. Kane County. In cases like Wilderness Society v. Kane County and Kerr v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch emphasized the lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the court could not hear suits presenting nonjusticiable political questions. In reviewing agency actions, courts often defer to agency interpretations of statutes under the Chevron doctrine. Judge Gorsuch has questioned the size and power of the modern administrative state. Judge Gorsuch has raised concerns about the size and power of the modern administrative state, questioning the overwhelming number of regulations issued by agencies. He has critiqued Chevron deference and taken a narrow view on when it is due, as seen in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch. Judge Gorsuch has criticized the modern administrative state and questioned the extensive regulations issued by agencies. In a separate concurring opinion, he raised concerns about the wisdom and constitutionality of doctrines created by Chevron and Brand X. Emphasizing the separation of powers, Judge Gorsuch highlighted the legislature's role in setting policy and the judiciary's duty to interpret laws neutrally. He argued that this division of responsibilities protects liberty and prevents unelected judges from making policy decisions for the nation. Additionally, he emphasized that judicial judgments should not be revised or overturned by the elected branches of government. Judge Gorsuch criticized Brand X for allowing executive branch agencies to override judicial interpretations of the law, arguing that it undermines the constitutional separation of powers. He believes that under Brand X, the executive branch effectively legislates without following the procedures required by the Constitution, leading to a shift in authority from the judiciary to the politically accountable branches of government. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela questions the Chevron deference doctrine, arguing it allows political branches to intrude on judicial functions, risking unfair treatment of regulated entities and arbitrary law interpretation based on political winds. This challenges the separation of powers and raises Due Process and Equal Protection concerns. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela criticizes the Chevron doctrine for lacking clear congressional intent and violating the non-delegation doctrine. He argues that Chevron allows agencies to interpret their own jurisdictional power without proper guidance from Congress. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela questions consolidating power in a single branch of government, arguing against Chevron deference. He believes courts should interpret laws without agency deference to ensure proper oversight and prevent excessive executive authority. Judge Gorsuch's views on judicial deference to agency legal interpretations contrast with those of Justice Scalia, suggesting he may favor narrowing the scope of Chevron deference in future cases. Judge Gorsuch's views on Chevron deference align with Justice Scalia's approach to statutory ambiguity, but he opposes the doctrine of Brand X on separation-of-powers grounds, similar to Scalia's dissenting opinion. Judge Gorsuch opposes Brand X on separation-of-powers grounds, allowing executive branch officers to overrule court judgments. He aligns with Justice Scalia on Chevron deference but limits the applicability of these doctrines in cases like De Niz Robles. In De Niz Robles, Judge Gorsuch rejected retroactive application of agency interpretation, narrowing the circumstances for Chevron and Brand X doctrines in the Tenth Circuit. He based his decision on separation of powers, due process, and equal protection principles. Judge Gorsuch grounded his decision in principles of separation of powers, due process, and equal protection, noting the presumptive prospective effect of legislation compared with the retroactive effect of a judicial decision. He reasoned that agency decisions resembling legislation should not be granted retroactive force, especially when displacing a contrary judicial decision. This 2015 ruling established that agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory provisions under Chevron should presumptively apply only prospectively. Judge Gorsuch's rulings in Gutierrez-Brizuela and De Niz Robles show his skepticism towards deferring to agencies on legal questions. In TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Department of Labor, he dissented from the majority's decision to defer to the Department's determination that a truck driver's actions were protected under the Surface Transportation Assistance Act. Gorsuch argued that the statute's meaning was clear and did not include the driver's actions as protected activity. Judge Gorsuch rejected extending Chevron deference to the agency's interpretation, believing the statute was clear and unambiguous. He did not express strong objections to discretionary or factual review in administrative law. The nominee has upheld agency actions under the arbitrary and capricious standard but has also disagreed with colleagues, finding agency actions lacking in evidence or fairness. In a specific case, he dissented in a decision regarding backpay calculations, arguing that the agency had considerable discretion but lacked consistency in its justifications. Judge Gorsuch dissented in a case where the agency's decision was criticized for treating terminated employees differently from those with reduced hours. He argued that the agency failed to provide adequate justification for its actions, essentially creating a new rule without explanation. His stance on capital punishment is significant as he may replace Justice Scalia, who supported the death penalty. This is crucial given the current division on the Court regarding capital punishment. Judge Gorsuch's views on capital punishment could be influential on the Court's future decisions. While he has not extensively written on the topic, his opinions suggest a tendency to defer to state decisions on the death penalty. The Court remains divided on issues related to how states carry out executions. In December 2016, the Supreme Court split 4-4 over staying the execution of an Alabama man challenging the state's method of administering the death penalty. Judge Gorsuch's past votes suggest he may provide a fifth vote against such challenges. In cases like v. Gross and Estate of Lockett v. Fallin, Judge Gorsuch supported decisions upholding the use of midazolam in executions and dismissing Eighth Amendment claims related to mishaps during executions. His views on the death penalty are reflected in his opinions on habeas corpus petitions. State prisoners sentenced to death can challenge their convictions in federal court through a habeas corpus petition, but face difficulty due to the deference given to state court decisions under the AEDPA. This standard makes it challenging for inmates to succeed in federal habeas cases, similar to Justice Scalia's stance on granting relief in death penalty cases. Judge Gorsuch, who rarely granted federal habeas relief in death penalty cases, has authored or joined opinions denying such relief, emphasizing AEDPA's deferential standard of review. He has also dissented from opinions granting relief, arguing for more deference to state court decisions. In Wilson v. Workman, he disagreed with the court's failure to consider material evidence in rejecting inmates' claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Judge Gorsuch's dissent in a case argued that a state court's decision to exclude evidence should be considered an adjudication on the merits under AEDPA, requiring federal courts to defer to the state court's decision. In another case, Eizember v. Trammel, he upheld the convictions and death sentence of a man despite the argument that jurors should have been excluded due to bias in favor of capital punishment. Judge Gorsuch disagreed with two judges on whether the state court properly assessed juror bias during sentencing. He argued for deference to the state court's decision that the trial court did not improperly exclude jurors. This suggests he will defer to states on capital punishment matters. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in a capital case suggests he may question the state's imposition of the death penalty in certain circumstances. In Williams v. Trammel, he expressed concerns about imposing capital punishment on an accomplice who did not intend for a death to occur. He referenced the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. Judge Gorsuch has shown a willingness to scrutinize state court decisions that may violate constitutional protections for capital defendants, particularly in cases involving monetary liability in civil lawsuits. He may be hesitant to expand defendants' rights beyond existing precedent but could have influence on procedural and substantive limits in federal law. Judge Gorsuch's potential impact on civil liability matters, particularly in cases involving faulty products, discriminatory practices, or fraudulent activities, could be influenced by his predecessor, Justice Scalia's decisions. Scalia's rulings restricted plaintiffs' ability to use procedural vehicles like class action litigation and limited corporate defendants' civil liability. Commentators are speculating on how Gorsuch's confirmation to the Court could affect its stance on business-related civil liability issues. Judge Gorsuch's potential impact on civil liability matters, particularly in cases involving faulty products, discriminatory practices, or fraudulent activities, could be influenced by his predecessor, Justice Scalia's decisions. Commentators suggest that Judge Gorsuch's writings indicate a tendency to limit civil defendants' exposure, favor arbitration over litigation, and criticize government agencies. He has expressed interest in high pleading and procedural standards for civil litigants, with a focus on critiquing perceived misuses or excesses of litigation. Judge Gorsuch's judicial opinions show a distaste for the time and costs of protracted civil litigation. He selected cases affirming dismissal of civil claims, highlighting the lengthy process and expenses involved in such cases. Judge Gorsuch's approach to civil liability cases involves closely examining federal statutes or rules, especially in class action status determinations. In cases like Hammond v. Stamps.com, Inc., he shows a tendency to curtail costly litigation through strict readings of statutes. In Hammond v. Stamps.com, Inc., Judge Gorsuch reversed a district court's refusal to exercise jurisdiction in a putative class action case due to the defendant's failure to show over $5 million \"in controversy.\" He emphasized the importance of the statutory term \"in controversy\" in determining federal jurisdiction in civil liability cases. Judge Gorsuch found federal jurisdiction in a class action case where damages exceeded the statutory amount. In another case, he analyzed jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness Act based on the plain language of the statute. Judge Gorsuch's textualist approach to statutes extends to his interpretations of procedural rules, including those relevant to class action litigation. In a case involving county jail inmates with mental health needs, he affirmed the district court's denial of class certification based on unmanageability. Gorsuch affirmed the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 for class actions, emphasizing the need for cohesiveness among class members. He has expressed criticism of securities fraud class actions, citing social costs and economic incentives. Judge Gorsuch criticized securities fraud class actions, arguing that economic incentives lead to meritless claims and high settlements. He advocated for stricter enforcement of causation requirements in these suits and could influence arbitration provisions, which have been closely split in recent Supreme Court decisions. Judge Gorsuch's judicial opinions suggest a preference for arbitration over litigation, interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) as favoring arbitration. In cases like Howard v. Ferrellgas and Ragab v. Howard, he emphasized the FAA's role in enforcing arbitration clauses, even in the face of conflicting provisions in contracts. Judge Gorsuch's judicial opinions show a strong support for arbitration, citing the FAA's preference for arbitration clauses. He emphasized the importance of arbitration in commercial agreements and highlighted the FAA's preemptive power over state laws that disfavor arbitration. This stance on arbitration and preemption could have significant implications if he is appointed to the Supreme Court. In Cook v. Rockwell International Corp., Judge Gorsuch disagreed with the district court's decision to disallow state law claims, arguing that the federal statute did not expressly preempt all state law tort recoveries for plaintiffs in nuclear incidents. He examined the statute's text, larger statutory structure, and legislative history to support his stance. In Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc., Judge Gorsuch affirmed the dismissal of state tort claims based on federal law preemption. He referenced a Supreme Court test stating that tort suits are not preempted if they parallel duties in the FDCA. Judge Gorsuch affirmed the dismissal of state tort claims in Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc., stating that tort suits are not preempted if they parallel duties in the FDCA. He questioned the definition of \"parallel\" duties and the application of competing statutory interpretations by the Supreme Court. Ultimately, the court found the state law claims preempted due to a lack of parallel federal requirements regarding off-label promotion of a medical device. Judge Gorsuch's views on constitutional civil rights questions are less known compared to Justice Scalia, as he has had fewer opportunities to address such issues directly in cases before the Tenth Circuit. Most of his civil rights decisions have focused on statutory civil rights rather than constitutional limits on affirmative action or equal protection rights for sexual minorities. Judge Gorsuch's civil rights decisions have mainly focused on statutory claims, particularly in employment discrimination cases. His textualist approach to interpreting statutes has led to varying outcomes for individual plaintiffs. However, his views on constitutional civil rights claims, such as equal protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, are less explored in his opinions. Judge Gorsuch's civil rights decisions have mainly focused on statutory claims, particularly in employment discrimination cases. His textualist approach to interpreting statutes has led to varying outcomes for individual plaintiffs. However, his views on constitutional civil rights claims, such as equal protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, are less explored in his opinions. In one opinion, Secsys LLC v. Vigil, Judge Gorsuch discusses equal protection as \"the law's keystone\" and explores the differences between intentional discrimination and discriminatory applications of rules. The case involved a plaintiff corporation alleging deprivation of equal protection by state officials, but Judge Gorsuch rejected the claim, stating that similar subcontracting agreements would have been required from any contractor. Judge Gorsuch's views on constitutional civil rights claims, particularly equal protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, are less explored in his opinions. In a case involving a plaintiff corporation alleging deprivation of equal protection by state officials, Judge Gorsuch rejected the claim, stating that similar subcontracting agreements would have been required from any contractor. He believes that the Constitution's equal protection principles play a crucial role in prohibiting certain government discrimination based on race or sex, but may be more skeptical of interpreting the Equal Protection Clause expansively to shield against previously unrecognized forms of discrimination. Judge Gorsuch has ruled on cases involving equal protection rights, including rejecting a transgender prisoner's claim of discrimination in hormone medication and housing, as well as a transsexual instructor's claim of discrimination in restroom access. He has shown a belief in the Constitution's role in prohibiting government discrimination based on race or sex but may be cautious in expanding the Equal Protection Clause to cover new forms of discrimination. In cases involving equal protection rights, Judge Gorsuch has ruled against transgender individuals, citing precedent for less stringent review. He has also addressed claims under federal civil rights statutes like Title VII. Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence on federal civil rights statutes like Title VII, FMLA, ADEA, ADA, and IDEA is based on textualism and rules-based adjudication. Critics have noted that some of his rulings favored corporate or government entities over discrimination claims of individuals, leading to outcomes where victims' claims were dismissed. Judge Gorsuch's rulings on federal civil rights statutes have been criticized for favoring corporate or government entities over discrimination claims of individuals, resulting in dismissals of victims' claims. However, his views on statutory civil rights protections may be limited in scope as plaintiffs rarely prevail in federal appellate courts, with many decisions leading to unanimous dismissals of cases. Litigation in this area often hinges on specific case facts rather than universal principles, making it challenging to derive overarching opinions from isolated cases. Judge Gorsuch's rulings on federal civil rights statutes have been criticized for favoring corporate or government entities over discrimination claims of individuals. In a specific case, he differed from his colleagues on a FMLA retaliation claim but would have affirmed a decision on a Title VII case due to lack of evidence. In another case, Orr v. City of Albuquerque, he wrote the majority opinion in favor of the plaintiffs after a thorough review of the record. Judge Gorsuch's rulings on federal civil rights statutes have been criticized for favoring corporate or government entities over discrimination claims of individuals. In a specific case, he differed from his colleagues on a FMLA retaliation claim but would have affirmed a decision on a Title VII case due to lack of evidence. In Orr v. City of Albuquerque, he ruled in favor of the plaintiffs based on evidence of illicit discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, suggesting his general judicial philosophy influences his approach to antidiscrimination claims. Judge Gorsuch has questioned the efficacy of the McDonnell Douglas test in federal employment discrimination litigation, criticizing its multipart burden-shifting test. In Paup v. Gear Products, Inc., he acknowledged the test was binding but noted that it diverted attention from the central question of discrimination. Judge Gorsuch has criticized the McDonnell Douglas test in federal employment discrimination cases, arguing that it diverts attention from the central question of discrimination and is not helpful enough to justify its costs and burdens. He has pointed out that the test has limited value and can be confusing and complex to apply, especially outside of motions for summary judgment. Judge Gorsuch has criticized the McDonnell Douglas test in federal employment discrimination cases, stating that it can be confusing and complex to apply. Legal commentators believe that any limits he might impose on the test could lead to significant changes in how employment discrimination lawsuits are handled. In Almond v. Unified School District #501, Gorsuch used a textualist approach in interpreting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, concluding that the Act's expanded accrual period only applied to \"unequal pay for equal work\" claims. In Almond v. Unified School District #501, Judge Gorsuch interpreted the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, limiting its application to \"unequal pay for equal work\" claims. He also ruled in A.F. ex rel. Christine B. v. Espa\u00f1ola Public Schools that a student settling a lawsuit under IDEA couldn't seek the same relief under ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, relying on the plain text of the statutes. In A.F. ex rel. Christine B. v. Espa\u00f1ola Public Schools, Judge Gorsuch interpreted that plaintiffs seeking relief under federal laws must exhaust procedures in IDEA to the same extent as bringing a civil action under IDEA itself. The dissent argued that this interpretation harmed the interests of children protected by IDEA, but Judge Gorsuch's opinion differed based on perceived congressional intent. Justice Scalia had a significant influence on the High Court's jurisprudence in criminal law, often favoring criminal defendants on issues like Fourth Amendment protections, Fifth Amendment self-incrimination, and Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. Judge Gorsuch has heard many criminal cases on the Tenth Circuit, participating in decisions on searches, seizures, and the exclusionary rule. Judge Gorsuch has participated in notable decisions on searches, seizures, the exclusionary rule, and statutory criminal law matters. His views on the Confrontation Clause and self-incrimination rights are less clear. His opinions seem to be shaped by his interpretation of legal texts and the role of courts in applying the law. He does not believe courts should solely define the interaction between criminal suspects and the government. Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence on the Fourth Amendment resembles Justice Scalia's originalist approach. In a 2016 dissenting opinion in United States v. Carloss, he argued that federal agents violated the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights by approaching his house with \"No Trespassing\" signs and knocking for several minutes. Judge Gorsuch disagreed with the defendant's argument that signs revoking implied license to approach a house and knock on the door did not convey this message to an objective officer. He noted that historically, government agents could only enter a home with the owner's permission or legal process. Homeowners could revoke entry licenses at will, and both state officials and private visitors could be liable for trespass. This stance aligns with Gorsuch's originalist approach to the Fourth Amendment. In United States v. Ackerman, Judge Gorsuch ruled that a government search of a defendant's email for child pornography was impermissible, rejecting the \"private search doctrine\" argument. The court emphasized that the Fourth Amendment was violated as the third party had not opened the email to view its contents before forwarding it to the government. The court ruled in United States v. Ackerman that a government search of a defendant's email for child pornography was impermissible, citing a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Judge Gorsuch emphasized the Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, including the use of excessive force during arrests. He relied on Supreme Court precedent, particularly the \"objective reasonableness standard\" from Graham v. Connor, in excessive force cases. Judge Gorsuch applies a test to determine excessive force based on whether the suspect poses an immediate threat, actively resists arrest, or attempts to evade arrest. He has found both excessive force and no excessive force in cases based on the Graham factors. In Herrera v. Bernalillo County Board of County Commissioners, he affirmed that deputies were not entitled to qualified immunity for tackling a non-resisting plaintiff. This decision was based on a clear establishment that the conduct alleged was constitutionally excessive. In Wilson v. City of Lafayette, Judge Gorsuch found qualified immunity protected an officer who used a taser on a fleeing suspect, resulting in death. Despite acknowledging the significant physical intrusion of a taser, the nominee determined the use was not clearly excessive based on the Graham factors, including the suspect actively resisting arrest. In Fisher v. City of Las Cruces, Judge Gorsuch concurred with the majority's use of the Graham factors in an excessive force claim where the plaintiff sustained injuries while being handcuffed after shooting himself. He criticized the majority for deviating from Graham by requiring proof of a 'non-de minimis injury' in addition to satisfying the factors. In United States v. Nicholson, Judge Gorsuch dissented on the application of the exclusionary rule regarding a police officer's mistaken belief in a traffic stop leading to evidence seizure. He argued that not all officer mistakes of law violate the Fourth Amendment. Judge Gorsuch argued in a dissent in United States v. Nicholson that a totality of the circumstances test should be used when the law is ambiguous and an officer's interpretation is reasonable, leading to a flexible view of the exclusionary rule. This view was later supported by the Supreme Court in a different case involving a mistake of law in a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment. In Williams v. Jones, Judge Gorsuch dissented on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, arguing that there is no constitutional entitlement to accept a pretrial plea offer. The Supreme Court later made decisions on similar issues. Three years after Williams, the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes plea bargain negotiations. Judge Gorsuch applied a textualist approach in a case involving the Mandatory Victims Restoration Act, clarifying the court's authority to order restitution within 90 days of sentencing. Judge Gorsuch applied a textualist approach in a case involving the Mandatory Victims Restoration Act, clarifying the court's authority to order restitution within 90 days of sentencing. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia disagreed with this interpretation. The Tenth Circuit's decision in Dolan was affirmed by the court, with Justice Scalia joining a dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Roberts. The disagreement centered on the interpretation of the statutory text regarding restitution, with the Tenth Circuit emphasizing the \"notwithstanding\" clause while Chief Justice Roberts focused on different words in the statute. Judge Gorsuch's textualist approach in criminal statutes focuses on the mens rea requirements, leading to defendant-friendly results. In United States v. Games-Perez, he dissented on whether the government needed to prove a felon's knowledge of their status and firearm possession. The dissenters on the High Court disagreed on restitution timing post-sentencing, emphasizing a 90-day window for action. Judge Gorsuch's textualist approach in criminal statutes focuses on the mens rea requirements, leading to defendant-friendly results. In his dissent in Games-Perez, he argued that the government only needs to prove knowing possession of a firearm. In United States v. Manatau, he interpreted sentencing guidelines leniently, contrary to the government's argument. Judge Gorsuch's approach to statutory criminal law issues focuses on mens rea requirements, emphasizing intention or knowledge of wrongdoing. He interprets the guidelines leniently, restricting liability to cases where an intentional choice to do wrong is present. This defendant-friendly approach aligns with concerns about overcriminalization and resembles Justice Scalia's stance. Judge Gorsuch, like Justice Scalia, utilizes the rule of lenity in interpreting ambiguous criminal statutes, as seen in his 2015 opinion in United States v. Rentz. He emphasizes a text-based interpretation and asserts that the rule of lenity should be applied when ambiguity remains after exhausting all evidence of congressional meaning. Judge Gorsuch supports the rule of lenity in interpreting ambiguous criminal statutes to ensure individuals have fair warning and uphold separation-of-powers principles. He has previously cited this rationale in his opinions, emphasizing the importance of legislative decision-making over prosecution. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, Gorsuch could play a crucial role in environmental law cases. Judge Gorsuch, if confirmed to the Court, may play a critical role in environmental law cases despite his limited record on the subject. The Tenth Circuit, where he currently serves, does not hear many environmental law cases due to jurisdictional limitations. However, Gorsuch has authored opinions challenging federal agency actions related to land management in western states and Yellowstone National Park. Judge Gorsuch has authored or joined opinions in cases challenging federal agency actions related to the management of federal public lands and natural resources. The outcome of environmental cases often hinges on procedural issues like standing, which has impeded environmental litigation at times. While there is no clear trend in his environmental standing jurisprudence, Gorsuch has addressed whether environmental groups or businesses have the right to challenge federal agency actions in court. In Backcountry Hunters & Anglers v. U.S. Forest Service, Judge Gorsuch dismissed the case due to lack of standing. The plaintiffs challenged a Forest Service order allowing motorcycles but not ATVs on certain trails. Gorsuch determined that the appellants lacked a genuine stake in the outcome as their requested action would not further their cause of reducing vehicles on forest trails. In a case involving an environmental group challenging the Bureau of Land Management's decision on a coal mining project in Utah, Judge Gorsuch determined that the group had standing due to potential harm to their members' enjoyment of the land. This decision is part of Gorsuch's involvement in various environmental cases where standing to sue was granted. However, his overall tendencies on environmental standing issues remain unclear due to the limited number of cases. Judge Gorsuch's views on intervention in ongoing litigation are unclear, but he has expressed openness to intervention in cases concerning public lands. He believes in fidelity to the law and the record for all litigants. While he has had limited experience with intervention matters in environmental cases, he has granted standing to environmental groups in some instances. In 2013, Judge Gorsuch dissented from a majority opinion allowing environmental groups to intervene in a lawsuit challenging a Forest Service plan for off-highway vehicle use in Santa Fe National Forest. He argued that the groups' interests were already represented by the government and a shift in the Forest Service's position was speculative. Judge Gorsuch expressed skepticism towards judges deferring to an agency's interpretation of statutes in environmental cases, particularly regarding the Clean Water Act. If his views on Chevron deference prevail, it could have significant implications. If Judge Gorsuch's views on Chevron deference were to prevail at the Court, there is debate on the impact for environmental law. Some believe it could impede federal agencies' efforts to regulate activities affecting the environment. However, Gorsuch's reluctance to defer to agency interpretations could also decrease regulation of environmental statutes. Judicial scrutiny of agency decisions may not necessarily result in less environmental protection. Judge Gorsuch has shown some deference to agencies' interpretations of their own environmental regulations, as seen in United States v. Magnesium Corporation of America. The court upheld the reinterpretation, which imposed more stringent management requirements on mineral processing waste, even though it conflicted with a previous interpretation by the agency. The court upheld EPA's reinterpretation of its regulations, despite conflicting with a previous interpretation, without requiring notice and comment rulemaking procedures. Judge Gorsuch expressed skepticism towards agency interpretative reversals but noted potential concerns with uprooting nontentative interpretations of law. In another case, he showed deference to the BLM's interpretation of its prior order allowing a coal mining project in Utah's Lila Canyon. The court upheld EPA's reinterpretation of regulations without requiring notice and comment rulemaking. Judge Gorsuch showed deference to BLM's interpretation of a prior order allowing a coal mining project in Utah's Lila Canyon, citing Tenth Circuit precedent. Environmental cases may raise constitutional issues, such as the Commerce Clause's impact on state environmental laws. In Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Epel, Judge Gorsuch reviewed a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to Colorado's renewable energy standard, upholding the law based on Supreme Court precedent despite opposition from Justices Scalia and Thomas. Judge Gorsuch upheld Colorado's renewable energy standard based on Supreme Court precedent, suggesting he may be open to arguments against using the dormant Commerce Clause to strike down state environmental laws. This contrasts with Justice Scalia's views on federalism and the division of power between states and the national government. Judge Gorsuch has shown respect for state court decisions and expressed support for abstention, cooperative federalism, and certifying state law questions to state courts in cases involving federalism concerns. His views on federalism are not clearly defined, making it difficult to determine his overall approach in this area of law. Judge Gorsuch's respect for state court decisions and support for abstention, cooperative federalism, and certifying state law questions to state courts is evident in his opinions. In Browder v. City of Albuquerque, he affirmed the denial of qualified immunity for an off-duty police officer involved in a fatal accident, while also discussing when federal courts should abstain from deciding cases where state courts can adequately protect rights. Judge Gorsuch's respect for state court decisions and support for abstention, cooperative federalism, and certifying state law questions to state courts is evident in his opinions. He believes that the Fourteenth Amendment should not be used as a basis for tort law in federal court, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a balance between state and federal courts. Judge Gorsuch's support for cooperative federalism and respect for state court decisions is evident in his federalism jurisprudence, particularly in habeas cases. In his dissent in Williams v. Jones, he criticized a federal intrusion into state judicial functions. In Wood v. Milyard, he held that a state procedural default did not bar relief. In Wood v. Milyard, Judge Gorsuch noted that federal courts must respect state court rules, even though a state procedural default does not bar federal habeas review. He believes in deference to state courts but recognizes limits, especially when state actions conflict with federal court judgments. For example, in Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah & Ouray Reservation v. Utah, he granted an injunction preventing state officials from prosecuting tribe members for crimes on tribal land. Judge Gorsuch granted an injunction preventing state officials from prosecuting Indian tribe members for crimes committed on tribal land, citing the need to protect or effectuate a previous federal judgment. This decision highlights his belief in deference to state courts but also recognizes the limits when state actions conflict with federal court judgments. Judge Gorsuch emphasizes the importance of comity and cooperative federalism while also recognizing the need to uphold the law's promise of finality. He has shown a preference for state courts to decide certain novel matters of state law, as seen in his certification of questions to state courts in cases like Pino v. United States. He has laid out principles for when certification is appropriate, emphasizing the need for novel and determinative questions to be decided by state courts. Judge Gorsuch emphasizes the importance of comity and cooperative federalism, preferring state courts to decide novel matters of state law. He articulates principles for certification, highlighting the need for determinative questions to be decided by state courts. Judge Gorsuch argues for sending questions of state law to state courts to promote cooperative federalism and comity. He has addressed state sovereign immunity in cases like Hill v. Kemp, where he reversed a dismissal based on Eleventh Amendment grounds. He extensively reviewed the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, including Hans v. Louisiana. Judge Gorsuch reviewed Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, including Ex parte Young, which allows suits against state officers for declaratory and injunctive relief. He criticized the complexity of the law but ultimately found that relief in the case was prospective and not barred by the Amendment. Judge Gorsuch concluded that the case was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment and fell within the scope of Ex parte Young. His views on the dormant Commerce Clause align closely with Justice Scalia's, criticizing it as a \"judicial fraud\" and a \"judge-invented rule.\" In Energy & Environment Legal Institute v. Epel, Gorsuch expressed misgivings about the doctrine. Judge Gorsuch criticized the dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence as a \"judicial fraud\" and a \"judge-invented rule,\" aligning closely with Justice Scalia's views. He questioned the authority of judges to strike down state laws that interfere with interstate commerce, calling it incompatible with the Constitution's structure. Judge Gorsuch upheld a state law requiring electricity generators to ensure 20% of electricity sold comes from renewable resources, based on a strict reading of dormant Commerce Clause cases. He criticized dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence as a \"judicial fraud\" and questioned judges' authority to strike down state laws interfering with interstate commerce. Judge Gorsuch's opinion suggests a skeptical reading of the dormant Commerce Clause and an interest in limiting its application to previous cases. In Direct Marketing Association v. Brohl, he argued that a state law imposing obligations on out-of-state retailers did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The appeal involves a claim about the power of precedent in dormant commerce clause cases. Judge Gorsuch's views on the dormant Commerce Clause are clear, but his stance on federalism and federal power compared to Justice Scalia is uncertain. However, his interest in the topic is evident. Judge Gorsuch's interest lies in upholding federal-state comity and deferring to states when necessary. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, he could impact freedom of religion jurisprudence, an area encompassing constitutional and statutory protections. Recent cases have seen Justice Scalia interpreting religious freedom narrowly in terms of the Constitution's establishment clause but broadly in statutory free exercise protections. Judge Gorsuch's views on this matter remain uncertain. Judge Gorsuch has clear views on freedom of religion, particularly regarding the Establishment Clause and the reach of the First Amendment's prohibition on the establishment of a national religion. He has considered the issue of unconstitutional endorsement of religion, using Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's \"reasonable observer test\" to determine government actions that endorse religion. This contrasts with his uncertain views on other areas of law. Judge Gorsuch has criticized expansive interpretations of the reasonable observer test, arguing that they eliminate religious symbols from the public sphere. In a dissent in Green v. Haskell County Board of Commissioners, he disagreed with enjoining a display of the Ten Commandments alongside secular symbols on a courthouse lawn, criticizing the Tenth Circuit's formulation of the test. Judge Gorsuch's dissent in Green v. Haskell County Board of Commissioners criticized perceived errors by the \"unreasonable observer,\" arguing that the county's display of the Ten Commandments was similar to the display upheld in Van Orden v. Perry. He suggested that the Tenth Circuit should reevaluate whether the endorsement test applies to the dispute. Judge Gorsuch dissented in American Atheists, Inc. v. Davenport, criticizing the use of the reasonable observer test in determining the constitutionality of twelve-foot high crosses on public lands. He raised concerns about biased interpretations and errors in the observer's judgment. Judge Gorsuch criticized the use of the reasonable observer test in the case of American Atheists v. Davenport, pointing out biased interpretations and errors in judgment. He disagreed with the panel decision and argued that the test could lead to striking down laws based on misconceptions about religious endorsements. Judge Gorsuch's dissent in American Atheists and Green expresses skepticism towards interpretations of the First Amendment that discourage accommodation for religious views. He favors a restrained approach in Establishment Clause cases and has written on statutory free exercise claims, particularly in challenges under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act related to the contraceptive coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. In the 2013 Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius case, Judge Gorsuch joined a decision that found the ACA contraceptive coverage requirement burdened the organization's free exercise rights. The Tenth Circuit concluded it was not the \"least restrictive means\" to justify a \"compelling governmental interest.\" In the Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius case, the Tenth Circuit found the ACA contraceptive policy burdened the organization's religious beliefs. The Supreme Court affirmed this decision, stating the policy was not the least restrictive means to achieve the government's goals. Judge Gorsuch's concurring opinion focused on procedural matters related to the RFRA. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Hobby Lobby emphasized the importance of religious liberty and deference to sincere religious beliefs. He argued that courts should largely defer to assertions about religious beliefs and that the burden on the plaintiffs did not require the government to affirmatively mandate their actions. Judge Gorsuch's Hobby Lobby concurrence emphasized religious liberty and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) as a \"tie-breaker\" to override legal mandates that encroach on religious beliefs. In Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, he reiterated these themes regarding religious objections to the ACA requirement. Judge Hartz, along with four other judges including Judge Gorsuch, dissented from a decision not to rehear a case involving religious entities objecting to the ACA requirement. The dissent criticized the panel for not acknowledging the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs and minimizing their objections, echoing themes from Judge Gorsuch's Hobby Lobby concurrence. The dissent argued that the majority approach was dangerous to religious liberty. The High Court ordered lower courts to reconsider cases involving religious entities objecting to the ACA contraceptive requirement, emphasizing the importance of accommodating religious beliefs. This action was seen as unusual and reflected the close division of the current Court on free exercise matters. Judge Gorsuch has also emphasized religious accommodation in other statutory free exercise challenges. Judge Gorsuch has shown a pro-plaintiff stance in cases involving prison litigation under RLUIPA, emphasizing the importance of accommodating religious beliefs and rejecting abstract interests as compelling government burdens. In Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of accommodating religious beliefs in prison litigation under RLUIPA. He reinstated claims of an Islamic prisoner denied a halal certified diet, highlighting the inmate's struggle to access food consistent with his religious beliefs. While supportive of religious accommodation, Gorsuch also set limits on statutory free exercise protections. Judge Gorsuch rejected the prisoner's claim that the prison violated his rights under RLUIPA by placing \"jell-o and pudding\" on his tray. He emphasized that winning under laws like RFRA and RLUIPA requires significant effort and does not protect those trying to avoid laws through subterfuge. In another case, he rejected the argument that RFRA protected members of a marijuana distribution conspiracy who claimed it was central to their religion. Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of statutory free exercise laws, like the Establishment Clause, acknowledges the role of religion in society but also sets limits on deference to claimants' interests. The Supreme Court, known for its strong stance on the First Amendment, has had closely divided rulings recently. Judge Gorsuch, if confirmed, could significantly impact the future of free speech law. Judge Gorsuch's work on the Tenth Circuit has touched on free speech issues, particularly in the context of campaign finance regulation and the First Amendment. In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, he joined a ruling that extended First Amendment protection to corporations' religious expressions, drawing comparisons to the Citizens United decision. This could indicate his broader support for similar rulings. Judge Gorsuch's work on the Tenth Circuit has involved free speech issues, including campaign finance regulation and the First Amendment. In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, he supported extending First Amendment protection to corporations' religious expressions, similar to the Citizens United decision. This suggests his broader support for such rulings, although his views on campaign finance laws may not be fully revealed by his past decisions. In v. Hickenlooper, Judge Gorsuch concurred that a Colorado law favoring major party candidates over minor party candidates violated the Equal Protection Clause. He reassured that the ruling did not threaten campaign contribution regulation, citing federal law as a fair model for Colorado to follow. Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of the constitutional freedom of contributing to political campaigns, which is closely tied to the rights of speech and association. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Riddle discusses the lack of strict scrutiny applied to contribution limit challenges, prompting speculation on his stance towards subjecting campaign finance restrictions to the most stringent standard of review. Some scholars interpret his opinion as highlighting confusion in Supreme Court jurisprudence on the level of scrutiny for campaign contributions. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Riddle emphasizes First Amendment interests in campaign contributions, suggesting a disagreement with retired Justice Stevens. He has shown a strong belief in the First Amendment's role in limiting government actions, as seen in cases like Van Deelan v. Johnson. In Van Deelan, Judge Gorsuch emphasized the dangers of government officials suppressing speech, stating that it damages First Amendment liberties and equal treatment. He rejected the argument that tax assessment challenges were not constitutionally protected activity, asserting that the First Amendment extends to all matters, public and private. This aligns him with the Roberts Court's stance on protecting various types of speech. Judge Gorsuch, like the majority of the Roberts Court, supports protecting \"low value\" speech under the First Amendment. In Bustos v. A&E Television Network, he ruled that a prisoner could not sue for defamation over being labeled a gang member on a TV show. Similarly, in Cory v. Allstate Insurance, he sided with promoting press rights over plaintiffs in state tort actions. Judge Gorsuch has a reputation for supporting free speech under the First Amendment. He has dismissed defamation lawsuits citing substantial truthfulness and privacy tort claims on First Amendment grounds. However, he recognizes limits to free speech protections, as seen in his opinion in Mink v. Knox regarding defamation actions aimed at parody. Judge Gorsuch has authored opinions limiting First Amendment lawsuits by government employees on the grounds that the speech occurred as part of their official duties. He has also dissented in cases involving zoning ordinances targeting adult bookstores, arguing for a narrower interpretation of the First Amendment. Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, similar to Justice Scalia's, is rooted in originalism. However, his jurisprudence lacks clarity on the use of foreign law and treaties to interpret the Constitution. In a case involving registered sex offenders, he upheld a Utah law requiring disclosure of online identifiers. Unlike his stance on First Amendment cases, his approach to international law remains uncertain. Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, akin to Justice Scalia's originalism, may lead him to disregard contemporary foreign practices in interpreting the Constitution. However, his stance on international law remains unclear as his Tenth Circuit cases have had minimal involvement with such issues. While he has briefly touched on Second Amendment matters, his views on the relevance of foreign law in U.S. courts are not evident in his judicial writings so far. Judge Gorsuch's references to the Second Amendment in his judicial writings have focused on interpreting federal criminal statutes, particularly in cases like United States v. Games-Perez. However, his views on the scope of Second Amendment protections and the relevance of foreign law in U.S. courts remain unclear. Judge Gorsuch's dissent in Games-Perez called for the Tenth Circuit to overrule the precedent that the government only needs to prove knowing possession of a firearm by felons. He emphasized the importance of mental state requirements in criminal statutes and mentioned the Second Amendment, highlighting that gun possession can be lawful and protected as a constitutional right. Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of mental state requirements in criminal statutes and highlighted gun possession as a constitutional right, calling for the Tenth Circuit to overrule the precedent on proving knowing possession of a firearm by felons. Judge Gorsuch's opinion focused on a text-based interpretation of the statute regarding gun possession, suggesting that the Constitution guarantees the lawful use, carrying, or possession of guns. His opinions may reflect the precedent set by the Supreme Court's decision in Heller. However, other opinions indicate a potential openness to certain restrictions on firearms possession. Judge Gorsuch's opinions suggest a text-based interpretation of gun possession laws, referencing the Supreme Court's decision in Heller. He has quoted Heller's language on restrictions for felons possessing firearms in various cases, signaling awareness of differing views but not necessarily agreement. Judge Gorsuch's opinions on firearms reflect a text-based interpretation of gun possession laws, citing the Supreme Court's Heller decision. He has mentioned firearms in contexts not directly related to Second Amendment claims, indicating a broader perspective on the issue. For example, he rejected a necessity defense in a federal gun charge case and upheld law enforcement actions in another case involving a concealed handgun. These cases suggest Gorsuch's views on gun possession go beyond Second Amendment considerations. The Tenth Circuit upheld law enforcement's reasonable suspicion in a case involving possession of a firearm, despite an exemption in the law. Judge Gorsuch's opinions on firearms show a strict interpretation of gun possession laws, even beyond Second Amendment considerations. Judge Gorsuch's opinions suggest concerns about Congress delegating legislative or judicial responsibilities to the executive branch. He advocates for reinvigorating the non-delegation doctrine to prevent overly broad statutory delegations. He believes vague criminal statutes can lead to the judiciary taking on a legislative role, posing a threat to separation of powers. Judge Gorsuch's formalist approach to separation of powers suggests he would reject functionalist approaches and prioritize strict delineations of governmental powers outlined in the Constitution. His opinions indicate concerns about Congress delegating legislative or judicial responsibilities to the executive branch, advocating for reinvigorating the non-delegation doctrine. Judge Gorsuch's views on separation of powers prioritize strict delineations outlined in the Constitution, rejecting functionalist approaches. He questions Congress delegating legislative or judicial responsibilities to the executive branch and advocates for reinvigorating the non-delegation doctrine. Additionally, he expressed doubts about the distinction between public and private rights in determining claims heard by Article I courts like bankruptcy courts. Judge Gorsuch emphasizes the importance of the separation of legislative and judicial powers as essential for preserving liberty, viewing it as a key aspect of the constitutional design. He believes that dividing government into separate branches with distinct powers is crucial for securing the people's freedom. Judge Gorsuch values the reach of liberty and warns against combining legislative and judicial functions, believing it threatens fair notice and equal protection. He opposes Congress delegating legislative responsibility to the executive branch based on an \"intelligible principle,\" especially in criminal cases. His formalist approach prioritizes individual liberty and challenges to criminal laws involving executive branch definitions. In United States v. Baldwin, Judge Gorsuch criticized the proliferation of criminal prohibitions in the Code of Federal Regulations. He also dissented in United States v. Nichols, arguing that Congress delegated too much authority to the executive branch in applying the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. The framers designed structural impediments to lawmaking to prevent arbitrary power and preserve individual liberty. Judge Gorsuch has objected to executive branch engaging in judicial functions, even when delegated by Congress. He disagreed with Supreme Court precedents in cases involving agency decisions overriding judicial authority. Judge Gorsuch established a presumption of prospectivity to agency exercises of delegated legislative authority, unless Congress clearly authorizes retroactivity. He disagreed with the idea of an executive branch agency overruling a federal court, especially when the agency's reinterpretation of immigration statutes is applied retroactively. In Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch, Judge Gorsuch invalidated retroactive application, citing due process and equal protection concerns. He expressed concerns about executive bureaucracies concentrating federal power and emphasized the need for less deference to powerful agencies in interpreting laws. Judge Gorsuch's concurrence in Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch emphasized the dangers of unchecked disregard of constitutional restrictions by agencies and suggested a more formalist approach to separation-of-powers questions. This approach may lead to closer scrutiny of the boundaries the Constitution places on each branch of government. The Supreme Court has been divided on cases involving the substantive component of the Due Process Clauses, which have led to the recognition of various unenumerated rights such as privacy, abortion, and others. Justice Scalia was critical of substantive due process doctrine, often limiting its scope in majority opinions and dissenting in cases recognizing new fundamental liberty interests. Judge Gorsuch's views on the doctrine are less clear, with limited opinions on substantive due process rights. In a 2011 case, he dismissed substantive due process claims in Kerns v. Bader. Judge Gorsuch, writing for a divided panel, dismissed substantive due process claims regarding a county sheriff obtaining psychiatric records from a local hospital. He ruled that the government's collection of information alone does not violate informational privacy rights. The claim was dismissed on qualified immunity grounds due to the plaintiff's failure to show clear violation of rights. The dissent disagreed, stating individuals have a constitutional right to keep medical records private from law enforcement. Judge Gorsuch dismissed substantive due process claims regarding a county sheriff obtaining psychiatric records from a local hospital, ruling that the government's collection of information alone does not violate informational privacy rights. In a separate opinion, he held that plaintiffs' substantive due process rights were violated in a case involving a police officer causing a crash while racing through city streets. In Browder, Judge Gorsuch upheld a district court order regarding substantive due process claims brought against an officer involved in a crash. He discussed the doctrine's paradoxical nature and emphasized that it should be applied sparingly due to its open-ended nature. The Supreme Court has established the Due Process Clause as the \"home\" for certain fundamental unenumerated rights. Judge Gorsuch emphasized the importance of history, precedent, and the plaintiff's state of mind in determining if a fundamental right has been violated under the Due Process Clause. He also argued that federal courts should abstain from ruling on substantive due process claims if state tort law can provide a remedy, citing reasons of comity and federalism. This discussion in Browder highlights the limits of substantive due process and the need for careful application of the doctrine. The discussion in Browder emphasized the limits of substantive due process and the importance of history, precedent, and the plaintiff's state of mind in determining violations of fundamental rights. Judge Gorsuch's skepticism towards the doctrine was evident in his opinions, signaling a cautious approach to its application in less egregious cases. His extensive writings on fundamental rights and substantive due process can be found in his book \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.\" Judge Gorsuch's book \"The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia\" explores ethical arguments against legalization based on secular moral theory, emphasizing the value of human life and arguing against intentional taking of human life. His writings on euthanasia and assisted suicide were deemed consistent with existing law during his confirmation hearing. In his book, Judge Gorsuch discusses the legal implications of assisted suicide and euthanasia, focusing on the substantive due process doctrine. He examines Supreme Court cases that upheld state laws against these practices, providing insight into his views on fundamental rights. Judge Gorsuch examines the legal implications of assisted suicide and euthanasia, focusing on substantive due process. He discusses challenges to assisted suicide based on historical practices and the methodological disputes surrounding the historical test for substantive due process. Judge Gorsuch applies the historical test broadly, finding limited support for a historical right to assisted suicide. Judge Gorsuch challenges Justices O'Connor and Kennedy's views on the historical test for assisted suicide rights, questioning the level of abstraction needed to recognize a historically based fundamental right. Judge Gorsuch challenges Justices O'Connor and Kennedy's views on the historical test for assisted suicide rights, questioning the level of abstraction needed to recognize a historically based fundamental right. He also examines the \"reasoned judgment\" approach in determining fundamental rights, which focuses on moral reasoning and critical discourse rather than historical norms. This approach has been seen in recent divided Court decisions. Judge Gorsuch questions the \"reasoned judgment\" approach in determining fundamental rights, particularly in the context of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey. He challenges the moral argument and reliance on stare decisis in upholding Roe v. Wade, suggesting open questions about the efficacy of such interpretation methods. Judge Gorsuch questions the basis for a right to assisted suicide, suggesting that Casey should be interpreted based on its narrowest rationale of stare decisis. He warns against recognizing new rights based on broad libertarian concepts, as it could lead to justifying the striking down of laws prohibiting various activities. This challenges broader conceptions of the Due Process Clause and raises questions about unenumerated, fundamental rights. The book critically examines the legal arguments for legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia, raising more questions than providing definitive answers. Judge Gorsuch's writings on the subject may not fully represent his current views, and he has dismissed the idea that they would influence his work as a judge. Judge Gorsuch's limited opinions on the substantive component of the Due Process Clause and his views on the role of the courts suggest he may not interpret it expansively if elevated to the Supreme Court. Unlike Justice Scalia, Gorsuch has not extensively addressed private property rights under the Takings Clause. This is likely due to the Tenth Circuit's limited jurisdiction over takings claims, which are primarily handled by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. If Judge Gorsuch is elevated to the Supreme Court, he could potentially hear takings issues, but there is currently not enough information to evaluate his views on the Takings Clause. The Court of Federal Claims primarily handles takings claims, not the Tenth Circuit where Gorsuch currently serves."
