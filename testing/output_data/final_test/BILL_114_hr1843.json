The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will implement a three-year pilot program with community partners to provide intensive care coordination and supportive services to disabled veteran families lacking access to direct wellness services. Partnership agreements will be made with community partners through a competitive award process to test service delivery efficiencies. The program aims to generate best practices for community care coordination and supportive services. The pilot program with community partners will provide care coordination and services to disabled veteran families lacking access to wellness services. Services include care coordination, outreach, assistance in obtaining VA benefits, and coordinating other public benefits. The pilot program with community partners will provide various public benefits such as marriage counseling, services for children, suicide prevention, substance abuse awareness and treatment, mental health awareness and treatment, financial counseling, anger management counseling, domestic violence awareness and prevention, employment assistance, transportation services, child care, and housing counseling. The pilot program with community partners will offer services like child care, housing counseling, family care plans, strategies for living with PTSD or TBI, emergency financial assistance, and other services to improve the well-being of disabled veteran's families without access to adequate VA services. The program with community partners provides direct services to improve the well-being of disabled veteran families not available through existing programs. Definitions include \"community partner\" as a private nonprofit organization and \"disabled veteran\" as a US citizen with an honorable discharge entitled to disability compensation. The pilot program authorizes $2,500,000 annually for the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist disabled veteran families. A report on the program's results must be submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs before completion, detailing services provided and outcomes achieved, including addressing homelessness, unemployment, and suicide risks. The pilot program authorizes funding to assist disabled veteran families, with a focus on addressing homelessness, unemployment, and suicide risks. Best practices for improving access to supportive services and care coordination are recommended."
