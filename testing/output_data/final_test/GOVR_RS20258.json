    "content": "The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act of 1999, S. 1344, introduced by Senator Trent Lott, aimed to amend ERISA for group health plans and insurance issuers. It required written grievance procedures for complaints not involving coverage determinations. Adverse coverage determinations could be appealed internally by participants and beneficiaries. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act of 1999, S. 1344, allowed participants and beneficiaries to appeal adverse coverage determinations internally. The review process had to be completed within 30 working days, or within 72 hours in cases where delay could jeopardize the claimant's life or health. Expedited reviews required documentation of a medical exigency. S. 1344 required timely notice of decisions for routine and expedited determinations. Plans and issuers had to have procedures for external review for certain adverse coverage determinations. External review was available for decisions based on medical necessity exceeding financial thresholds, risking health, or involving experimental treatments. Claimants had to complete internal review before seeking external review. The external review process required claimants to complete internal review first before filing a written request within 30 working days. An external appeals entity would select an external reviewer who must be appropriately credentialed, unbiased, have expertise in the diagnosis or treatment, receive reasonable compensation, and not be liable for medical determinations. The external reviewer would consider all valid, relevant evidence to determine medical necessity within 30 days, or 72 hours in urgent cases. Their determination would be binding. The Bipartisan Consensus Managed Care Improvement Act of 1999 combined two bills. The Quality Care for the Uninsured Act of 1999 and the Bipartisan Consensus Managed Care Improvement Act of 1999 were combined into one bill, passed by the House of Representatives on October 7, 1999. The bill required group health plans and health insurance issuers to provide an external review process for denied claims, establish new deadlines for internal reviews, and create a formal grievance system. H.R. 2990 would have allowed participants to request internal review of denied claims within 180 days. Reviews would be conducted by named fiduciaries or appropriate individuals, with medical judgment disputes reviewed by a physician. Internal reviews must be completed within 14 days, extendable to 28 days if additional information is needed. Delays that could jeopardize life or health would be avoided. The deadline for review could be extended to 28 days, with expedited review required within 72 hours for life-threatening situations. H.R. 2990 mandated external review processes for benefit denials based on medical necessity or experimental treatment. The Secretary of Labor could establish additional standards, including filing deadlines. Plans could condition external review on exhausting internal processes and charge a filing fee. The plan or issuer could charge a filing fee for external review, not exceeding $25, conducted by a certified external appeal entity. The entity for group health plans had to be certified by the Secretary of Labor or a qualified private standard-setting organization. For state health insurance issuers, certification was required by the applicable state authority. If the state had no certification process, certification could be done by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or a qualified private standard-setting organization. The external appeal entity had to operate through a panel of at least three clinical peers. The external appeal entity must have a panel of at least three clinical peers and sufficient expertise to make timely determinations, within 21 days in normal cases and 72 hours in urgent cases. The entity's decision is binding on the plan and issuer. Additional information can be found in CRS Issue Briefs IB98002, IB98017, and IB98037.
