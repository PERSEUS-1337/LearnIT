    "content": "Leap is a framework proposed for complex transfer learning scenarios, focusing on transferring knowledge across learning processes at a higher level of abstraction. It associates tasks with manifolds and minimizes the expected path length during training. The framework outperforms other methods in meta-learning and transfer learning, particularly in computer vision tasks and reinforcement learning environments like Atari. Transfer learning involves transferring knowledge from one model trained on a set of tasks to another model for a new task. This process relies on the similarity of parameters between the models, limiting its effectiveness to tasks with structural affinity. If tasks do not share this affinity, knowledge transfer may be limited. Meta-learning framework proposed for aggregating information across task geometries during training to avoid catastrophic information loss and facilitate learning of new tasks. Transfer knowledge of learning process itself to distill information from previous tasks and aid in learning new tasks in few-shot learning paradigm. In the few-shot learning paradigm, meta-learning involves rapid adaptation by training a meta-learner through backpropagation. However, backpropagating through numerous gradient steps is impractical and can lead to instability. The geometry of the loss landscape becomes increasingly important as the training process grows longer, especially when adapting to new tasks with multiple gradient steps. Leap is a light-weight framework for meta-learning that can scale beyond few-shot learning without the need for additional gradient steps. It outperforms similar methods in tasks requiring more training steps and shows superior knowledge transfer in reinforcement learning environments. The framework Leap leverages geometrical quantities to transfer knowledge across learning processes by guiding gradient descent. It focuses on the point of initialization and introduces a lightweight algorithm for transfer learning. The framework is based on the idea that transfer learning can be achieved by leveraging information encoded in the geometry of the loss surface. The framework Leap utilizes geometrical quantities to guide gradient descent for transfer learning. It involves a learning objective f mapping parameters to loss values, with different optimizers represented by varying learning rate schedules and preconditioning matrices. The process converges to a stationary point after K gradient steps, with the length of the learning process indicating the quality of the initialization. The length of a learning process is crucial for capturing the path taken on the loss surface during gradient-based learning. By defining the task manifold as the loss surface, we can accurately describe the trajectory of the learning process. The learning process in eq. 1 provides information about the geometry of the loss surface. Gradients pointing in the same direction indicate a well-behaved surface, while opposing gradients indicate an ill-conditioned surface. A framework for transfer learning minimizes the expected gradient path length across tasks to balance local geometries and encourage a short learning process. The learning process aims to minimize the distance for efficient learning. A task manifold M is defined as a submanifold of R n+1 with a smoothly varying inner product to measure path length. The length of a curve on M is accumulated infinitesimal changes along the trajectory. The induced metric on a task manifold M is defined by different constructions, with the Fisher matrix as the Riemann metric for an information geometric interpretation. Gradient descent on this manifold can be seen as a discrete approximation to the scaled gradient flow, aiming to minimize the distance for efficient learning. The gradient path on a task manifold M is defined by the Fisher matrix as the Riemann metric. In practice, a discrete learning process is observed, approximating the gradient path length with cumulative chordal distance BID2. Leap algorithm minimizes the expected path length from an initialization \u03b8 0, converging to a locally Pareto optimal initialization. The pull-forward objective is used to minimize the expected gradient path length. In the transfer learning setting, Leap algorithm leverages the local geometry to transfer knowledge across tasks by aggregating information along observed gradient paths. The use of the length metric leads to faster convergence, enabling gradient descent on the meta objective at minimal cost. Leap algorithm utilizes an initialization for rapid learning convergence. A task is defined as learning to approximate x \u2192 y through data samples. Knowledge transfer between tasks is measured by the shortest expected gradient path distance from a shared initialization. If tasks have convex loss surfaces, an optimal initialization achieves Pareto optimality. In data sparse regimes, a unique optimal initialization is crucial for rapid convergence in learning tasks. The initialization with the shortest expected gradient path distance maximally transfers knowledge across learning processes and achieves Pareto optimality. If tasks have non-convex objectives, the gradient path distance does not differentiate between different levels of final performance, making it necessary to consider other factors. In data sparse regimes, optimal initialization is crucial for rapid convergence in learning tasks. To ensure only initializations with a minimum level of performance are considered, a feasibility constraint is introduced. Leveraging transfer learning, a \"second-best\" initialization provides an upper bound for each task, guiding the search for viable solutions. The meta objective for candidate initialization balances learning processes and trade-offs between gradient paths to achieve equilibrium. The solution to eq. 4 achieves equilibrium by balancing strong pressure on the initialization. Solving eq. 4 efficiently involves obtaining gradient paths from a second-best initialization and incrementally improving upon them. Leap algorithm starts from a shared second-best initialization and constructs baselines for each task in a batch, ultimately finding a solution to the canonical meta objective. The Leap algorithm constructs baselines for each task in a batch to modify the gradient path distance metric, optimizing the initialization forward along task-specific gradient paths. This pull-forward objective leads to incrementally improving the initialization, generating more demanding baselines for further improvement. The Leap algorithm generates more demanding baselines to improve initialization by iterating through a sequence of candidate solutions. Gradient descent onF always yields solutions in \u0398, with learning rates schedules ensuring convergence to a limit point in \u0398. The meta-gradient is approximated analytically for efficient computation. The meta-gradient can be computed analytically during task training by approximating the Jacobians. Empirical evidence suggests that an identity approximation is effective, with the learning rate controlling the quality of the approximation. Ablation studies show that this limitation is relatively loose. The study found that the identity approximation is accurate to four decimal places and remains stable as training steps increase. The meta gradient can be computed asynchronously at negligible cost using stochastic gradient descent during task training, despite noise reducing the convergence rate. In this paper, a stabilizer is added to ensure following the descent direction, speeding up convergence and allowing for larger learning rates. The stabilizer replaces \u2206f i \u03c4 with \u2212|\u2206f i \u03c4 | in eq. 8, reinforcing the descent direction. While not necessary for convergence, it significantly speeds up the process. Transfer learning has been explored in various settings, with the typical approach infusing knowledge into a target model's parameters. Transfer learning involves infusing knowledge from a pretrained source model into a target model's parameters. However, standard transfer learning techniques can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses the ability to perform previously mastered tasks. This issue is exacerbated when there is a high degree of diversity among tasks, making transfer learning less effective than training from scratch. Recent approaches aim to address this by adding regularizing terms to the training objective, which help the model learn parameters that solve new tasks while retaining high performance on previous tasks. Meta-learning focuses on learning the learning process itself, primarily in few-shot learning scenarios. It aims to encode both global task-general and local task-specific information in a single model, which can lead to over-regularization and hinder further task learning. In contrast to standard transfer learning techniques, meta-learning approaches aim to facilitate knowledge transfer and mitigate catastrophic forgetting by learning the learning process itself. Meta-learning algorithms adapt models to new tasks with a few samples. Recent approaches include comparing inputs to samples from previous tasks and parameterizing the training process through a recurrent neural network. Some methods focus on few-shot learning, learning an initialization for the model to adapt to new tasks through gradient updates. The curr_chunk discusses methods like MAML and Reptile that focus on few-shot learning and how they relate to the Leap algorithm. It mentions that Leap reduces to Reptile under certain conditions but performs significantly worse. The curr_chunk discusses experiments on knowledge transfer using Leap, comparing it to other meta-learning methods on the Omniglot dataset. It evaluates Leap's performance in transferring knowledge across alphabets, in a Multi-CV experiment, and in a reinforcement environment. In a demanding reinforcement environment, Leap's performance is evaluated on the Omniglot BID21 dataset, which consists of 50 alphabets treated as distinct tasks. The study compares Leap with other meta-learning methods like MAML, FOMAML, and Reptile, showing that any type of knowledge transfer significantly improves upon random initialization. The experiments vary the number of alphabets used for meta-learning/pretraining and analyze the final performance and convergence rate on held-out tasks. The study compares meta-learning methods like MAML, FOMAML, and Reptile on computer vision tasks, showing that knowledge transfer improves upon random initialization. Reptile and Leap outperform finetuning, with Leap showing better performance as complexity grows. The AUC gap between Reptile and Leap increases with training steps, resulting in a 4 percentage point difference in final validation error. Leveraging geometric information in meta-learning is crucial. To reduce computational burden during meta training, Leap pretrains on each task in the meta batch for one epoch using the energy metric. This approach reaches equivalent performance compared to longer gradient paths or using the length metric. Leap is compared against random initialization, multi-headed finetuning, and non-sequential versions of HAT and Progressive Nets. The Multi-CV experiment is more challenging due to greater task diversity and complexity. Leap outperforms baselines on most transfer learning tasks, except for Facescrub where Progressive Nets perform slightly better. Finetuning and HAT lead to a drop in performance compared to Leap. Leap converges faster and achieves superior final performance on most tasks. It is also applied successfully in a reinforcement learning environment with Atari 2600 games. During meta-training, Leap applies the energy metric to the encoder and samples mini-batches from 27 games with up to 10 action space dimensions. Training on each task for five million steps, Leap generally outperforms random initialization by exploring a useful space faster and more consistently. This improvement is driven by less volatile exploration, leading to shared structures across complex learning processes. Leap outperforms random initialization on both pretraining and out-of-distribution tasks, showcasing its ability to transfer knowledge at a higher level of abstraction. The randomness in the learning process can be mitigated by longer training, leading to improved performance in tasks with larger state spaces. Leap is a framework for knowledge transfer at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on minimizing the expected length of gradient paths for meta-learning. It outperforms finetuning and other meta-learners, showcasing superior generalizing properties. To establish DISPLAYFORM1 with strict inequality for some s, let DISPLAYFORM2 with \u03c8 DISPLAYFORM3. Denote by E \u03c4,i the expectation over gradient paths, DISPLAYFORM4. The meta objective is defined in terms of gradient path energy and length. Every \u03b2 s is small enough to satisfy the gradient descent criteri\u0101 DISPLAYFORM6. There exists \u03b1 i \u03c4 such that DISPLAYFORM8 with at least one strict inequality for some i, \u03c4, s. The inequality is established for p = 2, leading to p = 1 due to monotonicity of the square root. The consequence of monotonicity of the square root is discussed, along with the expansion of terms and the use of first-order Taylor series. The inner product is considered, with a focus on non-negativity and non-zero values. The limit point of \u03a8 s+1 is shown to be the same as that of \u03a8 s for small \u03b2 s, with a comparison made using gradient descent. The Jacobians play a key role in translating changes in \u03b8 i+1 to \u03b8 0 via intermediary Hessians, making them memoryless up to second-order curvature. By controlling curvature with \u03b1 i, we can approximate J i (\u03b8 0 ) \u2248 I n accurately. This approximation is effective in practice and reduces noise injected exponentially with each iteration. Developing a precise low-variance estimator for J i (\u03b8 0 ) is a challenging task beyond the scope of this paper. The approximation of J i (\u03b8 0) \u2248 I n with controlled curvature using \u03b1 i is effective in reducing noise exponentially. A precise estimator for J i (\u03b8 0) is challenging and not covered in this paper. An ablation study on learning rates in the Omniglot experiment was conducted to assess the identity approximation's precision. In the study, the precision of the stabilizer and loss inclusion in the task manifold was evaluated. The relative precision of the first convolutional layer was reported, with no significant variation across layers. The study prioritized reporting how precision varies with the number of gradient steps using stochastic gradient descent. Different learning rates were evaluated across tasks, showing accurate identity approximation for various learning rates. The study evaluated the precision of the stabilizer and loss inclusion in the task manifold, showing consistent precision across layers. Different learning rates were tested, with accurate identity approximation observed for various rates. The results suggest that the identity approximation is a reasonable approach for the problems considered, but caution is advised for different settings. The study also highlighted the importance of specifying a meta learner in the Leap framework. The ablation study conducted on Leap evaluated the importance of task manifold variations, gradient path distance metrics, and stabilizer inclusion in the meta objective. Results show that a richer task manifold and accurate gradient path length approximation lead to better performance. Adding a stabilizer accelerates convergence, with the simplest configuration yielding a meta gradient similar to the update rule used in the experiment. The study on Leap evaluated the impact of task manifold variations, gradient path distance metrics, and stabilizer inclusion in the meta objective. Results show that a richer task manifold and accurate gradient path length approximation improve performance. Adding a stabilizer speeds up convergence, with the simplest configuration yielding a meta gradient similar to the update rule used in the experiment. The configuration identified as parameter space is less efficient in terms of convergence, but extending the task manifold to the loss surface cuts prediction error in half. Using the gradient path length as the distance measure performs better than using the gradient path energy. Data augmentation is applied to all tasks in Omniglot, with each alphabet treated as a distinct task for pretraining. In this study, data augmentation is applied to images by randomly transforming them with scaling, rotation, and cropping. The convolutional neural network architecture used is similar to previous works, with a 3x3 convolution, batch-normalization, ReLU activation, and max-pooling repeated four times. Tasks are defined as 20-class classification problems, with images downsampled to 28x28. The study applies data augmentation to images using random transformations. Tasks are 20-class classification problems with downsampled images. Models are trained using stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.1. Different final linear layers are used for each task, with a convolutional encoder similar to the Omniglot experiment. Leap is compared against various baselines and methods such as multitask finetuning, HAT, and Progressive Nets. Training is done using stochastic gradient descent with cosine annealing, sampling a batch of 10 tasks during meta training. Leap learns an initialization for the convolutional encoder, with the final linear layer randomly initialized for each task. During training, Leap benefits from using more than 1 epoch for task training steps. The initialization is updated after all tasks in the meta batch have been trained to convergence. Training stops if the maximum number of epochs is reached or if validation error does not improve over 10 consecutive gradient steps. Meta training stops if mean validation error does not improve over 10 consecutive batches. Adam BID17 is used for meta gradient update with a learning rate of 0.01, and no dataset augmentation is used. MNIST images are zero padded to 32x32. During meta training, a batch of 16 games is randomly sampled from a pretraining pool of 27 games. Each game in the batch is trained independently for 5 million steps, accumulating the meta gradient across games on the fly. The network is initialized using shared initialization and adapted to actor-critic algorithms by estimating both value function and policy through linear layers connected to a shared convolutional network. Standard practice involves using downsampled 84x84x3 RGB images as input. During meta training, a batch of 16 games is randomly sampled and trained independently for 5 million steps. Leap was trained for 100 steps, equivalent to training 1600 agents for 5 million steps. The meta learned initialization was evaluated on held-out games and games with action spaces larger than 10. Model parameters were updated with RMSProp, using a learning rate of 10^-4. The entropy cost was set to 0.01, rewards were clipped to a maximum of 5.0, and a discounting factor of 0.99 was used. Mean normalized episode scores on Atari games were reported as a moving average over 500 episodes. The performance of Leap (orange) was generally better than random initialization on most games, except for WizardOfWor where random initialization outperformed Leap due to some outlier runs. KungFuMaster, RoadRunner, and Krull have action state spaces twice as large as the largest encountered during pretraining."
