    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Rescue and Emergency Services Prepared for Our Nation's Defense Act\". It includes findings related to emergency services. The Congress acknowledges the global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their increasing availability, and the potential threat they pose to national security. President Clinton's Executive Order in 1997 highlighted the urgency of addressing this issue. The Executive Order declares a national emergency due to the threat of weapons of mass destruction, as highlighted in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The United States is not adequately prepared to respond to such an attack. The United States is enhancing the capability of government and emergency response personnel to prevent and respond to domestic terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Over 40 federal departments are involved in combating terrorism and providing training and assistance to civilian personnel at all levels. The Secretary of Defense has called for preparedness in response to the threat of weapons of mass destruction. The Secretary of Defense has initiated the establishment of Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection elements to assist local emergency responders during incidents involving chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Energy has a Nuclear Emergency Response Team for nuclear or radiological emergencies, and the Department of Defense is training local responders in major cities to prevent and respond to such incidents. The Department of Justice is coordinating training and exercises to enhance local response capabilities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has withdrawn from its role in leading efforts to enhance preparedness for incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Interagency coordination and overlapping jurisdiction are hindering federal initiatives in this area. The Federal Government must address the need for compatible communications capabilities, adequate equipment, and preplanning efforts for emergency response to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Increased planning and training are necessary to enhance emergency response capabilities in port areas and littoral waters. Establishment of Commission. A commission called the \"Commission to Assess Weapons of Mass Destruction Domestic Response Capabilities\" is established with 15 members appointed by various leaders. Members must have expertise in emergency response, and appointments must be made within 30 days of the enactment of the Act. The Commission to Assess Weapons of Mass Destruction Domestic Response Capabilities must hold its first meeting within 30 days of appointments being made. A Chairman will be elected by a majority of the members. SEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION. The Commission is tasked with assessing Federal agency efforts to enhance domestic preparedness for incidents involving weapons of mass destruction, evaluating the progress of Federal training programs for local emergency responses, identifying deficiencies in training programs, recommending strategies for effective coordination between Federal agencies and local response capabilities, and assessing the appropriate role of State and local entities.

Members or agents can act on behalf of the Commission if authorized. SEC. 8. PERSONNEL MATTERS. The Commission members serve without pay but are reimbursed for travel expenses. They can appoint staff without following standard procedures and set their pay accordingly. The Commission can appoint staff and set their pay rates based on regulations from title 5, United States Code. Federal departments can detail personnel to assist the Commission, and temporary services can be procured at specified rates.
