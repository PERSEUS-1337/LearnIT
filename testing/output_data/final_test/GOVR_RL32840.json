The federal government has implemented various programs and policies to enhance BTS. The reports in this series aim to address the challenges in achieving better border and transportation security, propose a framework to understand current programs, and suggest new policy directions. Homeland security efforts are depicted as concentric circles, with preventive measures outside the country being the outermost screen. The continuum of activities for homeland security progresses from distant to closer efforts. The report discusses the progression of border and transportation security efforts, starting with prevention abroad and moving towards more localized measures and emergency preparedness. Congressional concern with terrorism and border security dates back to the 1990s, following a series of terrorist attacks. The 1990s saw a series of terrorist attacks, including the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, Embassy bombings in 1998, and the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Congressional response included inquiries into the terrorist threat and targeted measures for national protection. Efforts continued with the 9/11 Commission report in the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. Efforts to understand the terrorist threat began in 1998 with the creation of three commissions by Congress. These included the Gilmore Commission, the Bremer Commission, and the Hart-Rudman Commission. Structural changes were made after the 9/11 attacks, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the USA PATRIOT ACT. Congress also addressed flaws in the immigration system through legislative measures. After the 9/11 attacks, legislative actions were taken to address flaws in the immigration system, including implementing entry and exit controls, using biometric identifiers in travel documents, and enhancing intelligence sharing among law enforcement agencies. Measures were also put in place to improve airline security and tighten immigration practices through various acts such as the PATRIOT Act, Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, and Maritime Transportation Security Act. Congress has shown interest in broader approaches to address border and transportation security threats, as highlighted by the 9/11 Commission Report and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The report traces the development of programs and policies aimed at enhancing security in various modes of transportation. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, securing the homeland has become a top priority. Border security is crucial in achieving this goal. Prior to the attacks, federal agencies involved in homeland security were fragmented and faced internal performance issues. Communication between agencies was lacking, and technology was inadequate. Congress passed the Homeland Security Act to address some of these issues. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated federal agencies responsible for border and transportation security into a single department under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This included the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Transportation Security Agency (TSA), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The DHS Directorate of BTS is charged with securing borders, terminals, waterways, and transportation systems of the United States. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 consolidated federal agencies into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including CBP, TSA, and ICE. CBP is responsible for securing U.S. borders while facilitating legitimate activities. The DHS is the primary agency for border security, with CBP, the Coast Guard, and TSA focusing on various security programs. CBP, Coast Guard, and TSA are key components of border security under DHS. They secure borders, ports, waterways, and air systems to prevent illegal entry and ensure defense readiness. The focus is on people and goods-related security measures since the terrorist attacks. Since the terrorist attacks, there has been a focus on tightening border security to prevent illegal entry of foreign nationals into the United States. Concerns about lax enforcement of immigration laws have led to calls for stricter measures at the border and during visa screening processes. The U.S. maritime system includes numerous sea and river ports with foreign-owned ships calling at U.S. ports, with particular attention on container ships. The U.S. maritime system focuses on seaport security, with attention on containerships to prevent terrorist infiltration. CBP officers analyze cargo information for targeting, but only a fraction is physically inspected. CBP works with the U.S. Coast Guard at seaports, utilizing programs like CSI to enhance security. Similar efforts are made in air, truck, and rail systems to prevent harmful items from entering the United States. The U.S. government employs various strategies to secure the nation's borders, including pushing the border outwards, hardening it with technology and more agents, making it accessible for legitimate trade and travel, strengthening it with intelligence, and engaging other actors in enforcement efforts. Emphasis has been placed on addressing issues before they reach the border, especially since the terrorist attacks. Since the terrorist attacks, emphasis has been on \"pushing the border out\" to enhance security. In 2004, over 427 million travelers were inspected at U.S. ports of entry, with approximately 62% being foreign nationals. While most travelers are admitted during primary inspections, a small percentage are referred to secondary inspections. The goal is to reduce the need for secondary inspections by pushing out the border, increasing security. Various initiatives like pre-inspections aim to achieve this. Initiatives like pre-inspections aim to push the border out by conducting immigration inspections at foreign ports of embarkation. Congress authorized immigration pre-inspections in 1996, with efforts to preinspect travelers already underway. As of spring 2005, 15 foreign airports participated in the program, with plans to extend it to at least 25 airports. Immigration officers are detailed to foreign airports under this program, with limitations on law enforcement functions in the countries where pre-inspection sites are located. Setting up pre-inspection sites at foreign airports involves diplomatic negotiations with host countries, addressing sovereignty and enforcement of immigration laws. Staffing pre-inspection sites is based on traveler volume, requiring significant resources. Countries with lower traveler volume may still justify having pre-inspection sites based on the number of \"high risk\" travelers. Air carriers must submit passenger manifests in advance to CBP inspectors for closer scrutiny. TSA and ICE have programs that indirectly impact border security. The Computer Aided Passenger Pre-Screening System (CAPPS) analyzes ticket purchasing behavior to identify potential threats among air travelers. Efforts to create a next-generation system (CAPPS II) were scrapped due to privacy concerns. TSA announced plans to test a new program, SecureFlight, for passenger pre-screening. TSA announced plans to test a new passenger pre-screening program called SecureFlight. Under SecureFlight, TSA will check domestic airline passengers' names against terrorist watch lists. Individuals on the watchlist face additional security measures, with a \"no-fly\" match leading to detainment and questioning by law enforcement. The Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) was established in response to terrorist attacks, placing plainclothes law enforcement agents on high-risk flights. In addition to FAMS, security measures for passenger airlines include cockpit door reinforcement and training. Security measures for passenger airlines include hardening cockpit doors, training and arming pilots as Federal Flight Deck Officers, and training flight attendants to handle security threats. CBP focuses on targeting high-risk shipments and securing the entire supply chain, using initiatives to identify high-risk containers in advance of their arrival at the border. Advance Electronic Cargo Manifest Requirement is crucial for accurate information to execute risk-based cargo inspections. To ensure effective risk assessment and targeting procedures, accurate information must be provided to inspectors in a timely manner before shipments reach the border. The 24-hour rule requires the submission of manifest information to Customs 24 hours in advance of vessel cargo being laden at the foreign port. CBP has established regulations for the mandatory electronic submission of cargo manifest data, with specific timeframes for different modes of transportation. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) program was initiated by the U.S. Customs Service in 2002 to secure the supply chain and prevent terrorists from exploiting containers entering the United States. It involves identifying high-risk containers, pre-screening them early in the supply chain, using technology for quick screening, and developing secure containers. CBP officers collaborate with host country customs officers at participating ports under the CSI program. The Container Security Initiative (CSI) program involves collaborating with host country customs officers at participating ports to pre-screen high-risk containers using non-intrusive inspection technology before they are loaded on U.S.-bound ships. Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) offers importers expedited processing of cargo if they comply with CBP requirements for securing their supply chain. C-TPAT participants benefit from fewer cargo inspections. The C-TPAT program requires businesses to conduct a self-assessment of supply chain security, submit a security profile questionnaire to CBP, implement security enhancements, and communicate guidelines to other companies in the supply chain. C-TPAT officials review the security profile, trade compliance history, and past criminal investigations to assess the company's security practices. CBP reviews compliance history and past criminal investigations to address security concerns and reduce risk scores. Efforts to enhance border security include programs like Carrier Consultant, Immigration Security Initiative, Known Shipper, and North American Perimeter Security. The U.S. northern and southwest borders, over 6,000 miles long, lack direct surveillance in some areas, posing vulnerabilities highlighted by terrorist attacks. The southwest border has a history of illegal migrants attempting entry into the U.S. The border patrol has increased manpower and uses various technologies like video cameras, ground sensors, and physical barriers to enhance surveillance at the border. Efforts are underway to improve border technology, including integrating data systems, sharing intelligence, and investing in technology to detect potential threats. Agencies invest in technology to detect harmful items like explosives. Inspectors use portal scanning devices on commercial vehicles to detect radiation. Border patrol uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the Tucson Border Patrol Sector to control illegal migration. Non-intrusive inspection technologies are deployed at ports of entry to assist with cargo examination. Large scale NII technologies include x-ray and gamma ray systems like the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS). The Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System (VACIS) uses gamma rays to produce images of container contents for CBP inspection. It can be stationary or mobile, along with other NII systems like truck x-ray systems, Mobile Sea Container Examination System, and Pallet Gamma Ray system. CBP also deploys nuclear and radiological detection equipment at ports of entry. Congressional mandates and administrative initiatives aim to strengthen border security, such as the U.S.-VISIT program implemented by the former INS in 1996. The U.S.-VISIT program, implemented by INS, aimed to track the arrival and departure of aliens, with a focus on immigration control. After 9/11, border security became the top priority, although tracking visa overstays remained important. The system faced challenges due to the high volume of travelers at U.S. ports of entry. The U.S.-VISIT program began implementation at selected air, sea, and land ports of entry to address the need for biometric identifiers post-9/11. Discussions focused on the best type of biometrics for the program, with current law requiring unique identifiers on travel documents. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established facial recognition as the standard biometric identifier for machine-readable documents. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) determined that two fingerprints and a facial photograph are the most widely available biometrics for testing. Concerns have been raised about the limitations of using only two fingerprints for identifying individuals. CBP and select volunteer importers are testing a new \"smart container\" that can sense changes in the environment to prevent crime and terrorism. Smart containers can detect if someone has broken in and communicate this information to shippers or receivers. CBP provides sensors to be placed inside containers to detect unauthorized entry during transit. Testing involves volunteer importers with containers from Europe and Asia moving through U.S. ports in New York-New Jersey. Efforts to enhance border security include the use of technology such as Integration of Data Systems, Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), Operation Safe Commerce, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Initiatives like NEXUS and SENTRI aim to expedite the inspection process for low-risk travelers and goods at land ports of entry. NEXUS and SENTRI are programs at land ports of entry for low-risk, frequent travelers. NEXUS is at northern ports while SENTRI is at southwest ports. Criteria for selection include identifiable low-risk border crossers and sufficient CBP staff. Eligible travelers must be US citizens, Mexican or Canadian citizens, or legal residents, pass a background check, pay a fee, and follow program rules. Both programs use electronic identifiers like proximity cards or radio transponders. The FAST program is a joint U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico initiative aimed at expediting commerce across the Southwest and Northern borders. It offers pre-approved importers, carriers, and drivers expedited processing through land ports of entry. Participants must be low-risk and have a history of compliance with relevant legislation. Importers and carriers must be C-TPAT certified to participate. Importers, carriers, and drivers must be FAST-certified to participate in expedited processing at land ports of entry. Less-than-truckload FAST shipments cannot be consolidated with non-FAST shipments. Efforts are underway to implement FAST lanes at additional land border crossings. FAST operates in both directions across the Northern border and can also be used for shipments exported from the US into Canada through Partners in Protection. The DHS inherited programs like INSPASS, I-68 Canadian Border Boat Landing Program, and Visa Waiver Program to facilitate legitimate travel and trade. The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the US without a visa, easing consular workloads abroad. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) allows certain foreign nationals to enter the US without a visa, bypassing initial background checks. This has raised concerns about potential loopholes for terrorists. However, the program now requires participants to be enrolled in the U.S.-VISIT program for added security measures. Intelligence is crucial in protecting U.S. borders and national security. Intelligence plays a crucial role in protecting U.S. borders and national security by providing warnings to DHS personnel. It aims to prevent the entry of harmful goods and individuals. However, the events of September 11, 2001, highlighted the importance of a robust intelligence system to avoid potential catastrophes. Traditional foreign and criminal intelligence also contribute to enhancing border security. Intelligence, including traditional foreign entities, plays a vital role in enhancing border security by collecting and disseminating information to prevent the entry of terrorists and dangerous materials into the United States. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is a key tool in the government's counterterrorism efforts, with various agencies contributing entries to the database. The TSDB is a crucial tool in counterterrorism efforts, with contributions from various agencies. It is shared across the U.S. government at the SBU security level triggering protective actions when a \"hit\" occurs. DHS's CBP uses the Automated Targeting System to protect against illicit cargo and potential WMD threats. The DHS's CBP utilizes the Automated Targeting System to effectively target cargo containers for inspection, with the National Targeting Center developing dynamic rules and algorithms to assign risk scores. Intelligence plays a crucial role in protecting U.S. borders by flagging shipments for human inspection. The United States and Canadian governments entered into a joint accord in 1995 to improve border management, contributing to the protection of U.S. borders by providing advance warnings to officials. Domestic intelligence officials collect intelligence within their communities to put international terrorist activities into a local context, emphasizing the importance of wide access to information for state and local law enforcement. The United States and Canadian governments signed the OurShared Border accord in 1995, merging five agencies to focus on border security and enforcement. In 1999, they established the Canada-U.S. Partnership Forum (CUSP) to discuss border management issues and promote cooperation. Key principles include streamlining policies, harmonizing efforts, and collaborating on border management to increase efficiencies. The United States and Canada collaborate on border policies, customs, immigration, law enforcement, and environmental protection. Efforts include a \"smart-border\" declaration with a 32-point plan for securing the border and facilitating the flow of travelers and goods. This includes coordinated law enforcement operations, intelligence sharing, infrastructure improvements, visa policy coordination, and improved processing of refugee and asylum claims. The United States and Mexico signed a joint statement of cooperation on border security and migration in 2001, focusing on security threats, illegal migration disruption, and efficient travel management. They announced a partnership in 2002 to create a \"smart border\" for tighter security and easier travel. The U.S.-Mexico Border Partnership Action Plan includes 22 points for greater cooperation, secure border infrastructure, and integrated computer databases. The United States has also collaborated with the European Union to enhance container security policies. Various policy approaches include pushing the border outward to intercept unwanted people and goods, and making the border more accessible for legitimate travel and trade through programs like C-TPAT, FAST, and NEXUS/SENTRI trusted traveler/frequent crosser programs. The United States has implemented various programs like C-TPAT, CSI, FAST, NEXUS, and passenger pre-inspection to enhance border security and trade. Balancing security with trade and travel requires a layered approach. Efforts to push the border outwards aim to preempt potential attacks and prevent unauthorized entry into the country. The concept of layering is essential in achieving border and transportation security goals. Efforts to harden the border include the use of biometric identifiers in travel documents and smart containers for goods. Intelligence sharing and collaboration with state, local law enforcement, and foreign neighbors are also key measures for better border and transportation security. Despite some gaps in the system, programs and policies have been put in place post-9/11 to enhance security. Efforts to enhance border and transportation security post-9/11 include implementing programs and policies with a sense of urgency to prevent another attack. Existing measures focus on providing a layered approach to security at vulnerable points. This report is part of a series addressing the complexity of border and transportation security challenges. The Carrier Consultant Program (CCP) works with air carriers to prevent illegal entry into the United States using fraudulent documents. CCP aims to eliminate improperly documented aliens at U.S. ports of entry before their departure from foreign ports. The program also identifies illegal or suspect activity at domestic airports related to fraudulent documents, with a focus on reducing illegal migration. CCP has gained increased attention in the post-9/11 era. The I-68 Canadian Border Boat Landing Program allows participants to enter the US by small pleasure boats without inspection. Applicants must undergo an inspection and interview, with their names checked against IBIS and biometrics collected. Approved participants receive a boating permit for the season, allowing entry from Canada without inspection. OARS permits small boat travelers without an I-68 form to enter the US via Canada using videophone stations at public marinas. The Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) are bi-national law enforcement teams targeting cross-border criminal activity, originally created in 1996 along the British Columbia and Washington state border. They focus on crimes involving illicit drugs and have been compared to CBP's Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Immigration Security Initiative (ISI), which intercept national security threats at foreign airports. The terrorist attacks prompted officials to expand IBETs role to include counterterrorism measures. INS Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS) is used at selected international airports for low-risk, frequent travelers. INSPASS records biometric hand geometry for enrollees, who must enter the US on certain visas or under the Visa Waiver Program. CBP officials use data systems to identify potentially inadmissible aliens. CBP officials utilize data systems and databases to identify potentially inadmissible aliens and high-risk commercial goods. The integration and accessibility of these systems are crucial for real-time information processing. The Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) is being developed to track goods entering the country. The Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS) is used along the northern and southwest borders. The Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS) is used by border patrol along the northern and southwest borders, consisting of remote video surveillance cameras mounted on towers. It also includes sensors and an Integrated Computer Assisted Detection (ICAD) database. The Transportation Security Administration's Known Shipper Programs differentiate trusted shippers from unknown ones for closer scrutiny. Mexican nationals crossing the border require a Laser Visa. Mexican nationals entering the United States need a laser visa for short-term visits, valid for ten years and allowing multiple entries. Possession of a laser visa exempts them from the U.S.-VISIT program, ensuring a quick entry. Concerns arise about tighter security measures hindering border crossings, with some advocating for a more open border and the concept of a North American Perimeter Security. The concept of North American Perimeter Security aims to move inspections away from the border, eliminating barriers to the movement of people and goods. P.L. 107-173 called for a study on the feasibility of this program, which would require harmonization of US and Canadian immigration policies. Despite challenges post-9/11, both countries have started harmonizing policies like preinspections and reverse inspections. Operation Safe Commerce (OSC) is a pilot program that aims to improve security procedures for cargo entering the country by identifying supply chain security weaknesses. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are being used for border surveillance along the Arizona/Mexico border as part of the Arizona Border Control (ABC) Initiative launched by DHS in 2004."
