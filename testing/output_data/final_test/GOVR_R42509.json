    "content": "Major developments in the domestic photovoltaic manufacturing sector include technological advances, lower prices for PV modules, and trade frictions with China. These trends have negatively impacted many solar companies, leading to factory closures and bankruptcies. The growth in shale gas production could affect the competitiveness of solar power if natural gas prices remain low, potentially reducing demand for renewable energy. The United States' ability to establish a sustainable domestic PV equipment production base is at risk due to these factors. The U.S. solar manufacturing industry has seen significant growth, with the number of PV systems more than doubling from 2011 to 2013. Government support, including tax incentives and stimulus funding, has played a key role in this expansion. Despite these efforts, solar energy still represents a small portion of the overall energy market. The Obama Administration actively supports greater deployment of solar energy in the U.S. to encourage advanced manufacturing, create skilled jobs, and increase renewable energy technology. Solar energy accounts for 0.5% of U.S. electricity generation despite government involvement. The Administration's investments have expanded manufacturing capabilities for solar panels and new technologies. The text chunk discusses employment trends, international trade flows, and federal policy efforts supporting the solar industry, focusing on solar photovoltaics for small-scale and utility-scale generation. Despite decreasing prices, cost-competitiveness with fossil fuels remains a challenge, especially for utility-scale installations. Residential and business markets show better cost-competitiveness for solar power. The solar PV manufacturing industry is evolving into a global market dominated by a smaller number of producers. Manufacturers aim to reduce the total cost per kilowatt hour by developing proprietary designs for converting sunlight into electricity. While some companies are vertically integrating their production processes, many still rely on extensive supply chains for components like wafers, glass, wires, and racks. Despite the growing popularity of solar systems, falling equipment prices may hinder efforts to sustain a solar manufacturing base in the United States. The solar PV industry has seen significant growth, with global revenue expanding from $2.5 billion in 2000 to $91.3 billion in 2013. PV systems are characterized by their simplicity, long service lifetimes of 10 to 30 years, and modular design. Manufacturers focus on mass production rather than customization, offering various technological approaches to converting sunlight into electricity. The production of crystalline silicon PV systems involves several stages, with polysilicon manufacturing being a key component. Polysilicon, derived from sand, is crucial for making semiconductors that convert sunlight into electricity. It accounts for a significant portion of the cost of a solar panel and is in high demand from the solar PV industry. Large processing plants costing up to $1 billion are required for production, and historically, polysilicon prices have been volatile. Polysilicon production is crucial for making semiconductors in crystalline silicon PV systems. Large processing plants costing up to $1 billion are needed for production. The market is dominated by a few manufacturers, with Chinese and South Korean companies producing nearly half of the world's polysilicon in 2013. Wafer manufacturers shape polysilicon into ingots and then slice them into thin wafers, which are further processed for cell manufacturing. Solar cells are the basic building blocks of a PV system, made by cutting wafers into desired dimensions and shapes. Manufacturers attach copper leads to link cells, with lead area minimization being a key design issue. The U.S. DOE estimated a $40 million investment for a plant producing 120 MW of cells per year in 2011. Modules, weighing 34 to 62 pounds, are created by mounting 60 to 72 cells on a plastic backing within an aluminum frame. Chinese manufacturers dominate module production, accounting for about 70% of global production in 2013. Solar glass, covering solar modules, is crucial for protecting units and maximizing efficiency in converting sunlight to power. Production is capital intensive, with major control by four manufacturers. Module manufacturing can be highly automated or labor-intensive. Thin-film PV technology, using semiconductor materials like a-Si, CIS, CIGS, or CdTe, accounts for 20% of solar PV production. Thin-film PV technology, such as gallium diselenide (CIGS) or cadmium telluride (CdTe), is deposited on a substrate like glass or transparent film in a single-step manufacturing process. These systems have lower efficiency rates (5%-13%) compared to crystalline silicon modules (12%-21%). First Solar is the largest thin-film panel manufacturer in the United States with an annual production capacity of 280 MW. In the United States, solar panel manufacturing relies on a global supply chain for balance of system components, such as batteries, inverters, and mounting hardware, sourced from external suppliers worldwide. PV manufacturers purchase these components at each stage of the value chain. PV manufacturers globally source solar factory equipment from European and U.S. firms like Roth & Rau, Applied Materials, GT Solar, and Oerlikon Solar. Each assembler has different sourcing strategies and levels of vertical integration. SolarWorld in Germany is highly integrated, while some manufacturers focus solely on cell production. Some solar manufacturers are moving towards greater vertical integration to control the manufacturing process and reduce bottlenecks. Labor costs are minimal for U.S. solar cell and module producers, with automation increasing in the module assembly process. International transport costs for finished modules are also low. In 2011, Chinese producers had a slight cost advantage over U.S. producers, but in the U.S. market, China faced a 5% cost disadvantage before antidumping duties. Manufacturers often choose to locate facilities in countries with strong demand and incentives for PV installations, such as Europe (Germany, Italy, Spain) and Japan. These countries make up two-thirds of the world's PV installed capacity. Labor and transportation costs are not the main factors influencing manufacturing facility locations. In 2013, European governments reduced solar incentives, leading to lower demand for solar PV installations in Europe. This affected European solar manufacturing, with Germany's market decreasing significantly. Japan sustained its domestic solar PV market with various inducements like feed-in tariffs and tax incentives. Other countries like South Korea, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines also support their domestic solar manufacturing sectors. The U.S. market for PV products has grown. The U.S. market for PV products has grown, with cumulative PV capacity reaching almost 5 GW in 2013. 23% of new installations were for commercial customers, 60% were utility-scale installations, and 17% were for residential buildings. Manufacturers in the U.S. produced PV modules with a capacity of 715,000 peak kilowatts in 2012, with combined shipments totaling about $7 billion. PV cell and module shipments totaled about $7 billion in 2012, with SolarWorld and First Solar accounting for half of total domestic module production. The U.S. solar manufacturing sector in 2014 consisted of 75 production sites and over 450 additional facilities manufacturing PV components and related products. SolarWorld's Oregon facility is the largest in the U.S., capable of producing 500 MW of solar cells annually. Foreign-based firms like Sanyo Solar and SMA Solar also have PV component plants in the U.S., with manufacturing facilities located across states like California, Oregon, Ohio, and Texas. The PV industry in the United States has manufacturing facilities in California, Oregon, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. SEIA's data from 2014 shows that there were around two dozen facilities producing raw materials or involved in wafer/ingot production, 50 facilities making cells or assembling modules, and 30 involved in solar inverter production. Market challenges have led to bankruptcies and manufacturing consolidations, resulting in some manufacturers reducing, idling, or closing their U.S. operations. Several manufacturers like Suntech, Kyocera, and Schott Solar have reduced or closed their U.S. operations. Hemlock Semiconductor and GE Energy have also abandoned plans for new solar factories in the United States. Some PV production facilities in the U.S. have short life spans, with many closing within five years. However, a few manufacturers have opened new U.S. manufacturing plants or expanded existing ones, such as 1366 Technologies in Massachusetts and Mission Solar in Texas. Stion in Mississippi plans to increase its solar panel manufacturing capacity in 2015, and Suniva started construction on a second solar PV facility in Michigan in 2014. In 2014, Suniva began constructing a second solar PV facility in Michigan. Estimates from 2010 showed that U.S. content accounted for 20% of crystalline silicon modules and 71% of thin-film modules. The solar manufacturing sector supported 32,490 jobs nationwide in 2014, representing one-fifth of U.S. employment in the solar energy sector. The solar energy sector employs 141,317 full-time workers, with 80% involved in various industry segments like installation, sales, project development, research, and finance. However, U.S. government data suggest that PV manufacturing employment is lower than reported. In 2012, there were 12,575 full-time equivalent employees in the U.S. photovoltaic industry, with solar manufacturing jobs remaining flat since then. Most PV cells and modules are made overseas, with domestic producers employing fewer workers. Solar manufacturing in the U.S. employs a small number of workers, with companies like SolarWorld and Suniva having fewer than 1,000 production workers. Despite some growth, the prospects for increased employment in solar manufacturing seem limited. Even with a potential increase in capacity, solar PV manufacturing is unlikely to become a major source of jobs. Employment growth will depend on future demand for solar energy and corporate decisions on production locations. The solar PV industry has seen rapid consolidation globally, with a decrease in manufacturing facilities in the United States and China aiming to reduce the number of producers. Price pressures have led to the closure of some manufacturers, including U.S. firms like Evergreen Solar. Price pressures have driven manufacturers like Evergreen Solar, Solyndra, Solon, and Q-Cells into bankruptcy, leading to layoffs. China dominates the solar module market, exporting 16.7 GW worth $10 billion in 2013. China's domestic solar market grew to 19 GW in 2013, supported by policies like grants and feed-in tariffs. India aims to reach 20 GW of grid-connected solar electricity by 2022 through programs like the National Solar Mission. By 2022, the United States aims to increase solar electricity production through government programs like the National Solar Mission. Six of the top global solar module producers are based in China, with imports of solar cells and panels tripling to $3.6 billion in 2013. U.S. solar panel manufacturers rely heavily on imported components, with most imports coming from Asia. The imposition of U.S. antidumping duties on Chinese-manufactured solar cells in 2012 led to a decline in PV imports in 2013. The United States imports solar panels mainly from Asia, with Mexico's exports declining and South Korean manufacturers reevaluating their business plans. Protracted trade cases involving solar equipment manufacturing have been initiated by multiple countries, including the United States and China. Helios Solar Works and four other companies filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, alleging that Chinese makers of solar cells and modules were selling below-market prices and receiving illegal subsidies. After investigations, tariffs of up to 249.9% were imposed on these products imported from China. The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels due to breaching global trade rules. China retaliated with antidumping and countervailing duties on polysilicon from the U.S. and South Korea. Chinese government issued final antidumping rates on U.S. polysilicon producers, with significant margins for REC Silicon, Hemlock Semiconductor, and MEMC (now SunEdison). China also imposed countervailing duties on U.S. polysilicon. SolarWorld and CASM supported U.S. duties against China in 2011-2012. SolarWorld objected to the scope of the duties, claiming they should have included solar modules made in China with components from other countries like Taiwan. In 2014, SolarWorld filed new antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the ITC and DOC, including both PV cells and modules made in China. In December 2014, the DOC announced antidumping margins for Chinese exporters and countervailing duties. Taiwanese companies faced antidumping duties as well. The ITC confirmed the decision, with new tariffs effective from February 5, 2015. SEIA and CASE opposed the petition, arguing that higher tariffs on Chinese PV imports would harm the U.S. solar industry by increasing costs and eroding profit margins. They attribute any industry injury to factors like polysilicon pricing and thin-film panel competition. SEIA proposed a solution to solar trade frictions between the US and China, suggesting China revoke tariffs on solar imports, the US remove duties for five years, and Chinese manufacturers contribute to a US Solar Manufacturing Settlement Fund. Solar equipment disputes have also involved the EU and India. The United States filed a WTO action against India over domestic content requirements that discriminate against U.S. solar products. U.S. PV exports were $350 million in 2013, down from $1.4 billion in 2010. Japan and Germany were top markets for U.S. solar exports in 2013. U.S. exports of solar products are expected to be led by Canada and Chile in 2015. Tariffs on U.S. solar cells and panels are generally low due to international agreements. The PV value chain faces low tariffs on silicon in leading countries, but non-tariff barriers like local content requirements and import charges can hinder trade. Talks among WTO countries aim to address these barriers. U.S. government programs encourage PV exports. The U.S. government programs encourage the export of renewable energy products, targeting large emerging markets like India. The Export-Import Bank provides direct loans to solar manufacturers, supporting the solar sector with funding for renewable energy technologies. Federal policies also support the domestic solar power sector, including incentives for solar electricity generation and the U.S. solar PV manufacturing industry. Several U.S. government programs aimed at supporting renewable energy manufacturers and solar power generation have expired or are set to expire. These programs include the advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, the Section 1705 Loan Guarantee Program, the investment tax credit, the Section 1603 Treasury Cash Grant Program, and the Sunshot Initiative. The DOE programs supported the solar industry and domestic PV manufacturing through the Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, Section 48C. This provided a 30% tax credit to advanced energy manufacturers investing in new facilities in the U.S. Solar panel manufacturing was a major beneficiary, with companies like Abound Solar, Calisolar, and First Solar receiving credits. Despite the Obama Administration's request for additional funding, Congress did not allocate more money for the program. The Section 1705 loan guarantee program under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided loan guarantees for renewable energy projects, with solar projects accounting for over 80% of the guarantees. Several solar manufacturers, including Solyndra, Abound Solar, and SoloPower, faced financial difficulties and bankruptcy after receiving loans from the program. The Section 1705 loan program, which expired in 2011, did not meet the requirements for its $197 million loan guarantee. 1366 Technologies is the only participant still manufacturing solar PV equipment. The Investment Tax Credit for solar, in place until 2016, allows for a 30% offset of solar system costs through tax credits. In 2009, a new tax option for solar power developers was introduced as part of ARRA, allowing for a direct cash grant in lieu of the federal business energy investment tax credit. The Renewable Energy Parity Act of 2014 aimed to make firms eligible for tax credits for projects under construction before the credit's expiration date. Members of Congress are advocating for modifications to the solar investment tax credit to ensure ongoing projects are completed. The Section 1603 Treasury Grant program expired in 2011, providing cash grants for renewable energy systems. The solar industry debates reducing the solar investment tax credit to 10% in 2017. The U.S. Department of Energy aims for solar energy to contribute 14% of domestic electricity by 2030. The U.S. Department of Energy aims to increase domestic PV manufacturing to provide 14% of electricity by 2030 and 27% by 2050 through various initiatives under the SunShot Initiative, including the PV incubator program, PV supply chain project, Advanced Solar Photovoltaic Manufacturing Initiative (PVMI), and SUNPATH. The DOE's ARPA-E program received $280 million in FY2014 to fund transformative energy research. 1366 Technologies and Applied Materials are among the solar manufacturers receiving federal funding. Solar manufacturing faces challenges such as global competition, falling prices, and plant closures due to difficult business conditions. Shale gas extraction is expected to reduce the cost of electricity generation. The extraction of shale gas is expected to lower electricity generation costs, potentially reducing demand for solar panels. While renewable fuel standards may sustain demand for utility-scale PV installations in some states, the lower cost of gas-fired generation could limit interest. Solar power is competitive in some areas with subsidies, but overall, it still lags behind fossil fuel-generated electricity, especially if subsidies are unavailable or natural gas prices decrease. Modern photovoltaic technology has roots in 19th-century breakthroughs by European and American scientists. The photovoltaic effect was discovered in 1839 by French physicist Alexandre Edmond Becquerel, and the first primitive solar cell was made in 1883 by American inventor Charles Fritts. Progress in solar cell manufacturing began in the 1940s and 1950s, leading to the development of the first commercial photovoltaic cell by three scientists at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. The space race of the 1960s drove demand for solar cells, used to power spacecraft and satellites. First-generation PV firms included Hoffman Electronics, Heliotek, RCA, International Rectifier, and Texas Instruments. Sharp pioneered earth applications for photovoltaics, but the technology remained expensive. The oil crises of the 1970s accelerated the development of modern solar panels by a second generation of PV firms. Exxon entered the field. Major oil and gas companies, including Exxon and ARCO, entered the solar power field in the 1970s. Federal support for solar manufacturing began during the Carter Administration with the Energy Tax Act of 1978. Despite this support, solar PV production in the United States remained small. Despite federal support, solar PV production in the United States struggled in the mid-1980s. President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the Investment Tax Credit to 10% in 1988, leading to a slump in solar manufacturing until 2005. President George W. Bush's Energy Policy Act in 2005 reinstated a 30% ITC for solar energy system installations."
