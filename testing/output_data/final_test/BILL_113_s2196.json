    "content": "The Act titled \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2014\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals under the Public Health Service Act by inserting a new section 224A. The \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2014\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, except for willful misconduct or gross negligence. The \"Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act of 2014\" limits liability for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, except for willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or rendering services under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In civil actions, the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff to show by clear and convincing evidence that the limitation does not apply. This section preempts state laws inconsistent with its provisions. The section provides liability protections for volunteer health care professionals during disasters, preempting state laws that do not offer greater protection. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 is also applicable. Definitions include what constitutes a \"disaster\" under the National Emergencies Act. The section offers liability protections for volunteer health care professionals during emergencies declared by the President or the Secretary under specific acts. The term 'harm' encompasses various types of losses, and a 'health care professional' is defined as someone licensed to practice in one or more states. The term 'State' includes various territories and possessions of the United States, and a 'volunteer' is defined as a health care provider. The term 'volunteer' refers to a health care professional who does not receive compensation exceeding $500 per year for services rendered. Compensation includes payments from insurance or health plans but excludes reimbursement for expenses, paid leave, and items for personal use. The Act and its amendment will take effect 90 days after enactment. It applies to claims for harm caused by healthcare professionals if the harm or conduct occurred after the effective date."
