    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preventing Labor Union Slowdowns Act of 2015\" or the \"PLUS Act.\" It aims to deter labor slowdowns. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to emphasize the importance of international trade and the need for a reliable transportation network, specifically mentioning the impact of labor slowdowns at U.S. ports on commerce. The slowdowns at the ports of the United States have caused significant economic disruptions, affecting both domestic and international commerce. These disruptions hurt the country's reputation in the global economy, leading to a loss of business for U.S. ports and posing a serious threat to the country's financial health and economic stability. The policy of the United States is to address and mitigate these disruptions promptly and provide remedies to those affected. The text chunk discusses the definition of \"employee engaged in maritime employment\" and \"labor slowdown\" in relation to the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. It aims to provide effective remedies for individuals affected by disruptions in the ports of the United States. The text chunk adds provisions related to labor slowdowns in maritime employment, including consequences for violating such provisions. The text chunk amends the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 by specifying penalties for violations under section 8(b)(8) of the National Labor Relations Act. The text chunk clarifies that even if an injured party has waived the right to pursue monetary damages related to a labor slowdown, it will not be a defense under certain circumstances specified in the Labor Management Relations Act."
