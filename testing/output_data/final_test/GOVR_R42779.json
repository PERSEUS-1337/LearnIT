    "content": "Changing economic, social, and political conditions have raised concerns about the United States' global competitiveness. Federal programs and policies, such as the 2007 America COMPETES Act, aim to invest in innovation and address key issues in research, education, workforce development, and more to maintain the country's scientific and technological edge. The America COMPETES Act aimed to invest in innovation through research and development, authorizing significant appropriations for physical sciences, engineering research, and STEM education. Policymakers closely monitored funding levels, with the 2010 COMPETES Act authorizing even higher appropriations for these areas. This report was prepared to help Congress track these trends. The report summarizes authorization levels and funding for selected COMPETES-related accounts across FY2008 to FY2013. For further analysis on COMPETES Acts and related policy issues, readers are referred to various publications by CRS. The report has been updated to reflect FY2009 to FY2013 final funding for COMPETES-related accounts."
