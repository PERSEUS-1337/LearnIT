    "content": "The Supreme Court emphasizes that Congress's intent is crucial in determining federal preemption of state law. The Court considers statutory text, structure, and purpose to discern this intent. The \"presumption against preemption\" canon guides the Court to avoid preempting state law unless Congress clearly intended to do so. The Supreme Court relies on Congress's intent to determine federal preemption of state law. The \"presumption against preemption\" principle is used to avoid preempting state law unless Congress clearly intended to do so. However, the Court has been inconsistent in applying this principle in recent cases, departing from it in express preemption cases in 2016. This shift is attributed to the rise of textualist approaches to statutory interpretation, which question the legitimacy of substantive canons that favor specific outcomes not supported by the statute's text. Prominent textualists question the legitimacy of substantive canons in federal preemption cases. Critics argue that a statute's preemption clause indicates Congress's intent clearly, and should be interpreted based on its ordinary meaning. The Supreme Court, in Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust (2016), adopted this view. Exceptions to the presumption against preemption include cases where states have not traditionally regulated or where the federal government has a significant regulatory presence. The Supreme Court has declined to apply the presumption against preemption in cases where the federal government has a significant regulatory presence. In Buckman Company v. Plaintiffs' Legal Committee, the Court held that federal law preempted state law claims involving fraud against the FDA. Similarly, in Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., the Court ruled that the National Voter Registration Act preempted a state law on voter registration. The Supreme Court has declined to apply the presumption against preemption in cases where the federal government has a significant regulatory presence. In United States v. Locke, the Court held that federal law preempted state regulations in maritime commerce due to the history of significant federal presence in that area. The Supreme Court's stance on the presumption against preemption is unclear, especially in cases where there is a history of significant federal presence. In Wyeth v. Levine, the Court allowed state law claims on drug labeling to proceed despite federal regulation for over a century. This raises questions on whether the presumption applies in fields traditionally regulated by the federal government. The Supreme Court often interprets federal statutes that preempt state laws related to certain subjects, covered by federal laws, or different from federal requirements. Preemption clauses in legislation typically state that federal laws supersede state laws related to specific federal regulatory matters. The Supreme Court interprets federal statutes with preemption clauses that preempt state laws related to specific federal regulatory matters. The Court relies on legislative history and purpose to interpret the scope of preemption clauses, such as those in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Airline Deregulation Act, and the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act. ERISA imposes federal regulations on private employee benefit plans, including reporting obligations, vesting schedules, and duties on plan administrators. The statute preempts state laws that \"relate to\" regulated employee benefit plans, including laws with a \"connection with\" or \"reference to\" such plans. State laws interfering with plan administration are preempted, while indirect effects are not. The Court has established that ERISA preempts state laws that directly impact areas of \"core ERISA concern,\" such as beneficiary designation and health insurance claims disclosure. However, state laws that indirectly affect ERISA plans, like surcharges on insurers and wage mandates for specific employees on public projects, are not preempted unless the effects are particularly \"acute.\" Laws with impermissible references to ERISA plans are also preempted. The Court has established that ERISA preempts state laws that directly impact areas of \"core ERISA concern,\" such as beneficiary designation and health insurance claims disclosure. State laws with impermissible references to ERISA plans are also preempted, as seen in cases like Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Company v. McClendon. ERISA preempts state law claims related to preventing regulated pensions from vesting and requiring employers to maintain health insurance coverage during workers' compensation. The Court has ruled that state laws referencing ERISA plans are preempted, as seen in cases like District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Board of Trade. The Airline Deregulation Act also includes preemption language. The Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) of 1978 deregulated domestic air transportation by eliminating the federal Civil Aeronautics Board's authority over airfares. To prevent state interference, the ADA prohibits states from enacting laws related to air carrier prices, routes, or services. The Supreme Court has applied ERISA standards in interpreting the ADA's preemption clause, ruling that state consumer protection statutes affecting airfares are preempted. The Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (FAAA) also uses \"related to\" preemption language, prohibiting states from enacting laws related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier. The Supreme Court has interpreted this language using the \"connection with\" standard from ERISA and ADA case law, but noted that the clause's \"with respect to\" qualifier narrows the FAAA's preemptive scope. In Rowe v. New Hampshire Motor Transport Association, the Supreme Court significantly narrowed the FAAA's preemptive scope by ruling that certain state laws regulating the delivery of tobacco were preempted. The Court found that a law requiring retailers to use specific recipient-verification services had a \"connection with\" motor carrier services and conflicted with the FAAA's deregulatory objectives. Carriers use recipient-verification services instead of competitive market forces. The FAAA's \"with respect to\" language narrows its preemptive scope. In Dan's City Used Cars, Inc. v. Pelkey, the Court ruled that the FAAA did not preempt state law claims related to towing companies failing to provide proper notice, making false statements, and auctioning cars without consent. The FAAA's preemption clause is similar to the ADA's with one notable change. The Supreme Court ruled in Dan's City Used Cars, Inc. v. Pelkey that the FAAA's preemption clause, which mirrors the ADA's with a key addition, significantly limits its scope. State laws related to storage and disposal of towed vehicles do not qualify as laws \"with respect to the transportation of property.\" The Court's interpretation of \"related to\" preemption clauses focuses on laws that have a connection with federal regulatory concerns. The Supreme Court has established principles for determining when state laws are preempted by federal regulations. State laws must have a direct or acute effect on the federal scheme to be preempted, while laws with only peripheral effects are not preempted. Additionally, state laws that immediately and exclusively act upon a federal matter or require the existence of a federal regulatory scheme for operation may be preempted. Qualifying language in state laws can also limit the scope of preemption clauses. The Supreme Court has interpreted preemption clauses with qualifying language to have a narrower effect. In CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Easterwood, the Court determined that \"covering\" is a more restrictive term than \"related to,\" and federal law will only preempt state law if it substantially subsumes the subject matter. The Court in CSX Transportation, Inc. v. Easterwood held that federal laws did not preempt state law claims regarding inadequate warning devices at a grade crossing. Federal regulations did not substantially subsume the subject of warning device adequacy, allowing state claims to proceed. However, federal law did preempt state claims related to unsafe train speed. The Supreme Court ruled that state law claims about unsafe train speeds were preempted by federal regulations, which comprehensively regulated the issue. Federal statutes preempt state requirements that are different from federal ones, even if entities can comply with both. The Supreme Court's decision in National Meat Association v. Harris established that federal law can preempt state regulations, even if entities can comply with both sets of requirements. The Court interpreted the preemption clause in the Federal Meat Inspection Act to prohibit states from imposing additional or different requirements on meatpackers and slaughterhouses. This ruling emphasized that state regulations that go beyond federal requirements can still be preempted, even if entities can adhere to both sets of rules. The Supreme Court has ruled that state requirements identical to federal ones (\"parallel requirements\") are not preempted. State laws must be \"genuinely equivalent\" to federal laws to avoid preemption. One lower court ruled that state restrictions do not genuinely parallel federal ones if a violation of state law does not also violate federal law. The Supreme Court has clarified that state requirements must be genuinely equivalent to federal laws to avoid preemption. Preemption clauses using \"in addition to, or different than\" language allow states to provide remedies for violations of state requirements even if federal law does not offer such remedies. Federal statutes often preempt state laws, regulations, and standards, leading the Court to determine if these terms include state common law actions. The Supreme Court has clarified that preemption clauses may include state common law duties. In Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, the Court interpreted a preemption clause in the Federal Boat Safety Act as not encompassing common law actions. In Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, the Supreme Court ruled that the phrase \"a law or regulation\" in the Federal Boat Safety Act does not cover state common law claims. The Court reasoned that the term \"law\" paired with \"regulation\" only preempted positive enactments, not common law. The FBSA's savings clause further supported this interpretation. The Court in Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. did not address whether a preemption clause's use of the term \"standard\" included state common law actions. Federal statutes often include \"savings clauses\" to clarify that federal law does not preempt certain state laws. The law on savings clauses is not well-developed and depends on the specific wording of the statutes. Three general categories of savings clauses are discussed: \"anti-preemption provisions,\" \"compliance savings clauses,\" and others. Some savings clauses in federal statutes aim to prevent preemption of certain state laws, labeled as \"anti-preemption provisions.\" These clauses state that state laws are not inconsistent with federal law if they offer greater consumer protection. Courts have addressed these clauses in cases involving the removal of state law actions to federal court. Some courts have used anti-preemption provisions to reject attempts to remove state law actions to federal court. For example, in Bernhard v. Whitney National Bank, the Fifth Circuit relied on such a provision in the Electronic Funds Transfer Act to deny a defendant's removal of state law claims. Federal district courts have also interpreted similar provisions similarly. Savings clauses in federal statutes may not relieve a person from liability under state law, raising questions about their preemptive effect. Some federal statutes contain compliance savings clauses that may impact the preemptive effect on state tort law claims. The Supreme Court has not established a definitive rule on the interpretation of these clauses, but they can narrow the scope of preemption. In Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., the Court used a compliance savings clause in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act to determine that state common law claims against an automobile manufacturer were not expressly preempted. Compliance with federal safety standards does not necessarily exempt individuals from liability under state law. Compliance savings clauses in federal statutes impact the preemptive effect on state tort law claims. The Supreme Court has used these clauses to narrow preemption scope in cases like Geier v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. The Court held that compliance with federal safety standards does not exempt individuals from liability under state law. In cases like Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, the Court has relied on compliance savings clauses to interpret express preemption clauses, but not all savings clauses automatically protect state laws from preemption. Some savings clauses automatically insulate state laws from preemption, limiting a federal statute's preemptive effect on certain laws enacted by states or political subdivisions. The Supreme Court has interpreted these clauses as evincing Congress's intent to disavow field preemption but not preserving state laws conflicting with federal objectives. Savings clauses that apply only to state laws also protect local laws from preemption, as seen in Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier. The Supreme Court interpreted the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Interstate Commerce Act savings clauses to include local ordinances and municipal regulations, respectively, in cases like Mortier and City of Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Service. Congress's reference to the regulatory authority of a \"State\" was understood to preserve traditional state and local regulatory powers unless explicitly stated otherwise. The Supreme Court has recognized two forms of implied preemption: \"field preemption\" when federal regulation precludes state regulation in a specific area, and \"conflict preemption\" when state law interferes with federal goals. Federal law may preempt state law if Congress intends for federal regulation to dominate a specific field. Federal law may preempt state regulation in specific areas through field preemption, where federal interest dominates a regulatory field. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal law occupies various regulatory fields, such as alien registration, nuclear safety, aircraft noise, tanker vessel operations, natural gas wholesales, and locomotive equipment. In the case of Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corporation in 1947, the Court held that federal law preempted fields related to grain warehousing, even prohibiting complementary state laws. The Supreme Court ruled in Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corporation that federal law preempted various fields related to grain warehousing, including unfair pricing and unsafe practices. This was based on Congress's intent to eliminate overlapping federal and state regulations in the Warehouse Act. The Supreme Court ruled in Hines v. Davidowitz that federal law preempts certain state law claims in federally regulated fields, such as alien registration. Federal law's complete regulatory scheme in alien regulation overrides state requirements, as established by the Court. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Arizona v. United States that federal law preempts state requirements in alien registration, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act as a comprehensive regulatory regime that occupies the field. Congress's intent to regulate alien registration was inferred from the INA's full set of standards, leading the Court to hold that federal law preempted even complementary state laws in this area. The Supreme Court has ruled that federal law preempts state laws on alien registration, as seen in the Arizona case. However, the Court has also stated that not all state laws regarding aliens are preempted by federal law. In the De Canas v. Bica case, the Court found that federal law did not preempt a California law prohibiting the employment of aliens without lawful residence. This decision was based on the fact that the Immigration and Nationality Act did not directly regulate the employment of such aliens at the time, indicating that Congress did not intend to preempt all state regulations on alien activities. The Supreme Court has upheld state laws regulating activities of aliens, such as in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting where an Arizona statute was allowed to revoke an employer's license for hiring unauthorized aliens. The Court clarified that not all state laws concerning aliens are preempted by federal law, as seen in the De Canas case. Additionally, the Court has held that federal law preempts nuclear safety regulation but not all state laws affecting safety decisions made by nuclear power plants. State laws fall within the preempted field of nuclear safety regulation if they are motivated by safety concerns and have a direct and substantial effect on safety decisions made by nuclear facilities. The regulatory regime changed significantly after 1954 when the Atomic Energy Act allowed private entities to own and operate nuclear power plants under strict licensing and regulatory oversight by the Atomic Energy Commission. Congress later amended the Act in 1959 to give states greater authority over certain aspects of nuclear energy regulation. The 1959 Amendments allowed states to regulate certain nuclear materials as long as their rules were in line with federal requirements. In 1974, the AEC was replaced by the NRC, giving states more regulatory power. The Supreme Court ruled that state regulations on nuclear power plants not related to safety are not preempted by federal law. The Supreme Court ruled that federal law does not preempt a California statute regulating the construction of new nuclear power plants. The statute requires a state agency's determination on storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Despite arguments from public utilities, the Court held that states can regulate nuclear power plants for non-safety purposes. The California law was upheld as it focused on electricity generation and economic viability of new nuclear power plants. The Supreme Court upheld a California statute regulating new nuclear power plants, focusing on economic viability. In Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp, punitive damages were awarded for plutonium contamination, not preempted by federal law. The Court found that Congress did not provide federal remedies for those injured in nuclear accidents, indicating a belief that state tort remedies were still available. This was supported by a 1957 amendment to the AEA, which partially indemnified power plants for liabilities, assuming plaintiffs could still bring tort claims. As a result, the Court rejected the argument that Congress preempted all state tort claims related to nuclear accidents. The Court in English v. General Electric Company held that federal law did not preempt state tort claims related to nuclear incidents, as long as the state law's effect on safety decisions was not \"direct and substantial.\" The Court rejected the argument that all state laws affecting nuclear safety decisions were preempted, allowing claims alleging retaliation against whistleblowers to proceed. The Court in English v. General Electric Company determined that federal law did not preempt state tort claims related to nuclear incidents unless the state law's impact on safety decisions was \"direct and substantial.\" The Court referenced Silkwood to support its decision, stating that the punitive damages in that case did not fall within the preempted field despite their potential impact on safety decisions. This ruling emphasized that whistleblower retaliation claims were not preempted as they had a less direct and substantial effect on safety decisions compared to the damages in Silkwood. The Court cautioned against hastily inferring that Congress has occupied a field with federal law, as preemption has significant consequences by displacing state laws and regulations. The Court has rejected the argument that the comprehensiveness of a federal regulatory scheme is enough to conclude federal law occupies a field. It relies on legislative history, statutory structure, and the scope of preempted fields. For example, federal nuclear energy regulations do not preempt all state laws in the field unless they have a \"direct and substantial\" effect. The Court has clarified that generally applicable state laws are less likely to be federally preempted than laws targeting specific entities or issues within a field. In cases like O neok, Inc. v. Learjet, Inc., state antitrust claims against natural gas pipelines were deemed outside the preempted field because the law applied broadly. Congress can limit the scope of preempted fields through explicit statutory language, as seen in Pacific Gas where non-safety motivated state laws were not preempted due to statutory provisions. The Supreme Court has clarified that federal law can preempt state laws through \"impossibility preemption\" and \"obstacle preemption.\" Impossibility preemption occurs when it is physically impossible to comply with both sets of laws, while obstacle preemption happens when state laws hinder the full purposes of Congress. The Supreme Court has explained that impossibility preemption occurs when it is physically impossible to comply with both federal and state laws. This principle was illustrated in cases involving prescription drug labeling, where the Court extended the doctrine to preempt certain state law claims against generic drug manufacturers. The manufacturers faced challenges complying with federal and state laws regarding generic drug labels. Plaintiffs claimed adverse effects from generic drugs and argued for additional warnings. The drug manufacturers cited the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which allow for FDA approval of generic drugs based on equivalence to brand-name drugs. Generic drug makers using this process must ensure their labels match those of brand-name drugs. The Court held that generic drug manufacturers cannot unilaterally change their labels, as required by both federal and state laws. This impossibility led to the preemption of state law claims in cases like PLIVA and Bartlett. In PLIVA and Bartlett cases, the Court ruled that generic drug manufacturers cannot comply with both federal and state laws without special permission from the FDA. This impossibility led to the preemption of state law claims. In Wyeth v. Levine, the Court rejected impossibility preemption arguments by brand-name drug manufacturers, allowing them to unilaterally strengthen warning labels. Federal law does not preempt state failure-to-warn claims against brand-name drug manufacturers, unless there is \"clear evidence\" that the FDA would have rejected a label change. Obstacle preemption cases involve state laws that interfere with federal goals. The Court has held that state laws can interfere with federal goals by frustrating Congress's intent to adopt a uniform system of federal regulation or impeding the vindication of a federal right. Obstacle preemption does not justify a \"freewheeling judicial inquiry\" into whether state laws are \"in tension\" with federal objectives. The Supreme Court has concluded that state laws can pose an obstacle to federal objectives by interfering with Congress's decision-making authority. The Court's decision in Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council illustrates conflict between state law and federal policy goals. In Crosby, the Court held that a federal statute imposing sanctions on Burma preempted a Massachusetts statute restricting state agencies' ability to purchase goods from companies doing business with Burma. The Massachusetts law interfered with the federal statute's objectives by imposing a different system of economic pressure against the Burmese political regime. The Massachusetts statute penalized individuals and conduct excluded from federal sanctions, conflicting with federal goals. The state law undermined Congress's intended \"calibration of force\" and compromised the President's diplomacy capacity. The Court has found federal laws establish both a regulatory \"floor\" and \"ceiling\" for certain products and activities. The Court held that federal automobile safety regulations preempted state tort claims regarding negligent design of cars without certain safety features, aiming to give manufacturers flexibility in choosing passive restraints. This decision aimed to lower costs and promote technological development in the industry. The Court held that federal regulations aimed to lower costs, incentivize technological development, and encourage consumer acceptance of airbags. State law claims were preempted due to conflicting with federal goals. However, not all state tort claims regarding automobile safety are preempted, as seen in Williamson v. Mazda Motor of America, Inc. where a different federal safety standard did not preempt a state law claim about seatbelt installation choices. The Court ruled that state tort actions may not conflict with federal regulations if based on minor design and cost concerns. In Felder v. Casey, the Court found that state laws can obstruct federal rights, as seen with Section 1983 claims. The Supreme Court held that state requirements for individuals to provide notice of their claims before bringing suit conflicted with Section 1983's remedial objectives. The Court reasoned that the requirements aimed at minimizing the state's liability conflicted with providing relief to individuals whose constitutional rights are violated by state officials. Additionally, the enforcement of the state statute would lead to different outcomes in Section 1983 litigation based on whether a claim was brought in state or federal court. The Supreme Court has ruled that state laws can conflict with federal laws due to impossibility preemption or posing obstacles to federal goals. The Court considers statutory text, structure, and legislative history to determine the preemptive effect of a statute. State laws can hinder federal goals by imposing stricter requirements than federal law or impeding the vindication of a federal right. Recent developments may narrow obstacle preemption doctrine, with tension between textualist theories of statutory interpretation and the allowance of courts to consult extra-textual evidence. Justice Thomas has criticized the Court for invalidating state laws based on perceived conflicts. The Court's recent additions may signal a narrowing of obstacle preemption doctrine, with Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh viewed as committed textualists. In the case of Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, Justice Gorsuch rejected the idea of appealing to \"abstract and unenacted legislative desires\" not found in a statute's text, aligning with Justice Thomas's skepticism towards obstacle preemption arguments. Justice Gorsuch emphasized that evidence of Congress's preemptive purpose must be found in a statute's text and structure, without endorsing a wholesale repudiation of conflict preemption based on purposes and objectives."
