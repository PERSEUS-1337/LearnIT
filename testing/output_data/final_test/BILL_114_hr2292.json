    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Preserving Rehabilitation Innovation Centers Act of 2015\". Congress finds that in the United States, there are 1,181 inpatient rehabilitation facilities, including a small group of institutions that are leading in rehabilitation care for complex conditions. These institutions are not-for-profit or Government-owned and serve a high volume of Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. Leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions are recognized by the Federal Government for their research contributions to enhance care quality, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. They train medical professionals and provide care nationwide, advancing rehabilitation research efforts. The leading inpatient rehabilitation institutions are recognized for their research contributions, providing cutting-edge medical care, serving as education and training facilities, ensuring high-quality care for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and supporting rural institutions for access to post-acute care. SEC. 3. INDIRECT COSTS PAYMENT FOR REHABILITATION INNOVATION CENTERS. Section 1886(j) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a study on additional payments to rehabilitation innovation centers for higher costs. The Secretary is required to conduct a study by July 1, 2017, to determine if an increase in prospective payment rates is necessary. The Secretary may increase payments to rehabilitation innovation centers to cover additional costs for furnishing items, conducting research, and providing medical training if deemed necessary. The Secretary may provide a percentage increase in payments to rehabilitation innovation centers for additional costs related to items, research, and medical training. A rehabilitation innovation center is defined as a not-for-profit facility meeting specific criteria. The Secretary may provide a percentage increase in payments to rehabilitation innovation centers that meet specific criteria, including holding a federal rehabilitation research and training designation for research projects on traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, or stroke rehabilitation research. The Department of Education may provide a payment increase to rehabilitation facilities meeting certain criteria, including a minimum Medicare case mix index and a specified number of Medicare or Medicaid discharges per year. The facility must be classified as a Government-owned institution under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2010 Provider of Services file and hold a Federal rehabilitation research and training designation for research projects on traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, or stroke rehabilitation research. The facility must meet specific criteria including a minimum Medicare case mix index and a disproportionate share hospital percentage according to the IRF Rate Setting File for the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for Federal Fiscal Year 2012. The Secretary may consider applications from inpatient rehabilitation facilities not meeting specific criteria as of the date of enactment but subsequently meeting them. Additionally, a study and report to Congress on access to rehabilitation care in rural communities in states without a Rehabilitation Innovation Center is required. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on access to rehabilitation care in rural communities in states without a Rehabilitation Innovation Center. A report with recommendations for legislation and administrative action will be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2017."
