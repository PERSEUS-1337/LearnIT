    "content": "The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Act, also known as the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, has the consent of Congress. It is recognized that the system established by the Agreement provides simplification and uniformity for sales and use taxes. This Act aims to authorize states to require remote sellers to collect and remit taxes, as long as they meet certain conditions. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COLLECTION OF SALES AND USE TAXES. Once 10 States comprising at least 20 percent of the total population have petitioned for membership under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, and have been found to be in compliance, any Member State is authorized to require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on remote sales to purchasers in the State. The authorization for states to require sellers to collect sales taxes on remote sales can be terminated if certain conditions are not met. A small business exception exempts sellers with nationwide remote taxable sales under $5,000,000 from this requirement. The seller must collect and remit sales taxes if they meet the $5,000,000 threshold, but have less than $100,000 in gross remote taxable sales nationwide. States must provide reasonable compensation for sellers' expenses related to tax administration. This compensation covers all tax processing costs for remote sellers and lasts for 4 years. The Act requires remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes for remote purchasers in the state. SEC. 5. DETERMINATION BY GOVERNING BOARD AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Any person affected by the Agreement can petition the Governing Board for a determination on implementation issues. They can also seek judicial review in the United States Court of Federal Claims if the petition relates to specific issues outlined in the Agreement. Any person affected by the Agreement can petition the Governing Board for a determination on implementation issues. Judicial review in the United States Court of Federal Claims can be sought if the petition relates to specific issues outlined in the Agreement. If the petition is denied or not acted upon within six months, an action for review must be initiated within 60 days. The court will set aside any actions, findings, and decisions in the review process. The court will set aside actions, findings, and conclusions of the Governing Board if found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with the law. The United States Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over judicial review of determinations of the Governing Board under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. SEC. 6. MINIMUM SIMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Minimum simplification requirements for the Agreement include a centralized registration system for sellers and uniform definitions of products for tax bases. Member States can choose exemptions based on these definitions.
