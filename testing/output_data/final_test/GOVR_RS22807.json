    "content": "CFL sales have significantly increased in the past two years, with 290 million Energy Star-qualified CFLs sold in 2007, nearly double the number from 2006. This represents almost 20% of the U.S. light bulb market, driven by factors such as energy efficiency and longer life. Consumer education and promotion by retail partners like Wal-Mart, Lowe's, and Home Depot have also contributed to the rise in CFL sales. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established energy efficiency standards for certain types of incandescent and fluorescent lamps, specifying maximum wattage based on lumens. The new standard requires incandescent lamps to use no more than 72 watts for comparable lumens, with deadlines between 2012 and 2014. CFLs already meet the energy standard set by the Act. The Energy Act sets energy standards for bulbs, but it does not ban incandescent bulbs or mandate CFL use. Mercury in CFLs is a neurotoxin but essential for efficiency. Fluorescent bulbs contain 2 to 6 milligrams of mercury, which is considered low risk compared to other household products like dental amalgams and thermometers. Concerns have been raised about the potential danger of mercury exposure from CFLs if broken in the home or improperly disposed of. The amount of mercury released by CFLs depends on various factors, with the mercury content becoming bound to the glass as the bulb ages. Mercury is not released during normal use, but may evaporate if a bulb breaks, posing minimal risk. Precautions are advised to prevent spreading mercury vapor. To avoid spreading mercury vapor from broken CFLs, recommended precautions include opening a window, leaving the room for 15 minutes, keeping pregnant women, children, and pets away, using sticky tape to pick up glass fragments, wiping the area with damp paper towels, and disposing of waste in a sealed container outdoors. The Energy Star program recommends using CFLs instead of incandescent bulbs to reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. CFLs emit less mercury and other pollutants, but proper disposal is crucial to minimize additional mercury emissions. The EPA recommends proper disposal of CFLs containing mercury to prevent them from being classified as household hazardous waste. Household consumers should contact their local environmental agency for disposal options. The EPA recommends proper disposal of CFLs containing mercury to prevent them from being classified as household hazardous waste. CFLs should be sealed in two plastic bags before being placed in outdoor trash or a protected outdoor location. Recycling is the preferred method for managing spent CFLs, with various state and regional programs available for recycling options. The EPA is working on expanding disposal options for CFLs to prevent the release of mercury. Recycling opportunities for CFLs are expected to increase as more are disposed of, with efforts to reduce environmental impact during manufacturing, transport, storage, and disposal. The perceived danger of CFLs has been fueled by media reports, including an incident in Prospect, Maine in 2007. The homeowner sought cleanup advice from the Maine DEP after a broken CFL, leading to a $2,000 cleanup estimate. The DEP later admitted unfamiliarity with proper cleanup and disposal of CFLs, posting guidance on their website. The incident in Prospect, Maine involving a broken CFL led to exaggerated media reports about the dangers and costs associated with CFL use and disposal. Claims of potential harm and high cleanup costs were widely repeated, despite no reported fatalities related to mercury exposure in landfills. The incident in Prospect, Maine involving a broken CFL led to exaggerated media reports about the dangers and costs associated with CFL use and disposal. Despite refuted claims, the incident is often cited in discussions about CFL dangers."
