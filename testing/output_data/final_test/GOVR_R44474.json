    "content": "Congress is currently reviewing the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reform Act, which aimed to prioritize \"jointness\" among the services in the Department of Defense. The Senate Armed Services Committee has held hearings on defense reform, and the DOD is conducting its own review, planning to propose legislative changes to Congress soon. After 30 years, a comprehensive review of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation is needed to make the Department of Defense more agile. There is little consensus on specific reforms, but proposals include improving defense acquisition processes, strengthening the Joint Staff, reducing Pentagon staffs, and empowering the services in joint operations. The debate on reforming the Department of Defense (DOD) and the broader national security system lacks consensus on key challenges and solutions. Various ideas exist on how to empower the services in joint operations and whether DOD reorganization alone is sufficient. This complexity reflects differing perspectives on organizational frictions within DOD and national security architecture. Defense experts diagnose critical security challenges based on their experiences, leading to a lack of common understanding on the root causes of these issues. The report outlines the challenges of reforming the Department of Defense and national security system, highlighting the complexity of organizational frictions. It aims to assist Congress in evaluating defense reform proposals and provides a framework to understand the DOD management challenge. The international security environment's complexity has increased, necessitating a reevaluation of defense reform in the current era. The Goldwater-Nichols legislation made significant changes to the Department of Defense, particularly in how military operations are conducted. These changes, such as clarifying the chain of command for joint operations, are fundamental to DOD's current business practices. The Reagan Administration also recognized inefficiencies in the Pentagon and established a Blue Ribbon Commission to address them. Congress may consider these historical reforms as it oversees the Pentagon. The Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management was established in 1985 to study and improve defense management policies and procedures within the Department of Defense. Chaired by David Packard, the commission aimed to identify efficiencies and cost savings, addressing organizational and structural challenges in military operations. In 1980, a U.S. military raid to rescue American hostages in Tehran failed due to helicopter issues at Desert One. This highlighted the need for significant reforms in the Department of Defense. The 1980 U.S. military raid to rescue American hostages in Tehran failed at Desert One due to operational issues. The mission was aborted, resulting in the loss of eight military personnel, seven helicopters, and one C-130 aircraft. The after-action reviews revealed that the key problem was the inability of the services to operate together, with separate training and lack of clear command and control procedures. The 1983 U.S. military operation in Grenada, Operation Urgent Fury, was seen as a success but had tactical and operational shortcomings. The inability of the military services to work together effectively was a key issue, with separate training and no clear command and control procedures. President's National Security Advisor highlighted that interservice interests prioritized individual services over joint mission requirements. Shortcomings in communication between different U.S. military services during the Grenada mission led to significant issues. Army units struggled to coordinate with sailors on the USS Guam for naval air support, resorting to drastic measures like borrowing a Navy UHF radio without proper clearance codes. One frustrated officer even used a civilian pay phone to call Fort Bragg for help. The lack of coordination between the Army and Navy during the Grenada mission was attributed to joint equipment and communication issues. Fire support from the Navy to the Army was deemed a serious problem, with poor coordination and inadequate planning leading to unnecessary casualties due to a lack of intelligence and mapping capabilities. The lack of intelligence during the Grenada mission led to accidental attacks on a mental hospital and a brigade headquarters, causing casualties. Despite the success of the operation, organizational shortcomings were identified, highlighting deficiencies in joint deployment capabilities. The Senate study emphasized the need to address these issues for future missions. The Grenada mission revealed organizational shortcomings in coordinating communications and joint operations. The lack of unity and compatibility in equipment led to the need for elaborate coordinating mechanisms. The Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983 also exposed significant chain of command deficiencies. The Marine mission in Lebanon revealed significant chain of command deficiencies, with the Unified Combatant Commander having limited authority to improve standards for service components from different services. Despite efforts to enhance security, the actual authority of U.S. European Command was limited, as General Smith noted that the Marines did not directly work for him. Prior to the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, the services had a larger role in military campaigns. The operational chain of command led from the President to the Unified Combatant Commanders via the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Services had component commands within Combatant Commander's areas of responsibility. Before the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, services had more control in military campaigns. Component commands within Combatant Commander's areas often prioritized orders from their service's headquarters in Washington over those of the Unified Combatant Commander. This led to potential confusion and conflict, as seen during U.S. operations in Lebanon where units reported directly to the Pentagon, bypassing EUCOM. The Pentagon received orders for the carrier battle group off Lebanon directly from the Chief of Naval Operations, bypassing the operational chain of command. The Desert One, Grenada, and Marine Barracks bombing incidents highlighted systemic issues hindering successful joint operations in the Department of Defense. Congress identified problems with the operational chain of command, military advice to civilian leaders, and service dominance, leading to calls for significant reforms. The Packard Commission's efficiency-focused reforms were deemed necessary by many in Congress. The Packard Commission's efficiency-focused reforms were seen as necessary but not sufficient to address the challenges facing the Pentagon. Concerns about operational shortcomings led to calls for significant restructuring of the Pentagon's organizational design. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff David Jones emphasized the need for an organizational structure that supports proper strategy, planning, and warfighting capabilities. Independent reviews by the House and Senate Armed Services committees were conducted over almost five years to assess the Pentagon's structure, processes, and incentives. The Goldwater-Nichols Act aimed to improve the Department of Defense's effectiveness by promoting interoperability among military services at strategic and operational levels. Congress concluded that the Pentagon's structure prioritized individual military services, leading to inter-service rivalry and operational failures. The Act sought to reorganize the Department in line with the National Security Act of 1947. The National Security Act of 1947 aimed to reorganize the Department of Defense, strengthen civilian authority, improve military advice to key decision-makers, clarify responsibilities of combatant commanders, ensure their authority matches their responsibilities, enhance strategic planning and resource utilization, improve joint officer management, and overall enhance military operations and Department administration. The National Security Act of 1947 aimed to reorganize the Department of Defense and improve military operations. It clarified the chain of command, gave service chiefs training and equipping responsibilities, elevated the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, required joint credit for strategic leadership roles, and promoted collaboration in developing capability requirements and acquisition. The Goldwater-Nichols Act aimed to improve military collaboration in developing capability requirements and acquisition programs. Despite initial opposition, the legislation passed by one vote and led to successful military operations like Operation Desert Storm. The act clarified the operational chain of command and advanced jointness in the military. The Goldwater-Nichols legislation, a result of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, was instrumental in the success of military operations like Operation Desert Storm. It promoted collaboration and teamwork among different branches of the military, clarifying the chain of command and enhancing jointness. This was evident in missions like Operation Provide Comfort, where command relationships were clear, bypassing component commanders for direct reporting to the CINC. The Goldwater-Nichols Act streamlined military operations by promoting collaboration and teamwork among branches, clarifying the chain of command. However, some critics argue that it may have prioritized joint over individual service requirements too much, leading to concerns about the development of officers with a balanced mix of experiences. The Goldwater-Nichols Act aimed to improve military operations through joint collaboration, but critics argue it did not address inefficiencies in defense spending or reduce staffing growth. While some believe it enhanced military advice quality, others feel further reforms were needed to meet post-Cold War challenges. The Goldwater-Nichols Act emphasized the importance of interagency collaboration for successful military and stability operations. Despite being praised for effective defense management, there are differing opinions on its overall impact and potential unintended consequences. Since the enactment of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, the strategic environment has changed significantly with events like the end of the Cold War and the September 11 terror attacks leading to global crisis management and counterinsurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The legislation has sparked debates on defense reform, with some believing it fell short in certain areas while others argue it had unintended consequences. The international security environment has become more complex and unpredictable in recent years, challenging the United States to respond to diverse requirements. Recent events include the rise of the Islamic State, drug cartels in South and Central America, Russian-backed proxy warfare in Ukraine, North Korean aggression, Chinese activities in the South China Sea, terror attacks in Europe, the civil war in Syria, and the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter noted the dramatic security environment in March 2016. The House Armed Services Committee in March 2016 highlighted the need for new ways of thinking and acting in response to the diverse and complex security challenges of today. These challenges develop rapidly, have significant impacts on U.S. interests and allies, and often require simultaneous responses. Adversaries are employing provocative tactics that do not necessarily warrant a large-scale military response, leading to the need for adaptation in defense institutions to operate effectively in \"grey zone\" conflict spaces. The changing international security landscape, characterized by complex challenges where adversaries are not easily identifiable, is placing increasing demands on the U.S. national security architecture and the Department of Defense. This is happening amidst fiscal restrictions on the DOD budget, leading to concerns about the aging equipment, declining Navy size, rising personnel entitlements, and other stressors on the force. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has caused significant constraints on the Department of Defense's ability to address challenges in personnel, acquisition, and force structure. These budget cuts have led to investment shortfalls in military readiness and capabilities, posing risks to forces, posture, and security. The United States spends over $600 billion annually on the Department of Defense, leading to concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of the defense enterprise. Reform of DOD's acquisition systems is seen as necessary to improve military agility and response to technological challenges. The current international security environment is characterized by increased and dynamic security challenges. Despite a large DOD budget, fiscal constraints have impacted force readiness. Scholars note rising requirements with stagnant resources, raising concerns about DOD's ability to meet future threats. Congress is reviewing the Goldwater-Nichols legislation and DOD's organization in light of these challenges. Observers approach DOD's organization and structure differently based on their experiences. Questions driving the examination include challenges in translating victories into political outcomes and low force readiness despite high defense spending. The readiness of the force is critically low, with production of platforms and capabilities falling short of requirements. The Department of Defense faces challenges in formulating strategies and policies quickly to adapt to dynamic threats. Difficulties in executing current military operations and planning for future capabilities are systemic in nature. The challenges faced by the Department of Defense suggest the need for a serious review of its organizational architecture and culture. DOD's mission is to provide military forces to deter war and protect the country's security by planning for current and future threats, preparing military forces, managing a budget, and articulating acceptable levels of risk. Reforming the DOD has been the subject of numerous studies with thousands of recommendations, highlighting the complexity of the task. The Department of Defense is a challenging organization to manage, with various reform approaches proposed over its history. One approach advocates for centralization to improve interoperability, while another favors decentralization with semi-autonomous military services guided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. The current structure of the Department of Defense's major staffs represents a mix of different management models, leading to a diffusion of authority and hindering the organization's ability to transform internally. The Department of Defense's major staffs have a complex management structure that hinders internal transformation. The Secretary of Defense oversees requirements, capabilities, and costs, which are crucial for DOD's activities. The Department of Defense must manage costs and risks associated with its worldwide operations, personnel, facilities, and processes. With over 3 million employees and numerous buildings worldwide, balancing its activities is challenging. Each point of the triangle in Figure 1 represents DOD's actions and programs. The Department of Defense faces a complex management challenge with its worldwide operations involving various organizations and stakeholders. Reforming one aspect of the Department may lead to unintended consequences, necessitating further reform. Efficiency and effectiveness are often conflated in the defense reform debate. Scholars and practitioners argue that improving the Department of Defense's efficiency will also enhance its effectiveness. However, it is important to note that while these objectives are related, they are not the same. Pursuing both goals simultaneously can lead to conflicting outcomes if not carefully managed. The Department of Defense's acquisition workforce must effectively manage contracts worth over $300 billion annually for weapons systems, military bases, consulting services, and more. A skilled workforce is crucial for military readiness, buying power, and long-term savings. Concerns in the 1980s led to a reduction in personnel to address under-skilled and over-manned issues. In the 1990s, the Department of Defense reduced the acquisition workforce by 14% and began relying on contractors. This led to a lack of critical skill sets, making the workforce ill-prepared for complex contracting requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan. Efforts to reconstitute the workforce started in 2009 to address capacity issues. Defense reformers have long advocated for reducing the size of headquarters. Defense reformers have advocated for reducing DOD bureaucracy and headquarters staff to improve decision-making, agility, and cost control. Despite efforts to reduce headquarters staff by 25%, implementing these reductions has been challenging due to mandated roles and missions within the Department. The Department of Defense faces challenges with staff reductions leading to overworked employees and potential compromise of effectiveness unless functions are divested. Cutting staff without needed reforms may not improve effectiveness and hinder collaboration across organizational lines. Efforts to improve fiscal efficiency must consider the impact on overall mission effectiveness to avoid significant challenges. Some observers believe the Department of Defense is bloated with excessive staff at higher levels. The Department of Defense is seen as bloated with excessive staff at higher levels, but many believe that these staffs are responsible for critical tasks. Cutting staff without necessary reforms may hinder mission effectiveness. Scholars and practitioners agree that DOD must be better equipped to respond to strategic challenges. The Department of Defense faces challenges in responding to complex contingencies worldwide, requiring rapid adaptation and agility. Key leaders emphasize the need for both strength and agility in military capabilities. Strategic integration is highlighted as a current challenge, focusing on improving the ability to fight as a joint force. The Department of Defense is facing challenges in strategic integration to confront various threats globally. The Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights key organizational problems within the Defense Department that need to be overcome for better planning and decision-making processes. The Defense Department is facing challenges in strategic integration to confront global threats. Key organizational problems include inefficiency and outdated systems, hindering the ability to keep pace with adversaries. Experts suggest that defense reform efforts should prioritize civilian control and modernization. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasized the need for practical updates in defense reform, ensuring military advice remains independent of politics. He highlighted the importance of balancing service equities and jointness, suggesting improvements in involving service chiefs in decision-making and strengthening the capability of the Chairman and Joint Chiefs to support combatant commands. Secretary Carter emphasized the need for defense reform to enhance execution across combatant commands amidst evolving threats. DOD will augment internal processes and propose statutory changes to Congress. There is no consensus on specific recommendations to address Pentagon challenges, with experts and scholars proposing various reform ideas. Practitioners in the defense and national security policy community have proposed various reform ideas to address Pentagon challenges. These suggestions have been grouped into categories such as managing costs, formulating requirements, building capabilities, and reforming the interagency national security system. The aim is to bring analytic coherence and clarity to the discussion on defense reform. During the second session of the 114th Congress, the Senate Armed Services Committee discussed reform areas within the Department of Defense. National security experts proposed over 160 recommendations for Pentagon reform, highlighting broken processes in formulating strategies to address security challenges. The Senate Armed Services Committee discussed reform areas within the Department of Defense, with over 160 recommendations proposed for Pentagon reform. Recommendations include improving strategy-making by generating better strategy documents and reforming central institutions for strategy formulation. Suggestions include creating an Operations versus Plans division of labor and institutionalizing \"red teaming\" of strategies. The Senate Armed Services Committee discussed over 160 recommendations for Pentagon reform, including improving strategy-making and restructuring DOD organization. Proposals included elevating United States Cyber Command and revisiting regions of responsibility for Combatant Commands. The Senate Armed Services Committee discussed proposals for Pentagon reform, including giving Service Secretaries more authority for military operations, retaining current staff structures, and disestablishing service component commands. Some recommended against diminishing the Secretary of Defense's authority. Other proposals included elevating U.S. Special Operations Command and creating a new U.S. cyber entity. Proposals for Pentagon reform include creating a new U.S. cyber service, establishing a separate Joint General Staff, reforming Special Operations Command, reviewing roles and missions for space, and streamlining decision-making by removing unnecessary management layers. Proposals for Pentagon reform aim to streamline decision-making by reducing management layers, empowering the DOD workforce, and extending the tenure of key leadership positions. Proposals for Pentagon reform include extending the tenure of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to address issues with DOD finances and efficiency. Efforts have been focused on controlling costs and finding more efficient ways to operate, with recent proposals emphasizing acquisition reform and improvements in DOD's financial management. Proposals for Pentagon reform in the 114th Congress focus on acquisition reform and improving efficiency in defense budgets. Recommendations include cutting programs behind schedule, minimizing documentation requirements, avoiding unnecessary features in procurements, shifting jobs to civilians or contractors, reviewing command relationships for cost savings, and improving collaboration with industry. Proposals for Pentagon reform in the 114th Congress include loosening information sharing requirements, revising contract incentives, reauthorizing public-private competitions, and encouraging industry leaders to serve in DOD. Other proposals focus on improving business practices, cutting overhead/civilian workforce management, and creating a Deputy Secretary position for business transformation. Proposals for Pentagon reform in the 114th Congress include cutting overhead/civilian workforce management by establishing a performance management system, increasing compensation for high-level civilians, downsizing inefficient healthcare systems, and combining agencies. Recommendations also address acquiring the right personnel and materiel capabilities to meet security challenges through military personnel management, training, and leveraging emerging technologies. Proposals for Pentagon reform in the 114th Congress focus on military personnel management and training, leveraging emerging technologies, and prioritizing key skill sets. Suggestions include improving military career paths, creating more flexibility in military careers, and prioritizing key skill sets for capability development. Proposals for Pentagon reform in the 114th Congress include prioritizing key skill sets such as strategic-level thinking, psychological resilience, and foreign language requirements. Building and leveraging technology through rapid prototyping and adopting a more tolerant approach to risk and failure. Revisiting force structure decisions by increasing military size, maintaining superiority in various warfare domains, and focusing on specific warfare types for different branches. The 114th Congress is considering Pentagon reform proposals, including prioritizing key skill sets like strategic-level thinking and foreign language requirements. Recommendations also suggest revisiting interagency national security structures to better synchronize DOD efforts with other U.S. government departments and agencies. This is seen as crucial for addressing emerging threats effectively. The 114th Congress is considering Pentagon reform proposals to synchronize DOD efforts with other U.S. government departments and agencies. Suggestions include adjusting Combatant Command headquarters for increased collaboration, merging State and Defense Departments at the regional level, expanding State Department advisors at Combatant Commands, and strengthening interagency institutions. Some recommendations for Pentagon reform include increasing funding for the National Security Council and designing a \"Goldwater-Nichols\" act for interagency coordination. However, there are concerns that certain proposals, like establishing a Joint General Staff, could diminish the Secretary of Defense's control. There is debate over the need for a broader interagency national security reform and whether top-down organizational changes would be counterproductive. In the fall of 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter initiated a comprehensive review of Goldwater-Nichols legislation and related organizational issues in the DOD. Working groups were established to assess key issue areas and find opportunities for efficiencies. Recommendations for strengthening the Chairman's capability to support the Secretary in management, planning, and execution across Combatant Commands were made. The Department aims to enhance the Chairman's support in management, planning, and execution across Combatant Commands without placing the chairman in the chain of command. This involves delegating authority from the Secretary to the Chairman to prioritize military activities and resources. Legislative proposals will clarify the Secretary's discretionary authority for delegation. Additionally, efforts will focus on strengthening the Joint Staff's capability in strategy development for operational plans and military alternatives. Staffing for Regional and Functional Matters will be reviewed and streamlined for improved efficiency. Improved staffing for Regional and Functional Matters: Streamlining organization of DOD \"communities of interest\" to reduce duplication, align roles, and relationships. Analyzing functions like logistics, intelligence, and plans for redundancies and cost-saving opportunities. Reviewing strategic guidance documents for clarity and cohesion. The curr_chunk discusses the reevaluation of defense strategy processes, elevating Cyber Command to a unified combatant command, and retaining the relationship between CYBERCOM and the National Security Agency. The focus is on reducing complexity, improving clarity, and streamlining operations within the Department of Defense. The curr_chunk recommends maintaining relationships between CYBERCOM and DOD/Service organizations, assessing cyber organizations for mission effectiveness, and considering organizational changes for efficiency. It advises against establishing a General Staff, as it could create a new bureaucracy and be less responsive to military needs. The review team, supported by DOD leaders, opposes placing the Chairman in the chain of command, as it would undermine civilian control over the military. They also recommend maintaining the COCOM role in warfighting to build strategic relationships and project military power globally. The Combatant Commands provide essential support for Joint Task Forces, including personnel, planning, logistics, and communications. The merger of EUCOM and AFRICOM was due to capacity challenges in addressing military threats in Africa. The potential merger of NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM could further reduce U.S. resources and influence in Central and South America. The merger of DLA and TRANSCOM has also been considered by the Department. The Department has examined the functions of DLA and TRANSCOM and determined there is minimal overlap between the two. A merger would risk loss of focus on essential missions and a reversal of the substantial progress made in improving management. Actions recommended include ensuring Service Chiefs are fully included in the acquisition process and evaluating the feasibility of a merger. The Department plans to streamline the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) membership by reducing the number of members to focus discussions on critical program issues. Additionally, they aim to decrease the number of acquisition documents that need coordination by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD/AT&L). The Department aims to push approval authority down to lower levels, streamline documentation and review processes, leverage Big Data for acquisition efforts, identify core elements for Capabilities-Based Assessments, review human capital requirements, and revise the definition of \"joint matters.\" The Department plans to revise the statutory definition of \"joint matters\" to broaden the types of billets eligible for joint credit, including operational and tactical-level experiences. They also aim to modify the three-year duty length requirement for joint duty positions to provide more flexibility and recognition for officers' assignments. The Department aims to remove specific requirements for Joint Professional Military Education II accreditation and establish a more flexible delivery method for Phase II requirements. They also seek to create a program for producing well-credentialed joint strategists to participate in national military activities. The Department is involved in the development, production, and implementation of national military strategy. Secretary of Defense Carter highlighted recommendations for better synchronization of global activities and reforms in headquarters staffing and four-star officer numbers. He emphasized the need to clarify the roles and authority of the Chairman and Joint Chiefs. The Chairman and Joint Chiefs need to synchronize resources globally for daily operations, provide military advice for ongoing operations, and advise the Secretary of Defense on military strategy and operational plans. This is crucial in today's complex world to allocate forces effectively and manage risks for maximum benefit to the nation. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is best positioned to allocate resources globally, reduce management headquarters by 25%, and maintain separate commands like Northern Command and Southern Command for efficiency and effectiveness in military operations. The Defense Department aims to streamline command and control functions by integrating logistics, intelligence, and plans across different military commands to eliminate redundancies and improve efficiency. They plan to simplify and improve command structures by replacing some four-star positions with three-star officers to increase effectiveness. The Defense Department plans to streamline acquisition processes by involving service chiefs more in decision-making, giving them greater authority at \"Milestone B,\" and evaluating the Defense Acquisition Board. They also aim to streamline the acquisition system itself and revise joint duty assignment requirements for improved efficiency. The Defense Department is proposing to broaden the definition of positions for joint duty assignments, including experience in various operational functions. Reactions to the proposals are mixed, with some calling it an aggressive change while others see it as incremental. Some believe incremental changes are preferable for the Defense Department, as it may not be prepared to meet emerging strategic challenges. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain suggests more comprehensive and controversial changes are needed. The House Armed Services Committee recognizes security challenges have become more complex and that the Department lacks agility and adaptability. The proposals in this subtitle aim to increase accountability, oversight, global synchronization, and strategic thinking in the military while maintaining civilian control. Chairman John McCain emphasizes the need for strategic integration in the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense aims to develop strategies and integrate military power globally to address various threats. Legislative proposals in Title IX focus on defense reform, with a call for characteristics that enable effective operations. Congress may consider recommendations from DOD's Goldwater-Nichols review for reforming the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense is seeking characteristics to effectively respond to national security challenges and improve global synchronization. Proposed changes aim to strengthen strategic integration, agility, and innovativeness. Questions arise about unintended consequences, mission requirements, and potential tasks for other government departments. Reforming DOD to address national security challenges requires a broader examination of interagency architecture. Evaluating processes, functions, and cultural changes within the Department is essential for fostering innovation. Past reform efforts were prompted by deficiencies in formulating requirements, building capabilities, and managing costs. The Reagan Administration established the Packard Commission to improve government efficiency, particularly in the DOD, due to cost overruns. The Goldwater-Nichols Reform Act of 1986 addressed concerns about DOD's joint operation capabilities. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) process was institutionalized after the Cold War to keep pace with strategic changes. The Defense Strategy Review was reformed in the FY2015 NDAA to better articulate national security risks. Key reform initiatives focused on defense strategy changes. Since 1980, key defense reform initiatives and proposals have included the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control (The \"Grace Commission\") in 1983-1984. The Commission, chaired by J. Peter Grace, delivered 2,500 recommendations to President Reagan for efficiency and cost savings in the executive branch, including $92 billion in savings for the Department of Defense by reducing weapon purchases and closing military facilities. The Grace Commission proposed cost-saving measures for the Department of Defense, including reducing weapon purchases, closing military facilities, and reforming the military health care system, which President Reagan endorsed and implemented. This led to improvements in the DOD's acquisition system, overhaul of the Department of Veteran's Affairs health system, and closure of numerous facilities through the Base Realignment and Closure process in 1985. In January 1985, Senators Barry M. Goldwater and Samuel A. Nunn initiated a defense reform study led by James Locher, identifying 16 key problems within the Department of Defense. The defense reform study led by James Locher identified key problems within the Department of Defense, including staff duplication, lack of clarity in strategic goals, inadequate feedback, and insufficient power of the Secretary of Defense. Locher made 91 recommendations to address these issues, with the most important being the establishment of mission-oriented Under Secretary positions and disestablishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Establish a Joint Military Advisory Council with a Chairman and four-star military officers from each service to advise the President, National Security Council, and Secretary of Defense. The Council will inform higher authority of policy alternatives and manage personnel for officers on joint duty. Establish a Joint Military Advisory Council with a Chairman and four-star military officers from each service to advise the President, National Security Council, and Secretary of Defense. The Council will inform higher authority of policy alternatives and manage personnel for officers on joint duty. Additionally, create a joint duty career specialty for military officers, integrate Secretariats and military headquarters staffs, and establish the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense (Strategic Planning) for strategic planning responsibilities. The Packard Commission, established by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and led by David Packard, studied defense management policies and procedures, resulting in some changes in personnel management and the chain of command through the Goldwater-Nichols legislation. The Packard Commission, established by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, studied defense management policies and procedures. The commission found that centralized policies implemented through decentralized management structures would improve efficiency and effectiveness in the Department of Defense. Recommendations were made in four areas: national security planning and budgeting, military organization and command, acquisition organization and procedures, and government-industry accountability. The report emphasized the need for capable people to be given responsibility and authority, short lines of communication, and accountability for results. The Packard Commission, established by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, made recommendations on defense organization and acquisition, emphasizing accountability for results. One key recommendation was the creation of two-year defense budgets for fiscal stability, partially implemented in the 1986 Defense Authorization Act. However, DOD never received full funding for this biennial period, leading to the repeal of the provision in the FY2008 NDAA. President Ronald Reagan established the Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management in 1985. One month after receiving the Packard Commission's interim report, he issued NSDD 219 to implement the findings. Key provisions included improving national security strategy integration with fiscal guidance to the Department of Defense, strengthening military command, control, and advice, and selecting a military program and budget level. NSDD 219 directed the Secretary of Defense to improve military command and control by revising the Unified Command Plan, providing options for organizational structures, increasing flexibility, and repealing restrictions on Unified Command for transportation. It also anticipated the establishment of a new Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and directed the development of a directive outlining their roles and responsibilities. The new Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition has roles and responsibilities including defining the scope of the acquisition function, setting policy for procurement and research and development, supervising the Department acquisition system, overseeing defense contractors, and providing guidance for auditing. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 was a significant defense organizational reform legislation addressing systemic problems in the Department of Defense identified by Congress and the Packard Commission. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 focused on improving \"jointness\" among the military services by addressing weaknesses in the budget process and deficiencies in congressional oversight of DOD programs. It included titles on the organization of DOD, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, defense agencies, joint officer personnel policy, and the military departments. Senators Nunn and Cohen introduced legislation to promote jointness for the Special Operations Community, amending the Act to establish a four-star Special Operations combatant command and an Assistant Secretary position for Special Operations/Low. In 1989, President George Bush directed the Secretary of Defense to improve defense procurement and management at the Pentagon. Key recommendations included better synchronization of senior leaders' roles, assigning day-to-day management to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and establishing a Defense Executive Committee. The Defense Executive Committee of DOD senior leadership was established to improve defense procurement and management at the Pentagon. Key recommendations included better prioritizing programs, streamlining acquisition processes, reducing the acquisition workforce, and improving logistics management. The report also suggested legislative changes, particularly pertaining to acquisition. In 1992, the \"Base Force\" Review was developed to determine the minimum force structure needed for the post-Cold War security environment. The 1992 National Military Strategy identified four key foundations for national military strategy and focused on advancing U.S. interests in vital regions. The Base Force's conventional structure consisted of three force packages: Atlantic forces for threats in Europe, Southwest Asia, and the Middle East, Pacific forces for interests in East Asia and the Pacific, and Contingency forces for rapid response to major regional contingencies. These forces varied in heaviness and reserve component reliance. The \"Base Force\" proposed a reduction in major force elements and manpower by 20% to 40% across Army, USAF, Marines, and Navy. Longer-term investment prioritized over procurement spending to meet defense budget cuts. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff released roles and missions report in 1993 based on Base Force Review findings. In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin directed the Bottom-Up Review (BUR) to reorient the Department of Defense away from the Cold War threat environment. The BUR aimed to find efficiencies and reconceptualize the threat environment for U.S. forces. It organized the Department into four \"building blocks\" for major regional contingencies. The Department of Defense was reorganized into four \"building blocks\" for major regional contingencies, including the ability to fight a major regional conflict, peace enforcement and intervention operations, and overseas presence operations to deter potential threats and reassure allies. The Department of Defense reorganized into four \"building blocks\" for major regional contingencies, including deterring potential threats and reassuring allies. One block focused on addressing nuclear dangers by reducing the threat of WMD use and improving response capabilities. The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, chaired by John P. White, recommended strengthening support for Combatant Commanders in the 21st century through improving joint operations and integrating support in critical areas like air/missile defense and intelligence. The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces recommended enhancing support for Combatant Commanders by improving joint operations in critical areas such as air/missile defense and intelligence, elevating CINCs' roles in command and control, joint training, and theater logistics, establishing a new \"Jointness\" CINC, and differentiating peace operations from \"operations other than war\" in contingency planning. The report highlighted the need for DOD to focus on unified operations, improve health care choices for beneficiaries, enhance acquisition infrastructure, and coordinate better with other USG agencies. It also emphasized the importance of joint operations and recommended changes to support Combatant Commanders. Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili issued a conceptual template for enhancing America's Armed Forces through innovation and technology to improve joint warfighting effectiveness. This vision, known as Joint Vision 2010, focused on leveraging information superiority and technological advancements to transform traditional warfighting methods. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized defense transformation through technology to enhance military operations, focusing on improving command and control capabilities and leveraging new technologies for the \"Revolution in Military Affairs.\" The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review focused on defense transformation through technology to enhance military operations, emphasizing new operational concepts, doctrine, and organizational changes. It reaffirmed the need for a nuclear deterrent and maintaining specific military assets, while also recommending reductions in civilian and military personnel associated with infrastructure. Additionally, it called for authority for two additional rounds of BRAC to improve efficiency and performance. The 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review recommended improvements in efficiency and performance through innovative management practices, including reengineering DOD support functions and outsourcing non-warfighting functions. This led to the Defense Reform Initiative, which aimed to streamline operations and reduce management overhead in the Department of Defense. The Defense Reform Initiative aimed to recommend organizational reforms, reductions in management overhead, and streamlined business practices in the Department of Defense, focusing on modernizing business practices and streamlining organizations. This included adopting electronic business operations, prime vendor contracting, logistics consolidation, reengineering travel procedures, and giving servicemembers more options for moving household goods. The Defense Reform Initiative aimed to streamline organizations by reducing personnel in various departments, establishing new agencies, and applying market mechanisms to improve quality and reduce costs. This included creating the Defense Threat Reduction and Treaty Compliance Agency, a Chancellor for Education and Professional Development, and consolidating OSD policy offices. The Defense Reform Initiative focused on streamlining organizations to improve quality, reduce costs, and respond to customer needs. This involved outsourcing services, improving competition for depot maintenance, reducing excess support structures, and revitalizing base housing and utilities with private sector capital. The 1997 National Defense Panel Report recommended a broader and accelerated transformation of the military and national security in the 21st century. The United States should undergo a comprehensive transformation of its military and national security structures, including operational concepts, equipment, and procurement reform. This transformation should extend beyond the military to the broader national security establishment, with the establishment of new commands like an \"Americas Command\" and a Joint Forces Command to enhance coordination and integration. The 2000 Hart-Rudman Commission recommended various changes in the U.S. military and national security structures, including the establishment of new commands, enhanced defense intelligence capabilities, and prioritization of Human Intelligence (HUMINT) collection capabilities. The 2000 Hart-Rudman Commission recommended changes in U.S. military and national security structures, including new commands and enhanced defense intelligence capabilities. Secretary of Defense William Cohen examined if national institutions were designed to meet future security challenges. The Commission proposed restructuring the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and reducing infrastructure costs by outsourcing and privatizing DOD support. The 2000 Hart-Rudman Commission recommended restructuring the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and reducing infrastructure costs by outsourcing and privatizing DOD support agencies. This involved creating a BRAC-like commission for DOD infrastructure reduction, moving the QDR to the second year of an Administration, and introducing a new resource allocation competition process within the overall DOD budget. The Defense Program Review suggests expanding the 11 MFPs into 13 programs across combat force, combat support, and service support categories. It also proposes updating war gaming tools, implementing a two-track acquisition system, increasing prototyping, adopting a two-year defense budgeting approach, and rewriting the Defense sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The 2001 QDR report recommended shifting to a capabilities-based model from a threat-based one, focusing on how an adversary might fight. It emphasized four core goals: assuring allies, dissuading adversaries, deterring aggression, and defeating enemies. The 2001 QDR report recommended shifting to a capabilities-based model, emphasizing assuring allies, dissuading adversaries, deterring aggression, and defeating enemies. It also retained the \"two major theater war\" construct, while adding planning for limited contingencies and enhancing security cooperation with allies. Other recommendations included maintaining regionally tailored forces, reorienting global military posture, strengthening joint operations through technology, and streamlining DOD overhead structure. In 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued Transformation Planning Guidance to transition the military to the information age, emphasizing rapid response to threats and active defense of U.S. territory. Key focus areas included introducing modularity, streamlining DOD structure, modernizing defense facilities, and recalibrating deploy-to-dwell ratios. The 2004 Joint Defense Capabilities Study, commissioned by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, aimed to assess how DOD developed resources and provided joint capabilities. Key findings highlighted the dominance of services in the requirements process, a focus on service programs rather than joint capabilities, and a lack of consideration for the full range of solutions for joint warfighting missions. The 2004 Joint Defense Capabilities Study found that service planning does not consider the full range of solutions for joint warfighting needs. Recommendations included establishing a Strategic Planning Council chaired by the Secretary of Defense to shape defense strategy and support effective oversight. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld adopted many of these recommendations in a memorandum issued on October 31, 2003. In response to the 2004 Joint Defense Capabilities Study, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld adopted recommendations for strategic planning and oversight, leading to the issuance of a fiscally informed Strategic Planning Guidance document and enhanced joint planning processes in 2006 QDR. The 2006 QDR emphasized the need for greater collaboration with other agencies in the national security interagency system to address various challenges, including counterinsurgency, stability operations, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response missions. It called for a shift in DOD capabilities to focus on defeating terrorist networks, preventing WMD proliferation, defending the homeland, and influencing strategic decisions of other countries. Key reforms included an emphasis on irregular warfare, building partnership capacity, increasing Special Operations Forces by 15%, establishing a Marine Corps Special Operations Command, and adopting a more transparent decision-making process. The 2006 QDR emphasized collaboration with other agencies for various missions. It focused on defeating terrorist networks, preventing WMD proliferation, and influencing strategic decisions. Key reforms included irregular warfare emphasis, building partnership capacity, and increasing Special Operations Forces. The 2010 QDR aimed to rebalance the Department's activities with key priorities like prevailing in wars, deterring conflict, and enhancing the all-volunteer force. It also emphasized alliance relationships and basing. The 2010 QDR proposed key reforms to DOD business practices, including security assistance, defense acquisition reform, rapid acquisition capability, and U.S. export control system. Secretary of Defense Gates focused on prioritizing current conflicts, reducing DOD bureaucracy, disestablishing Joint Forces Command, and finding cost savings during his tenure. Gates disestablished Joint Forces Command and directed the Department to find $100 billion in overhead savings over five years. He aimed to redirect the savings towards personnel, force structure, and future capabilities. Additionally, he sought to \"right-size\" the DOD workforce through in-sourcing, reinvigorate the acquisition workforce, and improve medical support for combat operations and veterans. In 2012, Defense Strategic Guidance outlined priorities for the Department, focusing on missions like counterterrorism, deterring aggression, countering WMD, and homeland defense. In response to the Budget Control Act of 2011, Secretary of Defense Hagel implemented reforms in 2013, focusing on managing the force to protect its capabilities, ensuring reversibility of decisions, rebuilding force readiness, reducing defense costs, and examining the mix of Active Component and Reserve Components. These reforms aimed to address sequestration and mandatory budget reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 led to sequestration and mandatory budget reductions for the Department of Defense. Secretary of Defense Hagel initiated a review to balance strategic goals with budget constraints, recommending reductions in major headquarters budgets, personnel, and direct reports to the Secretary of Defense. The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review Report focused on strategic objectives such as defending the homeland, projecting U.S. influence globally, and preparing to win decisively against any adversary. It announced force structure reductions while protecting investments in key capability areas like cybersecurity, missile defense, and special operations. The review aimed to rebalance the Department's \"tooth to tail\" ratio without announcing many specific reforms. The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review focused on recalibrating the defense budget and rebalancing the Department's \"tooth to tail\" ratio without announcing specific reforms."
