    "content": "The \"Personal Privacy Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings and purposes related to personal privacy. The \"Personal Privacy Protection Act\" includes findings that individuals and their families have been harassed and endangered by photographers, videographers, and audio recorders capturing images of their private lives for commercial purposes, violating their privacy interests. Federal legislation is needed to protect individuals and their families from harassment and trespass by using invasive devices for commercial purposes, as existing laws do not adequately cover such activities. Federal legislation is necessary to prohibit and provide redress in Federal courts for trespass and invasion of privacy using intrusive visual or auditory enhancement devices for commercial purposes. The first amendment does not protect persistent following or chasing that creates fear of bodily harm or trespassing with such devices. This Act aims to protect individuals from dangerous and intrusive activities by prohibiting specific actions without infringing on constitutional rights or other laws. It safeguards against harassment, endangerment, invasion of privacy, and trespass in a narrowly tailored manner. Congress has the power to enact this Act under the Constitution. The Act regulates conduct related to products for interstate or foreign commerce. Photos and activities regulated by the Act are routinely broadcast in interstate and international commerce. Photographers, videographers, and audio recorders travel in interstate commerce to engage in regulated activities for gaining material bought and sold in interstate commerce. The activities regulated by this Act occur routinely in channels of interstate commerce, such as following subjects inappropriately on public streets and using public areas for commercial purposes. The Act regulates activities that substantially affect interstate commerce by threatening the careers and rights of professional public persons in the media and restricting the movement of targeted individuals and their families. This can lead to limitations on travel or appearances in public spaces, forcing some to travel interstate to escape abuses. The Act aims to protect individuals and their families from bodily harm, privacy intrusions, and other threats related to activities in interstate and international commerce. It also seeks to safeguard interstate commerce affected by such activities and grants the right to injured parties to seek appropriate relief. SEC. 3. CRIMINAL OFFENSE.
