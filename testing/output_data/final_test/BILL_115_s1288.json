    "content": "SECTION 1. PRESERVATION LEASING OF INDIAN LAND. The amendment to Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act introduces Preservation Leasing of Indian Land, defining terms like Indian land, Indian tribe, permitted activity, and permittee. The Preservation Lease allows a permittee to lease wetlands on Indian land to preserve them undisturbed for compensatory mitigation. The Secretary can permit this if the wetlands are in the same watershed as the leased Indian land. The term of a preservation lease for compensatory mitigation must be at least the life of the permitted activity and adjusted for impacts cessation. If a permittee ceases the activity, they must obtain a permit modification from the Secretary. The Secretary may require restoration and rehabilitation of the area, consulting with an Indian tribe if necessary. If restoration and rehabilitation are deemed necessary, the permittee may be required to submit plans for such actions. The Secretary may require the permittee to submit a plan for restoration and rehabilitation, including goals, objectives, performance standards, site treatment, reporting, remedial work, and monitoring. After completion of activities under the plan, the land may revert back. The amendment applies to permits issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. If the restoration and rehabilitation plan is completed, the land subject to the lease will revert back to the Indian tribe without restriction."
