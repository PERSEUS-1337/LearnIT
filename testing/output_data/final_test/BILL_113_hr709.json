The Secretary may close the lock at the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam to manage the threat of Asian carp in Minnesota. The lock must be closed if live adult or juvenile Asian carp are captured above specific dams. If an Asian carp meeting the criteria is captured, the Secretary of the Interior makes determinations. The Secretary of the Interior may close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock and Dam in response to a petition, with the closure period determined by the Secretary. The petition and written response will be shared with relevant committees and the public electronically. If the Secretary closes the lock, it can be reopened once measures are in place to manage the threat of Asian carp. Emergency lock operations for flood damage mitigation are allowed. The Council on Environmental Quality will include certain rivers in the Asian Carp Control Strategy Framework. Congress believes that Federal agencies should collaborate with State and local partners on Asian carp control research, with priority given to partnerships where the partners contribute to the research costs."
