    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Preservation Act\" and designates the Secretary as responsible for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge. The Secretary of Transportation is responsible for the maintenance, rehabilitation, and expansion of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River between Virginia and Maryland. The Secretary will consult with Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia on the bridge's needs. The agreement from 1985 regarding the bridge's operation and maintenance responsibilities remains in effect. Establishment of Fund. The Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Preservation Fund is established for the maintenance, rehabilitation, and expansion of the existing bridge to facilitate interstate traffic efficiently and safely. The Fund will be replenished annually before October 1. Before October 1 of each fiscal year, the Secretary estimates the Fund balance. If it falls below $50,000,000, funds are deducted from apportionments to Virginia and Maryland to restore the balance. The Secretary also submits an annual report on the bridge's condition to Congress. The Secretary of Transportation, along with Virginia, Maryland, and DC, will develop a transportation plan for the Capital Beltway corridor and Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge project. The plan will determine the level of high occupancy vehicle lanes and transit service needed, consulting with local jurisdictions and using funds from the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Preservation Fund. Upon certification by the Secretary of Transportation, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Preservation Fund balance can be used for a replacement bridge construction once the transportation plan is approved, title to the existing bridge is transferred, and a finance plan is developed by Virginia and Maryland. The Secretary of Transportation has approved a replacement bridge project with funding from the Transportation Equity Act. Virginia and Maryland can petition for waivers to reduce project costs. The Transportation Equity Act provides a $900 million Federal payment to replace the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge. Any remaining funds can be used for bridge approach construction costs. Virginia and Maryland are responsible for all non-bridge project costs. The National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 is amended to focus on maintenance and rehabilitation of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge by the Secretary. The amendments will take effect on September 30, 2000, and apply to fiscal years after that date."
