Congress finds that the United States has experienced a surge in energy production, leading to increased investment, job creation, and becoming a global leader in crude oil production. The US is committed to free trade and opposes restrictions on energy flow. Studies show that exporting domestically produced crude oil will boost global supply and lower domestic gasoline prices. Exports of crude oil produced in the United States would provide an alternative stable supplier for allies around the world, allowing US crude oil to compete globally and potentially displace exports from Iran.
