    "title": "AB 2081",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1367.255 of the Health and Safety Code states that a health care service plan is not required to cover abortion as a benefit. The plan cannot be penalized for excluding abortion coverage. This section does not mandate the exclusion or restriction of abortion coverage. Facilities in the state must be licensed, personnel must be licensed or certified, equipment must be licensed or registered, and services must be provided with continuity of care and patient referral. The plan must ensure that all services are readily available to enrollees at reasonable times, accessible to all enrollees, and provided through telehealth when appropriate. Allied health manpower should be utilized for services within legal and medical practice guidelines. The plan must have the capacity to provide services to subscribers and enrollees, with medical decisions made by qualified providers. Contracts with subscribers, group contracts, and providers must be fair, reasonable, and consistent with the chapter's objectives. All provider contracts must include a fast and cost-effective dispute resolution process. Noncontracting providers should have access to a dispute resolution mechanism for billing and claims disputes. Health care service plans must report annually to the department on their dispute resolution mechanism, including the number of providers using it and a summary of dispute outcomes. A health care service plan contract must provide all basic health care services required by law, with exemptions possible for good cause. The director defines the minimum services for licensure. Plans can charge copayments or deductibles for services, as long as they are disclosed to subscribers and reported to the director. Plans can also set limitations in their contracts. The chapter prohibits health care service plans from setting contract limitations on maximum coverage of basic health care services without approval from the director and disclosure to subscribers. A health care service plan cannot require optometrists certified to use therapeutic pharmaceutical agents to register under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The director cannot establish rates for health care services, and the plan must comply with regulations even when delegating services to other entities."
