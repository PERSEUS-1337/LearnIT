    "title": "R43146",
    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but programs continue to receive annual appropriations. Both the House and Senate have considered legislation to reauthorize the ESEA during the 113th Congress. The Success for All Students Act (H.R. 5) was passed by the House on July 19, 2013, with a vote of 221-207. S. 1094 and H.R. 5 differ in approaches to reauthorizing the ESEA, focusing on accountability, teacher quality, and support for education. Both bills eliminate existing programs and create new ones. The report examines key features of S. 1094 and H.R. 5 in reshaping the ESEA, providing a structured orientation by ESEA title and part under each bill. It summarizes major proposals that would fundamentally change current law, excluding technical changes. The appendix analyzes proposed program authorizations in each bill, considering new or substantively changed programs. The ESEA reauthorization bills aim to reshape programs by making changes such as altering program purposes, fund distribution, and eligible recipients. Programs are considered retained if they are similar in purpose, recipients, and activities. For example, the Advanced Placement program is retained under S. 1094, while the block grant program in H.R. 5 is considered new due to significant differences from current programs. The block grant program in H.R. 5 is not retained and allows funds to be used for similar activities as some current programs. The proposed block grant program's uses of funds are discussed in the report. If an existing program is not mentioned as allowable under a new program, it should not be assumed that funds will be allocated. The report focuses on major changes to current law, indicating that programs may be similar but not retained without changes. President Obama and the secretary announced ESEA flexibility waivers for states, exempting them from certain academic accountability and teacher qualification requirements. The ESEA flexibility waivers allow State Educational Agencies to apply for optional waivers related to various accountability requirements, teacher qualifications, and funding flexibility. To receive the waivers, SEAs must agree to meet four principles established by the U.S. Department of Education for improving student academic achievement and increasing the quality of instruction. These waivers apply to school years 2011-2012, 2012-2013. The ESEA flexibility waivers allow State Educational Agencies to apply for optional waivers related to accountability requirements, teacher qualifications, and funding flexibility for school years 2011-2014. The waivers represent a fundamental redesign by the Administration of accountability and teacher-related requirements in current law. As of June 2013, 39 states and the District of Columbia had been approved for the waivers, with the possibility of Congress potentially overriding these provisions in any final bill. The report examines the reauthorization approaches of S. 1094 and H.R. 5 in three key areas: accountability for student achievement, teacher quality, and targeted support for education. Under NCLB, comprehensive standards-based accountability requirements were enacted. States, LEAs, and schools must comply to receive Title I-A funds. The discussion includes how S. 1094 and H.R. 5 would address these requirements. The report compares S. 1094 and H.R. 5 in terms of academic standards, assessments, and annual measurable objectives. States must adopt challenging standards in math, reading, and science for multiple grade levels. They must also develop annual assessments aligned with these standards and set annual measurable objectives. States must establish annual measurable objectives (AMOs) for reading and math assessments for grades 6-9 and grades 10-12. These objectives must set a minimum percentage of students who must meet or exceed proficiency levels, with a timeline for all students to reach proficiency by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. Adequate yearly progress (AYP) is determined based on student academic achievement in reading and math assessments. The AYP standards for mathematics assessments focus on student proficiency levels, with a 95% participation rate required for all students and subgroups. Schools must meet threshold levels for graduation rates as well. Consequences include program improvement for LEAs and schools that fail to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years. Schools failing to meet AYP standards for two consecutive years face consequences such as school improvement, public school choice, Title I-A funds for professional development, and offering supplemental educational services. LEAs must reserve 20% of Title I-A funds for transportation and SES. Continued failure results in corrective action, including staff replacement, curriculum changes, extended school year/day, and limited management authority. S. 1094 proposes retaining consequences for schools failing to make AYP, including restructuring and implementing alternative governance structures like converting to a charter school. States would need to develop college and career ready standards in reading, math, and science, with assessments aligned to these standards. States would have the discretion to administer annual summative assessments aligned with new standards, providing data on student proficiency and growth. Assessments could be computer adaptive and must be administered to at least 95% of all students and subgroups. Each state's accountability system must include reading and math, with the option to include science or other subjects. Performance categories must include students who are proficient. States would be required to establish three categories of student performance, including those meeting or exceeding state academic standards, those below grade level but showing sufficient growth, and those below grade level without sufficient growth. Annual performance targets would need to be set for each subject and grade level, using either performance standards from the ESEA flexibility package or goals for schools to reach the achievement level of the top 10%. Performance targets for student proficiency, growth, English language proficiency, and graduation rates must be set within a specified time period. States must identify schools not showing improvement, focus schools, and priority schools. AYP determinations are no longer required. Schools identified as focus schools must work with the SEA to implement state-approved interventions based on best practices. They are in the top 10% with the greatest achievement or graduation rate gaps among subgroups. Priority schools are the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary or secondary schools, have a graduation rate below 60%, or have been focus schools for six consecutive years. Each LEA serving a priority school must develop and implement a correction plan. Under H.R. 5, states would be required to adopt content and achievement standards for various subjects, with aligned assessments administered in grades 3-8 and once in grades 9-12. States have the option to use a single annual summative assessment or multiple assessments leading to a single score, providing data on student academic proficiency. Under H.R. 5, states would have the option to use assessments to measure student academic proficiency and growth, including computer adaptive assessments. They would no longer need to establish AMOs or determine AYP. Assessments must be administered to at least 95% of all students and subgroups, with high school graduation rates reported. The state accountability system would evaluate each public school's academic performance annually. The bill would change the evaluation of public schools based on student academic achievement, performance gaps, and other measures of success. It eliminates current outcome accountability requirements and allows states to establish a system for school improvement for low-performing schools. The bill would create a new reservation of funds for direct services to students under Section 1003A, requiring states to reserve 3% of Title I-A funds for competitive grants to LEAs for public school choice or academic tutoring. NCLB included new requirements for equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers and established minimum professional standards. Programs were authorized to support teacher quality and reward performance. The provisions of S. 1094 and H.R. 5 aim to ensure equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers in Title I schools, requiring teachers to have professional credentials and subject-matter knowledge. Newly hired teachers must also meet these qualifications to receive Title I-A funds. The Teacher and Principal Training and Recruitment Fund (Title II-A) provides support for state and local efforts to ensure that all public school teachers teaching core academic subjects meet the definition of a Highly Qualified Teacher by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. The Teacher Incentive Fund (Title V-D) offers grants for high-need schools to implement performance-based teacher compensation systems. S. 1094 proposes performance-based teacher and principal compensation systems based on student academic achievement and classroom evaluations. It requires all teachers in core academic subjects to be Highly Qualified Teachers, with a focus on equitable distribution of teachers to prevent poor and minority children from being taught by low-rated teachers. S. 1094 would require states to ensure that all LEAs receiving Title II-A funds implement teacher and principal evaluation systems, known as professional growth and improvement systems. These systems must provide meaningful feedback, evaluate performance regularly, align with professional development, involve teachers and principals in development, and provide training for evaluators. Principal evaluations must be based on evidence of improved student academic achievement, instructional leadership, and support to teachers and staff. S. 1094 requires states to ensure that all LEAs receiving Title II-A funds implement teacher and principal evaluation systems, focusing on professional growth and improvement. These systems must include evidence-based measures, classroom observations, and student perception surveys. States must provide technical assistance for system design and implementation, with LEAs required to implement these systems by the 2015-2016 school year. The Title II-A formula grant program will be retained, but the hold harmless provision for state grants will be eliminated. The bill H.R. 5 would make changes to Title II-A funds, requiring at least 20% to be used for professional development in \"priority\" and \"focus\" schools. It eliminates requirements for equitable distribution of instructional quality and highly qualified teachers, and does not mandate the development or implementation of staff evaluation systems. States can provide technical assistance to LEAs choosing to develop evaluation systems, which can be funded by Title II-A. H.R. 5 would make changes to Title II-A funds, retaining formula grant funding but modifying allocation criteria. It would scale back activities supporting teacher evaluation systems and require at least 20% of funds for professional development in \"priority\" and \"focus\" schools. The bill eliminates requirements for equitable distribution of teachers and does not mandate staff evaluation systems. States can provide technical assistance for LEAs developing evaluation systems. The ESEA provides formula and competitive grant programs to support specific student populations and activities. Some programs are no longer funded. The HELP Committee and Education and Workforce Committee have different approaches to funding programs through the ESEA. S. 1094 and H.R. 5 propose different approaches to program funding under the ESEA. S. 1094 would retain most formula grant programs, eliminate some competitive grant programs, and introduce new targeted grant programs. In contrast, H.R. 5 would eliminate most competitive grant programs and some formula grant programs, replacing them with a block grant program that could support similar activities. The bills diverge on targeted support and block grants. The bill H.R. 5 proposes new grant programs to support literacy, STEM education, well-rounded education, and student well-being. It eliminates most competitive grant programs but includes a new $2.1 billion block grant program for states. This contrasts with S. 1094, which retains formula grant programs and introduces targeted grant programs. The new block grant program proposed in H.R. 5 would provide states with flexibility to improve academic achievement and student safety. States must allocate 75% of funds for competitive grants to eligible entities, including partnerships with LEAs, CBOs, business entities, and nongovernmental entities. Additionally, states must allocate 10% for competitive grants to nongovernment entities and can use funds for state-level activities such as developing standards and assessments. The proposed block grant program in H.R. 5 allows states to allocate funds for various activities to improve academic achievement and student safety. States can use funds for developing standards and assessments, administering assessments, monitoring programs, providing training, implementing academic programs, and sharing effective strategies. Grants to eligible entities can be used for supplemental student support activities and activities to support students, excluding athletics, in-school learning activities, class-size reduction, construction, and staff compensation. Nongovernmental entities must use funds to increase academic achievement. The proposed block grant program in H.R. 5 allows states to allocate funds for activities to improve academic achievement and student safety. Funds could support activities previously funded under ESEA, but the impact on funding amounts is uncertain. Table 1 outlines how S. 1094 and H.R. 5 would modify current law for ESEA programs. The table provides appropriations information for FY2013 and indicates where S. 1094 and H.R. 5 would place programs in a reauthorized ESEA. Retaining a program does not guarantee all activities will continue, as they may be shifted to a different program. The reauthorized ESEA would no longer retain many current programs, instead implementing a block grant program for similar activities. Retained programs may undergo changes in funding formulas and usage. For example, the Advanced Placement program would be renamed as the Accelerated Learning program. The Accelerated Learning program under S. 1094 expands to include International Baccalaureate programs and exams. Table 2 compares S. 1094 and H.R. 5 to current law, detailing key issues in the reauthorization process. The comparison between current law, S. 1094, and H.R. 5 in ESEA reauthorization bills shows differences in specific program authorizations. Current law has 46 authorizations, S. 1094 has 39, and H.R. 5 has 16. The table highlights the number of explicit ESEA program authorizations in each bill, noting if certain programs would receive a specified share of the authorization. The comparison between current law, S. 1094, and H.R. 5 in ESEA reauthorization bills shows differences in specific program authorizations. S. 1094 includes separate authorizations for Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) grants and Promise Neighborhoods, which are currently funded under general authority available to the secretary. This means that the new program authorizations should not be seen as excluding existing programs authorized under current law. The authorizations in S. 1094 and H.R. 5 for ESEA reauthorization differ in the specified fiscal years. While S. 1094 authorizes funds for FY2014 through FY2018, H.R. 5 authorizes funds for FY2014 through FY2019 with the same amount each year. The total authorized level in H.R. 5 is $22.8 billion, compared to $22.1 billion in FY2013 appropriations under current law. The total ESEA authorization in the last specified year was $28.9 billion. The authorization of an appropriation is only an authorization, allowing Congress to enact appropriations at different funding levels."
