    "content": "The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides federal grants for cash welfare and other economic benefits to low-income families with children. Administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, TANF programs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. American Samoa is eligible but has not opted to participate. Tribal TANF programs are funded through allocations from the TANF basic block grant to states or tribes. States and tribes provide TANF benefits and services to families and individuals. This report outlines TANF financing, rules for state programs, federal TANF grants, state funds under a \"maintenance-of-effort\" requirement, and how funds can be used to achieve TANF goals. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant includes accountability requirements for states to submit plans and report data to the federal government. It also covers provisions such as competitive grants for promoting healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood, and tribal TANF provisions. States receive three federal grants under TANF: the basic block grant, contingency funds, and grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood. States must also spend their own funds on specified TANF-related activities for needy families with children, known as maintenance-of-effort (MOE). The TANF block grant provides federal funds to states and tribes for specified activities for needy families with children. The grants are entitlements based on peak expenditures from the mid-1990s, including cash welfare, emergency aid, and job training programs. States and tribes receive allocations based on these expenditures, with tribes receiving a portion based on FY1994 tribal member expenditures in the area to be served. The TANF block grant provides federal funds to states and tribes for needy families with children. Allocations are based on FY1994 expenditures, reducing the basic block grant payable to states. A set-aside for research reduces the available amount to $16.512 billion, distributed to states and tribes. States received $16.317 billion and tribes received $195 million for FY2018. A $2 billion TANF contingency fund was established in 1996 to address funding concerns during economic downturns. The TANF contingency fund is available to states that meet economic \"need\" criteria and have spent more than in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training. Contingency funds are only for states and the District of Columbia, not tribes or territories. States qualify based on unemployment rate or SNAP caseload increases compared to FY1994 or FY1995. The TANF contingency fund is available to states that meet economic \"need\" criteria and have spent more than in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training. Contingency funds are limited to one-twelfth of 20% of a state's basic block grant, and states may receive these monthly payments on an advance basis. States qualify based on unemployment rate or SNAP caseload increases compared to FY1994 or FY1995. The TANF contingency fund provides extra spending to states that meet economic criteria and have spent more than in FY1994 on cash, emergency assistance, and job training. States may receive monthly advances based on a cap of 20% of their basic block grant. The original $2 billion fund was depleted in FY2010, but Congress has since provided appropriations to continue funding the contingency fund. The FY2017 and FY2018 appropriations were $608 million each. The TANF program requires states to spend their own funds on TANF-related activities, with a minimum aggregate spending requirement of $10.3 billion for needy families with children in FY2018. This amount, known as the \"maintenance-of-effort\" (MOE) level, represents 75% of what was spent from state funds in FY1994 on predecessor programs. The TANF program requires states to maintain their own spending at a minimum level based on FY1994 funds. Failure to meet this requirement results in a penalty, with the MOE increasing to 80% for states not meeting work participation requirements. State MOE funds are crucial, and failure to comply leads to a reduction in the subsequent year's block grant. Table 2 displays federal TANF and state MOE funds, with varying percentages of total funds accounted for by federal funds due to differing Medicaid matching rates. The TANF program, named a \"block grant\" program by Congress, allows states discretion in using federal funds for a wide range of benefits and services for families with children. Federal TANF grants can be used within a state or tribal TANF program or transferred to other grants like the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). TANF funds can be transferred to CCDBG or SSBG, reserved without limit, and spent in any manner to achieve its goals of assisting needy families, promoting work and marriage, reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and supporting two-parent families. TANF funds are used to provide a variety of benefits and services for low-income families with children, including support for work through child care and transportation aid. Funds can also be used to assist children at risk of neglect or abuse who are placed in the care of relatives. Additionally, programs and services aim to achieve the family formation goals of TANF. Federal law allows states to use TANF funds for programs like foster care, adoption assistance, and juvenile justice. Up to 30% of TANF grants can be transferred to CCDBG and SSBG, with an additional 10% to SSBG for families below 200% of the poverty line. Job access programs target low-income individuals, including TANF assistance recipients, providing transportation assistance for commuting from inner city to suburban areas. Federal TANF funds can be used as a state match for reverse commuter grants, reducing the amount available for transfers to other block grants. Most benefits funded by TANF can also be financed by MOE funds, including cash assistance, administration, child care, and education. States can use MOE funds for child care, education, training, healthy marriage, and responsible fatherhood activities to further TANF goals. MOE funds have restrictions on expenditures not part of pre-1996 welfare programs and must exceed FY1995 levels. Certain families can receive assistance with MOE funds that are not eligible for federal TANF funds. States can use MOE funds for various activities to support TANF goals, including assisting families affected by the TANF time limit and noncitizens ineligible for federal benefits. TANF funds can be used for a wide range of benefits and services, with some restrictions on funds used for families receiving assistance. Federal TANF law does not define \"assistance\" but HHS defines it as payment for basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. Some states use MOE funds for nutrition assistance and child care. TANF assistance includes child care and transportation aid for nonworking individuals, excluding working parents. States can use MOE funds from TANF or separate state programs to meet requirements. Work participation standards now apply to families in separate state programs starting from FY2007. TANF assistance requires families to have a minor child to be eligible, with income below a specified level. Childless individuals and couples are not eligible, except for pregnant women. States cannot use federal TANF funds for families with an adult who received aid for 60 months. Adults who have received federally funded aid for 60 months, unwed teen parents not in adult-supervised settings, teens who have not completed high school, noncitizens who arrived after August 22, 1996, fugitive felons, parole violators, and persons convicted of a drug-related felony are not eligible for TANF assistance. States misusing federal TANF funds are penalized, but can use MOE funds to assist ineligible individuals. States have flexibility in providing assistance to needy families with children. States have broad leeway to define eligibility for TANF cash assistance, determining income standards and other criteria. \"Child-only\" families, where the parent is ineligible, can still receive benefits on behalf of the children. Common scenarios include parents receiving SSI, noncitizen parents, or children cared for by nonparent relatives. TANF requires states to assess adult recipients' skills and work experience within 90 days of eligibility. States must engage parents in work within 24 months and can sanction families for noncompliance. Good cause exemptions are allowed, and single-parent families cannot be sanctioned. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program sets minimum work participation standards for states, requiring a specified percentage of families to engage in specified activities for a minimum number of hours. States have flexibility in designing work requirements for individuals, and financial sanctions may be imposed on families for noncompliance. Individual work requirements and sanctions are determined by the states, with exemptions allowed for single-parent families with children under six who cannot find affordable childcare. The TANF program allows states to set work requirements for individuals, with two standards to meet each year - \"all-family\" and \"two-parent\" participation standards. States receive credits for caseload reduction and exceeding spending requirements. Caseload reduction credit reduces the participation standards for states based on declines in cash assistance caseloads from FY2005 levels. No credit is given for caseload reduction due to policy changes since FY2005. The TANF program allows states to set work requirements with two standards - \"all-family\" and \"two-parent\" participation standards. States can receive credits for caseload reduction and excess spending. Caseload reduction credits can lower participation standards based on declines in cash assistance caseloads from FY2005 levels. States may also receive credits for excess spending above the required amount. This excess spending can be considered as caseload reduction, leading to extra credits. The \"effective standard\" is calculated based on the percentage points credited for caseload reduction and excess spending. Compliance with TANF federal work standards is determined by comparing the \"work participation rate\" to the state's effective participation standard. The TANF work participation rate is calculated and compared to a state's effective participation standard. It represents the percentage of non-excluded families receiving assistance who are considered \"engaged in work.\" Only families with a \"work-eligible\" individual are included in the calculation. Work-eligible persons are adults or teen heads of households who are recipients of assistance, or certain non-recipient parents of children receiving assistance who are expected to work. Adult non-recipients who are non-parent caretakers, ineligible noncitizen parents, parents receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and parents needed to care for disabled family members are not considered work-eligible. The TANF work participation rate is calculated based on the percentage of non-excluded families receiving assistance who are considered \"engaged in work.\" Work-eligible individuals must participate in specific activities for a minimum number of hours per week to be considered \"engaged in work.\" Certain individuals, such as single parents caring for infants or participating in tribal TANF programs, may be excluded from the calculation. Single parents with pre-school aged children must participate for at least 20 hours per week, while other single parents must participate for at least 30 hours per week to be considered engaged in work. Two-parent families must participate for more hours. Most welfare-to-work activities are on the list of 12 activities that count toward the participation standards. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required HHS to define each of the 12 activities. There are limits on counting participation in pre-employment activities towards the work standards. The TANF work participation standards require work-eligible individuals to participate in activities related to work for a certain number of hours per week. Vocational educational training is limited to 12 months in a recipient's lifetime. Teen parents can be considered \"engaged in work\" by completing high school or obtaining a GED diploma. States failing to meet the standards risk a reduction in their block grant, starting at 5% and increasing by 2 percentage points each year. The TANF work participation standards require individuals to engage in work-related activities for a set number of hours per week. Penalties for noncompliance can increase by 2 percentage points each year, up to a maximum of 21%. States can avoid penalties by demonstrating \"reasonable cause\" for failure or by entering into a corrective compliance plan. Penalties may also be reduced in cases of recession or extraordinary circumstances like natural disasters. Penalty relief is granted to states for noncompliance with TANF work participation standards due to waivers for victims of domestic violence. States must have procedures to verify recipients' work participation, with penalties for noncompliance. Federal TANF funds cannot be used for families with an adult receiving five years of assistance. The federal TANF time limit does not apply to \"child-only\" cases. States have flexibility in implementing time limits, with a hardship exception and the ability to use state funds beyond the limit. States face penalties for having more than 20% of their caseload on welfare for over five years. Many states have adopted the five-year limit for welfare assistance, with some having shorter time limits. Some states provide aid beyond five years using state funds or continue benefits indefinitely for children only. Cash assistance recipients are often single mothers with noncustodial parents responsible for child support. TANF requires cooperation with child support enforcement and assigning child support to the state to receive assistance. The TANF Program requires families to cooperate with establishing paternity and child support enforcement. Noncompliance can result in a 25% benefit cut or even termination of assistance. Families must assign received child support to the state as reimbursement for welfare costs, with states having the option to pass it through to TANF families. The federal government shares in the cost of passing through child support paid to TANF families if it is disregarded in determining TANF eligibility and benefit amounts. State expenditures from the pass-through of child support count towards the TANF MOE. States have the option to waive program requirements for victims of domestic violence, such as work requirements and time limits, but they are still included in the TANF work participation rate standard calculation. The law allows states to provide domestic violence victims with waivers for TANF program requirements, including work participation and time limits. These waivers must be based on individual assessments, accompanied by a services plan, and reassessed every six months. States typically distribute TANF benefits through EBT cards for recipients to use at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals. Federal law mandates states to have policies in place to prevent TANF assistance misuse. Federal law requires states to prevent TANF assistance funds from being used in liquor stores, casinos, and strip clubs. States must also restrict cash withdrawals at ATMs in these establishments and prevent purchases using TANF assistance on EBT cards. States had two years to implement these policies after the enactment of P.L. 112-96. TANF state plans must ensure recipients have adequate access to benefits with minimal fees, and provide information on applicable charges. States can use federal funds for a variety of benefits and services under TANF. Federal law allows states to use TANF and MOE funds for a wide range of benefits and services beyond cash assistance, such as child care, transportation aid, tax credits, education, and youth employment programs. States have flexibility in designing and implementing programs with these funds. States have broad flexibility in designing and implementing programs with TANF and MOE funds. They are required to develop plans outlining fund use and report data on families receiving assistance every three years to receive TANF block grant funds. State plans vary in content and detail, with no set format and not always including information on eligibility rules for TANF assistance. The TANF law requires states to provide detailed information on families receiving assistance, including demographic data, work activities, and financial circumstances. This information is crucial for determining eligibility and monitoring program effectiveness. The TANF law requires reporting of data for families receiving benefits, including non-assistance services. Funding is provided for healthy marriage promotion, tribal child welfare coordination, and responsible fatherhood initiatives, totaling $150 million annually. Funding is split equally between responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage initiatives since FY2011. Any funds for tribal child welfare coordination would reduce the allocation for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. The $75 million allocated for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives includes funding for research projects, technical assistance, marriage promotion programs, education on social skills and conflict resolution, and programs to reduce financial barriers to marriage. Applicants for grants must ensure voluntary participation and address domestic violence concerns. The responsible fatherhood initiatives include promoting marriage, teaching parenting skills, providing job training services, and developing a national clearinghouse. Federally recognized Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizations have the option to operate their own TANF programs for needy families with children. Tribes receive a grant equal to FY1994 federal expenditures for Indian families, financed by a reduction in the state's block grant amount. States may provide tribes with MOE funds, but it is not required. Tribes operating TANF programs must submit plans for approval by HHS. Work requirements and time limits are established with tribal input. Grants totaling $7.6 million per year are provided for tribal work programs, based on FY1994 pre-TANF program funding levels."
