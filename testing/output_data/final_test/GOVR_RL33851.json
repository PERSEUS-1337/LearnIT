    "content": "The UNHCR has facilitated the return of 3.69 million Afghan refugees to Afghanistan since 2002, the largest operation in its history. An additional million refugees returned without UNHCR's assistance, totaling 4.8 million returnees. Most returned from Iran and Pakistan. Key concerns for the 110th Congress include sustaining refugee returns, funding strategies for remaining refugees, and border security issues with Pakistan. Pakistan's plan to lay land mines and build a fence along its border with Afghanistan raises border security concerns. Afghan migration trends since 1978 have impacted political arrangements in South Asia, with refugees fleeing due to political turmoil and the Soviet invasion in 1979. The Soviet attempt to control Afghanistan was met with resistance as the Afghan leadership made decisions without Soviet approval. The Soviet attempt to subjugate Afghanistan was brutal, leading to millions of refugees fleeing to Iran and Pakistan. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1988, refugees began returning, but Kabul fell into armed disorder as mujahideen factions fought for control. Another wave of displacement occurred, possibly affecting up to a million people. After the Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996, they gained dominance over most of Afghanistan by 1998. Many Afghans, especially the educated, fled due to the Taliban's strict Islamic rules, leading to a final wave of refugees during the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. UNHCR began planning for mass repatriation in 2002. In 2002, UNHCR, along with Afghanistan, established Tripartite Agreements with Pakistan and Iran for voluntary repatriations. Initially, it was estimated that there were 2 million refugees in Pakistan and 1.5 million in Iran. However, 2.15 million Afghans returned in 2002, revealing a larger Afghan population in Pakistan than previously thought. Despite a decline in returns in later years, the pace remained strong through 2005. As of December 2006, an estimated 2.46 million registered and unregistered Afghans are currently residing in the region. As of December 2006, around 2.46 million Afghans are living in Pakistan and over 900,000 in Iran. The refugee status of these Afghans is debated in both countries, with approximately 3.5 million Afghans living in exile. A census conducted in March 2002 by UNHCR and the Government of Pakistan revealed 3,049,268 Afghans in Pakistan, with 42% in camps and 58% in urban areas. Pashtuns made up over 81% of the Afghan population, with smaller percentages of Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmen, and other ethnic groups. The majority of Afghan families in Pakistan arrived during the early years of the refugee crisis, with a significant number being born in Pakistan. Encouraging these long-term residents to repatriate may pose a challenge due to their prolonged stay outside Afghanistan. Agricultural and economic instability in Afghanistan has historically led to migration across borders in search of work. During the refugee crisis in Pakistan, Afghan families fled due to drought and other problems, seeking temporary work. The Government of Pakistan set up camps in the Northwest Frontier Province and Balochistan, allowing Afghans to move and work within the country. Despite not owning land, they received food rations and basic services in the camps. During the refugee crisis in Pakistan, Afghan families fled due to drought and other problems, seeking temporary work. The camps provided food rations, health, and educational services overseen by UNHCR and CCAR. International and local NGOs were contracted to provide services. In 1995, WFP stopped providing rations as Afghans were deemed capable of providing for their own food needs. The GoP's stance towards refugees began to toughen. The Pakistani government's stance towards Afghan refugees hardened as international aid decreased, leading more Afghans to seek work in cities. The refugee passbook, their only form of identification, became meaningless without food aid. The government pushed for the return of all Afghans to Afghanistan, citing economic and security concerns. Some politicians believed Afghans were taking jobs from Pakistanis and driving down wages. Some Pakistanis believe Afghan labor is driving down wages in certain sectors like transport and construction. Economic worries about Afghans persist as international funding for refugees in Pakistan decreases. Despite record repatriation, millions of Afghans still remain in Pakistan, raising concerns about their economic impact and security risks. Many fear Afghans are involved in smuggling stolen goods, narcotics, and weaponry across Pakistan's western border. The \"smugglers' markets\" on the outskirts of Peshawar and Quetta, allegedly run by Afghans, offer a range of illegal goods from counterfeit passports to heroin to Kalashnikovs. These markets thrive due to their proximity to Afghanistan and the weak governance in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Pakistani police conduct sweeps in Afghan areas to crack down on crime, citing the challenge of dealing with the traditional Pashtun leaders who rule the FATA with a blend of personal decree, sharia law, and traditional Pashtun legal practices. The FATA region is a source of revenue for some leaders through smugglers' markets, despite Islamic laws against drugs and alcohol. Concerns arise over militant activities staging in the area, including attacks against coalition forces and the Pakistani government. There are suspicions that Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda members may be hiding in the tribal areas with the knowledge of local leaders. The government of Pakistan closed refugee camps in the FATA region, displacing around 200,000 refugees who mostly returned to Afghanistan. Critics pointed out the lack of suitable relocation options for those unable to repatriate. Many Afghan refugees in Pakistan lacked shelter or means to earn a living, leading to crossings without preparation or support. The Tripartite Agreement between GoP, GoA, and UNHCR required voluntary returns, with some camps in Balochistan and North West Frontier closing for security reasons in 2007. The closure of Afghan refugee camps in Balochistan and North West Frontier in 2007 could impact up to 250,000 refugees. The UN and other organizations are concerned about their well-being. A census in 2005 led to a registration program with UNHCR and Afghanistan's government. Registration started in 2006 to identify those with legitimate protection needs. The registration program for Afghan refugees in Pakistan started in 2006, allowing those with documented evidence of living in Pakistan during the census to register. The new identity document grants them the right to live and work in Pakistan for three years, with negotiations ongoing for its validity period. By January 17, 2007, 1.5 million had registered, with the deadline extended twice. The aim is to facilitate a transition period for Afghans to reconnect with Afghanistan and eventually return home. The UNHCR, UNDP, and Pakistani authorities are addressing ongoing refugee issues in Afghanistan. Refugees in Pakistan have spent less time there than those who remain, suggesting difficulty in returning due to fewer ties. In Iran, Afghans in urban areas receive government-subsidized services with official refugee status. According to recent government statistics, there were approximately 920,000 registered Afghans in Iran as of May 2006, with possibly close to one million more undocumented workers. Many of the registered refugees have been in Iran for over 15 years, with a history of Afghan migration to Iran dating back to the 19th century. During the 1970s oil crisis, many Afghans sought work in Iran. The flow of Afghan refugees increased dramatically after the Soviet invasion of 1979, with over 3 million fleeing to Iran by 1990. Initially considered \"involuntary religious migrants,\" they were later granted indefinite permission to reside in Iran. After the Soviet withdrawal, the status of Afghans in Iran changed. New migrants were no longer considered fleeing religious persecution and were categorized as refugees. They were issued temporary registration cards instead of indefinite residency status. Despite the fall of the Taliban, Afghans continued to migrate to Afghanistan and Iran, playing a significant role in both countries' economies through labor migration and remittances. Afghans in Iran are an important source of labor, with the government offering 200,000 Afghans to work as guest workers. These workers must leave their families in Afghanistan, a migration pattern that has been ongoing for some time. This contrasts with Afghans in Pakistan who emigrate with their entire families. Since 1979, Afghan migration to Iran has been less frequent than to Pakistan due to stricter border regulations and the requirement to pay for passports and visas. Single Afghan men in Pakistan often return to Afghanistan for higher-paying seasonal work, leaving their families behind. Afghan migration to Iran is less frequent than to Pakistan due to stricter border regulations and the need for passports and visas. Transportation costs can be prohibitive for Afghans traveling to major cities in Iran. The Government of Iran keeps a detailed list of accepted Afghan refugees, unlike in Pakistan where Afghan refugees have been relatively undocumented for years. Iran keeps a detailed list of accepted Afghan refugees, known as the \"Amayesh\" list, who are entitled to basic services. Those not on the list face deportation, despite protests from humanitarian agencies. Deported Afghans, some with refugee status, have been mistreated before being sent back to Afghanistan. Iran considers them illegal immigrants, not refugees, in violation of agreements with UNHCR and Afghanistan. The Iranian government considers deported Afghans as illegal immigrants, not refugees, leading to the loss of benefits such as free education and healthcare. UNHCR has criticized Iran for imposing additional taxes and fees on Afghans, despite budget cuts affecting services. Iran, despite budget cuts, has not strictly enforced new rules for Afghan repatriation. Both Iran and Pakistan believe it's time for Afghans to return home due to stability in Afghanistan. Iran plans to repatriate all Afghans by March 2007, but the voluntary nature of this repatriation raises concerns about Afghans choosing to remain in asylum countries. The US government has provided humanitarian assistance to Afghan refugees since the 1980s, with funding declining since 2001. Assistance is mainly through the Migration and Refugee Assistance account, managed by the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. This funding supports refugees in asylum countries and helps reintegrate Afghan returnees in Afghanistan. The Government of India is considering extending work visas to Afghans, indicating flexibility in planning or potential disagreement among leaders. USG assistance to Afghan refugees and returnees has been provided since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. The majority of funding goes to regional projects, with a focus on international organizations like UNHCR and ICRC. Some funding also goes to NGOs for targeted projects selected based on track record and cost-effectiveness. USG assistance to Afghan refugees and returnees through PRM is selected based on NGO's track record, cost-effectiveness, and adherence to guidelines. The aid focuses on basic humanitarian needs like food, shelter, protection, water, health care, and education. PRM partners with UNHCR for repatriation, shelter construction, and water/sanitation in Afghanistan. In Pakistan and Iran, UNHCR manages refugee protection, camp operations, health care, education, and water/sanitation through international and local NGOs. Many activities are carried out by international and local NGOs with oversight and funding from UNHCR, which played a key role in the humanitarian response to the South Asia earthquake in 2005. UNHCR was designated the lead agency for camp management in Pakistan. The ICRC is more active in Afghanistan, supporting various initiatives. PRM funds NGOs for projects like shelter construction, refugee education, skills training for women, and healthcare for refugees and returnees to complement the work of IOs. PRM funds projects for refugee education, healthcare, and shelter construction to complement the work of international organizations. Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran make up the second-highest population globally, with funding for them decreasing since FY2002. The United States faces challenges in maintaining assistance for Afghan refugees amidst competing priorities. Maintaining the successful repatriation program for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran may become more expensive as time goes on. The refugees remaining have fewer resources and ties to Afghanistan, making it difficult and costly to encourage voluntary returns. Funding for the program is declining, while the importance of sustaining previous returns and potentially granting citizenship to those who do not want to return is increasing. The success of the repatriation program for Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran depends on their integration into reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Many returnees do not stay in Afghanistan, with heavy traffic across the Pakistani border. Concern arises if returnees are crossing back into Pakistan and Iran due to lack of opportunities in Afghanistan. Many Afghans returning to Pakistan and Iran are unable to sustain themselves in Afghanistan, potentially highlighting reconstruction challenges. The governments show some flexibility on Afghan migration but believe the refugee crisis is over. Future studies on migration reasons are needed. The impact of Pakistan's border control plans on refugee movements remains uncertain. Humanitarian groups have expressed concerns. Pakistan's plan to increase border security by planting landmines has raised concerns among humanitarian groups and President Hamid Karzai. The effectiveness of the plan in preventing terrorist crossings is doubted. In the long term, political arrangements may be necessary for Afghan migration in South Asia. Research suggests Afghan labor migration could benefit both Afghanistan and host countries. Experts note that Afghan migration for livelihood opportunities is not new. The United States' stance on this issue is uncertain. Establishing a labor migration regime in South Asia may face political challenges in Pakistan and Iran. Some government officials believe Afghans are an economic burden. Security along the Afghan border is a concern due to perceived lawlessness by Afghans in Pakistan. Regulating Afghan migration may ensure security and humane treatment. Regulating Afghan migration can ensure secure, humane, and effective movement."
