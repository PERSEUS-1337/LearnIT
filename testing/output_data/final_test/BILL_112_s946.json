The Office of Rural Education Policy Act recognizes the unique challenges and benefits of rural schools. A report highlights the lack of research in rural education. The number of students in rural schools has increased significantly, with a rise in public school enrollment attending rural schools. In the 2008-2009 school year, rural student enrollment increased to 23.8 percent, with 31,635 rural schools in the US. Despite overall growth, rural students are a minority in most states. Enrollment of students of color in rural schools rose by 31 percent, with 26.5 percent now being children of color. Rural education is diverse, with student poverty rates ranging from 9.7% to 71.9% across different states. Policy measures like the Investing in Innovation Fund can have unintended consequences for rural schools. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aimed to support rural applicants, but the \"rural preference\" provision mainly benefited urban projects. Rural schools use distance education more frequently than urban schools. Rural schools prioritize online distance learning and teacher training, with lower teacher salaries compared to other community types. The Act aims to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy and provide input on proposed changes affecting rural schools and communities. The Act aims to establish an Office of Rural Education Policy under Title II of the Department of Education Organization Act. The Act establishes an Office of Rural Education Policy within the Department of Education to advise on the needs of rural schools and the impact of policies on State and local educational agencies serving specific locale codes. The Office of Rural Education Policy, under the Director, will establish a clearinghouse for information on teacher recruitment, technology use, distance learning, student achievement, and innovative approaches in rural schools. The Office of Rural Education Policy will focus on innovative approaches in rural education, higher education and career readiness, early childhood development, partnerships with community-based organizations, professional development for rural teachers and principals, and access to grants and assistance for rural areas. The Office of Rural Education Policy focuses on grants, assistance, financing, research projects, coordination, and information related to rural schools. The Office of Rural Education Policy focuses on activities related to rural education, including housing, agricultural services, transportation, economic development, career training, health care, disability services, and mental health. It coordinates with relevant agencies, provides technical assistance, and produces an annual report on rural education conditions. The Office of Rural Education Policy produces an annual report on rural education conditions and coordinates with relevant agencies. The Secretary prepares impact analyses of rules and regulations that may affect rural schools. The Director prepares an initial regulatory impact analysis for public comment on proposed rules affecting State and local educational agencies. The analysis must meet requirements under title 5, United States Code, and be published in the Federal Register. When a final rule is issued, the Secretary must also prepare an impact analysis. The Secretary (acting through the Director) prepares a final regulatory impact analysis for public availability and publication in the Federal Register when issuing a final rule. The regulatory flexibility analysis must address the impact on State and local educational agencies serving specific locale codes. The effective date applies to regulations proposed more than 30 days after the enactment of the Act."
