The \"Traditional Banking Regulatory Relief Act of 2015\" allows traditional banking organizations to maintain a minimum simple leverage ratio, exempting them from risk-based capital requirements for 18 months if they fail to meet the ratio.

Federal banking agencies can impose additional capital adequacy measures to prevent risks to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The \"Traditional Banking Regulatory Relief Act of 2015\" exempts banking organizations from risk-based capital requirements if they meet a minimum simple leverage ratio and have a total gross notional exposure of swaps and security-based swaps not exceeding $3,000,000,000. The \"Traditional Banking Regulatory Relief Act of 2015\" allows for adjustments in measuring the simple leverage ratio capital requirements for traditional banking organizations, such as excluding intangible assets from total equity or adding off-balance sheet items to total assets. This ratio is not considered a generally applicable leverage capital requirement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Traditional banking organizations with a simple leverage ratio of 8 percent or more have 18 months to meet the minimum simple leverage ratio or make an election under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The minimum simple leverage ratio is defined under the Act. Traditional banking organizations can elect to maintain a simple leverage ratio as their sole measure of capital adequacy under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. This allows for reduced reporting requirements and on-site examinations for these organizations. Traditional banking organizations defined in section 18(aa)(3) can opt for a simple leverage ratio as their primary capital adequacy measure under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. This choice reduces reporting obligations and on-site inspections for these institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act is amended to allow for a longer 18-month period for stress testing, with exceptions for traditional banking organizations. Additionally, a technical amendment reorders subsections in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act."
