    "content": "The Construction Consensus Procurement Improvement Act of 2016 includes provisions for design-build construction process improvement and prohibits the use of reverse auctions for awarding contracts for design and construction services. The findings by Congress highlight the need for improved procurement procedures for design and construction services. They acknowledge the effectiveness of techniques adopted from the private sector, such as design-build and reverse auctions, but suggest that the current statutory framework for design-build could be refined. Federal officials have successfully used techniques adopted from the private sector, such as reverse auctions, to award contracts for commercially equivalent products. However, reverse auctions are generally not suitable for procurement of design and construction services due to the unique nature of each project. SEC. 3. DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IMPROVEMENT. Design-build construction process improvement includes criteria for the use of two-phase selection procedures in civilian contracts based on project value. For contracts over $3,000,000, two-phase selection is mandatory, while for contracts under that amount, the contracting officer decides on its appropriateness. The design-build construction process improvement includes criteria for using two-phase selection procedures in civilian contracts based on project value. The procedures are appropriate when the contracting officer anticipates receiving 3 or more offers, design work must be done before pricing, significant expenses will be incurred in preparing the offer, and project requirements and time constraints have been considered. The design-build construction process improvement includes criteria for using two-phase selection procedures in civilian contracts based on project value. Agencies must consider the project's suitability, contractor capabilities, agency's management capability, and other established criteria. Annual reports on design-build contracts awarded must be compiled by agency heads by November 30 of specified years. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will ensure public access to reports on contracts awarded without using two-phase selection procedures. GAO reports must be submitted within 270 days after the final reports deadline under section 3309 of title 41. The Comptroller General of the United States will issue a report analyzing Federal agencies' compliance with title 41, United States Code. SEC. 4 prohibits the use of a reverse auction for awarding contracts for design and construction services. Congress finds that sellers bid down the price in a reverse auction. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council must prohibit the use of reverse auctions for awarding contracts for design and construction services within 180 days. The term \"reverse auction\" refers to a real-time electronic auction where offerors compete by submitting bids for a supply or service contract with the ability to submit revised lower bids before the auction closes. This applies to procurement by an agency for various construction-related services and projects. The term \"reverse auction\" refers to a real-time electronic auction where offerors compete by submitting bids for a supply or service contract with the ability to submit revised lower bids before the auction closes. This can result in the award of the contract, delivery order, task order, or purchase order to the offeror based on the price obtained through the auction process."
