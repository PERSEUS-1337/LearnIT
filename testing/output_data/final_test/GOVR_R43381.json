    "content": "Dynamic scoring, or dynamic revenue estimating in tax legislation, incorporates macroeconomic effects of legislative changes on economic output. It is often associated with revenue legislation due to potential \"supply side\" effects from tax revisions. The Joint Committee on Taxation's current revenue estimates already include microeconomic behavioral responses affecting revenue yields. Dynamic scoring in tax legislation considers micro-economic behavioral responses that impact revenue yields. Various factors such as types of effects, models used, and behavioral responses influence the effects on revenues. Previous studies by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office have examined short-term stimulus effects, deficits or surpluses on crowding out, and crowding in. Supply side effects from tax cuts can either increase or decrease output due to offsetting income and substitution effects. Permanent tax code changes should not be evaluated based on fiscal timing, as short-term stimulus effects may be offset by the Federal Reserve System. A tax cut can impact labor supply and savings through income and substitution effects. It can increase consumption of leisure, reducing labor supply (income effect), while also making leisure more costly relative to consumption, increasing labor supply (substitution effect). Similarly, a tax cut on savings can lead to reduced savings in the present (income effect) but increased savings due to lower future consumption prices (substitution effect). These effects are measured as elasticities, showing the percentage change in quantity relative to price or income. The projected effects of a tax change on output and revenues depend on the design of the tax change, the type of model, and the magnitude of income and substitution elasticities. Two types of models for estimating supply side response are a simple growth model and an intertemporal model. Labor supply is likely to be the dominant factor during the budget horizon. Capital accumulation tends to increase slowly, with labor supply being the larger input. A tax change affects the capital stock by influencing savings or investment, typically only impacting 2% to 3% of the capital stock. Even with a 50% increase in the saving rate, the capital stock would only rise by about 1%. Outside the budget window, capital accumulation may become more significant and can outweigh the effects on labor. Revenue-neutral tax reforms focus on supply-side effects, with minimal impact on short-term demand or the deficit. Income effects are unlikely to reduce supply in a revenue-neutral change, especially if it is also distributionally neutral. In tax reform, behavioral responses are influenced by effective marginal tax rates and changes in the income base. Base broadening provisions can raise effective marginal tax rates enough to offset cuts in statutory rates, potentially leading to output contraction. The effects of base broadening tax reform cannot be projected without specifying how revenue is offset. The revenue from tax reform can be offset by base broadening, leading to supply side responses. Simple supply side models suggest that revenue effects are expected to be small, around 3% to 8%. More complex models show similar results for wage tax cuts, depending on how deficits or surpluses are managed. Many models used have implicit behavioral responses. Many models used in tax reform have implicit behavioral responses for labor supply that are larger than simpler growth models. The JCT's intertemporal model shows elasticities similar to empirical studies, with large responses to changes in taxes on capital income. However, these models have rigid structures that may not align with empirical evidence, raising questions about their theoretical balance with empirical justification. Dynamic scoring in tax reform models typically focus on the aggregate economy, with a single rate of return and savings supply. Corporate tax changes can impact the rate of return and savings rates, but may also affect capital flows more immediately than domestic savings. Aggregate models may not fully capture the effects of corporate tax changes on capital. The effects of increased domestic saving can have various impacts on the economy, including short-run stimulus effects, crowding out effects on investment, and supply side effects. Stimulus effects, like tax cuts, can temporarily boost output by increasing demand. However, crowding out occurs when increased deficits displace capital that would otherwise be used for private investment. The magnitude of these effects depends on the extent of government borrowing from foreign sources. Government borrowing from foreign sources can have various effects on the economy, including short-run stimulus effects, crowding out of investment, and supply side effects related to tax or other policies. These effects can be isolated through sensitivity analysis to control for stimulus and deficits effects. Short-run economic models like IS-LM focus on forecasting and short-run stimulus effects on aggregate demand, while neoclassical growth models like Solow models analyze labor and savings supply responses, capturing crowding out and supply side effects. The effects of stimulus are driven by labor supply and savings elasticities in intertemporal growth models. These models capture supply side responses, with two forms being the Ramsey model and the overlapping generation life-cycle model. Intertemporal models in economics involve agents with perfect foresight and can include risk and uncertainty. These models cannot sustain deficits or surpluses indefinitely, and even temporary deficits have no effects in the Ramsey model. Hybrid models combine short-term stimulus effects with growth models, such as combining an IS-LM model with a Solow model. These models also consider labor supply responses to changes in the rate of return and may include unemployment through sticky wages. Intertemporal models in economics involve agents with perfect foresight and can include risk and uncertainty. Hybrid models combine short-term stimulus effects with growth models, such as combining an IS-LM model with a Solow model. Some models allow unemployment through sticky wages and liquidity constraints, with different results based on model choice and elasticities. Open economy effects may be included in various ways, like introducing perfectly mobile capital or using rule-of-thumb offsets against crowding out. The infinite horizon model is incompatible with perfectly mobile international capital. In corporate models of a closed economy, the corporate tax is often simplified as falling on capital in general, with changes in the tax rate affecting capital allocation between corporate and non-corporate sectors. However, the corporate tax base is unlikely to change significantly due to offsetting effects on the capital stock and rate of return. Open economy considerations are important, especially in the context of perfectly mobile international capital. The corporate tax on equity can directly impact capital flows in an open economy, potentially increasing output. Dynamic scores and macroeconomic analyses can estimate these effects, as saving is slow to respond to changes in the rate of return. Capital flows from abroad are crucial dynamic issues to consider. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) provides dynamic estimates for U.S. legislative proposals, including macroeconomic analysis. They have been conducting macroeconomic analyses since 1997, using various modeling approaches to estimate effects on output, labor, savings, and other variables. The JCT's analyses are posted on their website, with the first analysis in 2003 using three types of models to analyze macroeconomic effects. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) has been conducting macroeconomic analyses since 1997. In 2003, they used three types of models to analyze macroeconomic effects, including a Solow growth/hybrid model and an OLG life-cycle model. The OLG model has been revised to include corporate tax modeling, and the Solow hybrid model (MEG) incorporates short-term stimulus effects, deficits, surplus, labor supply elasticity, and consumption savings effects. The JCT is currently revising their Ramsey model. The JCT and CBO have been conducting macroeconomic analyses since 1997. CBO provides estimates of economic effects of the President's Budget and budget projections. CBO dropped the Ramsey infinite horizon model in later analyses and did not use any intertemporal model. The CBO OLG model has been revised recently. The OTA performed dynamic analyses in 2006 on tax reform proposals and tax cuts using various models. The Solow model with fixed labor supply and positive savings response was used in the first analysis, while the OLG model was used for the tax cuts analysis. The Solow growth model is commonly used by government agencies and think tanks to study the effects of tax changes in the long run. The Ramsey infinite horizon model is used by central banks and macroeconomists to study business cycles and economic shocks. It is simpler to construct compared to the OLG life-cycle model, which is preferred by tax economists for intergenerational income shifts. Life-cycle modeling is challenging due to its complexity. Life-cycle modeling is challenging to construct, with pioneers like Alan Auerbach and Laurence Kotlikoff leading the effort. Various models, including the OLG model, have been used by different organizations like the JCT and the Treasury. The Senate and House Budget Resolutions for FY2014 have differing views on tax reform, with some advocating for revenue neutrality and others for raising revenue. Earlier proposals aimed to cut taxes while reforming, potentially making them close to revenue neutral currently. A revenue neutral tax reform that lowers the rate and broadens the base may not have a significant impact on the economy. Effects such as short run stimulus, crowding out of investment, and supply side responses would likely be eliminated in such a reform. Changes in the distribution of the tax burden could potentially lead to a small stimulus, depending on whether the burden shifts to high or low income individuals. A revenue neutral tax revision may not have a significant short-term stimulus effect or impact on crowding out. However, in the long run, flattening the individual income tax rate structure could lead to lower revenues due to reduced bracket creep, potentially causing crowding out. Supply side responses are often the main focus in such reforms. In a revenue neutral income tax reform, supply side responses are the main focus. Distributionally neutral reforms do not have aggregate income effects, but can impact labor and saving through substitution effects. Base broadening provisions can affect effective marginal tax rates and supply side responses of labor, savings, and investment, especially in corporate tax reform. In an open economy, changing tax burdens at the corporate level is crucial for investment as it directly affects international capital flows. Major provisions for base broadening in revenue neutral corporate tax reform offset effects on investment incentives of lowering rates. Accelerated depreciation, if traded for a rate reduction, would discourage investment by increasing the effective tax rate on new investments. Eliminating tax expenditures other than deferral could potentially reduce statutory corporate tax rates by about 5%. Eliminating tax expenditures, including accelerated depreciation, could lower statutory corporate tax rates by 5%, with 2-3 percentage points attributed to accelerated depreciation. Base broadening provisions may offset rate reductions, such as the production activities deduction, which could reduce the rate by 1 percentage point. This deduction affects profits from domestic production in certain industries, and its elimination could lead to increased effective rates for some profits. Eliminating tax expenditures like accelerated depreciation could lower corporate tax rates by 5%, with 2-3 percentage points from accelerated depreciation. This could impact multinational corporations and international capital inflows, potentially increasing investment. Other minor tax expenditures may have similar effects to accelerated depreciation. Using these provisions for a revenue neutral corporate tax reform may not significantly reduce the cost of capital or encourage investment. The new version of the OLG model used by JCT had a large effect on GDP, shifting intellectual property to the US. However, intellectual capital is not physically located, so ownership shifts do not increase productivity as the input already exists. The ownership shift of intellectual property to the US does not increase productivity as the input already exists. Taxes can impact labor supply, domestic savings, and capital inflows. Revenue neutral tax reform with cuts in marginal rates would have larger supply side effects. Labor supply increases from cuts in marginal rates on labor income. In intertemporal models, labor supply responds to the rate of return. A higher rate of return leads to increased present work for future leisure. This behavior boosts output in the short run through more labor input and capital stock growth. Individual income tax reforms affecting marginal effective tax rates can impact labor supply and savings. Base broadening provisions can alter marginal effective tax rates, influencing behavior. Base broadening provisions, like eliminating or capping state and local income tax deductions, can increase effective marginal tax rates. This change can raise the total tax rate on the last dollar of income, impacting taxpayers claiming itemized deductions. Raising the marginal tax rate by 2.1 percentage points for taxpayers claiming itemized deductions can have a broad impact on supply response, especially when considering participation effects. Various tax-favored income sources can influence supply response, such as the earned income credit for lower-income unmarried women. Excluding employer health insurance from taxation may not directly affect marginal wage but could impact participation response. A recent CRS report found that eliminating itemized deductions for top income taxpayers would not significantly change effective marginal tax rates. The elimination of deductions for state and local taxes and charitable contributions, which increase with income, had the most impact. Some provisions may have long-term effects but not within the budget horizon. For example, restricting mortgage interest or property tax deductions for existing homeowners may not affect labor supply choices in the short run. Contributions to employer pension and 401(k) plans may vary in impact across income ranges. Contributions to employer pension plans and 401(k) plans may vary in impact across income ranges. Eliminating the child credit could affect marginal taxes at different income levels. Base broadening proposals, like capping tax expenditures, could raise effective marginal tax rates for high income households. Addressing marginal effects in individual income tax reforms is complex. The effects of base broadening in individual income tax reforms are complex and add to the challenges of estimating macroeconomic effects. Dynamic scoring that does not consider these offsetting effects may overstate the effects of rate reductions financed with base broadening. Tax reform, even if revenue neutral, could impact marginal tax rates and generate supply side effects. Stimulus and crowding out effects should be considered in macroeconomic analysis. Supply side models need to be evaluated for appropriateness in tax revisions that alter revenue or effective marginal tax rates. The short run stimulus effects of tax cuts and tax increases should not be considered in dynamic revenue scoring. Tax cuts increase spending, re-employing resources and boosting output through multipliers. The short-term effects of tax cuts and tax increases on output are known as multipliers. These effects are temporary and only occur in underemployed economies. It is argued that these effects should not be considered in dynamic estimation due to the difficulty of reversing tax changes and the fact that spending multipliers are typically more powerful than tax cut multipliers. The magnitude of a stimulus effect depends on assumptions about the central bank's behavior. The Federal Reserve can offset fiscal stimulus with a monetary contraction or vice versa to maintain output. They can adjust interest rates to strengthen or weaken the stimulus, or maintain output objectives regardless of fiscal policy changes. When the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) does dynamic estimates, it considers how the Federal Reserve may counteract policy effects. Tax changes' impact on debt should be considered, as it affects financing through taxes or borrowing. Analyzing tax cuts as stand-alone policies should include supply side effects and debt crowding out. Spending cuts have similar effects on debt as revenue increases, so dynamic scoring should be applied to both spending and tax changes. The uncertainty surrounding debt effects lies in foreign financing. Intertemporal models require debt resolution for solutions. Temporary debt with eventual transfers has no crowding out effect in the Ramsey model. Supply side responses in tax analysis are beneficial, but unclear in uncertain projections. The Solow model explains economic growth using labor, capital, and technology. It can be used to calculate feedback effects and analyze tax changes. The model is adaptable and has been used to examine various economic scenarios. The Solow model can be used to analyze tax changes and calculate feedback effects. A simple version of the model suggests that a 20% reduction in marginal tax rates on labor taxes could increase output by 0.5% to 1% in the short run, with revenue feedback effects of 3% to 7%. Feedback effects for capital income are more complex and take time to achieve. In analyzing tax changes using the Solow model, a 100% increase in investment would only raise the capital stock by 3%. Feedback effects are illustrated using different labor supply and savings rate elasticities. The long-term effects show that savings must eventually adjust to the initial after-tax return. The long-term effects of tax changes in the Solow model show that savings must eventually adjust to the initial after-tax return. Larger savings elasticities can lead to more significant feedback effects, but none fully offset the revenue loss. Effects from labor tax changes in the budget horizon are close to the long-run steady state, while capital income tax cuts have small effects relative to the long-run steady state. In the Solow model, savings must adjust to the initial after-tax return over the long term. A 20% tax cut shows output effects, with JCT finding a 9-10% feedback effect in the first five years. The model discussed is a closed economy, but in an open economy, the capital stock might change more quickly. The effects of a capital income tax cut on output would depend on whether it is residence-based or source-based. Estimates suggest that the investment substitution elasticity is closer to 3, reducing the potential impact. A study on a ten percentage point decrease in the corporate tax rate showed an output increase of less than 0.2% for an elasticity of 3. The Solow model provided a labor supply response consistent with consumer choices between consumption and leisure. Economists were dissatisfied with the treatment of savings responses as a simple savings elasticity cannot be derived from utility functions. Intertemporal models were developed to incorporate a utility function for labor and savings supply responses, where consumers choose consumption and leisure over time. Issues arise with intertemporal models, such as the Ramsey infinite horizon or life-cycle OLG models. Intertemporal models incorporate labor supply and savings responses, with individuals having perfect foresight and information. Theoretical requirements include strong assumptions about individuals' information, but uncertainty can be included in models like the CBO OLG model. Individuals may have precautionary savings in uncertain lifetimes. Intertemporal models incorporate labor supply and savings responses, with individuals having perfect foresight and information. However, it is challenging to include institutional rigidities in the labor and savings markets in these models. Individuals can enter and leave the workforce without penalty, change hours, and borrow and lend without constraints. Intertemporal models cannot handle a permanent deficit leading to unlimited growth in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Intertemporal models presume a certain savings behavior that may not reflect actual behavior, as individuals may not always plan ahead for future periods in their life. Some individuals, like the young or those with limited knowledge, may not save according to these models and instead adjust consumption based on income changes. The CBO OLG model includes risk and precautionary savings, along with age-related borrowing constraints. Alternative models of savings, such as building a rainy day fund or saving for a specific target like a house down payment, are discussed by Elmendorf. The infinite horizon, or Ramsey, model version of the intertemporal model may not reflect actual individuals' choices unless they consider the welfare of their descendants. The OLG life-cycle model considers the welfare of descendants, with no marriage and asexual reproduction. The model's infinite savings elasticity makes it inconsistent with an open economy. The presence of childless agents and lack of marriage in the model may impact savings responses. Some models, like the Auerbach-Kotlikoff model, do not account for the unlikelihood of returning to the workforce after retirement. Fixed retirement ages in models like John Diamond's can be important in tax revisions. The loss of purchasing power from income taxes can lead retired individuals to re-enter the labor market. Uncertainty can be incorporated into models to account for different types of saving behaviors. The Congressional Budget Office OLG model includes this uncertainty, but the magnitude of the effect is unclear. The effect of a permanent tax cut on wages is similar in Solow and intertemporal models, but differs for capital income tax changes. Changes in tax timing and distribution can impact labor supply. Model projections vary based on parameters and elasticities. Empirical evidence includes labor supply and savings elasticities, intertemporal substitution elasticities, and Frisch elasticities. The elasticities discussed include labor supply response to permanent wage changes, relevant to dynamic models with supply side effects. Evidence suggests small and varied labor supply responses to wage increases, with potential negative effects for men. Labor supply responses to tax changes are small and varied across workers, with potential negative effects for men. Studies show that married women's responses have become more similar to men's as their labor market participation has increased. Recent surveys indicate that labor supply is largely inelastic for men. Labor supply responses to tax changes are small and varied across workers, with potential negative effects for men. Studies show that married women's responses have become more similar to men's as their labor market participation has increased. Recent surveys indicate that labor supply is largely inelastic for men, with substitution elasticity ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 and income elasticity from 0.0 to -0.1. Married women also exhibit substitution elasticities from 0.2 to 0.4. The CBO OLG model assumes zero labor supply elasticities, compatible with indefinite wage rate growth. Models without zero labor supply response require time-dependent changes in tastes for leisure vs. consumption. Labor supply elasticities are directly entered into Solow type models or derived from intertemporal models. The limited literature on savings elasticities in the late 1970s and 1980s used aggregate data to estimate the savings elasticity, showing small or possibly negative responses. Evidence suggests that savings is not responsive to rates of return, leading researchers to focus on intertemporal substitution elasticities instead. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) measures the percentage change in consumption ratio between two periods divided by their relative prices. It is the primary driver of savings responses and influences labor supply through intertemporal shifting of leisure. Studies have used macroeconomic consumption aggregates and individual behavior to estimate this elasticity. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) measures the percentage change in consumption ratio between two periods divided by their relative prices. Robert Hall's pioneering study found the elasticity to be extremely small, possibly zero, and statistically insignificant, with most subsequent studies producing elasticities below 0.5. A recent meta-analysis across many countries estimated an overall elasticity of 0.5 for the world on average and 0.6 for the United States, cautioning that the estimates may be inflated due to publication bias. The elasticity estimate being negative can lead to publication bias, with researchers being less likely to submit their articles. Correction for publication bias suggests that income and substitution elasticities may be overestimated. A meta-analysis found the elasticity for macro aggregate studies to be zero. The elasticity estimates for micro studies varied, with a range of 0.22 to 0.36 for asset holders. A preferred estimate of 0.33 was reported for asset holders with various characteristics selected. An IES for asset holders would only be appropriate if the model identified a separate group of liquidity constrained consumers. If macro elasticities were considered along with micro, an IES of zero to 0.2 might be more suitable. Other types of estimates, such as labor substitution elasticities, could also be affected by publication bias. The empirical evidence on the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution (IES) for consumption suggests a potential bias towards estimates aligned with economic theory. Concerns include the proximity of periods considered, which may overstate the elasticity, and the impact on savings from changes in tax rates on capital income. Additionally, the utility function's response to changes in the rate of return also affects leisure, raising questions about the accuracy of IES estimates in the budget horizon. The nature of the utility function and leisure's response to changes in the rate of return can lead to a significant short-run labor supply response. Empirical evidence does not support this response, especially when taxes on capital income are deeply cut. Ballard, discussing intertemporal model simulations, emphasized the importance of controlling the labor supply response to interest rates. The Frisch elasticity, estimating workers' response to wage rate changes over time, may not be crucial in analyzing permanent tax changes. The Frisch elasticity estimates workers' response to wage rate changes over time. There are two types of estimates: micro data studies show small elasticities, while aggregate micro data estimates tend to be larger. These macroeconomic estimates are based on variations in hours and wages over the business cycle, assuming some unemployment is voluntary. The Frisch elasticity estimates workers' response to wage rate changes over time. Micro data studies show small elasticities, with an inverted U shape in hours of work and wages over time. Keane surveyed 13 studies for men, with a mean elasticity of 0.85, influenced by one outlier. CBO researchers examined Frisch estimates based on microeconomic evidence. The paper discusses Frisch elasticities for married women, which tend to be higher than those of men and are declining. Labor force participation elasticities have been focused on those close to retirement. The authors suggest a range of Frisch elasticity from 0.27 to 0.53, with a central estimate of 0.4. The time endowment is a crucial parameter affecting labor supply response in intertemporal models used to analyze taxes. The time endowment is a crucial parameter affecting labor supply response in intertemporal models used to analyze taxes. A larger time endowment allows for more leisure, impacting labor supply elasticities. Factors like sleep, commuting, household activities, and family care also affect the share of leisure time. The American Time Use Survey shows that men aged 35 to 44 spend 42 hours a week working, while women in the same age range work 29 hours. Women dedicate more time to housework and family care. The ratio of leisure to work remains steady between the ages of 25 to 54 for both genders. If leisure time is assumed to be half of available hours for a full-time worker, they could effectively work two jobs (80 hours a week). A study by Auerbach and Kotlikoff set the time endowment at 5,000. The studies by Auerbach and Kotlikoff, as well as Fullerton and Rogers, set different time endowments leading to varying leisure shares. Current data shows average work hours for full-time and all workers. Models used range from 0.3 to 0.6 leisure to hours ratio. Estimates suggest labor income elasticity is between 0.0 and -0.1, substitution elasticity between 0.0 and 0.3, total labor supply elasticity less than 0.3, and savings rate elasticity around zero. The labor income and substitution elasticities in the Solow models are consistent with empirical estimates. The Treasury study shows lower elasticities for labor income and substitution effects but higher savings elasticity. Even small differences in these elasticities can have significant impacts on tax policy effects. The JCT model incorporates an intertemporal model of consumption over time, with parameters such as intertemporal elasticity of substitution and intratemporal substitution between leisure and consumption. To convert leisure demand into labor supply, substitution elasticity and income elasticity for leisure are multiplied by the ratio of leisure to hours available. The Frisch elasticity is the ratio of leisure to labor supply. The Frisch elasticity, intertemporal elasticity of labor supply, and derived elasticities are reported for various models in Table 4, including the JCT, CBO, and Treasury models. Intertemporal elasticities are large compared to empirical evidence, with only the Treasury model being a Ramsey model. These elasticities differ from Solow models in terms of labor substitution. The labor substitution elasticities in various models, such as the CBO, Treasury Ramsey, and Diamond tax reform, are higher than empirical estimates. The income elasticities are also too large, with most models showing a backward bending labor supply. The Frisch elasticity is notably high in the Treasury Ramsey model compared to other models. The labor substitution elasticities in different models are higher than empirical estimates, with income elasticities also being too large. The Frisch elasticity is notably high in the Treasury Ramsey model. To improve elasticities, adjustments can be made using the time endowment as a tool, as suggested by Ballard. For example, setting the intertemporal elasticity at 0.2, intratemporal substitution elasticity at 1.5, and leisure share of hours at 0.15 would lead to better elasticities. The CBO model is uncertain, leading to precautionary savings not sensitive to interest rates. Economists prefer intertemporal models over Solow models for savings treatment. However, intertemporal models lack transparency and may not align with empirical evidence on labor supply elasticities. The JCT model has come close to matching empirical evidence but can be improved further. The JCT model incorporates life-cycle elements in their MEG model without labor supply responses to interest rates. However, the assumption of equal substitution elasticities between consumption across distant periods may rest on unreasonable assumptions. There is a debate on whether intertemporal models do more harm than good, especially regarding feedback effects during the budget horizon. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of providing key parameters in economic models for evaluation and comparison. It highlights the labor supply model based on elasticity and tax rates. The model assumes a positive elasticity where labor increases with wage and decreases with tax rate. The response is to a percentage change in the after-tax share. The feedback effect of a tax rate on labor supply is estimated based on the after-tax share and labor elasticity. With a tax rate of 25% and elasticity of 0.1 to 0.2, the feedback effect ranges from 3.3% to 6.6%. This effect is influenced by the initial tax rate and elasticity, impacting wages, labor supply, and capital stock. The model considers the impact of tax rates on labor supply and capital stock, aiming to increase the rate of return to capital. It includes a production function showing how labor and capital can be combined, with a numeraire of the overall price level. Changes in prices depend on the wage and rate of return shares of income. The model uses a Cobb Douglas production function with fixed income shares. The model analyzes the impact of tax rates on labor supply and capital stock, aiming to increase the rate of return to capital. It uses a Cobb Douglas production function with fixed income shares. The equation for percentage changes is derived, showing the feedback response from the labor tax. With an across-the-board tax, the feedback effects are not significantly different, resulting in a slight increase in output. The model examines the impact of tax rates on labor supply and capital stock, aiming to boost the rate of return to capital. It utilizes a Cobb Douglas production function with fixed income shares. The equation for percentage changes is derived, demonstrating the feedback response from the labor tax. A decrease in the tax rate would increase output by a certain percentage, depending on the elasticity. The Solow growth model allows for growth in capital over time, enabling changes in capital through increased labor income. In the long run steady state, additional variables, output (Q) and the savings rate (s) have to be added. The savings rate is determined by the after-tax return, where t k is the tax rate on capital income. In the steady state, savings equals investment. The feedback effects have different numerators based on labor tax changes and capital income. These results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 for various elasticities. In the long run steady state, savings rate (s) is determined by the after-tax return, where t k is the tax rate on capital income. Feedback effects have different numerators for labor tax changes and capital income. Output effects can be calculated for changes in labor and capital."
