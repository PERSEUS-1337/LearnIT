    "content": "Habeas corpus allows individuals in custody to petition for release if detention is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has ruled on detainee rights, but has not granted relief to state prisoners claiming innocence. Legislation has been proposed to address these issues. The report provides an overview of recommendations and legislative proposals related to habeas relief. Federal law imposes bars to habeas relief for finality, federalism, and efficiency reasons. The second or successive petition bar does not apply in cases of newly discovered evidence proving innocence. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on granting habeas relief based solely on a claim of innocence. Two bills in the 111th Congress aimed to establish actual innocence as a basis for habeas relief: the Effective Death Penalty Appeals Act (H.R. 3986) and the Justice for the Wrongfully Accused Act (H.R. 3320). Representative Moore introduced H.R. 3320, while Representative Johnson introduced H.R. 3986 with other representatives. The Johnson bill sought to amend the bar on second habeas petitions to allow claims of innocence. The proposed legislation aims to allow petitions based on newly discovered evidence that could prove the applicant's innocence of the underlying offense. The Supreme Court has favored a probability standard for innocence claims in second or successive petition cases. The statutory provisions now require clear and convincing evidence for claims of innocence in cases challenging the aggravating factor for the death penalty. The Johnson bill proposed a constitutional defect plus innocence exception to the second or successive petition bar, allowing federal courts to consider evidence of probable innocence and release death row inmates who claimed innocence from statutory habeas bars. This would free federal courts from being bound by state court decisions that resulted in a death sentence without considering newly discovered evidence indicating probable innocence. The Moore bill aimed to focus on innocence exceptions for state prisoners, particularly those on death row, in second or successive habeas petitions. It would have eased restrictions on filing such petitions but maintained existing standards for dismissal unless based on new law or newly discovered evidence of innocence. The Moore bill proposed changes to the requirements for second or subsequent habeas petitions, allowing for exceptions based on new evidence of innocence. It aimed to permit courts to consider forensic evidence, exculpatory evidence, and evidence of official misconduct in support of claims of actual innocence. The Moore bill proposed changes to habeas petitions, allowing for exceptions based on new evidence of innocence, including forensic evidence, exculpatory evidence, and evidence of official misconduct. The bill also addressed the bar imposed for failure to exhaust state remedies, permitting habeas relief based on withheld evidence favorable to the defendant. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on the Moore bill. Several proposals in the 111th Congress related to judicial review for Guantanamo detainees, including the Military Commissions Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2009 (H.R. 64), Interrogation and Detention Reform Act of 2008 (H.R. 591), Enemy Combatant Detention Review Act of 2009 (H.R. 630), Terrorist Detainees Procedures Act of 2009 (H.R. 1315), Detainment Reform Act of 2009 (H.R. 3728), among others. The Boumediene v. Bush case established that Guantanamo detainees have the right to habeas corpus. The Military Commissions Act and Detainee Treatment Act limited federal court jurisdiction over detainee matters. The Detainee Treatment Act was deemed inadequate as a substitute for detainee habeas review. The Detainee Treatment Act was found to be an inadequate substitute for detainee habeas review, leading to an unconstitutional suspension of the writ. Various bills aimed to repeal section 7 of the Military Commissions Act, which sought to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo detainees' habeas petitions. The Smith, Hastings, and Graham bills proposed granting the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia authority to review the lawfulness of detention for different categories of individuals. The Smith, Hastings, and Graham bills proposed new habeas provisions for detained enemy combatants in the 111th Congress. Witnesses criticized aspects of federal habeas law in recent hearings, but no further legislative action was taken on these proposals. The American Bar Association criticized the one-year statute of limitations in federal habeas law, expressing concerns over its complexity. They also disagreed with the binding effect of state court determinations of federal law. Chief Justice Kogan and Mr. Hanlon suggested changes to the \"opt in\" provisions for streamlined habeas procedures in capital cases. Professor Blume and Chief Justice Kogan recommended modifications to the habeas process. The federal courts were urged to modify the habeas \"procedural default\" bar by Professor Blume and Chief Justice Kogan. Mr. Hanlon recommended federal funding for capital defender organizations and suspension of federal executions for data analysis on disparities. Chief Justice Kogan also raised concerns about the Teague rule, harmless error, and deference to state fact finding. Chief Justice Kogan raised concerns about the Teague rule, harmless error, and deference to state fact finding in the context of habeas reform debate. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on these issues. The 111th Congress adjourned without further action on these matters."
