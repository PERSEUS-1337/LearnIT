    "content": "Market and technological changes are challenging traditional business models of broadcast television networks and local stations, while also creating opportunities. These changes are strengthening the position of content controllers in negotiations with distributors and may impact U.S. government media policy pillars. Stakeholders have requested the FCC to review and potentially modify broadcast media ownership and retransmission consent rules. The FCC is currently gathering data and comments for its quadrennial review. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is advocating for the elimination of cross-ownership restrictions and relaxation of restrictions on owning multiple television stations in a single local market. They argue that these rules hinder efficient combinations needed to support local news and emergency journalism. However, other stakeholders believe that such consolidation would harm diversity of voices, competition, and localism. The National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters opposes consolidation in the broadcast industry, claiming it puts smaller firms at a competitive disadvantage. The FCC is considering a petition to amend retransmission consent rules, with some stakeholders opposing FCC intervention. The FCC is considering intervention in the broadcast industry, which some stakeholders oppose. Broadcast networks and stations control valuable program content but face competition from various media outlets due to market changes. Advertisers have alternative avenues to reach consumers, impacting global advertising growth. Global advertising is facing challenges as technology advancements lead to a loss of growth to other marketing channels. Structural changes in broadcast television advertising are accelerating, posing a significant challenge to networks and stations heavily reliant on advertising revenue. Various research companies project different levels of advertising revenues, but all identify similar trends. For example, Magna Global forecasts a decline in English language advertising revenues. According to Magna Global, English language national broadcast networks saw a peak in advertising revenues in 2005, followed by a decline in 2006-2007 and a significant drop in 2008-2009. Recovery began in 2010 but is not expected to reach previous levels until around 2015. Spanish language national broadcast networks also experienced a slight decline from their peak in 2007 but are projected to grow rapidly, potentially exceeding $1.5 billion in 2015. The Olympics have historically boosted advertising revenues for networks, but this trend is expected to decrease as more programming moves to cable networks and the Internet. Local broadcast television stations' non-political advertising revenues peaked in 2007 at $17.8 billion, declined in 2008 and 2009, and are now increasing but not expected to reach the 2007 high by 2015. Political advertising revenues, higher in even-numbered years, especially during presidential elections, will continue to grow substantially. However, political advertising revenues are concentrated in areas with contested elections. Total broadcast television advertising revenues are forecasted to at best recover to their previous peak in the next five years. The outlook for broadcasters' non-advertising revenues is improving due to competition among companies delivering video programming. Broadcast networks can demand higher cash payments from distributors for retransmission rights, creating a new revenue stream projected to grow significantly in the coming years. The outlook for broadcasters' non-advertising revenues is improving with projected growth in retransmission consent revenues. Technological innovations are creating new broadcast revenue sources, such as mobile digital television technology developed by broadcast groups. The broadcast technology allows stations to broadcast encrypted video signals that can be received by anyone in its service area with the appropriate receiver. Bandwidth and spectrum requirements increase with the number of video signals offered, but not with the number of users. Broadcasters can share the same spectrum, avoiding usage charges for consumers. Broadcasters may not offer as much programming as wireless broadband providers, but they own or control essential content. Broadcasters have the advantage of owning or controlling key programming sought by consumers. The digital transition allows for multicasting, potentially increasing advertising and revenue. Analysts are optimistic about the impact on broadcast station cash flow. However, new revenue streams are unproven, and technological advancements like 3-D programming may favor pay-television models over traditional broadcasting. The broadcasting industry is facing declining advertising revenues, leading to concerns about the future of broadcast television news and sports programming. Despite the success of cable news networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC still attract more prime time viewers. However, network news programs are losing audience share, with an average viewer age of 63.1 years. This aging audience results in less advertising revenue, prompting national broadcast networks to make cuts in their news divisions. Some national news divisions have made cuts that could impact news coverage. Local TV news viewership is declining, but Americans still rely on broadcast TV for news. Stations are producing more original news programming, but some have reduced staff. Some news hours are repeats, and stations sell programming to other outlets. Sports leagues receive high payments for TV rights, and cable networks are successful. Sports leagues are receiving high payments for TV rights, with cable networks successfully bidding for major events. The NCAA signed a $10.8 billion agreement with CBS and Turner Cable Networks for the rights to NCAA basketball tournament games. Major sports leagues are keeping some events for cable networks in which they have an equity stake. The NFL, Big Ten Conference, and New York Yankees have their cable networks for exclusive game distribution. Popular teams' schedules are increasingly on cable networks, limiting access to non-subscribers. Broadcasters argue for relaxed ownership rules to maintain free programming availability. They fear retransmission consent rule changes could hinder negotiations with distributors. The National Association of Broadcasters recommends policies to support local broadcasters in generating non-advertising revenue and optimizing news resources. This will ensure a strong financial base for local news production, despite some market data suggesting no risk to broadcast news and sports programming. Broadcast networks and stations rely on news and sports programming for revenue, which is easier to control costs compared to scripted or syndicated programming. Cost-cutting measures and new business models are being implemented to maximize economies of scope in newsgathering and program production. Congress and the FCC may need to review how to support localism, diversity, and competition in light of audience fragmentation and high upfront costs for newsgathering and sports rights. Programming will need to be distributed across multiple platforms to recoup these costs. Some broadcasters argue that cooperative sharing of facilities and staff does not provide significant cost savings or additional revenues compared to merging with other news organizations. Concerns about reduced diversity, competition, and local programming have been raised with consolidation. Congress and the FCC may reconsider the benefits and drawbacks of consolidating newsgathering capabilities and potentially establish guidelines to balance the harms and benefits. The State of the News Media 2010 study and a Nieman Foundation Special Issue report present similar portraits of market forces affecting national broadcast television news networks. These long-term structural trends have challenged old business models but networks have adapted and survived. ABC, CBS, and NBC have national news divisions producing evening newscasts and morning news shows for local affiliates. FOX is the exception. The national broadcast television networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, produce a mix of news programming including evening newscasts, morning news shows, public affairs discussion shows, news magazine shows, and breaking news reports. Despite losing audience to cable and Internet providers, they still reach a larger audience. In the late 1990s, the networks were able to earn profits on their news programming by controlling costs, while entertainment and sports programming were losing money. NBC News remains the most watched and profitable national broadcast news division, thanks to a multiplatform organization that shares costs across broadcast, cable, and Internet platforms. In contrast, ABC and CBS struggle with profitability due to lack of cost-sharing opportunities and ineffective Internet presence. The average nightly audience for the three major broadcast networks has declined significantly over the years. The audience for broadcast network morning news shows has fallen for the past five years, with a decrease from 30.4 million in 1980 to 22.3 million in 2009. The prime time news magazine programs continue to attract large audiences, and the evening newscasts of Spanish language networks Univision and Telemundo have audiences almost as large as major cable news networks. The declining and aging audience for news shows has impacted advertising revenues. The audience for evening newscasts on broadcast networks remains larger than other programming at that time, attracting premium advertising. However, advertising revenues have been declining, leading to periodic layoffs and closures of bureaus. Networks are increasingly relying on outside sources and pooling footage to cut costs. Broadcast news networks have expanded their use of \"pooling\" to share footage from a single camera with other networks, reducing breaking news coverage and cutting costs. ABC, CBS, and NBC have all reduced their staff numbers in recent years. They are trimming overseas bureaus and relying more on one-person operations. The networks continue to use news teams to create hybrid news and entertainment programming during prime time, which is less expensive to produce than scripted entertainment. Newsmagazine programs are cost-effective compared to scripted entertainment due to shared costs with hard news programming and lower demands for salaries. Despite attracting smaller audiences, they can be more profitable and provide credibility to news teams. They serve as the financial backbone for network news organizations, which have implemented cost containment measures since the late 1990s. Since the late 1990s, news networks have sought economies of scope by using news assets to generate revenue across multiple platforms. NBC exemplifies this model by generating income from broadcasting, cable, internet sites, and news channels worldwide. This approach allows NBC to cover the costs of newsgathering for various programs, resulting in a significant decrease in the average cost per hour of news production. The 2010 Pew Study highlights NBC News as a profit center for NBC Universal, with revenue mainly coming from cable news channels like MSNBC and CNBC. ABC and CBS News lack multiplatform systems, potentially leading them to seek partnerships with other news organizations like cable news networks. NBC has already developed a successful multiplatform strategy, indicating a shift towards web and video streaming platforms for news distribution and revenue generation. ABC and CBS News may seek partnerships with cable news networks like CNN and CBS, as well as non-television newsgathering organizations to share costs. This consolidation could ensure the existence of strong newsgathering organizations but may reduce diversity and competition. Antitrust review would be triggered by a formal tie between major news organizations. The proposed merger or formal tie between major newsgathering organizations would undergo antitrust review by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to assess its impact on competition. The FCC would also review any transfer of ownership or control of spectrum licenses to determine if it is in the public interest, considering factors like diversity of voices and localism. The merger of two major newsgathering organizations would impact diversity and competition at the national level. FCC rules apply to local markets if the merging companies own local outlets. Cable news networks without a local presence would not be subject to FCC ownership rules. There are no specific criteria for evaluating the public interest implications of a broadcast news network merging with a cable news network. NBC and FOX already own broadcast and cable news networks without unique restrictions. It may be challenging for the FCC to impose conditions on a potential merger between a broadcast news network like ABC or CBS and a cable news network due to different regulatory requirements. Major newspaper companies could be potential partners for broadcast news networks looking to share newsgathering costs and expand their reach. These newspaper companies already have experience in video news production and a presence in local markets, which could complement a merger with a broadcast news network. The proposed combination of a major newspaper company with a broadcast news network like ABC or CBS would be subject to the local market broadcast-newspaper cross-ownership rule, potentially requiring divestment of a television station or newspaper to complete the merger. Major newspaper companies also own broadcast television stations that may compete with ABC or CBS owned-and-operated stations in local markets. The local market broadcast ownership rules could hinder a merger between a major newspaper company and a broadcast news network like ABC or CBS. Internet competition and audience fragmentation are impacting news organizations, with cable news networks experiencing varying viewership trends. The cumulative audience of cable news networks slightly declined between 2002 and 2009, but revenues and profits remain strong. Aggregate revenues for major cable news networks increased from $2.62 billion in 2008 to $2.76 billion in 2009. Newspaper readership, revenues, and profits are decreasing, with a decline in the number of daily newspapers in the United States. Newspaper circulation in the United States saw a significant decline in September 2009, with daily circulation dropping by 31.5% and Sunday circulation by 27% compared to peak totals in the last 25 years. Advertising revenues for newspapers also fell by 23% in 2007 and 2008, and by 26% in 2009. Despite cost-cutting measures, newspaper operating margins decreased from the high teens in 2007 to around 8% in 2009. This decline in newspapers contrasts with the relatively stable revenues and profits of cable news networks during the same period. Broadcast network consolidation is shifting towards cable news networks instead of newspaper companies, aligning with U.S. media policy to promote localism. However, this trend may result in a decrease in national and international news coverage. Currently, about half of non-PBS broadcast TV stations in the U.S. produce original local news, while 14% air news produced by other stations, and nearly 40% do not broadcast local news at all. The number of stations creating their own news has slightly decreased since 2009, but there has been a slight increase in stations airing news produced by others. Stations producing local news have increased their original programming from 4.7 to 5.0 hours per weekday on average. The increase in local news programming on non-PBS broadcast TV stations continued in 2009, with an average of 5.0 hours per weekday, up from 4.7 hours in 2008. While most stations did not change their newscast hours, 28.6% added a newscast and 13.7% cut one, mostly on weekends. This trend occurred despite declining viewership and advertising revenues for local news programs. The Pew Study found that ratings, share, and viewership declined for local news programming in 2009. In 2009, ratings, share, and viewership declined for local news programming on major broadcast networks. Even FOX affiliates saw decreasing viewership, including those airing news at nontraditional times. Independent stations attracted a small portion of the news audience. The broadcasting industry is concerned about declining station advertising revenues affecting profitability and news programming. It is challenging to accurately assess individual television station profits due to ownership structures. Nonetheless, reports on individual stations can offer insights into profitability trends. The NAB collects data on local station revenues, expenses, and profits in an annual Television Financial Report. Profits for local broadcast television stations declined in the late 1990s, possibly due to competition from cable channels. Data from 1998-2008 show that profits are cyclical, falling in economic downturns and increasing in even-numbered years due to political advertising and the Olympic Games. Average profits for local broadcast television stations have remained significantly higher than median profits, with a small number of highly profitable stations driving up the average. Profits have not reached the high levels seen in 1998, possibly due to high debt loads from leveraged borrowing for station acquisitions. This increased risk of financial loss despite positive operating cash flow, as debt service is not factored into cash flow calculations. The NAB's Television Financial Reports show that while most stations have positive operating cash flows, some major network affiliates in small markets, Spanish language stations in large markets, and independent stations experienced negative cash flow in 2008. Losses may be due to poor management or other factors such as allocation of non-station-specific costs or insufficient advertising in small markets. Independent Spanish-language stations in large markets may struggle to attract advertising revenue due to their niche audience. While most stations have positive cash flows, high debt loads can lead to pre-tax losses. Financial distress can impact station investment and programming decisions, leading to potential financial restructuring. The financial position of stations with pre-tax losses depends on factors like operating cash flows, network affiliations, local news programming success, and interest expenses from leveraged acquisitions. Stations facing losses due to market changes and lack of strong brand identities are more likely to cut back on local news programming. The FCC could collect data to better understand the situation. The FCC could collect data to analyze the impact of market changes on local news programming. Falling profits have reduced selling prices of broadcast television stations, with broadcast licenses becoming less valuable due to alternative advertising avenues. Most stations are expected to continue generating revenues exceeding operating costs. Broadcast television stations will continue to generate revenues exceeding operating costs, but the value of broadcast licenses may not rebound to previous peaks. Owners who acquired licenses at peak prices may struggle to cover acquisition costs. Financial decisions regarding local news programming are more influenced by the programming's direct financial impact rather than the station's overall financial status. While stations are not required to report specific financial information on news programming, it is known that such programming contributes significantly to station revenues. Local news programming contributes significantly to station revenues, with an average of 44.7% reported by news directors. Despite only accounting for 16% of the broadcast day, local news generates 39% of a station's revenues on average. This suggests that news programming is becoming more important for revenue generation, even though it represents a smaller share per hour of programming. News programming remains profitable for most stations, with a higher percentage of news directors characterizing their programming as profitable compared to unprofitable or breaking even. Profitability did not vary significantly by market size, ranging from 42.9% in the largest markets to 51.7% in markets 26-50. The profitability of news programming varies by market size, with 45.8% of stations in the smallest markets reporting profits. Even for stations where news is not profitable, it can still be beneficial for brand identity or lead-in to entertainment programming. Station spending on news does not necessarily correlate with market size, and a higher proportion of stations in large markets do not produce local news. Table 3 shows news expenses by market size and station affiliation. Average news expenses decrease with market size due to heavy spending by a few stations in large markets. Stations affiliated with major networks are more likely to invest in news programming. Over a quarter of TV stations in the top 60 markets have no news expenses. Television stations are cutting costs, with many affiliates not having news programming expenses. Despite an increase in news programming quantity, news staff positions have decreased. Budget cuts and staff reductions were reported by two-thirds of TV news directors in 2009. Stations have laid off experienced staff, reduced salaries, and used part-time journalists for news production due to technological changes. The digitization of television program production has led to changes allowing stations to use fewer editors and skilled staff for news programming. There is a trend towards \"one-man bands\" where reporters are equipped with cameras to eliminate the need for separate camera operators. Many television news departments provide content for media platforms other than their own station, with approximately one-third of stations producing news for another station in their local market. Over 40% of local stations make their programming available on mobile devices. Stations are increasingly producing news programming for multiple platforms, allowing them to share costs and resources. More than 60% of stations are involved in cooperative newsgathering agreements, with smaller stations being less likely to participate. Additionally, over 40% of local stations offer their programming on mobile devices. Stations are utilizing their newsgathering and news production capabilities to provide programming on secondary video streams. Over 50% of news directors oversee some portion of this programming, which includes all-news formats, weather channels, and entertainment programming with local news. Nearly all stations have websites, with the majority offering news videos and some providing live newscasts. Broadcast television stations are increasingly focusing on local content distribution through websites to strengthen their brand identity. SNL Kagan has observed a trend towards \"hyper-localism\" where stations combine their capabilities to create a strong local brand identity. Local content has become a cornerstone of broadcasters' strategies, tailored specifically for the web to reach local audiences. Many broadcasters are engaging in M&A deals to expand their local content online. Many broadcasters are focusing on M&A deals to grow local content online and increase market share. Broadcast-based mobile digital television may further strengthen this strategy. Local news is popular, especially during emergencies, leading to stations employing a three-screen approach. Stations are also producing programming for other media outlets and engaging in cooperative newsgathering arrangements. These strategies help stations compete successfully in the market despite advertising revenue challenges. The Pew Study found that producing more local content is cost-effective for stations compared to syndication programming fees. While local news programming seems secure in the current market, individual stations may face challenges in decision-making. Nearly 40% of broadcast television stations, mainly in large markets, do not offer local news programming. Introducing original local news may not necessarily boost profits for stations with weak brand identity and no existing audience for such programming. Almost one-third of local broadcast television stations cooperate with other media outlets for news programming. About one-quarter participate in cooperative agreements with other stations or newspapers in their market. These arrangements are not subject to FCC ownership rules as long as each retains control of their programming decisions. The NAB and Newspaper Association of America seek to reduce restrictions on local television and newspaper mergers. The FCC revised its ownership rules in 1999 to allow common ownership of two stations in a market with at least eight competing owners. The FCC revised ownership rules in 1999 to allow common ownership of two stations in a market with at least eight competing owners. This rule change permits a single entity to own two stations in a large market, known as a \"duopoly.\" Stations affiliated with major news networks are more likely to originate local news programming. The FCC revised ownership rules in 1999 to allow duopoly ownership of two stations in a market. Data is needed to determine the impact on independently produced local news programming. The FCC should collect relevant data to investigate the effect of duopolies on local news programming. This could help determine if the current rule should be retained, eliminated, or modified for a case-by-case approach. The FCC allowed duopoly ownership of two stations in a market in 1999, leading to various contractual arrangements like LMAs and joint operating agreements. These \"virtual duopolies\" are permitted as long as one station does not program more than 15% of the other station's programming day. This allows for shared newsgathering activities and news programming production within the 15% limit. In some cases of virtual duopoly arrangements, a station group is actively involved in creating and financing a separate entity to acquire stations in markets where the group already owns a station. This allows the station group to effectively control more than one station in the market. For example, Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation owns six TV stations operated by Sinclair Broadcast Group under LMAs, while Mission Broadcasting, Inc. owns 15 TV stations managed by Nexstar Broadcasting Group through LMAs. There are close financial relationships between these entities. LMAs and similar arrangements between broadcasters like Nexstar and Mission allow for financial relationships and potential efficiencies. The impact of LMAs on local news programming is unclear, and collecting data on this could inform FCC regulations on multiple ownership rules. This could lead to a decision on whether to retain or modify the rules to address LMAs, with considerations for a bright line rule or case-by-case review. LMAs and similar arrangements in broadcasting can lead to cost savings and promote competition, diversity, and local programming. However, they have faced criticism for potentially enabling broadcasters to increase retransmission consent fees, especially affecting small cable operators. Members of the American Cable Association have raised concerns about the leverage broadcasters have in negotiating agreements for multiple local stations. The American Cable Association members have raised concerns about higher retransmission consent fees when negotiating with broadcasters representing multiple \"Big 4\" stations. Cable operators argue that these increased fees will lead to higher subscriber bills, impacting their ability to support local news and sports programming. LMAs strengthen affiliated stations' position in negotiating advertising rates with local merchants by acting as a single entity. Advertisers may benefit from accessing two separate audiences through one negotiation, but may face disadvantages compared to negotiating with independent stations, especially if the stations are major network affiliates. This could increase advertising revenues for virtual duopoly stations, potentially boosting resources for local news programming. The FCC may conduct a study on the impact of virtual duopolies on advertising revenues for non-duopoly stations. Market pressures are pushing local television stations and newspapers to develop multiple program platforms and engage in cooperative newsgathering agreements. Some newspapers may urgently need to combine with other local newsgathering organizations. The FCC rule regarding media mergers in smaller markets is based on public interest criteria, with a presumption against combinations involving top-rated stations. However, mergers involving failing stations or newspapers are considered in the public interest. Financial stability and commitment to newsroom investment are key factors in evaluating mergers. The FCC rule on media mergers in smaller markets is based on public interest criteria, with a presumption against combinations involving top-rated stations. Smaller papers are in a better financial position than large dailies due to less dependence on classified ads and closer relationships with readers and advertisers. The current rule considers financial distress in addressing proposed mergers in smaller markets, with the burden on the entities proposing the merger to make a public interest case. The FCC rule on media mergers in smaller markets is based on public interest criteria, with a presumption against combinations involving top-rated stations. Smaller papers are in a better financial position than large dailies due to less dependence on classified ads and closer relationships with readers and advertisers. The ability to claim financial distress raises an interesting policy issue for companies that expanded through acquisition using highly leveraged financing. If a newspaper or television station group experienced distress due to risky choices, could they justify a merger based on this financial distress? The FCC rule on media mergers in smaller markets is based on public interest criteria, with a presumption against combinations involving top-rated stations. Smaller papers are in a better financial position than large dailies due to less dependence on classified ads and closer relationships with readers and advertisers. The ability to claim financial distress raises an interesting policy issue for companies that expanded through acquisition using highly leveraged financing. If a station or newspaper experienced distress due to risky choices, could that distress provide the basis for rebutting a negative public interest presumption against allowing a merger with another local station? Unique supply-side and demand-side characteristics of major sports programming create market forces that are very different than those for other types of programming. Major sports programming presents unique, time-sensitive events for which there is no close substitute programming. The control over access to sports events allows sports entities to negotiate from a position of strength with programmers and distributors. Major sports programming has a distinct audience with high demand. A minority of U.S. households have high demand for sports programming, influencing their choice between free broadcast or pay TV services. This affects the decisions of pay TV distributors. However, the larger audience for sports programming is less likely to base their subscription decisions on sports content. Both audiences include men who watch limited amounts of sports. The entity controlling sports programming considers demand characteristics like mass appeal, high-intensity appeal, and unique appeal when creating a profit-maximizing distribution strategy. Major sports entities use sports programming to promote their brand identities and attract competitive bidding for rights. For example, in 1987, ESPN acquired rights to offer ESPN Sunday Night Football by simulcasting games on local broadcast stations. In 1993, FOX Broadcasting Company successfully bid $1.58 billion for four years of NFL programming rights, establishing credibility as a major distributor of sports programming. This move allowed FOX to attract key talent, expand its network, and acquire additional affiliates. DirecTV later obtained exclusive rights to the NFL Sunday Ticket package as part of its branding strategy. The ticket package for \"out of market\" games and sports programming is part of a branding strategy to position the provider as a top sports programming source. Major sports programming attracts a large audience, offering value to the network by promoting other programs to viewers. Cross-marketing is common when the network owning the sports programming also has other broadcast or cable networks. This results in increased bids for sports programming rights. Bids for sports programming rights increased due to the entry of successful cable networks like TBS, TNT, and ESPN, reaching millions of households. Despite lower advertising revenues than broadcast networks, cable networks earned substantial per subscriber fees. In 2010, ESPN commanded $4.41 per subscriber, TNT $0.96, and TBS $0.48. In 2008, subscriber license fees represented 54.0% of revenues for advertiser-supported cable networks, while advertising revenues only represented 42.2% of revenues. Advertising revenues fell in 2009, leading to a smaller share of cable network revenues from advertising. Broadcast networks rely more on advertising, around 90% of revenues, compared to cable networks. Broadcast networks also collect retransmission consent compensation from video providers. Advertising revenues are sensitive to the business cycle, making them less stable than subscriber fees for cable networks. Broadcast networks rely on less stable revenue sources than cable networks, leading them to demand financial assistance from local station affiliates for expensive sports programming. The uncertainty of advertising revenues makes it challenging for broadcast networks to accurately predict their available funds for bidding on sports rights. This was exemplified in February 2002 when News Corp cited a downturn in advertising as the reason for a $909 million operating loss. NBC took a $909 million one-time operating charge for broadcast sports contracts with the NFL, MLB, and Nascar due to a downturn in advertising. Despite bidding $2.2 billion for the 2010 and 2012 Olympic Games, NBC lost approximately $200 million on the 2010 Olympics. This negative financial outcome may impact future bids for Olympic programming rights. NBC's strategy for the 2010 Olympics, despite financial losses, involved extensive coverage across various networks and online platforms. The broadcast network and cable channels offered over 835 hours of sports programming, including live coverage, utilizing multiple outlets to reach a wider audience. This approach is likely to influence future Olympic broadcasting models. The 2010 Olympics strategy involved extensive coverage across various networks and online platforms, with over 835 hours of programming spread across multiple outlets. This approach of using several networks for coverage was successful and is likely to influence future broadcasting models. The sports programming market is evolving with the adaptation of coordinating television and Internet for more hours of programming. A recent survey shows a growing number of fans using the Internet for sports alongside television. Major sports entities are creating their own national programming. Major sports entities like the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles have their own cable networks for exclusive sports event distribution. This strategy allows them to leverage limited \"must-have\" programming into year-round payment by bundling it with less-demanded content. They insist on placement on the tier with the most subscribers to maximize monthly fees. Sports entities leverage must-have programming by ensuring placement on the tier with the largest number of subscribers to maximize monthly fees and secure year-round payment. Cable companies initially resisted this placement, preferring a special sports tier, but sports entities have succeeded by threatening to lose subscribers to operators carrying their channels on a basic tier. This strategy exploits the high demand for sports events among a significant minority of television households. The unique supply and demand characteristics of major sports programming give sports entities control over access to events and the ability to command economic rents. Broadcasters have little control over the high license fees for broadcasting sports events, leading to sports networks accounting for a larger percentage of programming costs. Broadcast networks are adapting by coordinating with other programs. Broadcast networks are adapting by collaborating with other distributors to compete effectively for programming rights and increase revenues. They are seeking a share of fees from cable and satellite operators for retransmission of major sports programming, and developing multi-platform distribution strategies with cable and Internet outlets. This allows broadcasters to retain a portion of sports programming while ceding more to cable networks. Given the greater control sports entities have over production and distribution, regulatory rules aimed at broadcasters may not impact broadcast provision of major sports programming. Congress may need to consider sports entities, blackout policies, antitrust laws, and FCC program carriage rules in ensuring public access to major sports programming. The NFL imposes blackouts on games not sold out 72 hours in advance, even if it harms the home team and fans. This is to maintain the quality of the televised program by showing a full stadium of fans. Taxpayers who funded the stadium may feel deceived if denied television access to the games. The NFL imposes blackouts on games not sold out 72 hours in advance to maintain the quality of the televised program. Taxpayers who funded the stadium may feel deceived if denied television access to the games, impacting team revenues and local tax revenues. Market intervention may be justified to prevent harm to a team and its community, with bundling as a potential solution. Market intervention may be justified to prevent harm to a team and its community, with bundling as a potential solution. With a majority of households subscribing to multichannel video providers, the sports entity can insist on programming being carried on the tier with the largest subscriber base, potentially impacting consumer welfare. Is there a public policy basis for intervention to keep sports broadcasts free for all households? Public policy basis for market intervention to keep sports programming on \"free\" broadcast television and devising intervention that is not harmful."
