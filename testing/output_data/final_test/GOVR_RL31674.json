    "content": "During the 107th Congress, the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act was introduced by Representatives Don Young and John Mica. Initially, the Bush administration opposed arming pilots with lethal weapons. The bill was amended to cap participation at 2% of eligible pilots for a two-year test period. An amendment by Representative Peter DeFazio removed the cap and sunset provision, leading to the bill's passage by a vote of 310-113. Senator Robert Smith also introduced a similar bill. On November 12, 2002, Representative Richard Armey introduced H.R. 5710 (107th Congress) containing provisions for arming pilots, limited to passenger air carrier aircraft. On November 19, 2002, the Senate amended H.R. 5005 (107th Congress) to allow pilots of passenger air carrier aircraft to be armed. The debate over arming pilots focused on the benefits, risks, and costs of the program. Proponents argued that arming pilots could deter or thwart terrorist acts, while opponents, including airlines and aviation safety experts, raised concerns about safety risks and monetary costs. Critics of the program raised concerns about added workload, risks of firearm discharge, and proliferation of firearms on aircraft. These concerns were recognized by Congress and proponents of the plan. Debate in the 108th Congress focused on whether all-cargo pilots should be included in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. In the 108th Congress, legislation was introduced to expand the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include cargo pilots and other flight crew members. Bills such as H.R. 765 and S. 516 sought to achieve this, with S. 1657 passing in the Senate. Additionally, the Air Cargo Security Act included a provision for all-cargo pilots to be part of the program. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program was expanded to include other flight crew members such as flight engineers and those flying for all-cargo air carriers. Implementation of the program required assessments of pilot selection, equipment, training, operational procedures, and costs. The TSA formed a task force to address these issues and developed a plan for implementation. Congressional oversight of the program is expected to continue. The 108th Congress debated and passed legislation (P.L. 108-176) to allow pilots of all-cargo air carriers and flight engineers to participate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. Screening and selection criteria for volunteer pilots are being considered, including the need for additional background checks to ensure physical and psychological capability. Congressional oversight of the program is expected to continue. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program allows pilots to carry firearms on the flight deck after rigorous screening and evaluations. Proponents argue that pilots are already highly scrutinized employees, undergoing various assessments throughout their careers. Captain Stephen Luckey of ALPA emphasized the extensive evaluations pilots undergo, including pre-employment checks, flight physicals, drug testing, and criminal history checks. Recent examples of confirmed and suspected suicides and sabotage by flight crew personnel suggest a potential need for more detailed background checks of pilots participating in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. There is debate on whether additional screening, including psychiatric evaluation, is necessary to detect pilots who may pose a risk. Some argue that current screening and peer monitoring are insufficient, while others believe detailed psychiatric screening is essential to assess pilots' mental health. Some argue that detailed psychiatric screening for pilots may not be necessary as current evaluations are sufficient for assessing their mental health. Proponents of arming pilots believe that the existing scrutiny and background checks are adequate for the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. The Arming Pilots Against Terrorism Act gives preference to former military or law enforcement personnel in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program. Implementation issues include background checks for non-U.S. citizen pilots volunteering for the program. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program may require additional background checks and waiting periods for foreign pilots, despite their extensive experience with U.S. air carriers. The TSA currently mandates extra screening, including psychological evaluations, for program applicants. The Airline Pilots Security Alliance criticizes these requirements as redundant, while the TSA defends them as necessary for ensuring pilot fitness similar to federal law enforcement officers. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program requires background checks and screening for applicants to ensure fitness for carrying firearms. Approximately 6 percent of applicants are screened out before training, with reasons including not meeting qualifications, failing psychological screening, or having background check issues. Legislation addresses the selection of firearms and ammunition, as well as the risk of firearm discharge causing aircraft damage. The legislation for the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program specifies that analysis of firearm risks must be classified and not disclosed. The selection of firearms for pilots is crucial due to the unique environment of the flight deck. Opponents fear that stray bullets could damage aircraft systems and jeopardize flight safety. Captain Edward M. Davidson warned about the potential risks of firearm use on aircraft. Director of Flight Safety and Quality Assurance for Northwest Airlines warned about the dangers of bullets piercing flight deck windows, striking critical instruments, and damaging electronic navigation equipment. In the event of a cockpit decompression, the flight crew would need to use supplemental oxygen and follow checklist procedures. Mr. Ron Hinderberger from Boeing emphasized the risk of aircraft loss due to a stray round. Boeing Company stated that the risk of aircraft loss due to gunfire is very slight, as commercial airplanes are designed with sufficient strength to withstand bullet holes. The chosen weapon for the program was a Smith & Wesson .40-caliber pistol, but Heckler & Koch was awarded the contract to supply guns for the program. This decision was questioned by other bidders. Heckler & Koch was awarded the contract to supply up to 9,600 guns for the Federal Flight Deck Officer program, despite questions from other bidders and supporters of \"buy American\" principles. The company is building a manufacturing facility in Georgia to create about 200 U.S. manufacturing jobs. Further research and development may be needed for firearms and ammunition tailored to the unique needs of Federal Flight Deck officers. Factors to be examined include enhancing firearm effectiveness and mitigating risks of accidental discharges. The law allows for temporary suspension of the Federal Flight Deck Officer program if a firearm accidentally discharges due to training or procedural issues. Training for officers was to begin within three months of enactment, with the option for the Under Secretary to choose the training provider. TSA facilities, other federal agencies, or contractor facilities may be used for training. One advantage of using TSA facilities for pilot training is the potential for standardization and compliance with established guidelines. However, TSA facilities may struggle to accommodate a large number of pilots due to scheduling constraints. An alternative option is to use FBI training facilities for airline training. The FBI released a proposal for training airline pilots called the \"Cockpit Protection Program.\" The program removes training from TSA control, with oversight to maintain standards. Training may not include coordination between Federal flight deck officers and air marshals. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is also considered for training. The FBI proposed the \"Cockpit Protection Program\" for training airline pilots in locations like Glynco, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; and Artesia, New Mexico. These facilities may lack TSA oversight and coordination with Federal air marshals. Contractor facilities could be used for training, but oversight challenges exist. Contract training could reduce capital investment for facilities and personnel. The FBI proposed the \"Cockpit Protection Program\" for training airline pilots at facilities in Glynco, Georgia and Artesia, New Mexico. The program faced challenges with limited facilities and inconvenience for pilots due to the remote location of the Artesia facility. The training for Federal flight deck officers may involve a mix of federal and private sector facilities, with initial training likely to be conducted at federal facilities for evaluation purposes. The Act specifies that training will include proficiency with firearms. The training for Federal flight deck officers includes proficiency with firearms comparable to Federal air marshals, ensuring exclusive control over the firearm, defensive maneuvers, and decision-making on firearm use. Training standards are based on Federal air marshal training, with a 10-week program starting with basic marksmanship. The training for Federal flight deck officers includes progressive training starting with basic marksmanship, followed by reactive firearms training scenarios, advanced firearms techniques specific to the aircraft cabin environment, and scenario-based exercises using wide-body and narrow-body aircraft mockups. Pilot groups have suggested a 48-hour training program derived from details released in December 2001 regarding the FBI Cockpit Protection Program. The current TSA program consists of a 48-hour curriculum of classroom instruction, firearms training, and tactical drills, with re-qualification required at intervals specified by the Under Secretary. Flight deck officers must re-qualify at intervals set by the Under Secretary, with a balance needed to maintain qualification standards without overburdening resources or schedules. The effectiveness of training under the FBI Cockpit Protection Program is challenging to evaluate, as there are no specified criteria for assessing deterrence of terrorism and criminal acts against the flight deck. The effectiveness of the Federal flight deck program in enhancing aviation security can be difficult to assess directly. However, certain elements such as training effectiveness and risk management can be evaluated through performance evaluations and incident data analysis. Storage and transportation of firearms are also important considerations. The legislation addresses the storage and transportation of firearms for Federal flight deck officers, particularly focusing on international flights and overnight stays away from the pilot's base airport. Pilot groups advocate for officers to retain their firearms at their home base and receive training to maintain proficiency. Opponents argue that carrying weapons could make pilots targets for terrorists and criminals. The TSA recommended the use of lock boxes for transporting firearms for Federal flight deck officers to minimize the risk of mishandling and accidental discharges. Pilot groups are concerned that this undermines the legislation's intent for officers to maintain exclusive control over their firearms. The TSA's decision is based on the mission outlined in the legislation, allowing pilots to use their weapons only in defense of the flight deck. The Airline Pilots' Security Alliance (APSA) is worried about the use of lock boxes. The Airline Pilots' Security Alliance (APSA) is concerned that using lock boxes to transport firearms may make pilots vulnerable to theft and provide no means for personal security. Concealment of firearms is not addressed in legislation but was a significant consideration in establishing procedural requirements. Concealing firearms could prevent Federal flight deck officers from becoming targets for theft or seizure. Carrying concealed weapons by Federal flight deck officers may complicate security screening and law enforcement efforts. Pilot groups are concerned about backup firearms and the current practice of only issuing one weapon in a secured lock box. Airport security screening is a key issue. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated a uniform system of identification for Federal flight deck officers to carry firearms on aircraft, ensuring security personnel can verify their authorization and prevent forgery or misuse of identification. The TSA is researching technologies for a standardized Transportation Worker Identification Card and biometric identification for Federal flight deck officers. The specific procedures for verifying their credentials are considered security sensitive information. Screening and identification checking of Federal flight deck officers is a topic of discussion, especially if concealing their identity is desired for security reasons. Security screening of Federal flight deck officers and other flight crew in open public spaces may compromise the program's effectiveness by making them targets for firearm seizure. Screening pilots in public view could also reveal security procedures for validating their identity. Alternative screening arrangements may be impractical, especially at smaller airports where employee and passenger screening are combined. The legislation also addresses the placement of firearms during flight operations. The legislation addresses the placement of a Federal flight deck officer's firearm during flight operations. A holstered weapon may pose safety hazards and accessibility issues, leading to potential aircraft modifications for securing firearms on the flight deck. Simple designs may be easily approved, while more elaborate designs may require detailed testing and evaluation for FAA certification. The legislation addresses challenges in standardizing firearm positioning on transport category aircraft due to differences in flight deck layouts. Coordination between Federal flight deck officers and air marshals is crucial, including methods for identifying authorized personnel while maintaining their anonymity. The legislation aims to enhance procedures for identifying armed law enforcement officers on flights and clarifies the division of responsibility between pilots in case of criminal violence or air piracy. Questions arise about training materials for non-participating flight and cabin crew members. Flight crews and cabin crews have limited information about the program for Federal flight deck officers. Airlines do not address the division of responsibility when a pilot must act as a Federal flight deck officer, and there is no requirement for training non-participating crew members. Details of the program are not widely released due to security concerns, leaving it up to individual Federal flight deck officers to brief non-participating crew members on coordination of duties. The legislation specifies procedures for ensuring that the firearm of a Federal flight deck officer does not leave the cockpit during disturbances in the passenger cabin. Federal flight deck officers are instructed to use their weapons and training only in defense of the flight deck, not to intervene in cabin disturbances. Coordination among deputized Federal flight deck officers is smoother due to standardized training. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act specifies that Federal flight deck officers should only use their weapons and training to defend the flight deck, not intervene in cabin disturbances. Procedures for opening the cockpit door and leaving the cockpit are still being developed. The legislation specifies procedures for ensuring that the firearm of a Federal flight deck officer does not leave the cockpit if the pilot leaves for personal reasons. Reasons for leaving the cockpit during flight include crew meal service, crew changes, lavatory use, and emergency situations. Physical separation between the officer and their firearm may occur in these situations. The Federal Government is responsible for providing training, supervision, and equipment for Federal flight deck officers at no cost to the pilot or air carrier. This includes initial and recurrent training, as well as issuing firearms and ammunition needed for the program. The Federal Government will incur expenses for firearms, ammunition, equipment, and facilities for the program. Additional costs may include background checks for pilot fitness. Total costs will depend on the number of qualifying pilots and training rates. Congressional Budget Office estimates were based on limiting participation to 2% of pilots, costing about $8,000 per pilot annually. The TSA budgeted $500,000 for the prototype program, with costs of $10,400 per pilot for training and equipment. Funding from FY2003 and FY2004 totaled $33 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer program, allowing for over 2,000 pilots to be deputized by the end of FY 2004. Weekly initial training classes are currently being conducted by TSA. Currently, TSA is conducting weekly initial training classes for pilots participating in the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Pilots are not compensated by the Federal Government for training, and air carriers are not obligated to compensate them either. Indirect costs such as travel and lodging may vary depending on the air carrier. Indirect costs of training, like travel and lodging, may be paid by individual pilots or air carriers. Airlines are unlikely to compensate pilots for these costs due to economic difficulties and opposition to the program. In the current economic environment, pilots may have to cover training costs themselves, including potential tax deductions for out-of-pocket expenses. Uncertainty remains regarding who will pay for cockpit modifications needed for firearm storage. Air carriers may face indirect costs if aircraft need to be taken out of service for modifications. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program does not require cockpit modifications. Initially limited to volunteer pilots of passenger air carriers, there are calls to expand it to include other pilots and flight crew members. Proponents argue for arming pilots to enhance security measures. The Federal Flight Deck Officer Program was initially limited to volunteer pilots of passenger air carriers. However, a provision in the FAA reauthorization legislation expanded the program to include all flight crew members of both passenger and all-cargo air carrier aircraft. Proponents argue that arming cargo pilots is necessary for security, as they are currently vulnerable due to lack of security measures in air cargo operations. Cargo flight crews are vulnerable to terrorist threats as they lack security measures. All responsibility for aircraft security falls on the pilots. Captain David Webb of Air Line Pilot Association's FedEx unit advocates for allowing cargo air carrier pilots to participate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program for enhanced security. Cargo flight crews lack security measures, making them vulnerable to terrorist threats. Captain David Webb advocates for allowing cargo air carrier pilots to participate in the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program for enhanced security. Some argue that enhanced ground-based security measures and improved screening of authorized employees would make deputizing cargo pilots as Federal flight deck officers unnecessary. Consequently, a separate program with separate standards, training, and guidelines was considered more suitable for implementation in the air cargo industry. Other pilots, such as on-demand air charter pilots and pilots flying for fractional-ownership programs, may also seek participation in the program. Proponents argue that arming these pilots may provide security in operations where access control is difficult. Opponents argue that including these pilots in the program would significantly increase costs. Including these pilots in the Federal flight deck officer program could raise costs and increase the presence of firearms in aviation, potentially compromising other security measures. There have been no legislative efforts to incorporate these pilots into the program."
