    "content": "Title III of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended by inserting a new section 306C regarding prepayment or repricing of loans. The Rural Electrification Act of 1936 is amended to allow borrowers to request prepayment or repricing of loans made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administrator, under specific terms outlined in the loan contract. Borrowers can prepay or reprice the loan before maturity, subject to certain conditions. Borrowers of loans under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 can prepay advances by paying the outstanding principal balance, 1-year interest prepayment premium, and the difference in income at different interest rates until the end of the loan period. Borrowers under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 can reprice their loans by paying the net present value of the 1-year interest prepayment premium and the difference in income at different interest rates until the end of the loan period. The Administrator allows borrowers to prepay advances on loans and apply for a private lender loan not exceeding the prepaid amount plus any premium. A lien accommodation is granted if the borrower's assets exceed 120% of all outstanding loans secured under the lien. The Administrator allows borrowers to prepay loans and apply for private lender loans without prepayment penalties. A hardship prepayment program is available for borrowers of loans guaranteed by the Federal Financing Bank. The Administrator allows borrowers to prepay loans without penalties if they have experienced severe hardship or serve in rural, low-income, high unemployment areas with high electricity rates. Upon prepayment, a new loan at least equal to the principal amount can be obtained from the Federal Financing Bank. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the waiver of prepayment premiums for loans made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Administrator."
