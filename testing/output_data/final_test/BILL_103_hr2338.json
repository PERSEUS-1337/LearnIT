    "content": "The \"Aviation Revitalization Act of 1993\" is declared as the short title of the Act. The policy declaration is outlined in Section 2. Congress declares the severe financial distress of the US commercial airline industry, leading to cancellations of new aircraft orders and threatening the aerospace manufacturing industry. Many carriers struggle to obtain financing for new equipment, risking the phaseout of noisier aircraft. A Federal loan guarantee program is proposed to support the financing of new aircraft. A Federal loan guarantee program is established to finance new aircraft and components while phasing out older, less fuel-efficient, and noisier aircraft. SEC. 3. Authorization to guarantee financing of new aircraft under Title XI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The Secretary is authorized to guarantee loans for new aircraft or components for air carriers meeting specified conditions and agreeing to pay subsidy fees. Guarantees can be made for loans to carriers using the aircraft or to persons leasing them to carriers. Loan guarantees must result in the delivery of new aircraft. The loan guarantee must lead to the delivery of new aircraft or components to an air carrier certificated under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, by December 31, 1999. It must finance the acquisition of new aircraft or components complying with Stage 3 noise standards, purchased from companies with audited financial disclosure and domiciled in compliant countries. The loan guarantee requires the delivery of new aircraft to an air carrier by December 31, 1999, meeting Stage 3 noise standards and purchased from financially audited companies in compliant countries. The air carrier must agree to remove aging or Stage 2 aircraft from service after April 1, 1993. The air carrier must remove aging or Stage 2 aircraft from service if financed under specific regulations by December 31, 1999. This removal is based on the maximum certified capacity of the new aircraft being financed. The air carrier may carry forward excess seat or cargo capacity as a credit for other aircraft removed from service to comply with regulations. All-cargo aircraft can be modified to meet noise standards instead of being removed from service. The air carrier must keep aircraft configured for all-cargo service and cannot convert them to passenger-cargo combination service. Any aircraft removed from service cannot be registered in the United States, except under specific circumstances outlined by the Secretary. The Secretary may allow aircraft owned by non-affiliated persons to remain on the registry if brought into compliance with noise standards before lease or sale. Air carriers receiving new aircraft financed under this section must warrant not using aging or Stage 2 aircraft after specific dates. The Secretary may not grant a waiver to air carriers using new aircraft financed under this section to operate Stage 2 aircraft after December 31, 1999. 75% of new aircraft financed under this section must be manufactured in the United States. Violation of the warranty on not using aging or Stage 2 aircraft constitutes a revocation of loan guarantees. The Secretary must enforce fiduciary duties when making loan guarantees under this section, applying prudent standards and taking necessary actions to protect the United States' rights. Loan guarantees will be provided based on rates, terms, and conditions determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may require reasonable assurance of repayment for guaranteed loans, secure loans with collateral, and limit the guaranteed loan amount to 85% of the manufacturer's price. If collateral is required, it will be deemed subject to a purchase-money equipment security interest. The Secretary may authorize a security interest in collateral for loans financing new aircraft or components. A subsidy fee must be paid for the loan guarantee to remain in effect. The Secretary assesses a subsidy fee for each loan guarantee, equal to the guarantee's cost. An annual report is submitted to Congress detailing the loan guarantee program's progress, any issues, and the recipients of the guarantees. In this section, definitions for \"aging aircraft,\" \"new aircraft,\" and \"new aircraft components\" are provided. Aging aircraft are planes in service for over twenty-two years, new aircraft are newly manufactured planes not previously registered, and new aircraft components are parts that can be financed separately. The curr_chunk discusses the approval of Stage 3 hush kits for jet engines and avionics systems. It defines the term \"remove from service\" and \"Secretary\" in relation to aircraft regulations. Additionally, it explains the term \"Stage 2 aircraft\" as defined by a specific section of title. The curr_chunk defines \"Stage 3 aircraft\" as airplanes meeting specific regulations outlined in title 14, Code of Federal Regulations."
