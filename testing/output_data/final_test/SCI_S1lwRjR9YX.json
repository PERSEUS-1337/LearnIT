    "content": "In this work, the authors use algorithmic stability to provide an upper-bound on the generalization error for momentum-based methods in machine learning. The bound decays with the training set size and increases with the momentum parameter. They also develop an upper-bound on the expected true risk based on training steps, training set size, and momentum parameter. This addresses the fundamental issue of generalization in machine learning algorithms. The notion of uniform stability is used to analyze the generalization error of the stochastic gradient method (SGM) in machine learning. The SGM method is scalable, robust, and widely adopted in various problems. Adding a momentum term in the iterative update of the stochastic gradient helps accelerate convergence. The heavy-ball momentum method, introduced by Polyak, involves adding a weighted version of the previous update to the current gradient update. The heavy-ball momentum method, introduced by Polyak, involves adding a weighted version of the previous update to the current gradient update. Momentum methods accelerate convergence by avoiding sharp curvatures and long ravines in the objective function. Nesterov's accelerated gradient method converges as O(1/k^2), but does not improve the rate of convergence for stochastic gradient. This work focuses on the heavy-ball momentum method. In this work, the focus is on the heavy-ball momentum method in stochastic gradient methods. A bound on the generalization error of SGMM for strongly convex loss functions is derived, independent of training iterations and decreasing with the training set size. An upper-bound on the optimization error is developed, showing the gap between empirical risk and global optimum can be minimized with more iterations and a smaller learning rate. Additionally, an upper-bound on the expected true risk of SGMM is established based on problem parameters. Convex loss functions are important in machine learning, including linear and logistic regression with weight decay regularization. Previous works have focused on convergence analysis of first-order methods with momentum in deterministic settings. Few works have analyzed the stochastic setting. This study focuses on the convergence of SGMM for smooth and strongly convex loss functions, which is a new approach. The comparison with previous works is challenging due to different assumptions about loss function properties. In this work, the focus is on the generalization and true risk of SGMM for strongly convex loss functions. Unlike previous work, stability bounds are obtained for multiple epochs of SGMM with bounded generalization errors. The study considers a general supervised learning problem with samples drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The learning model aims to minimize the true risk by using empirical risk due to the unknown distribution. An upper bound on true risk is sought through generalization error and uniform stability. Uniform stability implies generalization in expectation. Theorem 1 states that if an algorithm is s-uniformly stable, then its generalization error is upper-bounded by s. The loss function is assumed to be L-Lipschitz and strongly convex on a compact parameter space \u2126. The SGMM update rule involves projection onto \u2126, with parameters such as learning rate \u03b1 and momentum \u00b5. The update is iteratively run for T steps in SGMM. The SGMM update is executed iteratively for T steps with two typical approaches for selecting examples. The generalization error for SGMM is the key quantity of interest, assuming a \u03b2-smooth, L-Lipschitz, and \u03b3-strongly convex loss function. The stability bound decreases inversely with the training set size and increases with the learning rate and momentum parameters. The stability bound decreases inversely with the training set size and increases with the momentum parameter \u00b5. Theorem 3 provides a convergence bound for the SGMM update executed for T steps with constant learning rate \u03b1 and momentum \u00b5. The optimization error is bounded by the difference between the empirical risk achieved by SGMM and the global minimum. The convergence is improved by the terms with negative sign due to strongly convexity, while the last term depends on the learning rate, momentum parameter, and Lipschitz constant. Proposition 1 provides a bound on the expected true risk of SGMM in terms of the global minimum of the empirical risk. The bound is obtained by combining Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 and minimizing the expression over \u03b1. The choice of \u03b1 simplifies considerably when \u00b5 is sufficiently small. The proof of this result is provided in the supplementary material. The analysis of SGMM involves tracking the divergence of iterative sequences with momentum terms. Two samples of size n are considered, with updates based on SGMM outputs. The analysis establishes a bound on the iterative expressions. The analysis of SGMM involves tracking iterative sequences with momentum terms. An upper-bound on the divergence of the sequences is established, considering updates based on SGMM outputs. The stability bound in Theorem 2 holds for the projected SGMM update. The stability bound in Theorem 2 holds for the projected SGMM update. The proof is inspired by convergence analysis in previous works, analyzing SGMM for a smooth and strongly convex loss function with a constant learning rate. The parameter recursion is defined to facilitate the convergence analysis. The recursion for projected SGMM update is analyzed by taking expectations and applying convexity properties. The convergence bound is extended to projected SGMM, with a proof provided. The projected SGMM update is analyzed by taking expectations and applying convexity properties. The convergence bound is extended to projected SGMM, showing how adding momentum affects convergence and generalization. Experimental evaluation on the notMINIST dataset validates the theoretical results. The study evaluates a regression model with weight decay regularization using SGMM for binary classification on the two-class notMNIST dataset containing images from letter classes \"C\" and \"J\". The learning rate is set to \u03b1 = 0.01, weight decay coefficient to 0.001, and minibatch size to 10. Comparison is made between SGMM with momentum values \u00b5 = 0, 0.5, and 0.9. Generalization error and training error are analyzed with respect to the number of training samples. The generalization error decreases as the number of training samples increases for all values of \u00b5, but increases with \u00b5 for large n. Training error increases with n, but adding momentum reduces it and improves convergence rate. Training accuracy also improves with momentum. The optimization error of SGMM is studied by comparing training and test error versus number of epochs for n = 500 samples. The training error decreases with the number of epochs for all values of \u00b5, and adding momentum improves accuracy. However, the benefit of momentum on test error diminishes as epochs increase due to higher generalization error. SGMM is analyzed for strongly convex loss functions, with an upper-bound on generalization error decreasing with training set size but increasing with momentum parameter. The training error decreases with the number of epochs for all values of \u00b5, and adding momentum improves accuracy. Momentum's benefit on test error diminishes as epochs increase due to higher generalization error. SGMM is analyzed for strongly convex loss functions, with an upper-bound on generalization error decreasing with training set size but increasing with momentum parameter. The convergence of SGMM during training is analyzed, establishing an upper-bound on the gap between empirical risk and the global minimum. An upper-bound on the expected difference between true risk and global minimum of empirical risk is also established, scaling with training steps and training set size. The numerical plots align with theoretical bounds on generalization error and convergence gap."
