    "content": "The Act titled \"Satellite Exports With Security Act of 2000\" imposes export controls on satellites and related items. Control of satellites and related items on the Commerce Control List of dual-use items in the Export Administration Regulations on October 16, 1998, and any dual-use communications satellites shall be governed by the Export Administration Act of 1979. Export of satellites intended for launch from China is subject to specific procedures. When exporting satellites intended for launch from China, the Secretary of Defense must approve or disapprove the export within 20 days. If there is a disagreement between the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Defense, the matter may be referred to the President for resolution. If the Secretary of Defense fails to notify the Secretary of Commerce within the 20-day period, the Secretary of Commerce can proceed with the export decision independently. The President must decide on proposed exports within 20 days if there is a disagreement between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce will then approve or disapprove the export based on the President's decision. If the technology in the proposed export is the same as a prior approved export to the same end user, the export can proceed with notification to the Secretary of Commerce at least 15 days in advance. The term \"related items\" includes various satellite components as defined in a report to Congress. Certain sections of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act are repealed or amended. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 is amended to change the responsible department from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of Commerce. Additionally, certain sections of the Act are repealed or amended to specify the Secretary of Defense as the appropriate authority. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 is amended to transfer responsibility from the Secretary of State to the Secretary of Commerce. Section 1309, Office of Defense Trade Controls, is revised, and monitoring of launches is addressed in Section 3. Section 1514(a)(2) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 is amended to include monitoring of launches, specifying actions in case of failure. Effective date of the amendments is also addressed. The Act and its amendments will take effect on the date of enactment, applying to pending export license applications under the Arms Export Control Act. Any pending applications will be transferred to the Department of Commerce upon enactment."
