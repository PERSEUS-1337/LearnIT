    "content": "Congress passed a $15.35 billion Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2002, resolving disagreements over international family planning and abortion issues. The bill signed by President Bush on January 10, 2002, dropped Senate language on abortion restrictions but allocated funds for family planning programs. The White House placed a hold on $34 million for the UN Population Fund pending a review of its program in China. The $15.35 billion Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY2002 was approved by Congress, with funding levels higher than the President's request. Highlights include increased funding for the Export-Import Bank, HIV/AIDS, and a cut in funding for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative. The bill also allows the President to waive restrictions on aid to Azerbaijan until December 31, 2002. Azerbaijan, along with other regional states, supports the war against terrorism. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill provides Armenia with $90 million in economic aid and $4.3 million in military assistance. This legislation is crucial for Congress to review and vote on the U.S. foreign assistance budget, funding various development programs managed by agencies like USAID. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds aid activities, including disaster relief and refugee support, managed by USAID and the State Department. It also includes security assistance for Israel and Egypt, contributions to the World Bank, and appropriations for export promotion agencies. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds aid activities, including disaster relief and refugee support, managed by USAID and the State Department. It also includes security assistance for Israel and Egypt, contributions to the World Bank, and appropriations for export promotion agencies like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-Import Bank, and the Trade and Development Agency. Congress has not enacted a foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leading to Foreign Operations spending measures playing a significant role in shaping both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. The United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War, leading to clashes between Congress and the Administration over foreign assistance management. President Bush submitted the FY2002 federal budget request, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs. The House passed H.R. 2506 after hearings and amendments. The House passed H.R. 2506 on July 24 after adopting several amendments. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 on October 24, including amendments addressing anti-terrorism issues. Conferees met on November 14 to resolve differences, finalizing on December 19 with a conference report. President Bush signed the legislation on January 10, 2002 (P.L. 107-115). The Senate also included $100 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria in a previous bill. The conferees approved an additional $100 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, offsetting resources with $20 million rescissions in prior year appropriations. The Administration requested $200 million, with $100 million drawn from Foreign Operations spending for FY2002. Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated over the past 25 years due to technical budget accounting changes. Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated over the past 25 years due to changes in budget accounting, including the scoring of export credit programs as appropriations. This has made it challenging to present a consistent trend line in funding levels. Despite this, data shows a peak of nearly $33 billion in FY1985, followed by a decline to $13.6 billion. Foreign Operations appropriations experienced a decline from $33 billion in FY1985 to $13.6 billion in FY1997, with brief periods of higher amounts in the early 1990s due to special supplementals. Funding levels for FY2001 and FY2002 were $15.4 billion and $15.35 billion, respectively. The enacted Foreign Operations funding levels for recent years have been presented in nominal terms, showing a 2.7% increase over FY2001. Foreign Operations represented 0.79% of the entire $1.9 trillion U.S. budget for FY2001 and consumed 2.3% of discretionary budget authority. In FY1985, foreign aid funds represented 2% of the total U.S. budget and 4.6% of discretionary budget authority. Usually, Appropriation Committees begin markups of their spending bills after Congress adopts a budget resolution. Funds are distributed to Appropriations panels through the Section 302(a) allocation process. House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide how to allocate funds among their subcommittees within budget guidelines. Foreign Operations funds fall under the International Affairs budget function, with decisions on allocation and distribution left to the Appropriations Committees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees set overall budget ceilings that impact the budget limitations for the Foreign Operations subcommittees. In FY2002, the House supported $23.9 billion in discretionary budget authority, while the Senate increased it to $24.2 billion with additional funding for international HIV/AIDS and climate change programs. The conference agreement on the budget resolution was passed by both Houses. The conference agreement on H.Con.Res. 83 modified the approach taken by House and Senate-approved resolutions for discretionary budget authority, setting it at the CBO baseline estimate. The International Affairs discretionary budget for FY2002 in H.Con.Res. 83 was $23.2 billion, $700 million below the President's request. Conferees noted that the figures included in the budget do not reflect any specific policy orientation. House and Senate Appropriations Committees are responsible for allocating the total discretionary budget. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees were tasked with allocating discretionary budget authority to subcommittees to address specific policy priorities. The initial allocations for FY2002 were $15.168 billion from the House and $15.524 billion from the Senate for Foreign Operations, with the Senate exceeding the President's request. This marked a departure from previous years where allocations were initially set below the budget recommendation. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees initially allocated funds for FY2002, exceeding the President's request for Foreign Operations. Following the September 11 attacks, an additional $25 billion was added to the budget ceiling, pushing it up to $686 billion. The budget ceiling was increased by $25 billion to $686 billion to accommodate rising spending needs. Foreign Operations received $15.35 billion, with an additional $200 million added for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. President Bush requested $15.167 billion for FY2002 Foreign Operations. The FY2002 Foreign Operations request is $15.167 billion, a 1.5% increase from FY2001. State Department and other non-foreign aid activities would see a 13.2% increase in funding. Some activities funded in FY2001 won't need new appropriations in FY2002, freeing up funds for other initiatives. This includes one-time funding for southern Africa flood relief and compensation to China for the embassy bombing. The FY2002 Foreign Operations request sees a 1.5% increase from FY2001, with a focus on increasing funding for disaster aid, international narcotics control, and the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. Israel and Egypt will experience a net reduction of $100 million in aid. The FY2002 budget includes $200 million for the Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, with $100 million each from Foreign Operations and Health and Human Services budgets. Contributions to international financial institutions would increase by 6% to $1.2 billion, but no funds are allocated for the $500 million arrears owed by the United States. Additionally, Export-Import Bank funds would decrease by 24.5% to $687 million, and debt reduction resources for the HIPC initiative would be cut in half to $224 million. Resources for the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative would be reduced by half to $224 million, enough to fully fund the U.S. contribution. Adjustments were made to foreign operations appropriations for FY2000, FY2001, and FY2002, including supplemental spending and Middle East peace support. The FY2002 budget includes $1.225 billion for Wye River Middle East peace support and $40 billion for emergency relief and counter-terrorism. Leading recipients of U.S. foreign aid include Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians. Additional funding was allocated for counterterrorism purposes after the September 11 attacks. The FY2002 budget requested few changes in top U.S. foreign aid recipients, with Israel, Egypt, and Jordan remaining leading recipients. Assistance for Latin American drug producing nations saw a significant increase due to the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, the allocation of foreign aid funds shifted, with the Administration using economic and military assistance to maintain international coalition efforts in the war on terrorism. Pakistan, previously ineligible for aid due to sanctions, received $100 million in late September and October after President Bush lifted nuclear sanctions. The US provided $600 million in economic aid to Pakistan as part of a $1 billion aid package announced by President Bush. Additional aid was allocated to other coalition partners, including Uzbekistan, Turkey, and Central Asian states. Aid planned for India also increased from $67 million to $78 million. The House passed H.R. 2506 with $15.167 billion for Foreign Operations, allocating $78 million for India. The legislation restored half of the proposed cut for the Export-Import Bank, reduced Andean Regional Initiative by $56 million, and increased development aid by $155 million. It included $100 million for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, totaling $487 million for combating HIV/AIDS. Funding for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan remained unchanged, while Palestinian assistance was conditioned on renouncing terrorism. The House passed H.R. 2506 with $15.167 billion for Foreign Operations, allocating $78 million for India. The legislation included $100 million in earthquake relief for El Salvador, with funding drawn from various accounts. The bill assumed full funding for population aid and the U.N. Population Fund, while reducing economic aid to non-Camp David countries and the former Soviet Union. President Bush's abortion restrictions on international family planning programs were upheld. The House adopted amendments to the Foreign Operations bill, with changes in funding amounts but maintaining the overall total of $15.167 billion. Key amendments included earmarking $5 million for preventing mother-to-child HIV/AIDS transmission, adding $5 million for vulnerable children and $13 million for HIV/AIDS, and adding $20 million for tuberculosis funding. The Committee-reported bill allocates $70 million, with reductions to Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and Asian Development Fund. Amendments include adding $1 million for South Asia disaster relief and $30 million for Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Limits are set for personnel in Andean Counternarcotics Initiative. $65 million is withheld pending a report on a Peruvian Air Force incident. Three amendments were rejected. The House rejected three amendments related to health funding and Andean Counternarcotics Initiative appropriations. One proposed amendment to increase global health trust fund by $60 million failed. Another to increase child health and tuberculosis programs by $50 million each lost. A final amendment to cut funding for the Export-Import Bank also failed. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a $15.524 billion Foreign Operations measure, higher than the House bill and President's request. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 on October 24, with amendments increasing funding for HIV/AIDS and other health programs, debt relief for Yugoslavia, and contributions to the U.N. Population Fund. This resulted in reductions for the Export-Import Bank, aid to former Soviet states, anti-drug assistance, and contributions to the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. Key highlights included restored funding for the Export-Import Bank, increased funding for child survival and development assistance, and additional funding for HIV/AIDS. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 with amendments increasing funding for various programs, including $485 million for disaster aid and up to $90 million for the Global Fund to combat AIDS, TB, and malaria. Country earmarks were set for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia. The Andean Counternarcotics Initiative was reduced to $547 million, with $151 million allocated for alternative development. Population aid was increased to $450 million. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 with amendments increasing funding for various programs, including disaster aid and the Global Fund to combat AIDS, TB, and malaria. Country earmarks were set for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia. Population aid was increased to $450 million, and language was included to overturn abortion restrictions on U.S. grants to foreign NGOs implementing family planning activities. Counter-terrorism funding was provided for Anti-Terrorism Assistance and Terrorist Interdiction. Amendments were debated post-September 11 attacks, including efforts to set aside prohibitions on U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan under section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. The Senate passed H.R. 2506 with amendments increasing funding for various programs, including disaster aid and the Global Fund to combat AIDS, TB, and malaria. Country earmarks were set for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia. Population aid was increased to $450 million, and language was included to overturn abortion restrictions on U.S. grants to foreign NGOs implementing family planning activities. Counter-terrorism funding was provided for Anti-Terrorism Assistance and Terrorist Interdiction. The Senate also addressed the issue of U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan under section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, allowing the President to waive the ban until December 31, 2002, for counter-terrorism purposes. The Senate adopted an amendment by Senator McConnell earmarking $4.6 million in military aid and training to Armenia, despite the Administration not requesting military assistance for Armenia. The $15.35 billion appropriation in H.R. 2506 was approved by Congress, falling between the House and Senate's proposed levels and $178 million higher than the President's request. This marks one of the few occasions when Congress approved more spending for Foreign Operations. Congress approved $15.35 billion in foreign operations spending, exceeding the President's request. The amount is about $400 million higher than FY2001, with key changes including funding for family planning programs and the Export-Import Bank. The foreign operations spending bill approved by Congress for FY2002 includes $2.6 billion for development assistance, $475 million for HIV/AIDS, and $625 million for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative. Additionally, the bill provides $100 million for the Global HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis Health Fund, with $60 million drawn from non-HIV/AIDS resources. The President is allowed to waive restrictions on aid to Azerbaijan until December 31, 2002, and Armenia receives $90 million in economic aid and $4.3 million in military assistance. The Foreign Operations appropriations measure addresses terrorism issues by providing funds for international counter-terrorism programs, enhancing physical security at USAID missions, assisting victims of terrorist acts with weapons of mass destruction, and restricting aid to countries involved in terrorism. Following the September 11 attacks, an additional $1.188 billion was allocated for programs countering terrorism, aiding refugees from the war in Afghanistan, and supporting countries in the international coalition against terrorist groups. The State Department's Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program aims to enhance the anti-terrorism capabilities of foreign law enforcement and security officials through training, equipment transfers, and advice. Over 23,000 officials from 112 countries participated in ATA programs between 1984 and 1999. The program focuses on the Middle East but also includes training in Colombia, Ecuador, and former Soviet states to address terrorist threats to energy sector targets. In FY1999, a new element was added to counter the use of terrorism. The ATA program, aimed at countering terrorism, added a new element in FY1999 to address weapons of mass destruction (WMD) threats. Funding more than doubled after the 1998 embassy bombings, reaching $41 million. The Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) was launched to enhance border security and prevent terrorist activities. TIP strengthens border security in vulnerable countries by installing monitoring technology and training officials. The State Department identified 34 possible TIP recipients, with programs planned for five countries in FY2001 and FY2002. The Administration requested $4 million for TIP in FY2002, part of the NADR account. USAID maintains 97 overseas facilities in high-threat areas, especially since the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. In response to security concerns following bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, USAID has faced delays in constructing facilities at co-located sites with U.S. embassies. The State Department's budget includes $50 million for this purpose in FY2001 and FY2002, but the funds have not been released. Security upgrades for overseas missions are funded through USAID operating expenses, which have been strained due to relocation costs, financial system replacements, and dwindling trust funds. The total USAID operating expense appropriation for FY2001 was $533 million, with $549 million approved for FY2002. Funding for USAID physical security requirements peaked in FY2000 at $22.6 million, falling to $12.5 million in FY2001 and further declining to $10.6 million in FY2002. USAID needs over $140 million to bring its overseas facilities up to government security standards. Approximately 90% of USAID overseas staff work outside American embassy compounds. The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) provides emergency relief to victims of natural disasters, conflicts, and terrorist attacks, including those involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The FY2001 budget was $165 million, with $0.8 million allocated for terrorism-related purposes. The FY2002 budget is $235.5 million, with $1 million designated for defending against WMD incidents by terrorists. Aid restrictions are in place for terrorist states, with provisions prohibiting U.S. assistance to countries supporting terrorism. The President may waive restrictions on U.S. aid to governments supporting international terrorism for national security or humanitarian reasons. Sec. 544 prohibits aid to governments providing lethal military equipment to terrorist-led countries, but certain humanitarian assistance can still be provided. This includes disaster relief, child survival programs, HIV/AIDS initiatives, emergency food and medicine, and demining operations. Additional aid, debt relief, and sanctions relaxation may also be considered for eligible countries. The United States is considering providing additional aid, debt relief, and sanctions relaxation to countries supporting its counter-terrorism efforts. Pakistan, a key ally, has requested financial aid and debt cancellation to strengthen its economy. Pakistan owes the U.S. around $3 billion and was set to receive $7 million in economic aid for democracy promotion and education programs in FY2002. However, it was barred from receiving non-humanitarian bilateral foreign aid. The President used special authority to provide $100 million in economic assistance to Pakistan, but legislative authority was needed for more aid due to restrictions. A $1 billion aid package for Pakistan was announced, including debt relief, IMF loans, and trade assistance. $600 million in direct U.S. economic aid has been allocated out of the total package. The Administration has allocated $91 million in economic and military support for Uzbekistan, Turkey, and other Central Asian states from the $40 billion Anti-Terrorism Emergency Supplemental Appropriations. Congress approved an additional $50 million for humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Afghanistan. Prior to the September 11 attacks, Congress fully supported the President's Anti-Terrorism Assistance and Terrorist Interdiction Program requests. House and Senate bills provided the requested total for USAID operating expenses. The enacted text of H.R. 2506 includes provisions for aid restrictions on countries supporting terrorism and earmarks $15 million for programs promoting democracy and human rights in Muslim-majority countries. Several terrorism-related amendments added by the Senate were dropped from the bill in favor of addressing the issues in the conference report. The conference report includes details on U.S. military aid to Uzbekistan, humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, the role of Afghan women in reconstruction, and a Peace Corps study on increasing volunteers in Muslim-populated countries. President Bush allocated funds for foreign aid programs from the $40 billion terrorism supplemental appropriation. Additional spending for Foreign Operations programs came from the first $20 billion portion under the President's control. President Bush allocated $1.1 billion for Foreign Operations activities, including aid for Afghan refugees, economic assistance to Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Central Asia, as well as military aid to Turkey and Uzbekistan. This funding also covered emergency communications, security upgrades, and Peace Corps volunteer evacuations. The $1.1 billion allocated by President Bush for Foreign Operations included $45 million in aid to Turkey and Uzbekistan, $108 million for counter-terrorism training in Afghanistan, $3 million for combating terrorist financing, and a proposed $50 million transfer for USAID facilities in Kenya and Uganda. Congress did not approve the transfer but added $50 million for humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan. The Export-Import Bank, with a budget of nearly $1 billion, finances around 2% of U.S. exports annually. The Export-Import Bank, with a budget of nearly $1 billion, provides guarantees and insurance to commercial banks to make trade credits available to U.S. exporters. It also offers direct financing to U.S. exporters on a limited basis to counter subsidized trade credits offered to foreign exporters. Government-sponsored trade financing has been controversial, with economists doubting the long-term benefits of subsidizing exports. Subsidized export financing merely shifts production without improving a nation's welfare in the long run. The Export-Import Bank provides guarantees and insurance to commercial banks for trade credits to U.S. exporters. Subsidized export financing shifts production among sectors without adding to economic activity. It does not permanently raise employment levels but alters sector composition. The Bank aims to assist small businesses, but critics argue it aids the wealthiest firms. Eximbank's activities provide financing where the market may not. Eximbank's activities draw from financial resources within the economy, potentially crowding out some borrowers from financial markets. Supporters argue that the Bank is necessary for U.S. exporters to compete with foreign subsidized financing and pressure foreign governments to eliminate concessionary financing. Eximbank is required to provide competitive financing terms for U.S. exporters. The Bush Administration proposed a $223 million, or 25% cut in spending for the Export-Import Bank in FY2002. The proposed cut would limit the Bank's ability to meet demands from American exporters, focusing on businesses with no access to private financing and seeking to increase risk sharing with the private sector. Export coalitions opposed the funding cut. The House in H.R. 2506 provided $787 million for the Export-Import Bank, with the Appropriations Committee recommending $805 million. An amendment was adopted to reduce the appropriation level by $18 million, potentially cutting Eximbank loan guarantees by $275 million. Amendment proponents argued that the Export-Import Bank extended an $18 million loan guarantee package to a Chinese firm, which hurt American workers in the steel industry. Critics of the amendment argued that reducing Eximbank funding would impact other American exporters. The Senate bill initially provided $806 million in funding, but an amendment during Senate debate reduced it to $780 million. The debate on H.R. 2506 reduced the Export-Import Bank's funding level to $780 million, slightly below the House amount. The enacted bill provides $779 million, which is higher than the request. The appropriation would give the Bank an authorized operation level of $10.6 billion, about 15% higher than for FY2001. Legislation in the House and Senate would extend the Bank's authority through 2005 and 2006. The debate also focused on development aid policy priorities post-Cold War. Senator Helms and critics question the need for a globally focused economic aid program, suggesting a shift towards smaller, targeted, and privatized aid managed by NGOs. Helms proposes abolishing USAID and creating a foundation to issue aid grants to private groups. The Clinton Administration supported an activist foreign aid policy through USAID, focusing on sustainable development, economic growth, global population stabilization, health protection, environmental conservation, democracy promotion, education, and humanitarian relief. Congress prioritized child survival, basic education, and combating HIV/AIDS. The Bush Administration sought increased funding for development aid in FY2002, with a focus on areas such as bilateral HIV/AIDS funding, basic education for children, and a new Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. The Global Fund contribution for FY2002 would total $200 million, with $100 million from the Department of Health and Human Services budget and $20 million from the FY2001 Foreign Operations bill. USAID Administrator-designee Andrew Natsios expressed strong support for agriculture and food security programs. USAID has re-aligned core goals around three \"spheres of emphasis\" including Global Health, Economic Growth and Agriculture, and Conflict Prevention and Developmental Relief. The Bush Administration planned to launch the Global Development Alliance to expand public/private partnerships in development. Under the Global Development Alliance proposal, USAID aims to enhance development efforts by partnering with private foundations, NGOs, universities, and for-profit organizations. Roughly $160 million would be allocated in FY2002 for this initiative. Secretary of State Powell is open to discussing the reorganization of USAID but is not inclined to propose any changes currently. The House passed legislation for development assistance in FY2002, including $2.523 billion, $155 million above the request. Amendments were considered for health programs, with $100 million allocated for the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. The FY2001 Supplemental Appropriations provided $487 million to combat HIV/AIDS, with the House blocking USAID's Global Development Alliance initiative due to lack of details. Funding for selected USAID programs was tentatively estimated across all accounts. Portions of the $100 million contribution to the Global Trust Fund to Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis were assumed to be drawn. The House and Senate bills allocated funds for HIV/AIDS from the Global Trust Fund, with varying amounts drawn from available funds. The Senate bill provided more resources for development activities compared to the House bill. The Senate amendment to H.R. 2506 increased funding for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs and global health contributions, as well as added funds for malaria and tuberculosis programs. The Senate also allocated more funds for children and maternal health, population assistance, polio, and biodiversity compared to the House. The Global Development Alliance concept was supported but lacked details, leading to no funds being set aside for GDA activities in the enacted bill. The Committee directs that no program funds can be set aside for GDA activities in H.R. 2506, which provides $2.6 billion for USAID core development assistance accounts. Funding for major program priorities receives a boost, including $475 million for HIV/AIDS programs. The conference report allocates $435 million for bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, higher than the House and Senate levels. Other increases in funding include a 9% rise in UNICEF contributions from FY2001 levels. Increases above FY2001 levels in H.R. 2506 include: UNICEF contribution up 9%, malaria up one-third, micronutrients up 20%, basic education up 46%, women in development up 50%. USAID can launch Global Development Alliance initiative with conditions, limited to $20 million for FY2002. Family Planning and Abortion Restrictions debate dates back three decades. The \"Mexico City\" policy, established in the mid-1980s, restricted U.S. funds for foreign NGOs involved in abortion-related activities. President Clinton reversed this policy in 1993, allowing funding for all family planning organizations as long as no U.S. money was used. States will resume funding for family planning organizations as long as no U.S. money is used for abortion-related work. The House and Senate have had opposing positions on the Mexico City policy, with the House supporting restrictions on U.S. aid funds for organizations involved in abortions or lobbying for abortion laws abroad, while the Senate prefers leaving these decisions to the Administration. Congress adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-FY1999 without resolving the population program controversy. The FY2000 debate on international family planning and population aid issues became contentious as Congress and the White House negotiated a final budget agreement. Congressional leaders insisted on adding abortion restrictions to U.S. population assistance policy in exchange for approving legislation authorizing payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations. Mexico City language adding abortion restrictions to U.S. population assistance policy. President Clinton reluctantly agreed to the restrictions to remove obstacles to U.N. arrears payments. The restrictions were included in legislation signed by the President for the first time. The Foreign Operations Act for FY2000 included the restrictions, with the President having the authority to waive them up to a certain point. This resulted in a loss of $12.5 million in population assistance if the waiver authority was exercised. Congress reached an impasse in 2000 on international family planning issues, allowing the new President to set policy in 2001 under the FY2001 Foreign Operations measure. President Bush issued a Memorandum in 2001 reinstating the Mexico City Policy, prohibiting the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. He maintained the $425 million funding level for population assistance, emphasizing the importance of voluntary family planning services in preventing abortions. President Bush reinstated the Mexico City Policy in 2001, limiting the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. USAID issued guidelines to implement the policy, maintaining the $425 million funding for family planning services. Critics oppose the certification requirement, citing increased administrative costs for managing family planning programs. Critics argue that the new certification requirements for family planning programs funded by USAID will lead to increased costs and delays in project implementation. They fear that organizations may reduce services due to uncertainty about the restrictions, potentially resulting in more unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Additionally, opponents believe these conditions strain relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs, infringing on their sovereignty and limiting their ability to advocate for changes in abortion laws in developing countries. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that it prevents organizations from using USAID funds for abortions or lobbying efforts, closing the fungibility loophole. In a congressional debate, an amendment to reverse the President's Mexico City policy was rejected, which would have allowed groups to receive funding as long as they followed U.S. and local laws. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2506 increased family planning aid to $450 million and allocated $40 million for the U.N. Population Fund. A Senate provision blocked the White House from restricting foreign NGOs' eligibility for USAID funding based on the services they offer, as long as they comply with relevant laws. Foreign NGOs would also not be limited in their advocacy or lobbying activities using their own funds. The provision in H.R. 2506 allowed foreign NGOs to engage in advocacy and lobbying activities with their own funds without facing restrictions. The legislation appropriated $446.5 million for U.S. bilateral family planning/reproductive health programs in FY2002, close to the $450 million passed by the Senate. Conferees agreed to delete Senate language overturning the Mexico City policy but adopted funding levels for population assistance and UNFPA closer to the Senate's figures. The legislation in FY2002 allocated a $20.5 million increase from FY2001, with $10.5 million going to family planning in the Child Survival account and $10 million to other economic aid accounts. The conference agreement included a U.S. contribution of \"up to\" $34 million to the UNFPA, with conditions to not fund abortions and segregate U.S. funds. Conferees dropped the House restriction on UNFPA spending in China. Additionally, the HIPC initiative aimed to provide debt relief for forty-one heavily indebted poor countries. The Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative includes forty-one countries, mainly in Africa, eligible for debt relief based on unsustainable debt and economic reform track record. Critics argue for deeper debt cancellation and shorter qualification periods for relief. They also suggest revising the debt criteria to include more countries in need of assistance. At the Cologne Summit in June 1999, G-7 leaders endorsed most of the HIPC reforms proposed by critics, leading to debt reduction for 22 qualifying countries. The HIPC initiative, along with existing debt relief mechanisms, will cancel $53 billion of their $74 billion debt stock, reducing annual debt service by about half. The HIPC initiative will reduce debt for 22 qualifying countries by about half, totaling $800 million each year from 2001-2003. Poverty program expenditures for these countries are expected to increase by $1.7 billion during the same period. Total creditor costs for the HIPC initiative are estimated at $29.3 billion, with the U.S. financial commitment being roughly $800 million. Some NGOs criticize the initiative, arguing that the terms are not generous enough for poor countries. Critics of the HIPC initiative argue that the terms are not generous enough for poor countries to invest in social programs. They suggest canceling 100% of debt owed by HIPC, lowering qualification criteria for heavily indebted countries like Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Haiti to benefit from the initiative. World Bank and IMF officials counter that they do not have the resources to cancel total debt owed. Governments argue that institutions lack resources to cancel all debt owed by HIPC nations, fearing depletion of bank reserves. They believe full debt cancellation could create \"moral hazard\" and advocate for some payment obligations to remain. Congress authorized funding for U.S. contributions to the HIPC initiative in 1999 and 2000, providing $110 million in FY2000 and $435 million in FY2001, with $75 million allocated for bilateral debt write-off and $360 million for the HIPC Trust Fund to assist multilateral creditors. The House provided full funding of $224 million for U.S. support of the HIPC initiative in FY2002, completing the U.S. commitment of $600 million for the HIPC Trust Fund. Congressional debate also directed the Treasury Secretary to press other donors to agree to the creation of a grant aid facility at the World Bank. The Senate bill recommended full $224 million funding for HIPC and provided resources for the Tropical Forestry Conservation Act (TFCA) debt relief initiative. The Administration did not request funds for FY2002 TFCA activities but sought authority to transfer $13 million from USAID development assistance resources. The House bill directed $25 million from prior year appropriations for TFCA debt relief, while the Senate measure appropriated $11 million for TFCA. H.R. 2506 provides $224 million for debt relief under HIPC, with additional funding of $5 million for the TFCA. The Bush Administration requested $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative in FY2002, focusing on economic and social programs as well as drug control efforts in Colombia and neighboring countries. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative, outlined in H.R. 2506, allocated funds to Colombia and Peru for socio-economic aid and counter-narcotics efforts. Colombia received $399 million, with $146.5 million for alternative development and $252.5 million for counter-narcotics aid. Peru received $156 million, with $79 million for socio-economic aid and $78 million for counter-narcotics efforts. Bolivia received $101 million for socio-economic aid and counter-narcotics efforts. Ecuador received $39 million for similar initiatives. Brazil received $15 million for border counter-narcotics forces. Panama received $11 million for upgrading interdiction and law enforcement personnel. Counter-narcotics aid: $10 million for Venezuela to reform law enforcement and interdiction, counter money-laundering, and reduce demand. Congressional debate reduced the President's Andean initiative by $56 million to $675 million. Concerns were raised about the lack of success of the earlier Plan Colombia program and the focus on military operations over development needs. Amendments were considered to further reduce funding or limit U.S. involvement in military operations, including capping personnel at 800. The House and Senate debated funding for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative, with the House reducing funding by $1 million and the Senate cutting funds to $547 million. An amendment to restore funding to $731 million was voted out of order. Alternative development for the Andean region was set at $151 million. The enacted bill provides $625 million for the Andean Counternarcotics Initiative (ACI), with an additional $35 million authorized for transfer. The conference committee encouraged providing Bolivia with $86 million and Ecuador with $33 million in alternative development funding. H.R. 2506 limits the number of U.S. personnel involved in the ACI to 800 and blocks funding for flights in support of the Peruvian air interdiction program. The Bush Administration's FY2001 supplemental appropriations proposal included additional funds for defense and domestic farm relief, but no additional resources for Foreign Operations programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $100 million for a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. President Bush had proposed $200 million for the Global Fund in FY2002, with the House bill including no funds for the HIV/AIDS and other disease fund. Conferees meeting on H.R. 2216 approved the Senate provision and added $100 million. Congress accelerated the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund by adding $100 million to legislation H.R. 2216 (P.L. 107-20). This required USAID to find $20 million in cuts from prior year programs. An amendment to add $593 million for the Global Health Fund was defeated in the Senate.

The Foreign Operations Accounts Discretionary Budget Authority was adjusted for FY2001, with funding changes for various programs including ESF, Peacekeeping, Child Survival, and East European aid. Congress approved $100 million for the Global Fund in FY2001 Supplemental Appropriations, partially offset by rescinding $20 million from prior year appropriations. For FY2002, $100 million was allocated for the Global Fund from Child Survival and other accounts, with a modified structure for Child Survival/Health and Development aid accounts. In the budget adjustments, education funding was moved from the CSH account to the DA account, while family planning funding was shifted from the DA account to the CSH account. Additionally, funding for the Inter-American and African Development Foundations was provided in separate accounts. The figures presented include totals across all accounts, not just within the Development Aid subtotal. The Administration request includes the Ireland Fund as part of the Economic Support Fund."
