    "content": "Congress has regulated drugs since the 19th century, starting with tariffs and purity requirements for narcotic drugs. The Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 marked the beginning of federal oversight of the domestic trade in narcotics. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 expanded federal control to include marijuana, depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. The Controlled Substances Act, part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, regulates drugs with potential for abuse and dependence. Congress aimed to balance the medical benefits of drugs with the risks of illegal distribution and misuse to protect public health. The Controlled Substances Act aims to protect public health by regulating drugs with potential for abuse and dependence. It creates registration and trafficking provisions to prevent diversion and misuse of controlled substances. The Act primarily applies to prescription drugs, not over-the-counter medications. The Controlled Substances Act primarily applies to prescription drugs, not over-the-counter medications. It does not apply to all prescription drugs, only a subset deemed to warrant additional controls. Recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and LSD are controlled substances, as are some lesser-known substances. Alcohol, tobacco, and hemp meeting certain requirements are excluded from the Act. New drugs not covered by the Act may fall outside its scope. The Controlled Substances Act primarily applies to prescription drugs, not over-the-counter medications. It does not cover all prescription drugs, only those classified as controlled substances. These drugs are also subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, enforced by the FDA, which prohibits the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Misbranding includes false or misleading labeling, advertising, or promotion, as well as unapproved prescription drugs, including imported ones. The FD&C Act prohibits the introduction of adulterated or misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, including imported drugs. Misbranding may involve misrepresenting a substance as a brand-name drug. The Act aims to prevent harm to consumers by ensuring drug quality and safety. The CSA, on the other hand, focuses on controlling the distribution of substances that pose a potential danger to public welfare. The CSA and FD&C Act aim to prevent harm to consumers by regulating the distribution of drugs and controlling substances that pose a danger. State drug laws often mirror federal laws, but states can modify them, leading to varying penalties for violations. There is not a complete overlap between federal and state control of drugs. States may impose controls on substances not covered by the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and may adopt federal scheduling decisions with a delay. However, states cannot change federal law, and federal law supersedes state law in cases of conflict. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) classifies substances into five schedules, with the DEA and Congress having the authority to make scheduling decisions. State laws on marijuana do not override federal controls, and federal law takes precedence in cases of conflict. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) categorizes substances into Schedules I-V based on medical utility and potential for abuse. Schedule I has the strictest controls as substances have no accepted medical use, while Schedule V has the least stringent regulations. The CSA also governs controlled substance analogues and listed chemicals. Under the CSA, controlled substance analogues are substances with a similar chemical structure or effect to Schedule I or II drugs, treated as Schedule I if intended for human consumption. Listed chemicals are precursor chemicals for controlled substances, categorized as List I Chemicals if used in manufacturing controlled substances in violation of the CSA. List I chemicals, like ephedrine and iodine, are used to produce methamphetamine and other drugs. List II chemicals, such as acetone and sulfuric acid, are also important for manufacturing controlled substances. Both listed chemicals and controlled substance analogues are subject to regulations, including recording transactions and complying with sales limits. There are differences in how these substances are regulated under the CSA. Controlled substance analogues and listed chemicals are regulated under the CSA. A key difference is that analogues must be intended for human consumption as a substitute for a controlled substance, while listed chemicals are typically used as ingredients in manufacturing controlled substances. Listed chemicals are specific substances identified for control, while analogues need only satisfy statutory criteria. Changes in a substance's legal status can occur through agency action, legislation, or congressional intervention. Congress has the power to quickly respond to urgent drug concerns by passing legislation to control, reclassify, or remove substances under the CSA. The DEA can also make scheduling decisions through a complex process involving other agencies and the public. Administrative scheduling can be initiated by the DEA, HHS, or any interested party. The DEA Administrator may deny a petition to begin scheduling proceedings if the grounds are not sufficient. Denial is subject to judicial review, and before rulemaking, a scientific evaluation from the Secretary of HHS is required, delegated to the FDA. Factors considered include abuse potential, pharmacological effects, and public risk. The FDA evaluates substances for control based on scientific findings, public health risks, and precursor status. FDA's recommendations are binding on the DEA, which makes scheduling decisions after evaluating relevant data and meeting specific criteria. DEA decisions undergo notice-and-comment rulemaking. The DEA Administrator's decisions on scheduling substances are subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking and judicial review. Courts generally defer to the DEA's interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act, and scheduling decisions can take years to finalize. Congress amended the CSA in 1984 to allow for faster scheduling in some cases. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 allow the DEA Administrator to temporarily place a substance in Schedule I to prevent public safety hazards. The DEA must provide 30 days' notice and consider abuse history, duration, and public health risks. Temporary scheduling can last up to two years, with the option for permanent scheduling proceedings. The DEA Administrator can temporarily schedule a substance for up to two years to prevent public safety hazards, with the option for one additional year extension if permanent scheduling proceedings are pending. Emergency scheduling orders are not subject to judicial review. The DEA has used this power to control analogues to fentanyl and synthetic cannabinoids. The United States is a party to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, which requires signatories to criminalize various activities related to narcotics, coca leaf, cocaine, and marijuana. The United States is party to international drug control treaties, including the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. This treaty requires controls on controlled substances, such as licensing for manufacture and distribution, prescriptions for dispensing, and measures against violations of laws. The DEA can schedule drugs to meet treaty obligations if existing controls are insufficient. The DEA can schedule drugs to meet international treaty obligations without the need for factual findings or following regular administrative scheduling procedures. Once a substance is under the Controlled Substances Act, all handlers except end users must comply with regulatory requirements. This creates a closed system of distribution where only authorized registrants like manufacturers, distributors, practitioners, and pharmacists can handle controlled substances. The DEA regulates the distribution of pharmaceutical controlled substances through authorized registrants like manufacturers, distributors, practitioners, and pharmacists. These registrants must maintain records of transactions and follow security measures. The DEA registration system ensures controlled substances are accounted for and under the control of registered individuals. Registration is required for those who produce, distribute, or dispense controlled substances, except for individual consumers known as \"ultimate users.\" Ultimate users are exempt from registration as they are not part of the distribution system monitored by the DEA. Manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must register annually with the DEA, while entities that dispense controlled substances can obtain registrations lasting between one and three years. Registrations specify the activities registrants may engage in, and separate registrations are required for different activities or locations. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires registration for activities involving controlled substances, with additional requirements for certain activities like operating an opioid treatment program. The DEA Administrator evaluates registrations based on public interest criteria to prevent diversion and ensure compliance with laws. Registrations expire at the end of the period unless renewed. Registrants must comply with multiple recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the CSA. They must conduct biennial inventories of controlled substances, maintain records of all transactions, and distribute Schedule I and II substances only with written orders. Records must be kept for two years and made available for government review upon request. Registrants must also have a system in place to identify suspicious activities. Registrants under the CSA must design a system to identify suspicious orders and report them to the DEA. Suspicious orders include those of unusual size, frequency, or deviation from normal patterns. Additionally, orders may be flagged if a pharmacy primarily sells controlled substances, customers pay with cash, or drugs are purchased at a price higher than insurance reimbursement. The DEA Administrator has the authority to inspect registrants' establishments. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) requires manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances to be inspected annually. A warrant is needed for inspection unless there are special circumstances. Probable cause is necessary for warrant issuance, defined as a valid public interest in enforcing the CSA. Registrants must have effective controls to prevent theft and diversion of controlled substances, with specific physical security requirements outlined in regulations. The regulations for controlled substances require specific physical security measures based on registrant type and substance classification. Nonpractitioners must store Schedule I and II substances in a secure cabinet or vault accessible only to authorized employees. Practitioners must use a securely locked cabinet and are prohibited from employing individuals with certain criminal histories related to controlled substances. The CSA directs DEA to set production quotas for controlled substances to prevent diversion and requires individual quotas for manufacturers. DEA Administrator must estimate diversion of opioids and reduce quotas accordingly. Controlled Substances Import and Export Act allows importation based on DEA Administrator's determination of necessity for medical or scientific purposes. Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), substances in Schedules II through IV must be provided by a medical practitioner or dispensed with a prescription. Schedule V substances may be dispensed for a medical purpose, usually requiring a prescription. The DEA enforces registration requirements and can take actions such as issuing warnings, suspending or revoking registrations, and imposing fines. The DEA Administrator has the authority to suspend or revoke an entity's registration for various reasons, including falsification of application materials or criminal convictions. Prior to taking such actions, the Administrator must provide notice, a hearing, and the opportunity to submit a corrective plan, unless there is an imminent danger to public health or safety. In cases of imminent danger, immediate suspension may be necessary to prevent harm related to controlled substances. A violation of the Controlled Substances Act's registration requirements, such as prescribing drugs without a legitimate medical purpose, may result in criminal charges by the DEA. Penalties vary depending on the offense, with potential suspension or revocation of registration for entities. The Controlled Substances Act imposes penalties for violations of registration requirements, including fines or imprisonment for individuals and fines up to $500,000 for manufacturers or distributors of opioids. The Act's trafficking provisions cover a wide range of illicit activities involving controlled substances, both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits the illegal manufacturing, distribution, possession, and trafficking of controlled substances. Penalties vary based on the type and amount of the substance involved. Specific offenses include distributing drugs at specific locations, endangering human life during manufacturing, selling drug paraphernalia, and operating large-scale drug dealing operations. Attempting or conspiring to commit any offense under the Act is also a crime. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits illegal activities related to controlled substances, with penalties based on the type and amount of substance involved. Attempting or conspiring to commit offenses under the Act is also a crime, and the DOJ enforces trafficking provisions through criminal charges. Participation in the registration system does not protect registrants from trafficking penalties, as seen in United States v. Moore where registered physicians can be prosecuted for drug trafficking if their actions are outside the usual course of professional practice. The Court in Moore held that the defendant's actions as a doctor distributing methadone exceeded the bounds of professional practice, acting more as a drug \"pusher\" than a physician. Appellate courts have used this case to uphold convictions of pharmacists and practitioners for illegal distribution of controlled substances. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has cautioned that a conviction under Moore for illegal distribution of controlled substances requires proof of intent to distribute drugs outside the course of professional practice. The DOJ has historically brought criminal charges against doctors and pharmacists for dispensing drugs outside professional norms. In 2019, criminal trafficking charges were brought against a pharmaceutical company and its executives for selling opioids to pharmacies. In 2019, criminal charges were brought against a pharmaceutical company and its executives for selling opioids oxycodone and fentanyl to pharmacies illegally. Violations of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) can result in large fines and significant jail time, with penalties varying based on the offense and type of controlled substance involved. Unauthorized possession of a controlled substance may lead to a $1,000 fine and up to a year in prison, while distribution of certain drugs can result in a prison sentence of 10 years to life and a fine of up to $10. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) imposes severe penalties for trafficking drugs like cocaine and methamphetamine, with potential fines of up to $10 million for individuals and $50 million for organizations. Repeat offenses or cases involving death or serious injury carry even harsher penalties. Apart from the CSA, drug-related misconduct can also lead to liability under various federal and state laws, such as the FD&C Act for drug companies and Racketeer charges for criminal organizations. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act can lead to federal charges for companies and criminal organizations. Manufacturers and distributors of opioids are facing civil suits under federal and state law for their marketing and distribution practices. Congress has been focusing on drug regulation, including proposals related to the opioid epidemic, synthetic drugs like fentanyl analogues, marijuana laws, and researchers' ability to study Schedule I controlled substances. The opioid epidemic is a significant issue in controlled substance regulation, with opioids being drugs derived from the opium poppy or mimicking its effects. The opioid crisis has led to a surge in overdoses and deaths, with both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical opioids being abused. Legislative proposals aim to address the illicit distribution of opioids, provide support for affected individuals and communities, and fund law enforcement and treatment programs. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) was enacted by Congress to combat the crisis. In 2016, Congress passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) and the 21st Century Cures Act to address the opioid crisis. The CARA provided grants for prevention, education, law enforcement, and treatment, while the Cures Act allocated additional funding to states. In 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention and Treatment Act (SUPPORT Act) made amendments to various statutes to combat the crisis, including expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and revising factors for opioid production quotas. The DEA is revising factors for opioid production quotas and defining \"suspicious order\" under the CSA. Proposed legislative changes aim to amend the CSA, such as the DEA Enforcement Authority Act of 2019 lowering the threshold for immediate suspension of DEA registration in cases of imminent danger. The John S. McCain Opioid Addiction Prevention Act proposes limiting opioid prescriptions to a seven-day supply for acute pain. The LABEL Opioids Act would require opioids to bear labels warning of dependence and overdose risks. Specific proposals target fentanyl, such as reducing the amounts needed for trafficking offenses. The Comprehensive Fentanyl Control Act introduced in the 115th Congress aimed to reduce fentanyl amounts triggering criminal liability and increase penalties for fentanyl offenses. The Screening All Fentanyl-Enhanced Mail Act of 2019 seeks to screen inbound international mail for illicit fentanyl. The Blocking Deadly Fentanyl Imports Act aims to gather information on illicit fentanyl production in foreign countries and withhold assistance from non-compliant countries. Congress is also addressing the proliferation of synthetic drugs, particularly synthetic opioids. Synthetic drugs, especially opioids like fentanyl, are chemically produced in labs to mimic natural drugs. Fentanyl, a potent opioid used for pain management, also poses a high risk of abuse and overdose. Manipulating its chemical structure can create new, dangerous substances. DEA has used emergency scheduling authority to control synthetic drugs, including fentanyl-like substances, due to their potential dangers. A recent broad emergency scheduling order covers all \"fentanyl-related substances\" meeting specific criteria. Without further action, this temporary order will expire in February 2020. Fentanyl-related substances may still be controlled as analogues, requiring specific elements for conviction in related offenses. The DOJ must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that analogue controlled substances are intended for human consumption and have a chemical structure or effect similar to Schedule I or II controlled substances. Proposals in Congress aim to permanently schedule fentanyl analogues to aid enforcement. The Modernizing Drug Enforcement Act of 2019 aims to automatically classify opioids like synthetic fentanyl as Schedule I narcotics based on their chemical structure, to avoid individually scheduling each substance. Defining fentanyl analogues for regulation poses a challenge due to varying effects and a large number of potential analogues. The 116th Congress faces legal considerations regarding the classification of opioids based on chemical structure or effects, and the growing divide between federal and state marijuana laws. As of June 2019, 11 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical and recreational marijuana for adults over 21. Despite state laws, marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance federally. DOJ has not prosecuted individuals for personal marijuana use on private property due to resource limitations, leaving enforcement to state and local authorities. Congress has passed appropriations riders since FY2014 to prevent DOJ from interfering with state marijuana laws. The current appropriations rider allows states to implement their own laws authorizing medical marijuana use, distribution, possession, or cultivation until November 21, 2019. Courts have interpreted the rider to prevent DOJ from prosecuting activities in strict compliance with state law, but those outside state laws remain subject to prosecution. Despite the rider, marijuana-related activities can still have serious legal consequences under federal law. The DOJ guidance in 2018 reaffirmed federal prosecutors' authority to target marijuana offenses in accordance with all laws. Participants in the cannabis industry may face collateral consequences due to federal prohibition, such as limited access to banking services and federal tax deductions. Involvement in cannabis-related income may also impact bankruptcy proceedings. Several proposals before Congress aim to address issues related to the marijuana policy gap, including the Secure And Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 (SAFE Banking Act) and the Ensuring Safe Capital Access for All Small Businesses Act of 2019. These proposals seek to protect financial institutions providing services to cannabis businesses and make SBA loan programs available to them. Other proposals aim to mitigate conflicts between federal and state law regarding cannabis. The STATES Act and the Responsibly Addressing the Marijuana Policy Gap Act of 2019 aim to protect individuals and entities complying with state marijuana laws from federal prosecution under the CSA. The latter also addresses collateral consequences such as access to banking services and tax deductions. The State Cannabis Commerce Act aims to prevent federal agencies from interfering with state marijuana laws, while other proposed legislation seeks to change marijuana's classification under the CSA. This could raise new legal issues. If Congress removes marijuana from the CSA, it may need to address past criminal convictions and could impose new federal regulations on marijuana. Descheduling marijuana would not automatically bring the cannabis industry into compliance with federal law under the FD&C Act. The FDA treats cannabis products like any other regulated products, prohibiting the introduction of CBD or THC in food or as dietary supplements. The FDA is considering a framework for lawful marketing of cannabis products, while Congress could pass legislation to change FDA regulations. Removing federal restrictions on marijuana may conflict with U.S. treaty obligations. The United States' potential removal of federal restrictions on marijuana could conflict with its treaty obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, which require criminalization and restrictions on controlled substances. Failure to comply could lead to international legal consequences. The 116th Congress faces legal issues regarding the Controlled Substances Act's impact on clinical research with Schedule I substances like marijuana. Federal law limits research funding and requires approval for scientific studies involving Schedule I substances. Some concerns have been raised about restrictions on research with Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana. Congress passed a law in 2015 to improve transparency in issuing licenses for research on Schedule I substances, but as of June 2019, no new licenses had been granted. In June 2019, no new licenses for research on Schedule I controlled substances had been granted. An applicant petitioned the D.C. Circuit for a writ of mandamus to compel the DEA to issue notice of its application. The DEA responded by publishing a notice in August 2019, announcing 33 applications received and intent to regulate marijuana manufacture for research. The petitioner disputes the mootness of the case and asks the court to ensure prompt action. The court has yet to rule on the petition for the DEA to process applications promptly. DEA intends to review pending applications and grant necessary licenses for marijuana research. Congress may pass legislation to guide DEA's consideration of manufacturing applications. The Medical Cannabis Research Act of 2019 aims to increase licenses for marijuana research. Congress could pass legislation to facilitate research on controlled substances, including marijuana, psilocybin, and MDMA."
