FINDINGS.\" The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia lacks legal protection for freedom of religion, with Salafi Islam as the official religion. The Mutawwa'in have persecuted non-Muslims, as seen in the 2005 detention of Christians. Citizens are denied the freedom to choose or change their religion, with apostasy punishable by death. Sunni Muslims face discrimination in government employment and higher education. Individuals of Hindu and Sikh faiths are considered polytheists under Sharia law, receiving only 1/16 of compensation in accidental death compared to male Muslims. Saudi Arabia prohibits non-Muslim clergy from entering the country, leading to detention and deportation of Christians for practicing their faith. Saudi Arabia's discriminatory practices extend to non-Muslims, with laws requiring citizens to carry identity cards designating their religion. The government violates freedom of speech, as seen in the case of Mansur al-Noqaidan who was punished for criticizing the government's response to extremism. Additionally, Saudi Arabia spreads religious fatwas through mosques in the United States, as highlighted in a report by Freedom House. The Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C. distributed fatwas through its Cultural Department against Muslims seeking U.S. citizenship, stating it is forbidden for a Muslim to become citizens of a country governed by infidels, showing clear contempt for civil society. Saudi Arabia promotes hate ideology and religious extremism in the United States through its Air Force, Foreign Ministry, and Embassy in Washington, D.C. The country practices religious apartheid, subjugates its citizens to a specific interpretation of Islam, and breeds terrorists through its education system. Saudi Arabia also exports terrorists and discriminatory values, benefiting from American money. Saudi Arabia benefits from American money through intermediate companies funding activities. The United States policy aims to ensure divestment from financial institutions with ties to Saudi Arabia, directing assets away from entities engaged in financial activities in the country. The United States policy aims to prevent future investment in banks or financial institutions with ties to Saudi Arabia, ensuring divestment from entities engaged in financial activities in the country. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, must report to Congress every six months on investments sold, redeemed, divested, or withdrawn from Saudi Arabia. The report should include details such as the entity's name, investment amount, progress towards divestment, and efforts to inform US investors about relevant policies. This Act aims to address the policies of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
