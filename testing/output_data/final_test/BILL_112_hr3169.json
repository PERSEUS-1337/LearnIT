    "content": "The \"Student Support Act\" is introduced, amending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to include a new chapter on school-based mental health and student service providers. The \"Student Support Act\" aims to address the lack of mental health services for children and adolescents in schools. Despite the high prevalence of mental illness among youth, many do not receive the necessary treatment. School counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, and social workers play a crucial role in providing support services, but there is a shortage of resources for these professionals nationwide. The current national average ratio of students to school counselors in elementary and secondary schools is 561 to 1, which is much higher than the recommended ratios by the Institute of Medicine. Schools need more mental health professionals and the flexibility to hire the professionals that will best serve their students. In some states, 1 school counselor typically serves over 1,000 students, with similarly high ratios for school psychologists and school social workers. The need for school-based mental health professionals is high, with some schools lacking these services. The number of students is expected to increase, leading to the retirement of current professionals. Programs with these providers have shown positive outcomes like reduced suspensions and increased student safety.

The curr_chunk specifies that a school social worker must be accredited by the Council on Social Work Education, licensed or certified by the State, or possess a national credential as a school social work specialist. The term 'State' refers to each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
