    "content": "The \"Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2001\" amends the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 by changing the year from 2001 to 2008. Additionally, it includes a provision for a GAO study and report. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the impact of the antitrust exemption on institutional student aid under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. The study will involve consultation with participating institutions, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, and other relevant parties to determine the content of the study. The study will examine needs analysis methodologies, trends in undergraduate costs of attendance, and institutional undergraduate grant aid among participating institutions. The study will analyze the percentage of first-year students receiving institutional grant aid, mean and median grant eligibility and aid, parental and student contributions to undergraduate costs for first-year students receiving aid, and the impact of the antitrust exemption under the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994. The study will analyze comparison data from institutions of higher education not under the antitrust exemption and baseline trend data from national benchmarks. The study will assess the impact of the antitrust exemption on institutional student aid, focusing on institutional undergraduate grant aid and parental contribution to undergraduate costs of attendance over time for institutions of higher education. The study will evaluate the effects of the antitrust exemption on institutional student aid by analyzing data from before the adoption of consensus methodologies at participating institutions and the data examined as part of the study. The Comptroller General will submit a report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees by September 30, 2006, containing findings on matters studied. Individual institutions will not be identified unless the information is public. Participating institutions must collect and maintain data for each academic year until the study is completed. The Comptroller General requires participating institutions to collect student-level data for analysis of family contributions, need, and grant aid awards. Institutions must also provide information on the formulas used to determine need. Non-participating institutions are not required to collect this data. The Act and its amendments will be effective on September 30, 2001."
