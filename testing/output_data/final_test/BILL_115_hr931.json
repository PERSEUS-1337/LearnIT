    "content": "The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 establishes a voluntary registry for firefighters to collect health and occupational information for determining cancer incidence. The registry aims to improve data collection and coordination for monitoring cancer nationwide. The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 establishes a voluntary registry to collect epidemiological information on cancer incidence among firefighters, including individual risk factors and occupational history. The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 establishes a voluntary registry to collect information on cancer incidence among firefighters, including age at cancer diagnosis and age during relevant dates of occupation. The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 requires firefighters to provide details such as their status (volunteer, paid-on-call, or career), years of occupation, number and type of fire incidents attended, and other medical information for a voluntary registry. The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 mandates the inclusion of additional risk factors and relevant information for a cancer study of firefighters. The Secretary is required to facilitate electronic connection between the Firefighter Registry and State-based cancer registries to obtain diagnoses, treatment details, and pathological data for firefighters with cancer. Additionally, a coordination strategy for the Firefighter Registry is also required by the Secretary. The Secretary must develop a strategy to coordinate data collection activities for the Firefighter Registry, including increasing awareness and encouraging participation among different types of firefighters. This strategy should address unique data collection needs for minority, female, and volunteer firefighters, and include information on data storage. The Secretary will store and provide electronic access to health information, develop a method for estimating fire incidents attended by firefighters, and submit a report to Congress within 30 days. The Secretary will develop a strategy for including firefighters in the registry, outlining submission and maintenance of information, and estimating fire incidents attended by firefighters. The Secretary will consult with non-Federal experts on the Firefighter Registry and submit a report to relevant committees on goals achieved and improvements needed. Non-Federal experts will include public health experts, epidemiologists, and clinicians with experience in cancer registries and incidence. The Firefighter Registry ensures information is available to the public, researchers, and fire service organizations while protecting personal privacy. $2,500,000 is authorized annually for 2018-2022 to support this initiative. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
