    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act is a significant piece of legislation that aims to eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Title III of the ADA specifically prohibits discrimination in public accommodations. Legal actions have been taken against entities for violations, with some cases being dismissed due to the plaintiff being deemed a vexatious litigant or lacking standing. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, with some legal actions dismissed due to lack of intent to return or previous suits. Legislation has been proposed to require notice of non-compliance before legal action. Public accommodations include hotels, restaurants, theaters, and more. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including parks, zoos, private schools, day care centers, health care offices, and gymnasiums. Removal of architectural barriers must be \"readily achievable,\" and reasonable modifications are required unless they fundamentally alter the services. No individual with a disability can be excluded without auxiliary aids unless it results in undue burden. Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, including parks, zoos, private schools, day care centers, health care offices, and gymnasiums. An undue burden is defined as an action involving \"significant difficulty or expense.\" Remedies and procedures from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are incorporated in Title III of the ADA, allowing for private suits and suits by the Attorney General for discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Monetary damages are not recoverable in private suits but may be available in suits brought by the Attorney General. The ADA does not specifically incorporate the requirement of giving notice to the appropriate State or local authority before bringing a civil action. The ADA does not specifically incorporate the requirement of giving notice to the appropriate State or local authority before bringing a civil action. Courts have generally found that this requirement was not incorporated in the ADA. Cases involving multiple lawsuits by individuals with disabilities based on minor violations have been settled out of court, but there have been judicial decisions addressing whether the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant or has standing. In Molski v. Mandarin Touch Restaurant, a California district court found that the plaintiff filed hundreds of lawsuits to harass and intimidate business owners into cash settlements. The district court reviewed Mr. Molski's 300-400 lawsuits filed since 1998, noting many were nearly identical in claims and damages. In one case, he alleged injuries at a restaurant due to lack of parking and high food counter. The court found his complaints indicative of harassing businesses. The court found that Mr. Molski's lawsuits showed a clear intent to harass businesses, even though many were not fully compliant with the ADA. Sanctions were imposed for bad faith, especially when the motive was to gain funds. The plaintiff was ordered to seek court approval before filing any more ADA claims, as the court found him to have lied in his filings. Additionally, the court ruled that the counsel in the Molski case must also seek court approval before filing further ADA claims. These decisions were upheld on appeal to the ninth circuit in Molski v. Evergreen Dynasty Corp. The ninth circuit upheld the decision in Molski v. Evergreen Dynasty Corp, stating that while serial litigation may be necessary for ADA compliance, it can become vexatious when complaints contain false allegations. The court also supported the district court's imposition of a pre-filing order due to false factual allegations in the complaints. The district court found that false factual allegations enabled Molski's vexatious litigation, leading to sanctions. Some courts have ruled that a plaintiff lacks standing for ADA claims without intent to return to the entity with violations. For instance, in Harris v. Stonecrest Care Auto Center, the court questioned the plaintiff's credibility due to multiple ADA lawsuits. Title III of the ADA aims to provide injunctive relief for discrimination in public accommodations. The plaintiff's purpose of visiting the gas station was solely to bring a Title III claim and supplemental state claims, but the court found that any injunctive relief granted would not satisfy the redressability requirement of standing. In another case, the court ruled that the plaintiff failed to show a real and immediate threat of future injury due to infrequent visits to the store and a gap in time between visits. Despite concerns about previous ADA litigation, the Ninth Circuit held that a plaintiff's declaration and testimony were sufficient to confer standing. The court found that the plaintiff's past ADA litigation did not affect her credibility, emphasizing her intent to return to Santa Barbara. Proposed changes in ADA legislation aim to address vexatious lawsuits, with arguments for notification requirements to prevent money-driven suits. Representative Hunter introduced the ADA Notification Act of 2011 to address these issues. H.R. 881, introduced by Representative Hunter, seeks to amend Title III of the ADA to limit court jurisdiction in civil actions under the ADA or state laws related to it. Plaintiffs must provide written notice of alleged violations before filing a complaint, allowing for a 90-day remedial period before legal action can proceed. The complaint states that the defendant has not corrected the alleged violation as of the filing date. H.R. 881 allows for a 30-day extension of the remedial period. Previous legislation in Congress had similar notification provisions, with some differences in notification methods. The House Subcommittee on Rural Enterprises, Agriculture, and Technology held hearings on the ADA Notification Act in the 108th Congress. Previous ADA Notification Acts in the 107th Congress had similar language and were discussed in hearings by the Subcommittee on the Constitution in the House Committee on the Judiciary."
