    "content": "The Act titled \"Emergency Contraception Education Act of 2007\" is also known as the \"Emergency Contraception Education Act.\" It includes findings related to emergency contraception. Congress finds that 3 million pregnancies in the US are unintended, with 4 in 10 ending in abortion. The FDA approves emergency contraception like Plan B for preventing unintended pregnancies. Emergency contraception, mainly using birth control pills, can reduce pregnancy risk by up to 89% within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception, also known as postcoital contraception, can be effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse or contraception failure. It works by delaying ovulation, preventing fertilization, and may prevent implantation. Increased usage of emergency contraception could reduce unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion. Despite recommendations, emergency contraceptive use in the United States remains low, with many women unaware of the method. Despite recommendations from gynecologists, only 1 in 4 obstetricians/gynecologists routinely discuss emergency contraception with patients, highlighting the need for more education. Around 25,000 to 32,000 women become pregnant each year due to rape or incest, with half choosing to terminate their pregnancy. Emergency contraception could help these survivors avoid the trauma of unintended pregnancy. A study by Ibis Reproductive Health found that less than 18 percent of hospitals provide emergency contraception without restrictions, showing limited access to this method. In nearly 50 percent of hospitals, emergency contraception is unavailable even in cases of sexual assault. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorse wider availability of emergency contraception. Healthy People 2010 aims to increase the proportion of healthcare providers offering emergency contraception. Public awareness campaigns can help remove barriers to access and promote this important form of pregnancy prevention. Emergency contraception education and information programs are essential for increasing access to emergency contraception, especially in cases of sexual assault. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support wider availability of emergency contraception. Healthy People 2010 aims to increase healthcare providers offering emergency contraception. Public awareness campaigns can help promote this important form of pregnancy prevention. The Secretary will develop and disseminate information on emergency contraception to the public through various channels. This information will include details on the description, use, safety, efficacy, and availability of emergency contraception. Additionally, a program will be established to provide healthcare providers with information on emergency contraception. The Secretary, in consultation with medical organizations, will develop and distribute information on emergency contraception to healthcare providers. This information will cover the use, safety, efficacy, and availability of emergency contraception, as well as guidance on its appropriate use. Additionally, providers will be informed on how to obtain and distribute this information to their patients. Definitions for the distribution of emergency contraception to patients by healthcare providers include emergency contraception as a drug or device used postcoitally to prevent pregnancy, approved by the FDA. Health care provider refers to licensed individuals providing health services, including pharmacists. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
