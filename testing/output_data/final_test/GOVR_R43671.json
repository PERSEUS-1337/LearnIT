    "content": "Ex-Im Bank is the official export credit agency of the United States, assisting in financing U.S. exports to support U.S. employment. It provides financial products like direct loans, loan guarantees, working capital finance, and export credit insurance. Its activities are backed by the U.S. government and follow international guidelines for government-backed export credit agencies. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is the official export credit agency of the United States, established in 1945 as part of the New Deal response to the Great Depression. It provides financial products to support U.S. exports and follows international guidelines for government-backed export credit agencies. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) was established in 1945 to support U.S. exports. It initially focused on reconstruction efforts post-war and later shifted to offering export credit financing for goods. In the 1960s, it began providing export credit guarantees against political and exchange rate risks. By the 1970s, it funded infrastructure projects in developing countries, and by the 1980s, small projects and capital goods became a larger focus. In the 1980s, small projects and capital goods constituted a larger share of Ex-Im Bank's business. Currently, Ex-Im Bank provides direct loans, loan guarantees, and export credit insurance to promote U.S. exports and contribute to U.S. employment. Congress has statutory responsibilities for Ex-Im Bank, providing authority through the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 and overseeing its activities. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is overseen by Congress, with the Senate approving nominations for key positions. Funding for the Bank is typically included in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act. Debate surrounds the Bank's role in promoting U.S. exports and job creation, with supporters citing its assistance in addressing financing gaps and enhancing competitiveness, while critics argue it displaces private sector financing. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) is a government agency that supports U.S. exports. Critics argue it crowds out private sector activity and poses risks to taxpayers. Congress has renewed its authority multiple times, focusing on its role in supporting exports and financial soundness. Ex-Im Bank is headquartered in Washington, DC, with regional export finance centers in 12 U.S. cities. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) supports U.S. exports and is led by a Board of Directors appointed by the President. The Board authorizes transactions and ensures political party diversity. An Advisory Committee, appointed by the Board, represents various sectors. The Export-Import Bank has a Sub-Saharan Africa Advisory Committee to promote financial commitments in the region. The Board of Directors lacks a quorum to approve transactions above $10 million. Nominations for Board members require Senate approval. In FY2015, the Bank had 420 FTEs for programs and 25 FTEs for the Office of Inspector General. Export finance is crucial for facilitating international trade by covering the gap between placing an export order and receiving payment. It helps exporters protect against payment default, manage working capital, and provide funds for buyers. The size and composition of trade finance markets are not accurately measured, but the World Trade Organization estimates that a significant portion of global trade transactions involve some form of finance. The global trade finance market exceeds $10 trillion annually and is mainly provided by export credit agencies, commercial banks, insurance companies, capital markets, and manufacturer self-financing. Commercial banks dominate the market, accounting for 80% of trade finance, with private lenders and insurers handling short-term export financing. Export credit agencies (ECAs) mainly provide short-term export financing, while commercial banks dominate the global trade finance market. ECAs support certain sectors and complex transactions, such as aircraft and infrastructure projects, by mitigating risks and diversifying funding sources. Ex-Im Bank offers direct loans and loan guarantees to foreign buyers of U.S. goods and services. Ex-Im Bank provides working capital finance, export credit insurance, and specialized finance products to support U.S. exports of goods and services, focusing on financing for small businesses with exporting potential. Ex-Im Bank provides financing for U.S. exports of goods and services, focusing on small businesses with exporting potential. Other U.S. government agencies like USDA and SBA also offer financing for exports, while OPIC supports U.S. investment in developing economies for foreign policy objectives. The existence of multiple agencies focusing on export promotion has raised concerns about potential overlap in services. The Ex-Im Bank focuses on export promotion and provides financing for U.S. exports. There is debate about potential duplication of services among federal agencies. Ex-Im Bank's name includes \"import\" but it does not support imports. It offers short-term, medium-term, and long-term financing options, including structured finance, project finance, and renewable energy transactions with varying repayment terms. Ex-Im Bank provides financing for U.S. exports with various repayment terms. The main source of its outstanding debt is borrowings from the U.S. Treasury, used to finance medium- and long-term loans. Fees for medium- and long-term financing are guided by the OECD Arrangement. Ex-Im Bank's financing terms are guided by the OECD Arrangement, with fixed interest rates for direct loans and floating rates for loan guarantees. Risk premia are charged to cover nonpayment risk, following OECD rules. Ex-Im Bank charges commitment fees for transactions, which may exceed OECD minimum fees. The pricing structure for short-term financing products is not covered by the OECD Arrangement. Applications for transactions can be submitted by various parties and approval time varies. Transactions require approval based on multiple criteria. Ex-Im Bank considers applications based on multiple criteria and monitors performance to contain risk. It is challenging to compare Ex-Im Bank financing with private sector financing for exports due to transaction-specific terms. Demand for Ex-Im Bank financing relative to the private sector can vary depending on market forces and regulatory policies. The role of ECAs may have become more prominent in recent years due to tighter credit market conditions. The Ex-Im Bank's role has become more prominent due to tighter credit market conditions and regulatory impacts. Commercial banks' willingness to participate in transactions can vary based on factors like liquidity, risk perception, and client relationships. Ex-Im Bank's financing must ensure repayment, supplement private capital, and be competitive with foreign ECAs. It considers a transaction's U.S. economic and environmental impact. Ex-Im Bank requires 85% U.S. content for full financing, ships products on U.S. vessels, and supports specific export goals mandated by Congress. It must align with commercial opportunities and is demand-driven. Congress prohibits support for certain transactions. Ex-Im Bank must follow congressional notification process for transactions over $100 million or related to nuclear power. It also complies with OECD Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits to encourage competition. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of limitations on government-backed export financing terms, rules for ECA activity in specific sectors, and reporting requirements. It also mentions the foreign counterparts of Ex-Im Bank and the increasing global ECA activity outside of OECD membership. The Ex-Im Bank supports U.S. exports in almost 200 countries but is prohibited from extending credit to certain countries due to various reasons. The economic impact analysis provisions have been in place since 1968 and have been modified over time. The Ex-Im Bank regulations ensure that any loan or guarantee does not harm U.S. industries or employment. Loans cannot support production for export if it will harm U.S. producers. The Ex-Im Bank regulations prohibit loans or guarantees that will cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of similar commodities. Exceptions can be made if the benefits to U.S. industry outweigh the harm. Stakeholders have differing views on the economic impact policy, with some arguing it hinders competitiveness compared to foreign ECAs. The Export-Import Bank's policy on economic impact has raised concerns among stakeholders, particularly in import-sensitive industries and the U.S. airline industry. Certain changes in the Bank's charter have been made in response to these concerns, such as the prohibition for Bank support related to countervailing duties and anti-dumping orders. The Bank's financing for U.S. aircraft exports to foreign airlines has been a point of contention, with some arguing it adversely affects U.S. airlines and their employees. The Export-Import Bank's economic impact analysis of wide-body aircraft transactions has been revised to ensure a more cautious review. The Bank's environmental policy has evolved since Congress mandated the establishment of environmental procedures in 1992. The Bank now considers both beneficial and adverse environmental effects before granting financing support. The Export-Import Bank conducts environmental reviews for transactions requesting support above $25 million or based on international agreements. They aim to reduce carbon emissions through promoting renewable energy exports and have established Environmental and Social Due Diligence Procedures and Guidelines to assess projects' environmental impact. Ex-Im Bank's environmental policies focus on transparency and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions for high-carbon projects, balancing U.S. exporting interests with environmental considerations. Some U.S. exporters are concerned that these policies may be burdensome and detract from the Bank's mission to support exports and jobs. Congressional interest has been drawn to Ex-Im Bank's support for high-carbon projects, leading to revisions in their guidelines after President Obama's Climate Action Plan in 2013. The Ex-Im Bank's Supplemental Guidelines for High-Carbon Projects were revised in December 2013 to restrict support for high carbon intensity plants, except in specific cases. FY2014-FY2016 appropriations legislation further limited the use of Ex-Im Bank funds for enforcing these guidelines, based on countries' classification by the World Bank. The Ex-Im Bank's Supplemental Guidelines for High-Carbon Projects were impacted by FY2014-FY2016 appropriations legislation based on World Bank classifications. Requirements for different country categories were suspended or maintained regarding carbon capture and sequestration to reduce carbon intensity. The Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 prohibits Ex-Im Bank from discriminating based on industry for energy-related projects. This raises concerns about the bank's ability to support U.S. exports and address environmental issues. The bank's charter mandates support for companies of all sizes. The Export-Import Bank provides financing to companies of all sizes with specific mandates for U.S. small business exports. The Bank is directed to allocate at least 25% of its loan authority to finance exports by small businesses. Additionally, there are targets to increase financing for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses and women-owned businesses. The 2006 act established a Small Business Division within the Export-Import Bank, focusing on socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses and women-owned small businesses. It also mandated small business specialists throughout the agency and a Small Business Committee within its management structure. The Bank is required to promote exports related to renewable energy resources, with specific targets set in appropriations acts. The Export-Import Bank is mandated to provide a minimum of 5% of its financing for renewable energy projects. The 1997 Reauthorization Act also includes mandates for the Bank's involvement in sub-Saharan Africa. The Export-Import Bank is required to establish an advisory committee for Sub-Saharan Africa to support its commitments in the region. The committee's termination date has been extended multiple times, most recently to September 30, 2019. Ex-Im Bank's content policy limits support for medium- and long-term transactions to 85% of the value of goods and services in a U.S. supply contract. The Export-Import Bank's content policy requires a minimum of 85% U.S. content for export contracts to receive full financing. If foreign content exceeds 15%, the Bank's support is reduced proportionally. Other ECAs like Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK do not automatically reduce support for exceeding foreign content. Some U.S. businesses and lenders find Ex-Im Bank's content policy less competitive than foreign ECAs due to its lack of flexibility. Calls have been made for greater flexibility, such as lowering domestic content requirements or expanding the definition to include research and development. Labor groups are concerned about the impact on employment if domestic content requirements are reduced. Ex-Im Bank faces criticism for its restrictions on financing defense articles and services, unlike its European counterparts. It has the authority to finance \"dual-use\" exports with civilian and military applications, renewed periodically by legislation. Ex-Im Bank financed $1.67 billion in exports under its dual-use authority, including satellites to a French company and Mexico, and construction equipment to Cameroon. GAO identified weaknesses in monitoring procedures but Ex-Im Bank has since revised its guidance. The Ex-Im Bank's shipping policy requires certain products to be transported on U.S. vessels, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis by MARAD. This policy is based on PR-17 to maintain a well-trained merchant marine for national security. Supporters argue it is vital for national security and job creation, while critics point to changes in strategic requirements. The Ex-Im Bank's shipping policy requires certain products to be transported on U.S. vessels, with waivers granted on a case-by-case basis by MARAD. Critics argue that this requirement can make U.S. goods less competitive due to higher rates and delays. Over half of export credit agencies globally operate unregulated programs, making it difficult to verify their activities. The Ex-Im Bank provides information on selected ECAs' trade-related support, categorized into OECD-regulated and non-regulated activities. OECD-regulated activities include traditional ECA support directly tied to exports, while non-regulated activities fall outside the OECD Arrangement's scope. This distinction reflects a shift in government-backed export financing trends over time. Certain OECD member countries provide unregulated financing through their ECAs, such as market windows, untied lending support, and investment support. These forms of financing are not governed by the OECD Arrangement and do not follow export credit guidelines. Investment support from non-OECD members like China, Brazil, India, and Russia is a form of unregulated financing that may not comply with OECD guidelines. In 2014, OECD countries provided around $96.7 billion in government-backed export financing, with the US contributing 12.5% through Ex-Im Bank. In 2014, China, Brazil, India, and Russia provided $63.9 billion in medium- and long-term support, surpassing OECD countries. China alone accounted for $58 billion, exceeding the combined total of G-7 countries. Ex-Im Bank noted China as the largest export finance provider in 2014, with differing policies compared to other ECAs. Some stakeholders believe Ex-Im Bank's policies are more stringent, impacting its competitiveness. Ex-Im Bank must balance stakeholder interests, including businesses benefiting directly, labor, and environmental concerns. It compares its policies with foreign ECAs in an Annual Competitiveness Report to Congress. Stakeholders debate the effectiveness of the OECD Arrangement in leveling the playing field for exporters. The OECD Arrangement has saved U.S. taxpayers about $800 million annually and boosted U.S. exports by $1 billion a year. However, questions remain about its effectiveness due to ECA activity by non-OECD members. The OECD Arrangement has been beneficial for U.S. taxpayers and exports, but concerns arise from non-OECD members' ECA activity. Non-U.S. exporters offer more advantageous financing, making it challenging for U.S. exporters to compete, including with Ex-Im Bank. The U.S. has historically led efforts to regulate government-backed export credit, with ongoing negotiations within OECD for further rules on ECA activity. The President is directed to pursue negotiations with major exporting countries, including OECD members. The President is directed to initiate negotiations with major exporting countries to reduce government-backed ECA financing, with the goal of eliminating it within ten years. An International Working Group on Export Credits (IWG) was established in 2012 to work towards new international export credit guidelines. Discussions have focused on sectors like ship-building and medical equipment. The Department of the Treasury has engaged in efforts to bring China and other emerging markets into a new international export credit framework. Some criticize U.S. government efforts as insufficient in meeting statutory requirements for international export credit negotiations. The Ex-Im Bank's exposure level is the total amount of loans, guarantees, and insurance outstanding, with statutory limits set in its charter. In FY2015, the exposure was $112.0 billion, below the $140 billion cap. Other countries may be hesitant to end their export credit programs while non-OECD countries like China, Brazil, and India continue theirs. The Export-Import Bank's exposure level decreased in FY2015 to $112.0 billion, below the $140 billion cap. The Ex-Im Bank's portfolio is diversified across financial products, regions, and sectors. The Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 reduced the exposure cap to $135 billion for FY2015 through FY2019. In FY2015, Ex-Im Bank authorized 2,630 transactions totaling $12.4 billion, down from 3,746 transactions totaling $20.5 billion in FY2014. In FY2015, Ex-Im Bank's authorizations decreased to 2,630 transactions totaling $12.4 billion from 3,746 transactions totaling $20.5 billion in FY2014. The bank provides annual reports on program activity levels, financial performance, and authorizations by market and financial product type. The requirement that Ex-Im Bank transactions should supplement and encourage private capital is a longstanding statutory requirement. The 2012 Ex-Im Bank reauthorization act amended the Bank's charter to categorize each loan and guarantee based on specific purposes, such as assuming commercial or political risk, overcoming financing limitations, or competing with foreign export credit. Applicants typically indicate the purpose for seeking Ex-Im Bank support in their applications. The Ex-Im Bank requires applicants for long-term loans and guarantees over $10 million to specify the reason for seeking support. Applicants must certify the truthfulness of their application under penalty of perjury. The bank verifies certifications as needed and ensures its financing does not compete with the private sector through policies like underwriting and Board approval. The agency's annual competitiveness report summarizes the primary purposes of Ex-Im Bank transactions by dollar amount and number of transactions. In the 114th Congress, debate focused on Ex-Im Bank's support practices, competition with private sector, and potential reforms. Ex-Im Bank estimates its impact on U.S. exports and jobs, with $12.8 billion authorizations supporting $17.1 billion in exports and 109,000 jobs in FY2015. Data on export and job impact is available at state and congressional district levels. The Ex-Im Bank's impact on U.S. exports and jobs is difficult to determine due to various factors. Challenges arise in assessing the opportunity cost of Ex-Im Bank financing, as it draws resources that could be used for other purposes. The presence of Ex-Im Bank affects resource allocation in the market, making it complex to measure its exact impact on the economy in the long run. Ex-Im Bank's impact on U.S. exports and jobs is challenging to determine due to resource allocation complexities in the market. The bank uses an \"input-output\" approach to estimate the number of jobs it supports through export financing. Economic theory suggests that without Ex-Im Bank, firms may face higher costs or market failures, potentially leading to fewer jobs in the export industry but no net loss in total employment in the long run. Ex-Im Bank uses an input-output approach to estimate jobs supported through export financing, calculating 6,199 jobs per $1 billion of U.S. exports in FY2015. The methodology involves applying industry codes, determining export values, and multiplying by jobs ratios from a domestic employment requirements table. This approach has limitations and is sensitive to assumptions. The Ex-Im Bank's methodology for estimating jobs supported through export financing has limitations, such as not distinguishing between newly created and maintained jobs, treating different types of jobs equally, and not accounting for multiplier effects. Alternative methodologies may address some limitations but have drawbacks. The Government Accountability Office conducted a study on Ex-Im Bank's jobs calculation methodology in May 2013. In a 2013 study, the Government Accountability Office recommended that Ex-Im Bank improve transparency in its job calculation methodology. Ex-Im Bank, a demand-driven agency, aims to align with commercial interests to meet targets for small businesses, renewable energy, and Sub-Saharan Africa. While meeting its small business target in FY2014 and FY2015, Ex-Im Bank fell short in other years. Small business transactions constitute the majority of the Bank's transactions. Support for renewable energy exports was below the 10% directive each year from FY2008-FY2015. Ex-Im Bank's support for renewable energy exports fell below the 10% directive each year from FY2008-FY2015, possibly due to market limitations. Support for sub-Saharan Africa increased in recent years but dipped in FY2015 due to an economic slowdown. The focus on direct support for small businesses may give the impression that Ex-Im Bank supports fewer small businesses than it actually does. According to a study, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) benefit from Ex-Im Bank financing and operate as suppliers to the suppliers in the supply chain. In FY2015, Ex-Im Bank authorized $384.2 million in indirect small business support, which some stakeholders argue was not the original intention of the bank's mandate. Critics are concerned that this indirect support may reduce incentives to seek small business customers and disapprove of the amount of financing directed to large corporations. Ex-Im Bank focuses on supporting U.S. commercial interests and Administration goals, such as boosting exports worldwide. It is involved in regional policy initiatives like the \"rebalancing\" towards Asia-Pacific and the U.S. Strategy Towards Africa. Additionally, statutory mandates, like expanding support in sub-Saharan Africa, may implicate U.S. foreign policy interests and have national security implications. Ex-Im Bank's activities have national security implications, supporting dual-use exports and U.S.-flag shipping requirements. Financing commercial sales of U.S. manufacturers contributes to a skilled defense workforce and the defense supply chain. U.S. trade policy is highlighted in the 2015 National Security Strategy, aiming to support economic growth and shape the global economic order. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is part of this strategy. The 2015 Strategy highlights the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and potential Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) in bringing jobs, increasing standards of living, and promoting stability. The role of emerging economies like China, Brazil, and India presents both opportunities and challenges for the United States in achieving its trade and economic goals. The Ex-Im Bank plays a role in supporting U.S. interests through commercial diplomacy, impacting national security interests. Former national security officials advocate for its reauthorization, emphasizing the benefits of U.S. companies in emerging markets for the American economy and global stability. Critics have differing views on its impact. Critics argue that the Ex-Im Bank's support for U.S. exports in certain countries may harm U.S. interests, particularly in terms of national security. However, the actual impact on the economy and foreign policy is debatable, as the bank's support represents a small portion of total U.S. exports. Ex-Im Bank faces risks in financing U.S. exports, including repayment, concentration, and foreign currency risks. These risks are managed to ensure financing benefits high-impact sectors and does not compete with the private sector. Ex-Im Bank faces foreign currency risk, operational risk, and interest rate risk in its transactions. Risk management is based on the charter's requirement for repayment assurance and provisions for losses, with mitigation through credit underwriting and monitoring of transactions. Ex-Im Bank conducts due diligence on transactions, monitors risks, and restructures transactions with credit weaknesses to prevent defaults. Credit losses are re-estimated annually to cover future claims, with surplus funds transferred to a Treasury account if financing accounts exceed credit loss estimates. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) transfers surplus funds to a Treasury account if financing accounts exceed credit loss estimates. Reserves for loan losses totaled $4.0 billion in FY2015, representing 3.9% of total exposure. Ex-Im Bank is required to hold reserves not less than 5% of its outstanding balance. Ex-Im Bank is required to hold reserves not less than 5% of its outstanding balance to protect against future losses. The default rate is monitored quarterly and reported to Congress, with a historical rate of less than 1%. The Ex-Im Bank's default rate is being debated, with a GAO study noting that the impact of recent business on default rates is uncertain. The agency has implemented recommendations to enhance loss modeling and compare newer and older business data. Ex-Im Bank pays claims for defaulted loans it has guaranteed, taking over the loan and paying the full amount plus interest to the lending bank. Ex-Im Bank manages foreign currency risk by purchasing foreign currency to pay claims on defaulted loans, then attempts recovery on the U.S. dollar equivalent. It reports recovering 50 cents on the dollar on average since 1992. The bank can take legal action against obligors for defaulted transactions, backed by the U.S. government. Financial risk management practices are debated for balancing risk management and minimizing taxpayer losses. Ex-Im Bank manages risk to minimize taxpayer losses and meet U.S. exports and jobs mandate. The 2012 Export-Import Bank Act required monitoring of default rates and development of a plan to reduce rates above 2%. GAO reports in 2013 noted improvements in risk management practices, including credit loss modeling enhancements and recommendations for data collection and stress testing. Ex-Im Bank has implemented various risk management practices, including stress testing, monitoring default rates, forecasting exposure levels, and analyzing operational risks. Changes made in recent years include appointing a Chief Risk Officer, establishing an Enterprise Risk Committee, modernizing credit monitoring, creating a Special Assets unit, and improving underwriting criteria. Supporters argue that the Bank has adequate systems and staffing to manage risk effectively, with a strong record of risk management. Critics raise concerns about the Bank's risk management practices. Critics question Ex-Im Bank's risk governance, methodology for calculating losses, exposure growth in aircraft, and capacity for underwriting. Concerns raised about becoming too risk-averse and balance in risk management. Ex-Im Bank's Office of Inspector General (OIG) oversees audits, investigations, and inspections to promote efficiency and prevent fraud. OIG's mission is to ensure the agency's programs operate effectively and detect any mismanagement. Ex-Im Bank staff conduct risk-based due diligence to underwrite transactions, screen for eligibility, and determine credit structure. They also perform post-authorization due diligence to identify corruption and fraud, referring concerns to the OIG. New standards were implemented in 2012 to improve due diligence for lender partners. The Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) has an ethics program for employees, including mandatory training and reporting of unethical behavior. The Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015 established new oversight measures, such as an Office of Ethics and a Chief Risk Officer. Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization in 2015 followed debates in Congress over its adequacy. The debate in Congress over the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank in 2015 was influenced by concerns about fraud control and ethics practices. The Office of Inspector General highlighted common fraud schemes involving false representations and documents, leading to training for employees. Ex-Im Bank maintains its ethics program is compliant with laws and policies, emphasizing zero tolerance for waste, fraud, and abuse. Fraud allegations have fueled arguments against reauthorization or for charter reforms. The Export-Import Bank's program revenues, including fees, interest, and loan repayments, are used to fund new obligations such as administrative costs and claim payments. The Bank borrows from the Treasury for loans and has no limit on offsetting collections, but there are restrictions on how long they can be kept. Ex-Im Bank receives authority to spend its offsetting collections through the annual appropriations process. Ex-Im Bank's credit subsidy was negative in FY2015 and FY2016, so no appropriation is needed. If the subsidy calculation changes to positive, an appropriation would be required. For FY2016, appropriations legislation provided $6 million for Ex-Im Bank's Office of Inspector General (OIG) and set an upper limit of $106.3 million for the Bank's administrative expenses. Carryover funds of up to $10 million were allowed to remain available until September 30, 2019. The Federal Credit Reform Act (FCRA) requires the budgetary cost of credit programs to equal the estimated subsidy costs. This change places the cost of federal credit programs on a budgetary basis that aligns with other federal outlays. In FY2015, the FCRA methodology resulted in a budgetary impact of -$456 million for Ex-Im Bank's credit activities, reducing the budget deficit by $456 million. The negative credit subsidy for federal credit programs is calculated based on the subsidy rate multiplied by the total loan value. The estimated subsidy for FY2016 is -$473 million and for FY2017 is -$433 million. Subsidy rates are subject to re-estimates in future years, leading to new subsidy estimates that may be higher or lower. For example, the original subsidy rate for Ex-Im Bank's direct loans in FY2014 was -3.36%, but it has been re-estimated at -3.81%. Loan guarantees had an original subsidy rate of -2.13% and are currently re-estimated at -0.58%. The FCRA requires reported budgetary costs to equal estimated subsidy costs at the time credit is provided. Ex-Im Bank's activities reduced the budget deficit by $456 million in FY2015 and $473 million in FY2016. The credit subsidy impacts federal debt when the Bank borrows money from the U.S. Treasury for new loans or loan obligations. The Ex-Im Bank's borrowing from the U.S. Treasury increases the federal debt dollar-for-dollar. The size of the credit subsidy reflects the long-term cost on the U.S. Treasury. Outstanding borrowing owed to the U.S. Treasury was $22.7 billion at the end of FY2015. Repayments to the Treasury do not directly affect the Ex-Im Bank's credit subsidy for budgetary purposes. Ex-Im Bank collects revenues from customers through fees, premia, and loan payments. In FY2015, offsetting collections totaled $548.7 million after setting aside funds for credit loss reserves. $431.6 million was provided to the Treasury after covering operating expenses, calculated based on offsetting collections minus administrative expenses. The excess revenue calculated on a cash basis differs from the budgetary basis credit subsidy calculation. The Ex-Im Bank's credit subsidy calculation for budgetary purposes incorporates expected costs and profits. A negative credit subsidy results in offsetting receipts recorded in the federal budget, indicating that the Bank is projected to generate more in collections than initially borrowed. In FY2015, the negative subsidy amount was -$456 million. Proposals have been made to change the scoring methodology for federal credit programs from an FCRA approach to a fair value approach based on market rates. The Budget and Transparency Act of 2014 proposed changing the accounting method for federal credit programs to fair value approach based on market rates. This change would have increased the 10-year cost of the Ex-Im Bank from -$14 billion to +$2 billion, shifting its budgetary impact from reducing the deficit to increasing it. Separate bills in the 114th Congress also aim to implement fair value accounting for credit programs. The Ex-Im Bank's charter allows it to continue certain activities even after its statutory termination date, as authorized by Congress. This includes taking on loans or obligations before the termination date that mature after it. The Ex-Im Bank's charter allows it to continue certain activities even after its statutory termination date, as authorized by Congress. This includes assuming liabilities and issuing debt that matures after the termination date, enabling the Bank to operate without restructuring every financial instrument. These provisions ensure that debts, assets, and contractual duties entered into before the termination date remain valid and enforceable by the United States post-termination. The Ex-Im Bank may continue to perform certain functions after its termination, including administering assets and collecting obligations for an orderly liquidation. The Bank is authorized to fund its operations through FY2015, but there is little guidance on how long it can engage in these functions post-termination, which is crucial considering some obligations have repayment periods of over seven years. The Ex-Im Bank may continue functions post-termination for orderly liquidation, with little guidance on duration. Obligations with repayment periods over seven years could be settled methodically. The Ex-Im Bank may continue to administer existing loans and obligations for orderly liquidation post-termination, but new loans or guarantees cannot be issued. The impact on employees during a prolonged lapse in its charter is uncertain. The Ex-Im Bank has considerable discretion in structuring its \"orderly liquidation\" without clear guidance. Senators requested clarity on the bank's plan for liquidation, but the Chairman stated they have broad discretion and did not specify a timeline. Ex-Im Bank resumed operations after renewing its authority. Ex-Im Bank's authority lapse prevents new commitments but allows existing obligations to be serviced. Debate exists on the impact, with some fearing harm to U.S. firms while others believe it could boost private sector export financing. The expiration of Ex-Im Bank's authority raises concerns about the impact on U.S. exports and employment. Supporters argue that without the bank, U.S. companies may struggle to compete with foreign firms receiving support from their ECAs. Critics believe its expiration could lead the U.S. to set an example in eliminating government-backed ECA programs globally. Debate arose over the impact of Ex-Im Bank's authority lapse in 2015 on U.S. businesses. Some companies, like Boeing, claimed to have lost export contracts and faced layoffs due to the uncertainty. Larger firms, such as General Electric, considered moving operations overseas in response to the Bank's authorization status. General Electric (GE) was considering moving some U.S. manufacturing overseas due to the uncertainty surrounding the Ex-Im Bank's authorization status. They were seeking financing from foreign ECAs for projects, with production potentially going to GE plants in countries like Canada, China, and European countries. Smaller companies reported mixed experiences with private sector alternatives, some able to return to the private sector while others struggled to access financing and lost export contracts. Critics argue that the expiration of Ex-Im Bank hurt businesses in supply chains and caused competitive disadvantages for U.S. companies. They claim that the bank's operations result in more costs than benefits overall, with opportunity costs for exports and jobs. Additionally, critics believe that U.S. companies faced unfair disadvantages without Ex-Im Bank financing.
