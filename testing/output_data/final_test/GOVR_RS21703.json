The previous vote in January 2000 saw a coalition of center-left parties defeat the incumbent HDZ government after the death of Franjo Tudjman, who was seen as both a symbol of Croatian independence and criticized for his nationalist actions. Croatia's military operations in 1995, known as \"Flash\" and \"Storm,\" aimed to regain control over rebel-held territory and had implications for the balance of power in Bosnia. Tudjman played a role in the Dayton peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war. The 1995 Dayton peace agreement ended the war in Bosnia, with the HDZ leader criticized for nationalist policies and corruption scandals. In 2000, new leaders took office, focusing on economic reform, repairing relations with neighbors, and pursuing EU and NATO integration. Croatia joined NATO in 2000. Since 2000, Croatia has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program and Membership Action Plan. It has also applied for EU membership, joined the World Trade Organization in 2003, and experienced steady economic growth. However, high external debt, unemployment levels, and corruption scandals have persisted. The 2003 election campaign period lasted three weeks, with pre-election polls predicting a close race. The 2003 election campaign in Croatia lasted three weeks, with pre-election polls predicting a close race between the SDP-led coalition parties and the HDZ. HDZ leader Ivo Sanader emphasized the party's new moderate, pro-European outlook, economic reform plans, and support from European conservatives. Sanader also pledged cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and called for the return of ethnic Serb refugees. Prime Minister Racan presented his cabinet as the best means to guarantee Croatia's path to EU membership. The 2003 election campaign in Croatia saw the coalition parties competing separately, dividing the center-left electorate. A key issue was the case of former Croat General Ante Gotovina, indicted for war crimes. Despite international pressure, Gotovina remains popular among right-wing Croatians. Croatia's electoral system is based on proportional representation. The 2003 election in Croatia saw the HDZ winning a plurality of the vote with 66 seats in parliament, falling short of a majority. Turnout was 69% in the electoral districts but dropped to 60% due to lower turnout among expatriates and ethnic minorities. The OSCE noted improvements needed in election legislation and voting access for refugees. The 2003 election in Croatia resulted in the HDZ winning a plurality of seats, but falling short of a majority. Initial analyses suggested a shift to the right, attributed to a desire for change rather than nostalgia. The Racan government's goals for Euro-Atlantic integration remain popular, with the HDZ echoing these aims. The left suffered from internal conflicts, leading to a small margin of difference in voter support between the right and left. After the election, the HDZ reached out to other parties for coalition-building. After the 2003 election in Croatia, the HDZ sought coalition partners to form a majority government. The Peasant Party and the right-wing Party of Rights were considered, but the Peasant Party did not approve a coalition. The European Union opposed the inclusion of the HSP due to its extreme nationalism. The HDZ then turned to smaller parties like the HSLS/DC coalition and the Pensioners party for support, as well as gaining backing from national minority deputies. Prime Minister-designate Sanader announced the coalition-building efforts in December. Prime Minister Sanader announced in December that he had secured enough votes to support a minority government led by the HDZ. The government's policy priorities mainly focus on economic reforms, with the HDZ relying on cooperation agreements with parties outside of government due to a lack of sufficient coalition partners for a stable parliamentary majority. The return of the HDZ to power has raised speculation about the government's continuity or change from the previous administration, with efforts to distance the party from its legacy in the 1990s and present it as a moderate conservative movement that is pro-European and rejects radicalism and nationalism. The HDZ's transformation is evident in the government's approach to key issues, but its inability to form a majority coalition leads to instability. Concessions may be needed for support from small parties, and maintaining unity within the HDZ is a challenge. The weak standing of the HDZ could hinder the government's policy agenda, especially regarding NATO and EU membership. The HDZ-led government faces challenges in maintaining stability due to its dependence on small parties for support. Key priorities include securing Croatia's path to EU membership by 2007, with a focus on issues such as ICTY and refugee return. The government may need to make concessions on budgetary matters to accommodate the demands of other parties. Croatia applied for EU membership in 2003 and is awaiting the European Commission's opinion. Compliance with EU conditions, including cooperation with the ICTY and minority rights, is crucial for accession negotiations to begin. Cooperation with the ICTY remains a challenge for the HDZ government. The HDZ government in Croatia faces challenges with the war crimes tribunal, refugee returns, and property restitution. Former General Gotovina's case is unresolved, with new indictments expected against HDZ members. Only 100,000 out of 280,000 ethnic Serb refugees have returned. Sanader pledged to support refugee returns without specific plans, complicating issues with property rights and minority rights. In exchange for Serb party support, Sanader promised to accelerate property restitution and housing construction for returnees. The new Croatian government, led by Sanader, faces challenges in regional relations, particularly with Bosnia. The HDZ's history with Bosnia's internal affairs and ties to the Bosnian Croat community complicates efforts for an integrated Bosnian state. The current HDZ's relationship with HDZ-BiH may have complex implications, as they pledge to respect Bosnia's sovereignty while also maintaining ties with the Croat electorate. In 2003, political relations between Croatia and Serbia improved with symbolic gestures of apology for past wrongs, potentially leading to greater reconciliation and closer economic cooperation. The Racan government also sparked a dispute with Slovenia. In 2003, the Racan government sparked a dispute with neighboring Slovenia over an exclusive economic zone in the Adriatic Sea. Slovenia objected to Croatia's claim, threatening to block Croatia's EU aspirations. The previous Croatian government promoted regional ties in the security arena and proposed the U.S. - Adriatic Charter to deepen cooperation with Albania and Macedonia. The Charter was signed in May 2003. The foreign ministers of Albania, Croatia, and the United States signed the Charter in Albania on May 2, 2003. The United States supports Croatia's transition from communism and its integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions. The Bush Administration allocated over $30 million in assistance to Croatia for FY2004, but bilateral security assistance was suspended in July 2003 due to U.S. sanctions. Sanctions were imposed on countries that did not agree to exempt U.S. personnel from extradition to the International Criminal Court. The Bush Administration is seeking bilateral agreements with ICC party countries, including Croatia, for this exemption."
