The Helium Act Amendments of 1960 are being updated to reduce costs and increase operational efficiencies in the markets of producers, processors, and consumers of helium. Sales of helium by the Secretary will be at prices comparable to private industry, covering all incurred costs. An annual review of price comparability will be conducted for adjustments. The Secretary of the Interior is tasked with creating a long-term plan to cancel the Department of the Interior's debt related to the Federal helium program and improve program operations. The plan should consider minimizing impacts on Federal employment, helium purchasers, and private sector markets. The President may adopt the plan and cancel the debt if it is in the national interest. Title II focuses on improving the collection of royalties by the Minerals Management Service. The Secretary of the Interior directs the Minerals Management Service to develop an automated business information system for auditing lease history and improving royalty collection processes to reduce underpayment and increase revenue to the U.S. Treasury by $28 million by fiscal year 1999.
