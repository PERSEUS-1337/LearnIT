    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"ROV In-Depth Examination Act\" and includes a study on recreational off-highway vehicle standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is prohibited from establishing standards for recreational off-highway vehicles' performance or configuration until a study is completed. This includes not requiring manufacturers to provide performance data to buyers. However, manufacturers can still comply with voluntary standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission cannot set standards for recreational off-highway vehicles' performance or configuration until a study is done. Manufacturers are not required to provide performance data to buyers, but they can still comply with voluntary standards. The Commission will contract with the National Academy of Sciences to assess the technical validity of proposed requirements for reducing the risk of ROV rollovers. The National Academy of Sciences will conduct a study to assess the technical validity of proposed requirements for reducing the risk of ROV rollovers. The study will also consider the impact on the utility of ROVs used by the Armed Forces if the proposed requirements are adopted. The report containing the findings of the study must be completed and transmitted to the Commission within two years of the enactment of the Act. The Commission will report to Congress within five days of receiving the National Academy of Sciences' report on ROV safety. The Commission will consider the study's results for future rulemaking on ROV performance and point-of-sale information. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and \"ROV\" stands for recreational off-highway vehicle. A recreational off-highway vehicle (ROV) is a motorized vehicle designed for recreational use by one or more persons. It has a steering wheel, foot controls for throttle and brake, non-straddle seating, a maximum speed over 30 mph, a weight rating under 3,750 pounds, width less than 80 inches, and an engine displacement of 61 cubic inches or less for gasoline engines. It is identified by a 17-character code. Identification by a 17-character personal or vehicle information number does not include a prototype of a motorized, off-highway, all-terrain vehicle intended exclusively for research and development purposes unless offered for sale."
