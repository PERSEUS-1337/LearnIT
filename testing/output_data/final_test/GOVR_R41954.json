    "content": "The U.S. energy sector is large and complex, with multiple energy sources used for various demand sectors. Fossil fuels dominate, comprising 83% of total U.S. primary energy supply. Renewable energy sources provided 8% of total U.S. primary energy supply in 2009. The electric power sector is the largest energy consumer, generating 4 million gigawatthours of electricity annually, mostly from fossil fuels and nuclear sources. Renewable electricity generation in the U.S. accounted for 11% of total electric power in 2009, with most coming from conventional hydropower. Other renewable sources make up about 4% but are growing rapidly. There is a push to increase renewable energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and finite fossil fuel supplies. The United States aims to lead in renewable energy technology despite the abundance of coal and natural gas for electricity generation. Renewable energy offers advantages such as sustainable energy sources and minimal greenhouse gas emissions. However, challenges exist in implementing renewable electricity generation. This report discusses the potential for renewable electricity generation in the United States, addressing challenges and liabilities. It focuses on the amount of renewable electricity possible and the technical, operational, and economic obstacles to large-scale deployment. The report emphasizes renewable energy sources that can be sustained indefinitely and does not use terms like \"clean energy\" or \"alternative energy.\" This study focuses on various renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and ocean/hydrokinetic for electricity generation. Fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, and coal, are extracted from the earth's crust for combustion, while renewable energy sources require different technologies due to their diversity. The distinctive characteristics of renewable energy include numerous sources for electricity generation such as sun, wind, water, wave action, natural heat, and biological materials. These sources can be utilized in various ways using different technologies and materials, like concentrating solar power or photovoltaics with different materials like crystalline silicon or cadmium telluride. Renewable energy sources like sun, wind, water, wave action, natural heat, and biological materials have unique characteristics. Fossil energy sources have high energy density due to natural heating and pressure processes, while renewable sources are diffuse and require multiple technologies to concentrate. Renewable electricity generation projects vary in size, with large megawatt-scale installations feeding electricity into the grid. The largest US electric power plant is the hydroelectric Grand Coulee Dam. The largest US electric power plant is the hydroelectric Grand Coulee Dam with a capacity of 7.08 GW. Renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines are used to power individual homes. Fossil fuels are traditionally measured in units like barrels of oil, short tons of coal, or cubic feet of natural gas. The use of volume or weight for measuring fossil fuels makes it challenging to compare energy content among them and communicate renewable energy amounts needed to replace fossil fuels. Each fossil fuel has an energy content measured in British Thermal Units (Btu), while renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric have their own unique units of measure. Wind energy is measured in wind speed, solar energy in daily insolation, and hydroelectric energy in water flow rate and velocity. Experts estimate annual electricity generation potential from renewable energy sources by making assumptions about conversion equipment efficiencies and annual hours of operation. Renewable electricity generation is measured in watthours (Wh) and can be bought or sold. In 2009, the U.S. generated around 4 million gigawatthours of electricity. Renewable electricity generation potential is expressed in annual gigawatthours (GWh) for all renewable sources. Renewable electricity generation potential in the United States is calculated in annual gigawatthours (GWh) by various institutions using different processes and methodologies. Unlike traditional fossil fuel energy assessments, renewable energy estimates lack uniform methodologies and are based on unique methods and assumptions. Fossil energy resources are classified into categories like resource base, technically recoverable, economically recoverable, and reserves, while renewable energy resources should be measurable. In reality, collecting high-quality data for renewable energy sources like wind, solar, stream flow, geothermal, and biomass is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive due to physical differences in energy extraction technologies and geographic variations in performance. Estimating available renewable energy resources is challenging due to varying data and the need to compare different types of energy sources. Reliable data is collected by national programs like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, federal agencies, state agencies, federal labs, and academic institutions. Data and estimates change over time. The collection of high-quality data on renewable energy sources is an ongoing need for the nation. Comparing assessments from different sources is difficult, and a comprehensive assessment of all available renewable energy resources for the nation does not yet exist. The report provides an overview of current U.S. renewable electricity generation and discusses specific renewable electricity technologies such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, ocean-hydrokinetic, and biomass energy sources. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, ocean-hydrokinetic, and biomass provided 11% of U.S. electricity in 2009. Hydro was the largest source, while wind and biomass each contributed 1-2%. Solar and geothermal made smaller contributions. The text discusses the potential electricity generation from these sources, along with technology and cost considerations. Comparing renewable electricity generation estimates is challenging. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of estimating renewable electricity generation potential in the U.S. It provides a summary of the research and analysis performed, including current and projected generation potential, cost estimates, and key challenges for each energy source. The approach used compares renewable generation potential to the 2009 total U.S. net generation. The reader is advised that the presented cost estimates only reflect electricity costs associated with capacity. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of estimating renewable electricity generation potential in the U.S. It highlights the research and analysis indicating the potential for renewable energy sources to meet a significant portion of U.S. electric power needs. However, technical, operational, economic, and practical challenges may limit their contribution. Despite vast potential, projections suggest renewables will only contribute 14-15% of total U.S. electricity generation by 2035. The quality of resources estimates varies for each renewable technology. The quality of resources estimates for renewable technologies may change as new data is collected. Wind energy resource estimates are highly dependent on assumptions like turbine height and capacity factor, with winds stronger at greater heights. Onshore and offshore wind energy resources in the U.S. have different generation potentials. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates onshore and offshore wind electricity generation potential in the U.S. Onshore wind potential ranges from 22.5 to 46.9 million gigawatthours annually, with the largest resources in the middle of the country. Offshore wind potential ranges from 10 to 14.5 million GWh annually, but there is uncertainty in characterizing the offshore wind resource. Additional work may be needed to assess U.S. offshore wind potential accurately. The U.S. offshore wind potential is being more accurately assessed. Onshore wind energy technology is commercially available, with General Electric and Siemens as top manufacturers of wind turbines in 2010. Wind turbines typically have a capacity between 1 to 3 megawatts, with a trend towards larger sizes for greater efficiency. Offshore wind technology faces challenges in corrosive marine environments and varying water depths. The Department of Energy operates a Wind Power Program for research and development. The Wind Power Program focuses on wind research and development, discussing factors affecting the cost of wind-generated electricity. The EIA estimates onshore wind electricity costs between $82-$115 per MWh and offshore electricity costs between $187-$349 per MWh. Geographic and environmental factors influence solar radiation levels in the U.S. Solar resources in the U.S. are influenced by factors like latitude, time of day, season, landscape, and weather. The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and NREL/SUNYA provide authoritative solar resource data. Quantifying solar potential is complex due to different energy conversion methods (CSP and PV), radiation components, system configurations, and technology variations. CSP resources vary across the country. Solar resources in the U.S. are influenced by factors like latitude, time of day, season, landscape, and weather. The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and NREL/SUNYA provide authoritative solar resource data. CSP resources vary throughout the country, with the highest quality resource located in the southwestern United States. NREL and Sandia National Laboratories estimate that U.S. CSP electricity generation potential is approximately 16.3 million GWh. PV resources also vary across the country, with the highest quality resources in the southwestern United States. PV systems offer flexibility in project size and can be used for residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications. As of July 2011, estimates of the solar photovoltaic resource in terms of annual GWh were not available. NREL researchers analyzed land-use requirements for generating 100% of U.S. electricity and estimated that 0.6% of total U.S. land area would be needed to satisfy current demand load using a \"base system configuration.\" Solar PV could theoretically generate 10 times the amount of current U.S. demand, but factors like cost and power system integration may limit this potential. The NREL analysis suggests that U.S. solar PV generation potential is around 40 million GWh annually. Residential and commercial rooftop PV systems could generate approximately 819,000 GWh per year. Parabolic trough technology dominates U.S. CSP capacity, while crystalline silicon is the most common PV technology. Research and development in CSP and PV markets focus on improving efficiencies and reducing costs. The cost of solar electricity is a challenge for CSP and PV technologies. The DOE's SunShot program aims to reduce PV electricity generation costs to $60 per MWh. Geothermal energy is abundant in the western United States, Alaska, and Hawaii, with potential in all states. Geothermal electricity generation potential exists in the western United States, Alaska, and Hawaii, with the use of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology. USGS, NREL, and MIT have published estimates for U.S. geothermal electricity generation, with differences in estimates due to factors like geographic scope. Geothermal electricity generation potential in the U.S. is estimated by USGS, NREL, and MIT, with varying results based on factors like geographic scope and resource depths. Different technologies are used for generating electricity from conventional hydrothermal geothermal resources. As of April 2011, U.S. geothermal installed capacity was 3,102 MW, representing about 0.3% of total U.S. electricity capacity. In 2009, 15,009 GWh of electricity was generated from geothermal energy sources, with the majority of capacity located in California. Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology could enable large-scale geothermal electricity generation, but it is not yet commercially available. Factors influencing geothermal electricity costs include resource quality, depth, drilling, and equipment costs. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for conventional geothermal electricity ranges from $92/MWh to $116/MWh. NREL estimated geothermal electricity LCOE between $50/MWh and $1,200/MWh. EGS resource potential is smaller than total potential. Hydropower is the largest renewable electricity source in the US, generating 257,000 GWh in 2010. INL reports have assessed new hydropower capacity since 1998. The potential for new hydropower generation capacity has been estimated in various reports over the years, showing an increase from 30 GW in 1998 to 60 GW in 2006. Different studies have provided varying estimates due to differences in hydropower categories considered. After consolidating the data, CRS calculated an additional potential of around 65 gigawatts, equivalent to 284,700 GWh of electricity annually. Recent estimates from ORNL suggest that non-powered dams could add up to 12.6 gigawatts to the total hydropower resource assessment. The total hydropower resource assessment could increase by up to 12.6 gigawatts in the United States. Efforts are being made to enhance the performance and environmental impact of conventional hydropower technologies. Hydroelectricity is considered a low-cost source of renewable electricity, with new plants estimated to have a levelized cost of electricity ranging from $59/MWh to $121/MWh. Additional research may be needed for low-head and low-power hydroelectricity technology used in constructed waterways. Ocean energy resources, including tidal, wave, current, and thermal, vary in availability and technology for electricity generation. Limited assessments exist, with EPRI providing estimates for wave and tidal energy in 2006. DOE has funded assessments not yet available. Table 4 summarizes resource estimates for ocean energy categories, with a focus on U.S. wave energy potential shown in Figure 10. The majority of wave energy potential is off the coasts of Alaska, Hawaii, and west coast states. Hydrokinetic energy, extracted from river flows, has an estimated potential of 12.5 GW according to a DOE-funded study by New York University. Electricity generation from hydrokinetic resources could range from 32,850 GWh to 54,750 GWh, making ocean and hydrokinetic technologies emerging in the commercial sector. Emerging ocean and hydrokinetic technologies are being developed and demonstrated worldwide, with around 30 projects in the United States. Estimating the cost of energy production is challenging due to the early developmental status of these technologies. Biomass electricity generation potential is also difficult to estimate accurately due to the various competing uses of biomass materials. Biomass electricity generation potential in the U.S. is highly dependent on the availability of biomass material and its dedicated use. In 2009, approximately 54,493 GWh of electricity was generated from biomass, representing about 1.2% of total U.S. net electricity generation. Current biomass consumption for electricity generation is around 25% to 35%, with the potential to produce about 1.3 billion tons of biomass annually according to DOE analysis. The potential to produce 1.3 billion tons of biomass annually could generate a significant amount of electricity. Biomass electricity generation faces challenges due to the variability in feedstock quality and characteristics. There are approximately 80 operating biomass electricity generation facilities in the United States. Biomass electricity generation equipment must address variability in feedstock quality, alkali metal species, and biomass accumulation and transportation. The levelized cost of energy for biomass electricity ranges from $99.50 to $133.40 per MWh. Biomass feedstock quality is a key cost driver impacting the levelized cost of energy. Comparing costs for conventional and renewable electricity generation shows advantages and disadvantages of each technology. The report discusses challenges in the development and deployment of renewable electricity generation technologies, with a focus on the cost of generating electricity from renewable sources. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) is a common metric used to measure the financial cost of electricity production. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) is used to compare energy generation costs of different sources like coal, natural gas, wind, and solar. However, caution is needed as there is no standardized calculation method, assumptions can skew results, and LCOE may not reflect the varying value of electricity generation throughout the day. LCOE calculations vary between organizations due to different methodologies and assumptions used. Two common methods include total life cycle costs and energy production, or a cash flow model based on equity rates of return. The latter method considers project finance constraints like debt service coverage ratios and cash reserves. The LCOE estimates can vary due to different assumptions such as capital costs, government incentives, and technology performance degradation. Organizations use different assumptions leading to variations in LCOE estimates. The EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2011 was used to compare LCOE estimates for renewable energy resources. The EIA provides LCOE estimates for renewable energy resources, reflecting projected capacity additions. Costs typically increase as new capacity is installed, with the lowest-cost capacity added first. Geothermal supply curve estimates show potential LCOE of up to $1,000 per MWh depending on capacity. Understanding assumptions for projecting future electricity costs is crucial. The current low cost of fossil fuel energy may not include external impacts such as health problems, environmental damage, and national security costs. Quantifying these social costs can be complex and assumptions used for estimating them can greatly affect calculations. Some groups attempt to value social costs of fossil energy for comparison with renewable resources. An Interagency Working Group estimates the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis. Mitigating social costs may shift to producers or consumers. Renewable energy developers focus on cost-effective technologies for commercial viability. Research continues to improve materials and lower manufacturing costs for renewable technologies. Improvements in renewable technologies aim to reduce manufacturing and electricity production costs to increase competitiveness. Connecting renewable electricity to the grid can pose technical challenges, especially with high penetration of variable sources like solar and wind. Constant monitoring and control are necessary for power system reliability, with a need to balance supply and demand. Existing power systems have infrastructure to manage variability, according to a recent study by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The existing power infrastructure can manage some variability in renewable energy sources, with biomass, geothermal, and certain hydropower sources providing consistent electricity generation. However, integrating variable sources like wind and solar may pose operational challenges at high penetration levels. DOE funded studies to evaluate these challenges, such as the Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study. The Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study and the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study assessed the impacts of integrating wind and solar electricity generation at different penetration levels. Both studies concluded that managing variable renewable electricity is feasible but may require significant transmission investment, reserve capacity, and power system operation modifications. Wind and solar power are intermittent, unlike geothermal, biomass, and some hydropower sources that can provide continuous energy. The intermittent and variable nature of renewable energy sources like wind and solar contrasts with continuous electricity production from fossil and nuclear power plants. Advanced storage technologies are being developed to overcome the intermittency and variability of renewable energy, such as batteries, compressed-air storage, hydrogen generation, and fuel cells. The curr_chunk discusses the study of various storage technologies for renewable energy, including batteries, compressed-air storage, hydrogen generation, and fuel cells. It emphasizes the need for reliable storage to maximize the potential of renewable technologies. The chunk also mentions the limitation of land availability for energy development and the large footprint required by some renewable energy technologies. The land-use intensity of energy production technologies varies significantly depending on assumptions and geography. There is no standard methodology for estimating land use, with renewable sources like wind turbines occupying only a small portion of land while energy crops fully occupy their area. Solar plants require less land in regions with intense sunlight. Solar plants require less land in regions with intense sunlight, and the technologies with the greatest land-use intensity for electric energy production are biomass, wind, hydropower, and solar. Comparing land-use intensities between renewable energy and fossil fuel technologies is challenging due to factors like power plant footprint, mining areas, transportation infrastructure, and ecosystem impact. Renewable energy technologies like biomass, wind, hydropower, and solar photovoltaic have higher land-use intensities compared to natural gas, coal, geothermal, and nuclear power. As demand for renewable energy grows, there will be a need to integrate energy policy with land-use policy. While distributed generation technologies like rooftop solar can help mitigate land-use issues, utility-scale installations will still be necessary. Geographic factors play a role in optimizing the use of renewable energy, with wind energy being best in coastal areas and the Midwest, solar energy in the southwestern US, and hydroelectric power historically performing well. Large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies in the relatively cloudless southwestern United States may require new electricity transmission infrastructure to connect energy supply regions to demand centers in large cities. The NREL Eastern Interconnection Report suggests that significant expansion of transmission infrastructure would be needed for feasible wind generation of 20% to 30%. The new infrastructure must be sized to accommodate the maximum rate of electricity flow. Renewable energy sources offer virtually infinite energy supply, but converting them into usable electricity requires significant materials like steel, fiberglass, silicon, cadmium, and others. The demand for these materials may impact their prices, affecting the cost of renewable electricity generation. Renewable electricity generation, including wind turbines and solar panels, can have environmental impacts such as land use, habitat disturbance, bird mortality, noise, and water usage. Geothermal power plants may need to address water use, land subsidence, and seismicity issues. Hydropower and ocean-hydrokinetic systems can lead to water quality degradation, ecosystem disruption, and animal mortality. Biomass projects emit pollutants like nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power can have environmental impacts such as land use changes and emissions like nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. Policy makers need to consider these impacts when increasing electricity production from renewable sources. Infrastructure investments are also necessary for all forms of energy production, with specialized infrastructure needed for some renewable sources like offshore wind energy. According to DOE, specialized infrastructure like vessels and grid interconnections are needed for offshore wind development in the U.S. Private and public investments are being made in renewable energy technologies, with funding from ARPA-E and DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Bridging the gap between R&D and commercialization may require significant funding. Commercializing new technologies often requires significant funding, known as the \"valley of death.\" Market development activities like technology validation and cost quantification are necessary for private equity and bank financing. Federal policies, such as tax credits and incentives, support renewable electricity generation projects. Federal policies, including tax credits and incentives, support renewable electricity generation projects. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act introduced new policies like the Section 1603 cash grant option and the Section 1705 Loan Guarantee Program. State-level policies, such as renewable portfolio standards, also drive market demand for renewable electricity. There is interest in establishing a federal renewable or clean energy standard to further boost demand. However, these federal policies typically have a defined expiration date, leading to concerns in the industry. The renewable electricity industry faces market uncertainty and growth challenges due to sudden expiration of federal policies. Policy makers aim to stimulate renewable electricity growth while reducing dependency on federal subsidies. Energy efficiency and conservation are also important considerations. Energy efficiency and demand curtailment offer significant opportunities for reducing energy resources. By addressing both supply and demand sides, the US can extend its energy consumption. These strategies may not meet future energy demands alone but can reduce the need for new energy. Benefits include lower costs, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and less need for supply expansion. Various sectors are seeking more efficient energy use, with indicators measuring efficiency at individual device levels. The United States has seen a steady drop in energy intensity over the years, despite increasing energy consumption. Efforts to promote energy efficiency and conservation are proving successful, with potential savings of $170 billion per year by 2030 through improvements in building energy efficiency. Numerous opportunities exist for further efficiency enhancements. Liquid biofuels, such as fuel ethanol and biodiesel, are renewable fuels derived from plant materials. They are primarily used as blending agents with gasoline and diesel but can potentially be used in their pure form with modifications to engine fuel systems. Unlike other biomass sources, liquid biofuels are mainly used for transportation and are important for vehicles like aircraft and heavy trucks that cannot easily switch to other propulsion technologies. In 2009, the United States consumed 99 million gallons of liquid biofuels. In 2009, the United States consumed 99 million gallons of fuel ethanol as E85 and 10.7 billion gallons as E15 in gasoline, along with 316 million gallons of biodiesel. For more information on biofuels, refer to CRS reports on Agriculture-Based Biofuels, Cellulosic Biofuels, Meeting the Renewable Fuel Standard, Biofuels Incentives, and the Renewable Fuel Standard. The United States uses a significant amount of energy daily, monthly, and annually, dominated by coal, natural gas, and nuclear sources. Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy on a large scale is a formidable task to meet the increasing energy demand of the U.S. economy. Electricity generation in the United States is mainly from coal, natural gas, and nuclear sources, with only 8% of total energy coming from renewables, mostly for electricity. To displace fossil fuels with renewable energy, there needs to be significant growth in renewable technology deployment. While biofuels can replace petroleum consumption, most renewable technologies focus on electricity generation. This would only displace fossil fuels used for electricity, as the U.S. relies heavily on petroleum for transportation. The United States relies heavily on petroleum for transportation, with renewable electricity potentially requiring increased electrification of the transportation system. Adoption of renewable energy sources for electricity generation could reduce coal demand but would not impact energy imports as most coal is domestically produced. China and other nations have been successful in developing renewable energy technologies. The United States leads in renewable energy capacity and deployment, with impressive installations in non-hydropower, biomass, and geothermal power. While China leads in total renewable electricity generation including hydropower, the US excels in operational wind power capacity and electricity generation from non-hydro renewable sources. The United States has a large electricity generation capacity, but renewable energy only makes up 11% of total electricity generation. Policy makers are considering whether to increase the use of renewable energy for electricity production and what barriers need to be addressed by federal policy. Future trends in renewable electricity will depend on technology costs, fossil fuel costs, and government incentives. In the absence of subsidies and consideration of external costs, some renewable electricity technologies are not commercially viable. EIA projections for wind and solar growth rely on renewable standards and subsidies. Without carbon pricing, the US may continue to rely on low-cost fossil fuel electricity. Policy makers are debating the growth of renewable electricity. Policy makers may prioritize renewable electricity growth due to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, finite fossil fuel supplies, and global leadership in renewable energy technology. Cost competitiveness can be improved through technology advancements or revised fuel costs, but incentives may be necessary for short-term viability. If renewable electricity costs become competitive with fossil fuels, issues like intermittency, land use, transmission, and environmental impacts will need to be addressed by officials at all levels of government. Renewable electricity generation capacity in the U.S. doubled from 2006 to 2010, reaching 55 GW. In 2010, renewables provided 11% of total electricity generation, with a projected increase to 14-15% by 2035. Despite potential contributions to U.S. electricity demand, challenges and barriers exist for large-scale deployment. Policymakers need to address issues like intermittency, land use, transmission, and environmental impacts as renewable energy technologies advance. As Congress evaluates energy policy objectives, they may consider the benefits and risks of large-scale deployment of renewable electricity generation, including emissions reduction and job creation, as well as potential electricity cost increases and reliability issues."
