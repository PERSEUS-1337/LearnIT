The \"Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010\" offers a credit against taxes for increased employment, with higher credits for states with high unemployment rates. The \"Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010\" provides tax credits for increased employment, with higher credits for states with high unemployment rates. The credits are based on a percentage of increased high unemployment state wages for taxable years 2010 and 2011. Definitions include \"increased high unemployment state wages\" and \"qualified employee.\" The term 'employee' in the Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 refers to an employee whose services are mostly within the state of employment and whose principal residence is in that state. The Act also defines a 'high unemployment state' as a state with a high unemployment rate. The Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 sets a maximum credit of $500,000 for employers in high unemployment states with an unemployment rate of at least 8.5 percent. Special rules apply for employers exempt from income tax or with insufficient income tax liability. The Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 provides a reduction in payroll taxes for employers exempt from tax under section 501(a) or those estimating their tax liability will not exceed the credit allowable under subsection (a) for the year. The Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 offers a reduction in payroll taxes for qualifying employers. Payroll taxes include amounts deducted for wage withholding, FICA employee taxes, and FICA employer taxes. The reduction amount is considered paid to the Secretary on the due date. Reconciliation is required for payroll periods with reductions. The Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 offers reductions in payroll taxes for qualifying employers. If reductions are made for one or more payroll periods in a taxable year, the tax imposed for that year will increase by the total reduction amount. This increase in tax is not considered when calculating other tax credits, except for the credit under subsection (a). Minimum preceding year wages must be at least 50 percent of the specified amounts for subsection (a). The Tax Credits for Jobs Now Act of 2010 offers reductions in payroll taxes for qualifying employers. The total credit allowed for any taxable year cannot exceed the amount based on wages without any dollar limitation. Wages must be at least 103 percent of the required amount under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (a)(2)(B). The term 'wages' is defined as per section 3306(b), except for railway and agricultural labor. The term 'inflation-adjusted wages' under section 3306(b) refers to aggregate wages paid in 2010 adjusted for inflation. Special rules apply for railway and agricultural labor, with adjustments for acquisitions made after December 31, 2008. After December 31, 2008, if an employer acquires a major portion of a trade or business from another person, the wages deemed paid by the employer before the acquisition will be increased by the wages paid by the predecessor for the acquired business. This rule also applies to dispositions made after December 31, 2008. After December 31, 2008, if an employer disposes of a major portion of a trade or business, the amount of wages deemed paid by the employer before the disposition will be decreased by the wages attributable to the disposed trade or business. The text discusses how a change in status from self-employed to an employee can impact the determination of the credit allowable for a taxable year. If an individual has net earnings from self-employment in one year and becomes an employee in the following year, the employer's aggregate wages for the initial year will be increased by a certain amount of the individual's net earnings from self-employment. The text outlines rules for determining the credit allowable for a taxable year, including limitations based on median household income and application of specific rules related to remuneration, related individuals, successor employers, and special rules for short taxable years. The text outlines rules for determining the credit allowable for a taxable year, including limitations based on median household income and specific rules related to remuneration, related individuals, successor employers, and special rules for short taxable years. Tax-exempt employers are treated as taxpayers for this purpose. Amendments are made to ensure no double benefit is received, and conforming amendments are made to related sections of the tax code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009."
