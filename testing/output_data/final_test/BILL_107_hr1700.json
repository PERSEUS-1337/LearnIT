Congress finds that approximately 828 million people are chronically undernourished worldwide, with the majority living in low-income countries. Additionally, around 300 million of the world's hungry are children, with 193 million experiencing stunted growth, a key indicator of under-nutrition. UNICEF emphasizes the importance of good nutrition and stimulation for optimal neural development in children. Hunger is often linked to poverty and lack of empowerment in developing countries, where governments struggle with low revenues, high debt burdens, and inadequate funding for health and education. Poor children face barriers to receiving adequate education, with over 130 million primary-school-age children affected according to UNICEF. In developing countries, over 130 million primary-school-age children, with 60% being girls, do not attend school. UNESCO reported that around 250 million children aged five to fourteen are laborers, with half working full time. Lack of education and poor literacy hinder children's growth potential, while education improves cognitive skills, productivity, and protects children from labor exploitation. Increased literacy rates are crucial for economic development, with countries achieving an 80% literacy rate among girls and women experiencing decreased birth rates. Food aid, Mother-child health programs, and Early childhood development programs have lasting benefits for children in developing countries. These programs provide supplemental food, health care, and training in basic skills to pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children under the age of six. They aim to reduce malnutrition, promote proper growth, and educate mothers on basic sanitation and disease prevention. Food for Education programs in poor countries reduce hunger and improve educational attendance and performance by providing school meals or take-home rations. These international food aid programs are similar to programs in the United States like WIC, Head Start, and school meal programs. United States international food assistance has helped alleviate hunger and is a key part of foreign policy. American farmers have been crucial in providing food aid to countries in need through programs like the Food for Peace program and the Food for Progress Act. In fiscal year 2000, 7,900,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities worth $1,500,000,000 were approved for food aid to 91 countries. The Food for Progress Program, established in 1949 under Public Law 480, is implemented by various organizations and governments. American farmers benefit by selling commodities for international development, improving living standards in developing countries and expanding markets for agricultural products. Successful bipartisan programs include school lunch, school breakfast, and WIC for children in the United States. America has made progress in reducing hunger among children through school lunch, school breakfast, and WIC programs. Senators McGovern and Dole praised the government's efforts at the National Nutrition Summit in 2000. The G-8 Summit in Okinawa endorsed a proposal to reduce hunger globally. The Global Food for Education Initiative, endorsed by the G-8 Summit, launched a $300 million pilot program to provide meals and assistance to 9 million needy children in 38 countries. Food commodities will be purchased from American farmers and distributed in fiscal year 2001. In fiscal year 2001, the Global Food for Education Initiative will distribute $300 million through 49 projects by US-based organizations and the UN World Food Program. Senators urge Congress to make this program permanent and engage the international community to end child hunger in the next three decades. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide commodities and assistance for school feeding programs, maternal and child nutrition programs. Eligible commodities and cost items are specified. The Commodity Credit Corporation will purchase agricultural commodities for distribution under the Act if its stocks are insufficient. The Secretary can approve the use of funds for transportation and storage costs to achieve the Act's purposes. The Commodity Credit Corporation can use funds to pay for activities in host countries by nonprofit organizations to enhance effectiveness. Funds can also cover administrative expenses for private organizations implementing activities under the Act. The term \"agricultural commodities\" includes any agricultural commodity. The term \"commodities\" refers to any agricultural commodity or its products produced in the United States. The Secretary may provide assistance to various organizations as deemed appropriate under this Act. The Secretary will ensure that rules for this Act include provisions for submitting proposals for commodities and assistance, eligibility criteria for recipients, streamlined procedures for proposal review, monitoring of assistance use, and allowing for the sale of commodities. The Act allows eligible organizations to sell commodities to raise funds for improving food security for women and children. The Secretary will prioritize funding based on the ability of recipients to identify and address the needs of malnourished or under-nourished mothers, young children, and school-age children. The Act prioritizes funding for programs targeting low-income areas with low school enrollment, especially for girls, and coordinates feeding and nutrition programs for mothers and young children. It involves indigenous communities in program development, builds local capacity, and focuses on self-sufficiency and program longevity. The Food and Nutrition Service will provide technical advice on program establishment and implementation in recipient countries. The President is urged to engage international food aid coordinating mechanisms for multilateral commitments. Private sector involvement is encouraged, and funding levels will be addressed. SEC. 10. FUNDING LEVELS. The Commodity Credit Corporation will allocate funds for programs under this Act, starting with $300 million in fiscal 2002 and increasing to $750 million in each succeeding fiscal year for certain programs. SEC. 11. COOPERATION WITH OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. The Secretary may approve the use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds to cover administrative expenses of other government agencies assisting in the Act's implementation. SEC. 12. REQUIREMENT TO SAFEGUARD LOCAL PRODUCTION AND USUAL MARKETING. The requirement of section 403(a) of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 shall apply to the availability of commodities under this Act."
