    "content": "This report by Pennsylvania State University, with contributions from Seth Blumsack and Thomas Murphy, was part of a multiyear project to examine U.S. energy policy. The report, funded by the Joyce Foundation, focuses on shale gas resources and the expectation of increased resource abundance. The United States is experiencing resource abundance in natural gas supply, leading to potential expansion in the near future. The country may become a net LNG exporter by 2016 and an overall gas exporting country by 2018. Despite low prices benefiting consumers, there are technical and market impacts that require further research and analysis. Recent changes in thermal coal use in the United States, impacted by switching to natural gas, are substantial and expected to continue declining due to market influences and policies. Coal-to-gas switching for U.S. power generation doubled in 2012, with gas use for power generation also doubling. Despite rising coal exports to Asia and Europe, there has been a negative impact on the mining sector in certain U.S. regions, leading to underutilized rail capacity now being used to transport crude oil from shale deposits. Rail capacity previously underutilized due to declining coal use is now being used to transport crude oil from shale deposits in the western US to eastern refineries. This shift is driven by increased demand for domestic West Texas Intermediate (WTI) priced crude. The addition of numerous oil and gas companies entering shale gas developments has advanced research on extraction technologies and may lead to other countries developing shale formations. The shift in energy sourcing and utilization is leading to increased research on shale gas extraction technologies. Government agencies are pursuing multiagency initiatives, but budget constraints may limit their activities. North America is expected to make significant gains in energy independence through reduced energy use and increased supply. Technologies for developing natural gas from shale are advancing rapidly. The advancement of natural gas extraction from shale, particularly in the Marcellus Shale region, has seen significant growth. The U.S. Geological Survey has revised estimates upwards to 84 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. Pennsylvania alone has drilled over 6,000 wells into the Marcellus, producing over 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2012. Pennsylvania and West Virginia have seen a significant increase in natural gas production from shale wells. Pennsylvania produced over 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2012, a substantial rise from previous years. This increase is important due to the state's proximity to major U.S. natural gas markets in the Northeast. Pipeline capacity in the Northeast U.S. needs expansion to meet demands from energy companies drilling natural gas wells in Pennsylvania. Approximately 50% of wells in the state lack access to pipelines for reaching commercial markets, especially in northeastern Pennsylvania. This bottleneck is causing lower basis prices at citygate locations near large eastern cities. In western Pennsylvania, where natural gas contains natural gas liquids, there is also a need for more fractionation facilities. Industry estimates suggest a nationwide investment of $10 billion per year for the next decade is needed to develop sufficient capacity in gathering and transmission pipelines, along with compression facilities. The Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) was at 70% capacity in 2012 due to a surplus of Marcellus gas from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Legacy premium gas pricing in the Northeast U.S. markets is expected to shift towards western markets within five years. Gas pricing in northeastern U.S. markets is expected to shift to western markets within five years due to increasing demand. Eastern shales are predicted to expand net surpluses in the region. The trans-Canadian pipeline capacity for west-to-east flow has declined, with eastern United States shale gas moving into eastern Canada. Canadian gas production is decreasing, leading to a drop in natural gas imports from Canada. Gas flow to Mexico is increasing, surpassing 1.8 bcf/d in 2013. Traditional market dynamics in the United States between supply and demand are changing. The changing dynamics of natural gas supply and demand in the United States are affecting pricing. Market distortions are emerging due to increased production outside the Gulf area and the volume of gas passing through the Henry Hub in Erath, LA. This is reflected in regional price spreads, such as the one between TCO Appalachia and Henry Hub, which is influenced by Marcellus production growth. The spread between these points in spot markets is shifting, with TCO Appalachia historically priced $0.25 per million British thermal units above Henry Hub. The spread between TCO Appalachia and Henry Hub in spot markets reflects parity now, with TCO Appalachia priced less than Henry Hub in forward markets. Market participants assess the future difference between southwest Pennsylvania and Gulf Coast natural gas markets, impacting short- and mid-term prices. Companies are selecting regions with the lowest-cost wells to develop, influenced by shale gas production and drilling successes. Break-even prices vary in different shale-gas regions based on geography and hydrocarbon composition. The composition of produced hydrocarbons, such as natural gas liquids, can significantly reduce break-even prices for gas deposits. This influences companies to drill more wells, promote natural gas use, and seek higher-priced markets. Shale wells have a short payback time, typically within two years. Exports of natural gas from the United States have a short payback time, usually within two years, depending on production rates and market prices. Gas sold on the global market can fetch prices five to seven times higher than at Henry Hub, creating a potential export opportunity for U.S. producers. As of April 2014, 43 firms had applied to the U.S. Department of Energy to develop export terminals for offshore gas sales. Developing export terminals in the United States for LNG sales to non-free trade countries has raised concerns about potential price impacts and four primary issues. One of these issues is the impact on industrial utilization of natural gas, with concerns about rising prices and the effect on manufacturing trends towards re-shoring. Recent investments by large petrochemical companies in the United States, particularly in the Gulf Coast region, indicate a growing trend towards enhancing capacity. Construction of new petrochemical plants is expected to surpass $80 billion in the next five years. Similar investments are also being made in high energy-use industries like paper, glass, ammonia fertilizer, aluminum, steel, and other primary metals production. The shift towards gas utilities over coal for electrical generation is evident, with shorter permitting periods for new gas-fired power plants. This transition is driven by the availability of more predictable energy supplies and favorable pricing conditions in the United States. The demand for natural gas is increasing due to factors such as sourcing from shale resources, lower construction costs for new gas units, and less price volatility compared to coal. Gas-fired capacity has been constrained by high and volatile prices relative to coal, which offers predictable pricing and a well-established transportation infrastructure. The combination of re-shoring and growing gas-fired power generation capacity can utilize substantial quantities of shale gas hitting the market. The demand for natural gas is increasing due to factors such as sourcing from shale resources and lower construction costs for new gas units. Gas-fired capacity, along with power generation, can use substantial quantities of natural gas and would be sensitive to factors affecting energy pricing. Studies commissioned by the DOE on natural gas exports show potential price impacts and positive economic benefits. Geopolitical factors have spurred other nations to explore shale gas extraction due to its commercial value. The commercial value of shale geology has prompted many nations to pursue natural gas development. Countries like Argentina, China, Britain, South Africa, and Poland are actively working on matching their regulatory expertise and infrastructure to tap into shale gas reserves. However, challenges such as unexplored geology, internal policies, infrastructure constraints, and technology limitations are slowing down the pace of development. Geopolitical implications are also being considered as the United States and other countries explore shale gas extraction. The commercial value of shale geology has led to increased natural gas development in the United States and abroad. Currently, over one-third of the U.S. total natural gas comes from shale, with expectations to reach nearly 50% by 2035. This oversupply situation is causing excess LNG cargos originally intended for the U.S. market to be pushed back onto the global market. Strong demand for LNG is seen from key U.S. allies like Japan, South Korea, and Europe, with potential U.S. LNG exports likely going to these countries. Efforts to reduce reliance on nuclear power and evolving climate policies are expected to further drive demand for LNG. Disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine over gas supply have caused interruptions in Europe during winter. Efforts to diversify supply are underway due to the standoff between Russia and Ukraine. U.S. LNG exports to the EU are affected by shale development, renewable energy growth, and the Eurozone economic crisis. The current situation involves demand erosion, permitting of LNG import facilities in EU countries, potential LNG exports from the US to Europe, and Gazprom facing investigation for business practice irregularities. This has led to pricing pressure on natural gas contracts being negotiated between European governments and Gazprom. Poland aims to increase national production through shale gas exploration before finalizing a new contract with Gazprom in 2020. In the US, efforts are being made to enhance global energy security by developing natural gas resources from shale in countries less dependent on Russia. The State Department is advocating for gas transmission lines to increase supplier diversity in countries where it has influence. The U.S. trade balance benefitted from the rise in natural gas production, reducing the need for imports. Opposition to gas exports is based on environmental concerns. The development of LNG export terminals raises environmental concerns due to potential construction in ecologically sensitive coastal areas and the promotion of shale resources, contradicting efforts to reduce reliance on fossil energy. Alternative approaches like offshore floating terminals could lessen land-based impacts. Groups opposing new LNG applications in the US are pushing for upstream environmental impact assessments during site permitting. Public concerns about shale gas development and LNG exports include worries about risks, lack of benefits, and adverse effects on communities. Elected officials are hearing constituents' complaints about increased truck traffic and limited benefits from energy development. Interest in domestic use of natural gas sourced from shale is increasing, especially in the northeastern United States. Gas-fired residential heating is on the rise, with projects in New York City aiming to save money and reduce heavy fuel oil use. The transition from fuel oil to gas has economic and environmental benefits, including reduced air emissions. The transition from fuel oil to natural gas for domestic home use is driven by economic and environmental benefits, including reduced air emissions. Utility companies are expanding distribution lines to accommodate the increased supply and favorable pricing of natural gas in the mid-term. This involves constructing new lines and modernizing existing infrastructure, with costs reaching up to $1 million per mile in populated areas. The locations of shale gas deposits are causing a reconfiguration of infrastructure, leading to increased awareness at state and local government levels. The growing demand for natural gas is leading to new efforts to assess the cost and feasibility of new distribution infrastructure in many regions of the United States to enhance economic development. Industries are seeking to source shale gas directly to eliminate transmission costs, and there is an expected displacement of traditional liquid fuels for transportation by natural gas. The transportation industry is shifting towards using natural gas as a fuel source, with vehicles and trucks being modified to use compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). This requires new on-board fuel tanks, which can be costly and large, especially for retrofits on light-duty trucks or passenger cars. LNG is seen as more suitable for long-haul trucking, rail locomotives, and shipping due to the size of fuel tanks needed, energy density, and limited refueling stations available. The construction of these facilities is focused along key interstate highways. The growth in construction of CNG fueling facilities is concentrated along key interstate highways. Access to fueling locations and onboard technology costs are limiting factors for expanded CNG use in automobiles. The need to construct new fueling infrastructure delays widespread adoption, with newer locations built to allow private access. Early adoption in the US is mainly in public fleets like buses, taxis, and refuse haulers strategically located near fueling facilities. Large fleet owners base vehicle-purchasing decisions on policy initiatives encouraging conversion. An emerging trend in public policy is the promotion of CNG in automobiles through various initiatives like tax incentives, public grants, and state fleet vehicle purchases. Clean Cities Coalition programs support fleet owners in urban areas considering transitioning to natural gas for transportation. Gas can be chemically reformulated into energy-dense liquid products through processes like gas-to-liquids (GTL) or the development of drop-in fuels. Fischer-Tropsch is a large-scale industrial process used for GTL. Sasol Limited is planning a $14 billion GTL plant in Louisiana to produce synthetic diesel fuel from shale gas resources. Research is ongoing to reduce the scale of the process and make it more portable, potentially creating synthetic fuels closer to shale gas sources. This could lead to higher-value products with increased market demand. Research is exploring new chemical conversion processes independent of Fischer-Tropsch, with companies like Primus Green Energy producing liquid fuels from shale gas on a pilot-scale level. Universities have also produced dimethyl ether (DME) from shale gas, offering enhanced energy properties and a reduced environmental footprint. The development of natural gas from shale formations has transformed the energy industry, with observers recognizing the resource size and potential benefits. Industry efficiency in extracting these resources has improved. The industry has improved efficiency in extracting hydrocarbons, leading to a shift from resource scarcity to abundance. The U.S. natural gas supply change has sparked interest in energy independence and export potential. Other countries aim to replicate U.S. success but face challenges due to different industry structures and regulations."
