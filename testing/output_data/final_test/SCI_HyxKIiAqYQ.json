    "content": "We propose a context-adaptive entropy model for optimized image compression, utilizing bit-consuming and bit-free contexts to estimate latent representation distributions more accurately. This leads to a more generalized form of approximation models. The proposed method for image compression shows enhanced performance compared to traditional codecs like BPG and JPEG2000, as well as previous ANN-based approaches, in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM index. ANN technology has seen breakthroughs in various areas due to its optimization and representation learning capabilities, but progress in image compression has been slow. The test code is available at https://github.com/JooyoungLeeETRI/CA_Entropy_Model. Relatively slow progress has been made in image compression due to complex target problems. Various works have focused on enhancing the quality of reconstructed images, with approaches like BID4, BID17, and BID24 reducing artifacts from image compression using artificial neural networks (ANN). While ANN-based artifact reduction shows promise, it is considered post-processing rather than compression itself. Recent methods in ANN-based image compression aim for superior perceptual quality, leveraging generative models to achieve high compression levels with minimal perceptual loss. Recent methods in image compression leverage generative models to achieve high compression levels with minimal perceptual loss. Unlike traditional codecs, these approaches seek a comprehensive solution through end-to-end optimization, such as Toderici et al.'s approach using latent binary representations for compressed information. Acceptability of machine-created image components may vary depending on the application. The text discusses the use of latent representations in image compression, aiming to improve quality while minimizing entropy. Unlike previous methods, which focused on maximizing entropy in binary representations, the new approach aims to minimize entropy in discrete latent representations. This shift in focus allows for better compression performance without the need for excessive iteration steps. The text discusses using latent representations in image compression to improve quality and minimize entropy. BID1 and BID18 propose frameworks that utilize entropy models to approximate actual distributions of the representations, showing better performance compared to conventional codecs like JPEG2000. They introduce an input-adaptive entropy model to estimate distribution scales for each representation based on natural image characteristics. The text discusses using latent representations in image compression to improve quality and minimize entropy. They provided test results that outperform previous approaches and reach close to BPG BID3, a subset of HEVC used for image compression. The trainable entropy model estimates the required bits for encoding latent representations by approximating their distributions. The text discusses using latent representations in image compression to improve quality and minimize entropy. The rate estimation m(\u0177) is calculated through cross entropy using the entropy model p\u0177(\u0177). Decreasing the rate term R during training allows the entropy model to approximate m(\u0177) closely, enhancing compression performance. A new entropy model is proposed to exploit two types of contexts for better capacity. The text introduces a new context-adaptive entropy model framework for image compression, utilizing two different types of contexts to improve distribution estimation and reduce spatial dependencies among latent representations. Results show outperformance of conventional image codec BPG in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM. Proposed methods aim to enhance model capacity and context levels for further improvements.

The encoder and decoder models are discussed in Section 3, with experimental results in Section 4. The use of entropy models has significantly improved image compression performance in ANN-based approaches.

The model adaptsively estimates scales of representations based on input, reducing redundancy by using additional information for proper scale parameter estimation. The paper presents a novel image compression approach that estimates scales of representations and utilizes convolutional neural networks to capture spatial dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art compression performance.

The paper introduces a new image compression method that uses convolutional neural networks to capture spatial dependencies and improve compression performance by adaptively estimating standard deviations and means of latent representations based on neighboring contexts. Context-adaptive entropy coding methods by Toderici et al. (2017) and BID15 are discussed, showing that estimating both mu and standard deviation parameters with given contexts can effectively remove spatial dependencies. The optimization problem transforms input x into y with low entropy, capturing spatial dependencies of y. The paper introduces a new image compression method using convolutional neural networks to capture spatial dependencies and improve compression performance by adaptively estimating standard deviations and means of latent representations based on neighboring contexts. It transforms input x into y with low entropy, capturing spatial dependencies of y and utilizing four fundamental parametric transform functions. The optimization problem is analyzed from the viewpoint of the variational autoencoder, showing the minimization of the KL-divergence. The paper introduces a new image compression method using convolutional neural networks to capture spatial dependencies and improve compression performance. It transforms input x into y with low entropy, utilizing discrete representations on conditions for training. The gradient overriding method is used to deal with discontinuities from uniform quantization. The objective function used in this paper is given in. The objective function in this paper includes terms for rates and distortions, with a coefficient \u03bb controlling the balance. The focus is on the balance between rate and distortion during optimization, with \u03bb manually configured. The noisy representations of \u0177 and z follow a standard uniform distribution, with input to h a being \u0177, a uniformly quantized representation of y. The rate term represents the expected. The rate term in the objective function is calculated using entropy models of p\u0177 |\u1e91 and p\u1e91, approximated by p\u1ef9 |\u1e91 and pz. Equation FORMULA5 uses a Gaussian model with parameters \u00b5 i and \u03c3 i estimated from bit-consuming and bit-free contexts. E extracts c i from transform h s, while no additional bit allocation is needed for c i. The known subset of \u0177 is utilized for estimation. The known subset of \u0177 is utilized for estimation, with c i extracted by the extractor E. A simple entropy model is used for \u1e91, assumed to follow zero-mean Gaussian distributions with a trainable \u03c3. This contributes a small amount to the total bit-rate, simplifying the entropy model for end-to-end optimization. Actual entropy coding or decoding processes are not necessarily required for training or encoding. The encoder-decoder model transforms input images into latent representations, quantizes them, and entropy-codes them. The decoder then reconstructs the image from the latent representations using the same entropy models. All parameters in this section are assumed to be trained. The encoder-decoder model includes components for transforming input images into latent representations, quantizing them, and entropy-coding them. The entropy model estimates the distribution of each transformed representation individually, optimizing scales through training. Context information is used for entropy coding, with a latent representation z being quantized to reduce bit-rate for carrying additional context information. The latent representation z, transformed from \u0177, is quantized and entropy-coded by its own entropy model. The parameters of h s and the entropy models are shared by both the encoder and decoder. The inputs to the entropy models during training are the noisy representations to approximate probability mass functions. The convolutional autoencoder structure is used, with the distribution estimator f implemented using convolutional neural networks. The convolutional neural networks implement analysis and synthesis transform functions, using the structures of the networks with added components for estimating the distribution of each \u0177 i. The distribution estimator f is implemented using convolutional layers. The estimator f, implemented with convolutional layers, estimates \u00b5 i and \u03c3 i using channel-wise concatenated inputs c i and c i. Shared c i and c i capture correlations among channels for all \u0177 i s at the same spatial position. f estimates all M distributions of \u0177 i s at once, reducing the total number of estimations. Parameters of f are shared for all spatial positions of \u0177, requiring only one trained f per \u03bb for processing images of any size. The estimator f, implemented with convolutional layers, estimates \u00b5 i and \u03c3 i using channel-wise concatenated inputs. To reduce the burden of collecting results from all spatial positions during training, a certain number of random spatial points are designated as representatives per training step. These random points contribute solely to the rate term, while distortion is still calculated over all images. Index i can be represented as three indexes, k, l, and m, for horizontal, vertical, and channel indexes respectively. E extracts c to keep the dimensions of the estimation results to the inputs. The estimation results are extracted using 4\u00d74\u00d7M windows and binary masks for parallel processing. Sequential reconstruction is necessary for decoding. A hybrid approach is used to reduce implementation cost by combining a lightweight entropy model with the proposed model. This approach assumes representations follow a zero-mean Gaussian model with estimated standard deviations. It is applied to the top four cases of nine \u03bb configurations for higher-quality compression. The latent representation is separated into two parts, y1 and y2, with different entropy models applied. Parameters are shared and trained together. N and M parameters are set for different \u03bb configurations. Tensorflow and Python were used for network structures, and an arithmetic coder and decoder were implemented for entropy coding and decoding. The Reference arithmetic coding project 2 source code was used as the base for optimizing networks with MSE and MS-SSIM distortion terms. 18 networks were trained and evaluated using 256x256 patches from randomly selected images. Training involved 1M iterations with the ADAM optimizer and a decreasing learning rate. For the evaluation, the average BPP and quality of reconstructed images were measured in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM over 24 PNG images from the Kodak PhotoCD dataset. Results were compared with traditional codecs like BPG and JPEG2000, as well as previous ANN-based approaches such as BID18. The proposed method outperforms previous approaches like BID18 and Ball\u00e9 in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM values. It also surpasses conventional codecs like BPG and JPEG2000, showing compression gains in PSNR BD-rate of 34.08% over JPEG2000. The study shows significant compression gains over traditional codecs like BPG and JPEG2000 in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM values. The approach outperforms previous methods and highlights the potential of ANN-based image compression. Additional image samples are provided in the appendix. The study demonstrates improved compression using entropy models with different contexts, showing superiority over traditional codecs like BPG and JPEG2000. The proposed method utilizes free and additional bit allocation contexts, providing a framework for entropy models. While experiments showed best results in ANN-based image compression, further studies are needed for enhancement. Further improvements in ANN-based image compression can be achieved by generalizing distribution models underlying the entropy model and enhancing the level of contexts used in the methods. Combining more elaborate models and higher-level contexts can lead to better results by reducing the mismatch between actual distributions and approximation models. By understanding the structures of human faces, entropy models can better approximate distributions when encoding features like eyes. Generative models and in-painting methods learn image distributions within specific domains. Utilizing high-level understandings and contexts, such as segmentation maps, can enhance image compression techniques. ANN-based image compression approaches have potential for future extension, despite their high complexity compared to traditional codecs. The proposed context-adaptive entropy model aims to make a useful contribution in enhancing compression performance. The proposed context-adaptive entropy model aims to enhance compression performance by dividing the representation y into two parts, \u0177 1 and \u0177 2, which are encoded using different models. The detailed structure of the proposed model is illustrated in FIG3, combining a lightweight entropy model with the context-adaptive entropy model to reduce implementation costs for high-bpp configurations. The lightweight model exploits scale estimation, assuming PMF approximations of quantized representations follow zero-mean Gaussian distributions. The hybrid network structure splits the representation y into two parts, y1 and y2, with different channels. The entropy model is used for y1, while a lightweight model is used for y2. The standard deviations for y2 are estimated directly from ha. The total loss function includes rate and distortion terms divided into parts for y1, y2, and z. The rate is divided into three parts for \u01771, \u01772, and \u1e91. The noisy representations follow a standard uniform distribution. \u01771 and \u01772 are split representations from y. The rate term for \u01771 is the same model as before, while the rate term for \u01772 is slightly different. The rate term for \u01772 is similar to \u01771, with noisy representations used only as inputs for training entropy models. A hybrid structure was implemented for top configurations, with N, M1, and M2 set accordingly. Average execution time per image was measured for encoding and decoding Kodak PhotoCD image dataset to show the benefit of the hybrid model, which reduced execution time significantly. The hybrid models reduced execution time significantly, with speed gains of 46.83% and 57.28% achieved by setting different parameters. Test results of the proposed model using discrete representations and noisy representations were compared. Training phase involved using quantized representations for the proposed model and different representations for the compared model. Additional changes in the proposed model included using different inputs for certain transforms. The proposed model, trained using discrete representations, outperformed the model trained with noisy representations by 5.94% in terms of BD-rate of PSNR. Compared to a different approach, the performance gains were 11.97% and 7.20% for the models trained with discrete and noisy representations, respectively."
