    "content": "The Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) expired in FY2009 and may be considered for reauthorization by the 111th Congress. Issues that may arise include conservation of collections, funding, changing role of libraries, and alternative funding models for museums. The report describes the background, history, and current policy of library and museum services, as well as changes from the 2003 reauthorization. In FY2007, the U.S. had 9,214 public libraries serving 97% of the population, with 2.2 billion materials circulated. In FY2007, public library circulation was 2.2 billion, with funds coming from local, state, federal, and other sources. The federal government has supported public libraries since 1956 through acts like the Library Services and Construction Act. Additionally, federal support extends to other types of libraries and collecting statistics. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) replaced the Library Services and Construction Act in 1996, consolidating various library assistance programs. LSTA provides aid to a wide range of libraries, including public, school, college, university, research, and private libraries. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) replaced the Library Services and Construction Act in 1996. LSTA was reauthorized as Title II, Library Services and Technology (LST), of the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. The reauthorization included changes such as prohibiting funding for obscene projects, increasing initial state grants, expanding IMLS advisory functions, and requiring impact analyses. State discretion in selecting grantees and fund usage was increased under the current program. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) was replaced by the Library Services and Technology (LST) under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. The LST grants, authorized through FY2009, focus on new forms of information sharing like the internet. Funding of $232 million for LST in FY2004 was allocated to states for expanding services and access to information. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) was replaced by the Library Services and Technology (LST) under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. LST grants are used for expanding services, developing networks, and targeting underserved populations. A percentage of funds is reserved for national activities, Native Americans, and federal administration, supporting grants for research, preservation, and education for librarians. The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) was replaced by the Library Services and Technology (LST) under the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003. LST grants are used for expanding services, developing networks, and targeting underserved populations. A percentage of funds is reserved for national activities, Native Americans, and federal administration, supporting grants for research, preservation, and education for librarians. 1.75% of appropriations is reserved for services to Native Americans, and up to 3.5% may be used for federal administration of LST programs. Each state receives a \"flat grant\" of $680,000 ($60,000 for outlying areas) from the total funding reserved for state grants. Initial state grants were increased to $680,000 (from $340,000) in years with higher appropriations. In FY2009, appropriations for the IMLS triggered higher state grant amounts under the LST program. Participating states must develop five-year plans to enhance information-sharing networks and target library services to disadvantaged populations. The federal share of costs for assisted activities is 66%, and states must maintain spending levels for library programs to avoid reductions in LST grants. Up to 4% of each state's grant can be used for administration. The LST grants provide states with flexibility in fund usage, allocated competitively by SLAAs. Administered by IMLS, it includes Office of Museum Services and Office of Library Services and Technology. The current director is Anne-Imelda Radice. The IMLS, under the Office of Library Services and Technology, is responsible for federal library functions, including surveys previously conducted by NCES. It also took over functions from NCLIS, such as advising on library policies and conducting studies on library needs. The IMLS is responsible for federal library functions, including advising on library policies and conducting studies on library needs. The most recent reauthorization of MLSA included new provisions requiring IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services. The June 2009 report on LST state grant programs found that libraries are expanding their traditional mission to provide access to computers, software, new services, and digital information resources. The report identified three categories of library services: information infrastructure projects, human capital projects, and library service expansion. Between FY1998 and FY2007, there was a shift towards using program funds for statewide initiatives rather than specific library projects, possibly due to changes in technology. The shift towards using program funds for statewide initiatives rather than specific library projects may be due to changes in technology that make technology-related services more cost-effective at the state level. Museums play a vital role in society by providing opportunities for lifelong learning, enhancing communities, and serving an educational role through partnerships with educational institutions and public schools. Multiple stakeholders from government levels, charitable foundations, and the public are interested in museums and their operations, with funding coming from various federal sources such as IMLS, NEA, NEH, NSF, and congressionally directed grants. The study analyzed federal funding for museums from FY2000 to FY2006, totaling around $200 million per year. State and local funding for museums is challenging to collect due to the diverse nature of the museum sector. The federal government has provided aid for museums through the MSA since 1976, with changes in administration over time. Funding for museums from state and local sources is difficult to quantify due to the diverse nature of the sector. In 1980, IMS was transferred from the Department of Education to the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities. Congress made technical amendments to MSA through various acts, but museum services remained under NFAH until the establishment of IMLS in 1997. IMLS combined OMS and LST into one agency with separate appropriations. The Museum Services program, funded through the L-HHS-ED appropriations, was reauthorized by P.L. 108-81 as Title III of the MLSA. OMS and LST are both under the jurisdiction of L-HHS-ED appropriations. P.L. 108-81 authorized $38.6 million for Museum Services in FY2004 and subsequent years. A \"museum\" is defined as a nonprofit agency organized for educational or aesthetic purposes with tangible objects. The Museum Services program, funded through the L-HHS-ED appropriations, was reauthorized by P.L. 108-81 as Title III of the MLSA. A \"museum\" is defined as a nonprofit agency organized for educational or aesthetic purposes that utilizes a professional staff, owns or utilizes tangible objects, cares for them, and exhibits them to the public regularly. The MLSA authorizes the director to enter into arrangements with museums and other entities to provide federal support for museum services. The federal share of museum services, defined in legislation, is up to 50% to incentivize leveraging other financial support sources. The director reserves 1.75% for grants to Native Hawaiian organizations and may use up to 20% for federal share exceeding 50% in arrangements for museum services. The Museum Services program, administered by OMS within IMLS, allows for the federal share of support for museums to exceed 50%. This funding can be used for a variety of services such as providing access to collections, partnering with schools, conserving collections, professional development, research, and program evaluation. OMS oversees several grant programs and cooperative agreements to support museums, including Museums for America, Conservation Project Support, and National Leadership Grants for Museums. The IMLS administers various grant programs for museums, each with unique priorities and requirements. The largest program, Museums for America, aims to enhance institutional capacity, collections stewardship, and community engagement. Other programs focus on professional training, conservation needs, and serving specific populations. The IMLS administers grant programs for museums with unique priorities. Programs like Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum Services Grants and Museum Grants for African American History and Culture support museums serving specific populations. The Museum Assessment Program (MAP) and Conservation Assessment Program (CAP) provide technical assistance for institutions to assess strengths and weaknesses. The IMLS administers grant programs for museums with unique priorities, such as Native American/Native Hawaiian Museum Services Grants and Museum Grants for African American History and Culture. They also offer programs like the Museum Assessment Program (MAP) and Conservation Assessment Program (CAP) for technical assistance. Heritage Preservation provides professional assistance for analyzing care practices and recommending actions. National Leadership Grants support innovative projects in library and museum sectors. Funding for Museum Services in FY2010 was $33.727 million. In FY2010, the Museum Services program received $33.727 million in funding, while the Museum Grants for African American History and Culture received $1.485 million. The conservation and preservation needs of museum and library collections were highlighted in a 2005 report commissioned by IMLS, which found significant issues such as 820 million objects at risk, 190 million needing urgent conservation care, and lack of adequate storage and emergency plans in many institutions. In response, IMLS held a national summit in June 2007 and has been working to educate the public, libraries, and museums on these issues. The Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian program, created in FY2003, has seen funding increase from $9.9 million to $25.5 million in FY2009. Potential reauthorization issues for the program may include increasing funding to ensure state grant awards do not fall below $680,000. The Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian program has seen funding increase from $9.9 million in FY2003 to $25.5 million in FY2009. It has supported thousands of students in various education programs. There is a need for the program to continue, as the aging librarian workforce will create job openings in the future. Recent enrollments in MLS programs are rising, potentially increasing the pool of new librarians. Libraries serve as community hubs, offering a variety of resources and services such as free internet access, job announcements, after school activities, online homework help, and adult literacy classes. Library advocates argue for more support to expand these community resources. The role of libraries in providing employment and job-training resources is expanding, with services like online job searches and resume development being offered. Advocates are pushing for increased support and coordination with federal job-training programs in the upcoming legislation reauthorizing the IMLS. The LST State Grants provide states flexibility in fund use for library services, including improving staff expertise in new technologies. Advocates suggest adding language during reauthorization to allow funds for continuing education for library staff. The upcoming reauthorization of IMLS may consider expanding the agency's role by including more detailed requirements and reflecting on the implementation of existing provisions. Potential amendments could also address new authorizing language regarding responsibilities previously held by NCLIS and the Department of Education. Reauthorization issues related to Museum Services may include various proposals. Potential reauthorization issues related to Museum Services may include federal funding levels and assistance to small and midsize museums. The American Association of Museums recommends reauthorization of OMS within IMLS with an incremental appropriation reaching $95 million over five years, a significant increase from the FY2010 appropriation of $34 million. Participants in IMLS hearings expressed concerns about the special needs of small to midsize museums. IMLS support for Museum Services is distributed through competitive grants, disadvantaging small and midsized museums due to lack of capacity, grant writers, and experience. Accountability requirements for federal funds deter some from applying. Disagreement exists on how to address the needs of small and midsized museums, with a proposed solution being federal-state partnerships. IMLS conducted studies on public support for museum services and explored federal-state partnership models for funding distribution. The study found that current programs are discipline-based, lacking a state-level organization representing museums as a whole. This contrasts with other federal arts and humanities agencies that have state-level organizations for the arts or humanities sector. IMLS conducted studies on public support for museum services and explored federal-state partnership models for funding distribution. The lack of consistent state-level information on museums and their capacity poses barriers to developing federal-state partnerships for Museum Services. Systemic data collection activities may be necessary to assess state-level infrastructure and institutional capacity. IMLS has investigated using a population-based state grant program to distribute federal funding for Museum Services. Some participants at public hearings support a federal funding formula, while others are concerned about current funding levels. Advocates for a federal funding formula prefer a population-based state grant program, but there are challenges due to varying numbers of museums per state. The number of museums per state varies, with no clear correlation to the state's population. Congress could implement a state grant program for Museum Services using a population-based or institution-based funding formula. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 was signed into law, reauthorizing the LSTA and MSA. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 was reauthorized, with major changes including prohibiting funding for projects deemed obscene, expanding the definition of \"museum\" to include various types of institutions, emphasizing museums' public service role, and promoting educational leadership and innovative technologies in museums. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 was reauthorized with major changes, including setting standards for museum operations, supporting partnerships among museums and community organizations, establishing procedural standards for grant evaluation, and increasing state grants for library and museum services. Funding amounts were specified for Library Services and Museum Services for FY2004 and beyond. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 was reauthorized with changes for FY2004-FY2009, allowing the director to enter contracts for museum activities, including partnerships with libraries and schools, new technologies, and programs for underserved areas. Advisory functions were moved to a new National Museum and Library Services Board within the IMLS, with increased federal administrative costs to 3.5%. The Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 was reauthorized with changes for FY2004-FY2009, increasing federal administrative costs to 3.5% and allowing the director of the IMLS to make national awards for library service."
