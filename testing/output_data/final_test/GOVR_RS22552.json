    "content": "The 110th Congress will address funding for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, including the unfinished FY2007 appropriations bill. Funding for FY2007 may be held at FY2006 levels through an omnibus bill or continuing resolution. Congressional decisions for FY2007 could impact the FY2008 budget resolution, setting federal spending parameters for the future. The 109th Congress debated federal spending for the next omnibus farm bill in 2007, including a proposed $3.8 billion disaster aid package for farmers affected by natural disasters. The amendment for the aid was ultimately defeated, with support from farm groups and opposition from the Administration and fiscal conservatives. In the 110th Congress, a package of assistance similar to S.Amdt. 5205 has been introduced to address production losses from severe winter storms in late 2006 and early 2007. Decisions about a new farm bill are being made as provisions of the current omnibus farm bill expire in 2007. Commodity price and income support policy remains a contentious issue in the debate. The 110th Congress will debate various food and agricultural issues, including farm support programs, conservation, rural development, trade, domestic food assistance, and biofuels. Key questions include whether to extend current farm support programs or adopt different approaches due to federal spending constraints, concerns about farm program benefits distribution, and potential WTO challenges. The Congress will also monitor the Administration's participation in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which has focused on agricultural trade liberalization. Negotiations were suspended in July 2006 due to the inability to reach a compromise on reducing subsidies or expanding market access for agricultural products. The 110th Congress will consider bilateral free trade agreements with Colombia, Peru, and Panama to boost U.S. agricultural exports. Additionally, Congress may discuss extending Trade Promotion Authority for expedited trade consideration. The Trade Promotion Authority, expiring June 30, 2007, allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements. Ongoing trade issues include barriers to agricultural trade, restrictions on agricultural sales to Cuba, and funding for U.S. agricultural export and food aid programs. In March 2005, a WTO appellate panel ruled against the U.S. in a dispute settlement case brought by Brazil. The panel ruled against the United States in a dispute settlement case brought by Brazil regarding the U.S. cotton program. Congress authorized the elimination of the Step-2 cotton program in response. Brazil has pressed for further reductions in U.S. cotton support, leading to potential modifications in U.S. farm programs to comply with WTO rulings. Policymakers are concerned about implications for other farm commodity support programs, with Canada initiating consultations on U.S. domestic corn subsidies for a potential WTO challenge. The United States is facing potential challenges from Brazil and Canada regarding its farm subsidy programs, particularly in relation to the U.S. cotton program. Congress may need to make changes to comply with WTO rulings. High energy prices are also a concern for agriculture, as they could lower farm incomes and impact profitability. The agriculture sector is facing concerns about farm profitability due to high energy prices. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel are seen as important, with a requirement for biofuels use to increase from 4 billion to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. This is expected to boost U.S. ethanol production, but policymakers worry about higher corn prices affecting livestock feed costs. Conservation program spending has also increased to protect natural resources on farmed land. The Conservation Security Program, implemented since the 2002 farm bill, has seen rapid growth in spending to protect natural resources on farmed land. Congressional interest remains high, with questions about limited funding and implementation in only a few watersheds. Stakeholders are exploring conservation policy options for the next farm bill, while the threat of agroterrorism is recognized as a national security concern. Attacks on agricultural targets (agroterrorism) are seen as a national security threat, leading to increased focus on \"food defense\" since 2001. Efforts to enhance laboratory and response capabilities have been made through increased funding. National response plans now include measures against agroterrorism. Some in Congress are pushing for additional laws and oversight to improve food defense, especially in terms of interagency coordination, response leadership, and border inspections. Approximately 76 million Americans fall ill and 5,000 die from food-related illnesses each year. Congress regularly oversees food safety and may consider legislation on the matter. Some Members are interested in issues such as microbiological contamination of fresh meat, poultry, and produce, stronger enforcement or recall authority, regulation of bioengineered foods, human antimicrobial resistance, and reorganizing food safety authorities. USDA advocates stringent on-farm biosecurity to control avian flu, which has spread globally but not yet in the United States. USDA advocates stringent on-farm biosecurity to control avian flu in poultry, seen as crucial for preventing a human pandemic. Congress has allocated funds for surveillance and hearings on animal disease and food safety. Additional funding will be needed for surveillance, vaccine stockpiles, and first responder equipment. There is a call for improved traceability of agricultural products to quickly contain disease outbreaks and verify labeling claims. One issue is whether a more universal animal identification system should be mandated and who should pay. Another is mandatory country of origin labeling (COOL) for fresh red meats, produce, and peanuts, which Congress required in the 2002 farm bill but has since delayed. Some advocate for COOL implementation, while others prefer voluntary labeling. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates the futures trading industry and is subject to periodic reauthorization. Amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) are being debated, focusing on issues such as regulation of energy derivatives markets, security futures, foreign futures exchanges, and futures-like contracts based on foreign currency prices. Hired farmworkers, including those under guest worker programs, play a crucial role in agricultural production. The 109th Congress debated farm labor and immigration policies, including the use of workers from Mexico, as part of a larger discussion on a guest worker program and border enforcement. This issue is crucial for fruit, vegetable, and horticulture growers in ensuring a sufficient labor supply without increasing the permanent U.S. population."
