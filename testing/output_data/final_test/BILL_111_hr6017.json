    "content": "The Act titled \"Gulf Coast Health Monitoring and Research Program Act of 2010\" amends the Public Health Service Act to establish the Gulf Coast Health Monitoring and Research Program. The Gulf Coast Health Monitoring and Research Program Act of 2010 establishes a comprehensive health screening, monitoring, and research program for oil spill workers and residents affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The program includes screening for physical and behavioral health effects from the oil spill. The Gulf Coast Health Monitoring and Research Program Act of 2010 establishes a program for health effects data collection on workers and residents affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Research includes food safety of Gulf Coast seafood and fresh water supply. Coordination with Federal agencies for data sharing is required. The Gulf Coast Health Research Advisory Committee is appointed by the Secretary to provide scientific research advice on long-term monitoring and research objectives related to workers and residents at risk from oil spills. The committee also ensures that health concerns are considered in setting research priorities. The Gulf Coast Health Research Advisory Committee is composed of 10-15 members qualified to provide scientific advice on environmental and occupational health research. At least 4 members represent affected populations, including commercial fishermen involved in the Vessel of Opportunities program by BP PLC. The Gulf Coast Health Research Advisory Committee, consisting of 10-15 members, includes representatives from affected populations, such as commercial fishermen involved in BP PLC's Vessel of Opportunities program. The Advisory Committee appoints members, including a chair and vice chair, for 3-year terms, with initial terms potentially up to 5 years for staggering. Members may be reappointed and continue serving after their term expires. The Gulf Coast Health Research Advisory Committee appoints 10-15 members, including representatives from affected populations like commercial fishermen. Members serve 3-year terms, with the possibility of reappointment and serving beyond their term until successors are seated. The Secretary establishes conflict of interest requirements. The Committee advises on health research program development, responds to requests for advice, and reviews reports. The Secretary consults with various agencies and stakeholders to develop a research and monitoring program for protecting the health and safety of cleanup workers and vulnerable communities in the Gulf Coast. This includes representatives from Gulf Coast States, local health departments, academic institutions, worker and community representatives, and other research organizations. The program established in the Gulf Coast communities includes experts in human health and environmental monitoring. Its primary duty is to implement the health program, collect baseline health information, conduct screening, monitoring, surveillance, and research on worker and resident exposure to oil, dispersants, chemicals, and physical hazards during clean-up efforts. This includes information on personal protective equipment, biological sampling, and vulnerable residents susceptible to exposure. The environmental health impacts in Gulf Coast communities include vulnerable residents susceptible to exposure, acute and chronic health effects, mental health effects, reproductive effects, and monitoring of hazardous substances in seafood and water sources. Other elements necessary for a comprehensive research and monitoring program are also considered. The Secretary must establish an environmental health research and monitoring program to understand the implications of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on worker and public health, make recommendations for future oil spills, and provide biennial reports to Congress for at least 20 years. The Secretary may extend reporting provisions for monitoring and research beyond the initial period. After 3 years, the Advisory Committee will issue a report to Congress and the public on lessons learned and best practices for handling future environmental health disasters. The Secretary has the authority to compel BP PLC to provide health-related data, and must maintain and archive information obtained through the program. The program established under subsection (a) will archive information for health monitoring and research purposes, ensuring accessibility while protecting individual confidentiality. Definitions for Gulf Coast State, Advisory Committee, and vulnerable residents are provided. The term 'workers' refers to paid or volunteer staff involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup, particularly those living in Gulf Coast States exposed to hazardous substances."
