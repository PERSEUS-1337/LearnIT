    "content": "The Act titled \"Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2006\" establishes jurisdiction in civil rights cases concerning real property. Section 1343 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to state that a district court must not abstain from jurisdiction in cases involving real property if no State law violation is alleged, and no parallel State court proceeding exists. The court must also exercise jurisdiction even if the party does not pursue State judicial remedies. The district court may certify unsettled State law questions to the highest appellate court if necessary to resolve a Federal claim regarding real property. The court must proceed after the State appellate court resolves the certified question. This certification is only allowed if the State law question is essential to the Federal claim and is unclear. Any claim under section 1979 of the United States Revised Statutes to redress property rights violations is covered. Deprivation of property rights secured by the Constitution can be adjudicated by district courts upon a final decision made under state laws causing actual injury. A final decision exists when a definitive ruling on property use is made, and an application to use the property is denied. The party seeking redress can apply for a waiver or appeal if denied, as long as the mechanism provides relief. If pursuing a waiver or appeal would be futile, it is not required. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES AS DEFENDANT. Section 1346 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow claims founded on property rights secured by the Constitution to be adjudicated upon a final decision by the United States causing actual injury to the party seeking redress. This final decision includes a definitive decision on permissible property uses and the denial of one application, waiver, and appeal. The party seeking redress is not required to apply for a waiver or appeal if it is unavailable, cannot provide relief, or would be futile. SEC. 4. JURISDICTION OF COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS. Section 1491(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a provision stating that any claim based on a property right secured by the Constitution and allegedly infringed by the United States must show concrete injury and a final decision by the government on the permissible uses of the property. The party seeking redress for a denied property claim can apply for a waiver or appeal, as long as the mechanism is available and can provide the relief requested. If pursuing a waiver or appeal would be futile, they are not required to do so. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION FOR CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS. Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) is amended to hold individuals acting under state law liable for unconstitutional conditions or exactions related to property rights or privileges secured by the Constitution. This includes approvals for real property development and subdivision of real property under state laws. The amended Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983) holds individuals accountable for unconstitutional actions related to property rights. It specifies that claims regarding subdivided lots must be considered individually if taxed or recognized as separate property units by the state. Additionally, actions under state law must be evaluated for arbitrariness, capriciousness, abuse of discretion, or non-compliance with the law in cases of alleged deprivation of substantive due process. SEC. 6. CLARIFICATION FOR CERTAIN CONSTITUTIONAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. The District Court Jurisdiction under Section 1346 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to hold the United States liable for unconstitutional conditions or exactions related to property rights secured by the Constitution. This includes approvals from executive agencies for real property use and subdivision of real property under state or territorial laws. The United States can be held liable for unconstitutional conditions or exactions related to property rights by executive agencies under state or territorial laws. The Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over claims founded upon such actions. The United States can be held liable for unconstitutional conditions or exactions related to property rights by executive agencies under state or territorial laws, including approvals for real property use and subdivision of real property. The United States can be held liable for unconstitutional conditions related to property rights by executive agencies under state or territorial laws. Each subdivided lot, if taxed or treated as an individual property unit, will be judged for deprivation of substantive due process. SEC. 7. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS: Federal agencies must notify property owners of any actions limiting property use under this Act within 30 days, explaining their rights and compensation procedures. Definitions for \"Federal agency\" and \"agency action\" are provided. SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATE. If any part of this Act is deemed invalid, the rest remains unaffected. The amendments apply to actions starting after the enactment date."
