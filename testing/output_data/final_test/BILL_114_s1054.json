    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smart Manufacturing Leadership Act\". Congress finds that the industrial sector in the United States represents 20% of the economy, provides 13% of employment, and accounts for a significant amount of energy consumption. Smart manufacturing is expected to revolutionize the sector over the next 10 years, leading to savings in various resources. Smart manufacturing technologies are estimated to add between $10 trillion and $15 trillion to the global GDP over 20 years. Market barriers hinder widespread adoption of smart manufacturing practices. Smart manufacturing practices face barriers such as lack of common communication protocols, standards for energy information, an open-access platform, and cybersecurity protocols. Addressing these barriers is crucial for the United States. The Secretary of Energy is collaborating with the private sector to reduce market barriers through voluntary protocols and standards. Many domestic manufacturers are unaware of technologies that could enhance competitiveness and reduce environmental impacts. Federal agency action can promote economic growth in smart manufacturing, and the U.S. would benefit from a focused effort to advance smart manufacturing adoption in the manufacturing sector.

Many domestic manufacturers are unaware of technologies that could enhance competitiveness and reduce environmental impacts. Federal agency action can promote economic growth in smart manufacturing, and a focused effort is needed to advance smart manufacturing adoption in the manufacturing sector. The Act defines \"energy management system\" as a process for improving energy performance and \"industrial assessment center\" as a facility at a higher education institution funded by the Department of Energy for assessing manufacturing plants. The Act defines \"energy management system\" as a process for improving energy performance and \"industrial assessment center\" as a facility at a higher education institution funded by the Department of Energy for assessing manufacturing plants. It also identifies opportunities for potential savings for small- and medium-size manufacturer plant sites from energy efficiency improvements, waste minimization, pollution prevention, and productivity improvement. The term \"information and communication technology\" refers to electronic systems or equipment used for data creation, conversion, communication, or duplication. The term \"institution of higher education\" has the meaning given in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"National Laboratory\" is defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, while the \"North American Industry Classification System\" is used by Federal agencies for business classification. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and \"small and medium manufacturers\" are manufacturing firms classified in the North American Industry Classification System. Smart manufacturing refers to advanced technologies and practices that integrate information and communication technologies with manufacturing processes to manage energy, productivity, and costs in real-time. Small and medium manufacturers are classified as sectors 31 through 33 with annual sales under $100,000,000, fewer than 500 employees, and energy bills between $100,000 and $2,500,000. SEC. 4. DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SMART MANUFACTURING PLAN. The Secretary, in consultation with the National Academies, must develop a national plan for smart manufacturing technology within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The plan should focus on improving productivity, energy efficiency, and competitiveness in the US manufacturing sector. The national plan for smart manufacturing technology aims to enhance competitiveness and strengthen the manufacturing sectors of the United States. Agency actions include assessing previous Department of Energy actions, establishing interconnection protocols, deploying research results, and leveraging high-performance computing infrastructure. The plan will be revised biennially to incorporate advancements in information. The Secretary will revise the national plan for smart manufacturing technology to incorporate advancements in information and communication technology and manufacturing needs. An annual progress report will be submitted to Congress, and unobligated funds from the Department of Energy will be used for implementation. The Secretary will leverage existing agency programs to assist small and medium manufacturers. Congress finds that the Department of Energy's technical assistance programs help small and medium manufacturers implement best practices and smart manufacturing. The Secretary is required to expand the Industrial Assessment Centers to include smart manufacturing technologies and practices. The Department of Energy aims to expand the Industrial Assessment Centers to provide technical assistance in smart manufacturing technologies and practices to manufacturers using unobligated funds. The Department of Energy plans to leverage smart manufacturing infrastructure at national laboratories. The Department of Energy will conduct a study on increasing access to high-performance computing resources in National Laboratories for small and medium manufacturers, focusing on computing facilities and ensuring data protection and facility security. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 1 year of enacting the Act, detailing the study results. The Secretary will also facilitate access to National Laboratories for small and medium manufacturers to utilize high-performance computing resources and enhance manufacturing competitiveness in the United States. SEC. 7. STATE LEADERSHIP GRANTS. Congress finds that States are committed to promoting domestic manufacturing and supporting economic development activities. States can assist manufacturers, especially small and medium ones, with smart manufacturing deployment by providing infrastructure like supercomputing facilities, process simulations, and demonstrations. The Secretary may grant funds to States for establishing programs supporting smart manufacturing technologies. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application to the Secretary, meeting specified criteria such as academic and private sector partnerships, funding sources, dissemination plans, and infrastructure permanence. Grants have a maximum term of 3 years and a specified maximum amount. The grant under this section has a maximum amount of $3,000,000 and requires a 30 percent matching contribution from the State. Funds must be used for providing access to supercomputing facilities, funding research and development, and offering tools and training to small and medium manufacturers on energy management. The Secretary will evaluate grants biannually to assess program impact and effectiveness, providing guidance to States. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2017-2020 to implement energy management systems and smart manufacturing technologies for small and medium manufacturers. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress and the public on the progress of smart manufacturing in the United States."
