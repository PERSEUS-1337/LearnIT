Federal farm policy has supported U.S. agriculture since the 1930s, with the 2008 farm bill being the most recent legislation. In 2009, some farmers struggled financially after prosperous years in 2007 and 2008. Livestock, dairy, and poultry producers faced low returns due to high input prices. Many farmers have been using equity to survive, while crop producers also faced challenges. The current farm price-cost squeeze is affecting producers of federally supported crops like grain, oilseeds, and cotton, as well as non-program crops. Farm groups are asking for additional support from Congress and the USDA. The cyclical nature of agricultural markets, driven by factors like weather, plays a significant role in this squeeze. The cyclical nature of agricultural markets is driven by factors like weather, leading to large crop yields that lower prices or droughts that raise prices. High prices encourage producers to increase production, but once supplies increase, prices tend to fall. This cycle is captured in the adage \"the cure for high prices is high prices,\" indicating that high prices eventually lead to increased production and lower prices. The cyclical nature of agricultural markets is driven by factors like weather, leading to fluctuations in prices. Farmers may cut back on inputs or exit the industry during low-price periods, but eventually, prices turn higher and profitability returns. Some farmers find ways to stay in business, while others may exit the industry. Agriculture Secretary Ezra T. Benson noted farmers' role in the cyclical nature of commodity markets over 50 years ago, suggesting that production and marketing decisions can help solve surplus and low price problems. The cyclical nature of agricultural markets is driven by factors like weather, leading to fluctuations in prices. Rising productivity from new technology and management approaches has also contributed to this cycle. Government policy and farm commodity subsidies are debated for their role in responding to market cycles, with some arguing it helps preserve farms while others believe it disproportionately benefits large farms. Weather can create short-term disruptions and price volatility in the market. Large economies of scale in U.S. agriculture drive producers to expand operations, utilize technology, and reduce costs through bulk purchasing, leading to declining farm prices over time. Small operators face economic pressure and struggle to sustain profits, often resulting in some going out of business due to market volatility. The performance of the agricultural sector, from individual producers to overall price levels, is heavily influenced by supply and demand factors. International and domestic market changes, energy costs, prevailing wages, and other factors all play a role in determining the prices farmers receive and the costs they incur. Overall, farm profitability is influenced by various factors such as technology, government policy, transportation, and marketing issues. Farm program payments, government support, and off-farm income can be crucial for business survival. A farm's cost structure and marketing ability play a significant role in determining profitability. For example, small farms may have higher per-unit costs, while some farmers may excel at maximizing market prices. Some farmers excel at maximizing market prices, which can vary significantly among producers. Assessing financial prospects for a farm involves considering factors like commodity mix, risk preferences, and financial variables. Policymakers and analysts often use a simplified measure to gauge the farm price-cost squeeze, comparing prices received with input costs. This comparison provides insights into the current market conditions. The price-cost squeeze for farmers involves comparing output prices with input costs to determine financial conditions. This comparison can help policymakers understand how different groups of farmers are faring financially. The ratio of output price to input price is used to measure the price-cost squeeze, which can vary over short and long periods due to technology changes and efficiency gains. The milk-feed price ratio is a key indicator for farmers' profitability, with a ratio close to 3 being sufficient for profitability in the dairy industry. A ratio near or below 2 indicates low or negative profitability, leading to herd liquidation and industry contraction. Livestock production costs are heavily influenced by feed prices, making the ratio an important factor to consider. The milk-feed price ratio is crucial for farmers' profitability in the dairy industry. It should be close to 3 for profitability, while a ratio near or below 2 indicates low or negative profitability, leading to herd liquidation. Livestock production costs are heavily influenced by feed prices, making the ratio an important factor to consider. Input prices, particularly feed costs, are a significant contributor to overall farm costs and financial prospects in the short run. Comparing price indices can help measure the price-cost squeeze and output prices relative to input prices. The price-cost squeeze and output prices relative to input prices are crucial factors for farmers' profitability. The ratio of output prices to input prices indicates financial circumstances for farmers in the short and long run. Various factors such as crop rotation, equipment availability, and management expertise also impact farm profitability and planting decisions. Indices published monthly capture output and input prices for analysis. Output and input prices for major livestock species and crops are captured in indices published monthly by USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). These include ratios like the \"milk-feed\" price ratio and indices for various livestock and crop categories. Livestock prices are reported relative to feed prices, with some ratios using a composite price of several crops weighted by typical ration shares. Output price indices for major crop categories are also published by NASS. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) publishes indices for crops, fruits, nuts, commercial vegetables, and potatoes. These indices are based on farm price estimates from farmer surveys. The agency also publishes a \"crop sector\" index for input costs. However, these indices may not accurately reflect individual producer situations due to industry-wide averages. Some output categories are too broad for specific analysis. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) publishes indices for various crops and sectors, providing a general indicator of economic conditions in the farm sector. While the indices may not accurately reflect individual producer situations, they offer a quick snapshot of current economic conditions. More detailed analyses, particularly for livestock, can be done at the state level using available data. The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) publishes indices for various crops and sectors, offering a general indicator of economic conditions in the farm sector. Policymakers can monitor U.S. farmers' economic situation monthly through farm price-feed ratios and prices received and paid indices. The livestock sector, especially dairy, experienced a price-cost squeeze in 2009 due to falling producer prices and slower receding feed costs. Prices in the feed complex, led by corn and soybeans, have risen since 2005 due to increased demand for corn for ethanol production. Other factors like global income growth and a weaker U.S. dollar have also supported foreign demand for grains and oilseeds. Farm prices of livestock, poultry, and milk have not kept pace with grain and feed prices. Dairy market experienced a boom and bust cycle, with record milk prices in late 2007 offsetting higher feed costs, but the milk-feed price ratio dropped significantly in 2008. In 2008, the milk-feed price ratio dropped significantly due to weakened demand for U.S. dairy products and falling milk prices. This led to financial stress for dairy farmers as production remained higher than demand. Milk prices strengthened in late 2009 as production slowed and demand recovered somewhat. Similar trends were seen in the farm price-cost ratios for hogs, poultry, and cattle, with declines starting earlier in 2005. The poultry sector saw quicker changes due to its shorter production cycle compared to cattle and hogs. The poultry production cycle is shorter than that for cattle and hogs. Farm prices for crops relative to costs had been steady or rising before the 2008 price spike. Prices for most crop categories were near 2007 levels at the end of 2009. Cotton is the only field crop with a long-term decline in domestic mill use. Farm prices for fruits, nuts, and vegetables have remained within historical ranges since 2000. Farm prices relative to costs have held within historical ranges since 2000, with a downward trend in the fruit and nut category since 2007. Costs rose sharply in 2008 due to increased prices for fertilizer, fuel, and seeds. Federal policies and off-farm income also impact U.S. agriculture, influencing farmers' production decisions. Farmers focus on both revenue and cost sides of their business to make decisions that affect their output. Farmers focus on revenue and cost sides of their operations to address declining returns. They often sell products strategically to avoid seasonal lows and maximize revenue, using forward pricing and marketing options. Cost-cutting measures, such as reducing inputs or delaying investments, are also considered to improve profitability. Farmers can reduce costs by selling less productive assets, delaying equipment upgrades, or drawing on equity. They need to pay attention to efficiency ratios when making these choices. Eventually, farmers collectively lower sector-wide supplies in response to negative market signals, leading to changes in production plans such as shifting from cotton to soybean plantings. The positive price impact of reduced supplies in the market is seen once traders anticipate a decline in supplies. Weather and other factors influence supply and prices. Livestock producers may send animals to slaughter or feed cheaper rations, affecting production. Prices initially drop due to increased meat supplies from herd liquidation, but eventually rise as animals no longer contribute to the market. The federal government provides support to farmers through programs focusing on specific crops like wheat, corn, cotton, and rice. These programs, rooted in farm legislation from the 1930s and 1940s, offer payments to agricultural landowners. Reduced production can result from sending breeding animals to slaughter or feeding less nutritious rations, impacting meat and dairy supplies in the future. The federal government provides support to farmers through programs focusing on specific crops like wheat, corn, cotton, and rice. Total price and income support payments to agriculture averaged $15.5 billion per year in FY2001-FY2009. The sugar industry is supported primarily through domestic supply control and import barriers. Federal program support for fruits, vegetables, and horticulture crops is generally limited to crop insurance, disaster assistance, and funding for research, marketing, and promotion projects. In the livestock sector, the only extensive federal policy is for dairy, with price supports, direct payments to producers, and milk pricing regulations under federal milk marketing orders. Crop subsidies have encouraged grain production, benefiting livestock producers through lower feed prices. Some analysts suggest that government efforts to stabilize markets through federal policies can be counterproductive by distorting production incentives and creating a disconnect between consumer demand and farmer production. Critics argue that government programs keep inefficient resources in the agricultural sector and work against natural forces driven by technology and economies of scale. Further government intervention may be necessary to address these issues. Government intervention in agriculture may be necessary to stabilize markets and prevent unnecessary farm closures. Supporters argue that small- and medium-sized farms, which are more vulnerable to financial losses, benefit from government assistance in carrying out conservation measures. Off-farm income is crucial for farm survival during price-cost squeezes. Technological advancements have reduced the need for labor in agriculture. Off-farm income is essential for farm survival during price-cost squeezes, with many farmers seeking off-farm jobs to supplement household income. National statistics show that off-farm income accounts for at least 80% of total household income for the past 20 years, reaching over 90% in some years. For commercial farms, farm income makes up about 75% of household income, while for other farms, it is often in single digits or negative. This situation leads to farming being more of a \"hobby\" than a profitable business for many, making it a lifestyle choice rather than a primary source of income. The decline in U.S. farm numbers from over 6 million in the early 20th century to 2 million in recent decades was most apparent in the 1950s due to mechanization reducing the need for farm labor, efficiency gains from large farm size, and the availability of off-farm employment. Livestock producers often need to tend animals daily, limiting off-farm job options, while diversified operations may require full-time focus on the farm. Technological gains in farming have led to excess production, causing a price-cost squeeze and a decline in farm numbers. While overall U.S. farm numbers have stabilized since the late 1980s, there has been a shift away from medium-sized farms towards larger farms. This shift has been attributed to the need for resources to exit the sector when supply is out of balance. In 2007, the total number of farms in the U.S. was 2.2 million, with less than half a million farms having sales of $50,000 or greater. The trend shows a decline in commercial farms driven by economies of scale and technology, with only about 125,000 of the largest farms (5.7% of total farms) accounting for 75% of the nation's farm sales. Since the Great Depression, federal farm policy has aimed to help farmers survive market downturns by enacting legislation to stabilize agricultural markets and support rural income. Over the years, technology adoption has led to a shift from a large number of high-cost producers to a smaller number of lower-cost producers. Public support for agricultural subsidies is driven by the desire to assist \"family farmers.\" Recent farm bill debates have sparked heated discussions over subsidy levels and eligibility, with public opinion favoring payments to small farmers over large ones. Government programs currently benefit farmers based on their production, with some large operations still receiving payments. Some large farms receive payments based on production, creating incentives to expand or downsize. Economic and technological pressures also drive consolidation. Policymakers debate preserving food production amid farm financial struggles. Economic returns may lead to decreased food production in some agricultural sectors, but overall food production levels are not necessarily at risk. Resources like land, labor, and capital remain abundant in the United States, allowing for continued food production capacity. Shifts in resources occur based on economics and government policies, with gains in productivity enabling resources to leave the sector without reducing overall food output. The federal policy on agriculture in the United States is a major concern, particularly regarding the structure of the industry and the support for family farmers. There is a debate on whether the government should let family farmers fail financially or support them to slow the transition to more economically efficient farms. The issue is shaped by the belief that agriculture is a special segment of the economy, while others argue that it should be treated like any other business. Farm programs are part of a larger policy context that has evolved over time. The policy context for farm policy has changed since its development in the early- and mid-20th century when agriculture was crucial to the rural economy. Now, with the growth of other rural industries, farming's relative importance has decreased. Critics and advocates question how farm policy aligns with policymakers' goals for rural communities. Some critics worry that current farm policy is intensifying the farm price-cost squeeze, while others argue that government assistance is necessary to support agriculture during poor economic conditions."
