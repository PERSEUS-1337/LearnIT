    "content": "The \"Deafy Glade Land Exchange Act\" is a legislation regarding a land exchange in Mendocino National Forest, California. The County of Solano, California must convey 160 acres of land to the Secretary of Agriculture in exchange for approximately 82 acres of land in Mendocino National Forest known as Fouts Springs Ranch. The map detailing the land parcels is available for public inspection. The Secretary may make technical corrections to the map and legal descriptions for the land exchange. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 applies to the exchange process. Survey and administrative costs for determining the land acreage will be covered by the County. The County must agree to use the acquired land for specified purposes. The Secretary may grant an easement for continued access and use of facilities at Fouts Springs Ranch. Acquired lands will be managed as part of Mendocino National Forest. The land exchange will be subject to additional terms and conditions. The Secretary and the County may agree upon additional terms and conditions for subsection (a). SEC. 3. SALE OR EXCHANGE OF NOAA PROPERTY IN NORFOLK, VIRGINIA. The Secretary of Commerce may sell or exchange real property in Norfolk, Virginia to the City of Norfolk, including land and improvements at 538 Front Street, consisting of approximately 3.78 acres, if it is in the best interests of NOAA and the Federal Government, and after notifying relevant committees. The Secretary requires the City of Norfolk to provide fair market value consideration for any conveyance, which may include cash, other property, or in-kind services beneficial to NOAA. The Secretary determines fair market value for property conveyance based on appraisal standards. Proceeds from conveyance are available for NOAA property operations or improvements. The Secretary may impose additional terms and conditions for property conveyance to protect the interests of the United States, including recouping any profits made by the City of Norfolk within three years of the conveyance. The authority for property conveyance will end after 24 months if no sale or exchange contract is made between the City of Norfolk and the United States. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 22, 2008. Attest: LORRAINE C. MILLER, Clerk."
