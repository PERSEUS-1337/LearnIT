    "content": "Entailment vectors encode known and unknown information in a vector. They model relations where one vector includes all the information in another vector. This paper explores unsupervised learning of entailment vectors for word semantics, outperforming previous results in predicting entailment between words. Modelling entailment in natural language semantics has been a challenge, with recent interest in using vector-space representations. Unsupervised models like word embeddings have struggled to detect entailment effectively. Entailment involves information inclusion, where y entails x if everything known given x is also known given y. Standard word embeddings like Word2Vec may not capture the abstractness of words and how much information is unspecified. This contrasts with the majority of work in this area, which relies on existing vector-space embeddings. Recent work has focused on developing new vector-space models specifically designed to capture entailment, such as using variances and probabilities to represent uncertainty. The \"entailment-vectors\" framework from BID4 is utilized to create new entailment-based models for unsupervised learning of word embeddings, showing unprecedented results in predicting entailment between words. These unsupervised models use distributional semantics to induce vector-space representations of word meanings. The distributional semantic hypothesis states that a word's meaning is reflected in the distribution of text contexts it appears in. Various methods have been proposed to create word embeddings from word-context pairs in large text corpora. BID4 introduces a framework where each dimension of the vector-space represents a known feature, with continuous vectors indicating probabilities of these features being known or unknown. They propose a reinterpretation of Word2Vec embeddings as entailment vectors, successfully predicting entailment between words. The distributional semantic hypothesis suggests that a word's meaning is reflected in its context. BID4 proposes a model using Word2Vec training to approximate this semantic model. They implement the model to train new word embeddings, which encode known and unknown information without requiring reinterpretation for predicting hyponymy. The model postulates a latent pseudo-phrase vector to capture the unified semantics of a word and its context. The distributional semantic hypothesis suggests that a word's meaning is reflected in its context. BID4 proposes a model using Word2Vec training to approximate this semantic model. They implement the model to train new word embeddings, which encode known and unknown information without requiring reinterpretation for predicting hyponymy. The latent vector in the entailment-based distributional semantic model captures the redundancy and consistency between the semantics of two neighboring words. The word embeddings suggested by BID4 may not be the best way to extract information about a word's semantics. Instead of using likelihood vectors, it is proposed to use posterior vectors that include evidence from the word and its indirect consequences via prior constraints. This model allows testing the hypothesis by outputting either likelihood vectors or posterior vectors. The model proposed by BID4 uses Word2Vec training to approximate the distributional semantic model. It evaluates word embeddings by predicting hyponymy in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The likelihood vectors perform similarly to Word2Vec embeddings, while the posterior vectors outperform them, achieving the best results on benchmark datasets. In a semi-supervised setting, similar results are obtained, showcasing state-of-the-art performance. In section 2, the paper presents a formal framework for modelling entailment in a vector space using distributional semantic models to predict hyponymy. Section 3 discusses related work, while section 4 covers empirical evaluation on hyponymy detection in unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments. Additional analysis of induced vectors is presented in section 4.4, focusing on the Word2Vec model's refinements and computational optimizations for learning vector-space embeddings from large corpora with good semantic generalization. The Word2Vec Skipgram BID6 model combines distributional semantics with an entailment-based approach to represent the relationship between a word and its context words. BID4 proposed a latent vector y that unifies the features of the middle word x e and its neighboring context word x e. This model emphasizes the redundancy and consistency in the semantics of a word and its context. The semantics of a word and its context are formalized using an entailment-vectors framework by Henderson & Popa (2016). This framework models distributions over discrete vectors where entailment y\u21d2x requires that the features of x are a subset of the features of y. The probability of entailment y\u21d2x between two such \"entailment vectors\" Y, X can be measured using the operator >. The model formalized by Henderson & Popa (2016) calculates the expectation based on the probability of y=1 or y=0. It infers the optimal latent vector distribution Y and scores how well the entailment and prior constraints are satisfied. The score is measured using the same approximation as used in the inference process. The model by Henderson & Popa (2016) calculates expectations based on y=1 or y=0 probabilities. It uses an approximation to satisfy entailment constraints. The Word2Vec model cannot directly map to this approach due to differences in vector representation. BID4 proposes an approximation incorporating the prior into one of the vectors. The Word2Vec model is unable to directly align with the approach proposed by Henderson & Popa (2016) due to differences in vector representation. BID4 introduces an approximation that incorporates the prior into one of the vectors, allowing for the training of new word embeddings using distributional semantic models based on score (5). This leads to the development of Word2Hyp models. The Word2Hyp models are designed to predict hyponymy by incorporating the prior into one of the vectors for training new word embeddings. The model provides a better understanding of the effects of the prior and how it influences the vector representation. The Word2Hyp models predict hyponymy by incorporating the prior into one of the vectors for training new word embeddings. This model approximates the model on the left side of FIG0, with Xp being a better reflection of word semantics than Xe. The Word2Vec code is modified to train two vectors for each word, with negative sampling applied to one vector and the other as the output vector. The Word2Hyp models predict hyponymy by training new word embeddings using negative sampling on one vector and using the other as the output vector. This modification applies to both Skipgram and CBOW versions of training, with the output vector corresponding to either the likelihood vector Xe or the posterior vector Xp. This results in four different models to evaluate, each providing word embedding vectors for every word in the vocabulary. To predict lexical entailment between words, word embedding vectors are used, which can be interpreted as entailment vectors. By applying the > operator to the vectors, an approximation of the log-probability of entailment can be obtained. The entailment predictions are evaluated on hyponymy detection, where hyponym-hypernym pairs with higher entailment scores reflect direct lexical entailment. This evaluation is important as it shows that semantic features of a hypernym should be included in the features of a hyponym. Other forms of lexical entailment may require reasoning or world knowledge, which is left for future work. In this paper, a distributional semantic model based on entailment is proposed. Different approaches to modelling entailment with vector space embeddings are discussed, including unsupervised models of hyponymy detection. BID10 introduces an unsupervised model of entailment in a vector space using Gaussian distributions to represent words. The variance of the distribution indicates the extent to which a dimension's feature is unknown. The distributional semantic model uses KL-divergence to detect hyponymy relations, with a focus on unsupervised and semi-supervised models for hyponymy detection accuracy. BID5's semi-supervised model learns a Boolean vector space for prediction, while BID11 evaluates various unsupervised and semi-supervised models for hyponymy detection. Their methodology involves disjoint training and test sets to learn about the unsupervised vector space. In the evaluation of hyponymy detection models, the focus is on unsupervised and semi-supervised setups. The experiments replicate BID11's setup and compare results with other models. The semi-supervised setup involves training a linear mapping from unsupervised to a new vector space for predicting hyponymy relations. The accuracies and average precision are reported in Table 1 for unsupervised experiments. The experimental setup replicates BID11's selection of hyponym-hypernym pairs from the BLESS dataset, using 50% positive hyponymy pairs and 50% negative pairs. Ten-fold cross validation is used in semi-supervised experiments with 200-dimensional word embedding vectors trained on a corpus of half a billion words from Wikipedia. Performance on hyponymy detection is quantified by ranking pairs based on model scores. The experimental setup involves ranking pairs based on model scores and evaluating performance using two measures: \"50% Acc\" and average precision. These measures are used to assess the accuracy of ranked lists in hyponymy detection. The experiments focus on evaluating different embeddings in unsupervised models of hyponymy detection. The experiments evaluate different embeddings in unsupervised models of hyponymy detection, comparing results with BID4, BID11, and BID9. The Word2Hyp models use CBOW or Skipgram to train likelihood or posterior vectors for predicting entailment. The experiments compare different embeddings in unsupervised models of hyponymy detection, showing that Word2Hyp models with posterior vectors outperform Word2Vec vectors. This confirms the hypothesis that posterior vectors are a better model of word semantics than likelihood vectors. The experiments compared different embeddings in unsupervised models of hyponymy detection, showing that Word2Hyp models with posterior vectors outperform Word2Vec vectors. The average precision score and accuracy patterns were similar. The semi-supervised experiments showed no advantage of GoogleNews vectors over Wikipedia vectors for Word2Vec reinterpretation. The experiments compared different embeddings in unsupervised models of hyponymy detection, showing that Word2Hyp models with posterior vectors outperform Word2Vec vectors. The posterior vectors achieved 86% accuracy and nearly 93% average precision. Training with posterior vectors took longer than with Word2Vec, with Word2Hyp CBOW training about 8 times faster than Word2Hyp Skipgram. The text discusses the use of a quadrature approximation to speed up computation of the sigmoid function and log-sigmoid function in distributional semantic models for hyponymy detection. The success of the models indicates capture of lexical entailment aspects, but the gap between unsupervised and semi-supervised results suggests other factors are also being captured. A table ranks the abstractness of frequent words in the hyponymy dataset using Word2Hyp-Skipgram-posterior embeddings. The text discusses measuring abstractness using unsupervised embeddings and the entailed zero log-odds vector. An initial ranking showed that abstract words had low frequency in the data, indicating a problem with the method. Terms with frequency greater than 300 were ranked for abstractness. The paper proposes unsupervised methods for training word embeddings that capture semantic entailment, building on previous work by BID4. The most abstract terms in the study include \"something\" and \"anything,\" while the least abstract terms are very specific. The model does not disambiguate words by part-of-speech, leading to lexical ambiguity in some terms. The study proposes unsupervised methods for training word embeddings that capture semantic entailment, with empirical results showing that the model's posterior vectors outperform all previous results on benchmark datasets. The success of these unsupervised models demonstrates the effectiveness of distributional semantic models in extracting information about lexical entailment from large text corpora. The entailment-vectors framework has been crucial for modeling entailment relations efficiently. Future work may leverage this framework in unsupervised models for compositional semantics. The merger of word embeddings with compositional semantics for representation learning in larger text units is a significant challenge in natural language semantics, and this paper contributes towards solving it."
