    "content": "The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request included $41.86 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, with $13.26 billion for State operations and $28.60 billion for foreign operations. This represented a 23.3% decrease in funding compared to FY2018 levels. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $54.377 billion for SFOPS accounts, a 0.3% decrease from FY2018 but higher than the Administration's request. The FY2019 appropriations process was influenced by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased discretionary spending limits. This resulted in higher funding levels for defense and nondefense, including State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. The SFOPS appropriations bill details are provided in various appendices. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased discretionary spending limits, leading to higher funding levels for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) by $68 billion. The SFOPS spending is categorized as enduring (base) funds or funds for overseas contingency operations (OCO), with OCO funds not counting towards spending limits. The OCO designation became more significant with the enactment of the BCA. The Obama and Trump administrations expanded OCO use for various countries and activities. In FY2019, the Administration did not request foreign affairs OCO funds due to increased spending limits from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The final legislation included $8.0 billion designated as OCO, about 15% of enacted SFOPS funding. House and Senate SFOPS Legislation for FY2019 proposed funding levels slightly higher than FY2018, but neither bill received floor consideration. Continuing Resolutions were signed into law on September 28, 2018. In December 2018, funding for SFOPS was extended through December 21, 2018, but a partial government shutdown occurred after funding lapsed. An agreement was reached on January 25 to continue funding through February 15 at the FY2018 level. On February 14, a full year appropriation was passed with $54.38 billion in total SFOPS funding, a 0.3% decrease. The full year appropriation passed with $54.38 billion in total SFOPS funding, a 0.3% decrease from FY2018 levels. $16.46 billion was allocated for State Department operations, $37.92 billion for foreign operations accounts, and $8.0 billion designated as OCO. The State Department sought a 19% cut in funding for FY2019, while the House and Senate committee bills aimed to maintain funding near previous levels. The House committee bill proposed $16.38 billion, and the Senate committee bill suggested $16.34 billion for the Department of State and Related Agency category. The FY2019 enacted appropriation (P.L. 116-6) provided $16.46 billion for the State Department and Related Agency category, a 0.9% increase from FY2018. The State Department's request moved $3.69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations into the base budget request. The House committee bill proposed $3.03 billion for OCO, 28% less than FY2018. The FY2019 enacted appropriation (P.L. 116-6) provided $16.46 billion for the State Department and Related Agency category, a 0.9% increase from FY2018. The law allocated $4.37 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), 4.5% more than FY2018. The State Department's proposed cuts focused on diplomatic security accounts. The FY2019 enacted appropriation (P.L. 116-6) provided $16.46 billion for the State Department and Related Agency category, with a focus on diplomatic security accounts. The State Department also requested $246.2 million for the Leadership and Modernization Impact Initiative, part of the department's \"Redesign\" efforts. Both the House and Senate committee bills included provisions for oversight of broader reorganization efforts at the department. The enacted legislation, P.L. 116-6, allowed Congress to oversee reorganization efforts at the State Department. Proposed changes to selected accounts within the State Department and Related Agency category were outlined in Table 3. The Diplomatic Programs account, the State Department's main operating appropriation, saw a decrease in funding in the FY2019 budget request. The House and Senate committee bills proposed different funding amounts for Diplomatic Programs, with the final enacted amount being $9.17 billion, a 4% increase from FY2018. The FY2019 enacted legislation, P.L. 116-6, provided $9.17 billion, which is 4% more than FY2018 funding and 17% more than the State Department's request. A new \"Consular and Border Security Programs\" account was established to deposit consular fees for administering programs. The State Department requested renaming the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account to \"Diplomatic Programs.\" Consular fees retained by the State Department do not count against annual appropriations for this account. The FY2019 enacted legislation, P.L. 116-6, authorized the renaming of Diplomatic and Consular Programs to Diplomatic Programs. The account funds U.S. direct hire positions, including State Department officers. The hiring freeze was lifted in April 2017, but the State Department kept its own freeze until May 2018. Concerns were raised about personnel shortages at the Department of State. Section 7073 of P.L. 116-6 prohibits the State Department from changing personnel levels without consulting the appropriate congressional committees. The Secretary of State must submit reports every 60 days on personnel levels, hiring, and attrition until September 30, 2020. The State Department is required to submit reports every 60 days on personnel levels, hiring, and attrition until September 30, 2020. These reports must include a hiring plan to maintain Foreign Service and Civil Service personnel numbers at December 31, 2017, levels through FY2019. Congress encourages increasing hiring above these levels as needed. Funding for diversity programs in the Foreign Service is provided through the Human Resources category within Diplomatic Programs. The State Department has the discretion to fund the Rangel and Pickering programs at appropriate levels from appropriated Human Resources funds. Congress supports increasing diversity in hiring and expanding workforce diversity programs. The Senate committee recommends the continued expansion of these programs. The State Department is expanding workforce diversity programs and directing qualified graduates of the Rangel and Pickering programs to be inducted into the Foreign Service. Funding from the Diplomatic Programs account supports overseas programs, including those by the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations and the Bureau of Medical Services for healthcare services for government employees and their families. Public diplomacy programs are also funded through this account. Public diplomacy programs, including countering state disinformation activities funded through Diplomatic Programs, aim to enhance local resilience against disinformation and coordinate U.S. efforts in specific sub-regions. The House committee report expressed concern about foreign propaganda threatening national security, particularly from China, Russia, and extremist groups. The GEC, funded by the State Department, is tasked with countering foreign state propaganda and disinformation, especially from China, Russia, and extremist groups. The Senate committee recommended up to $75.4 million for the GEC, with $40 million allocated for this purpose. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act authorized the Department of Defense to transfer up to $60 million to the GEC for FY2019 and FY2020. The State Department's FY2019 budget request included $5.36 billion for embassy security accounts, with $3.70 billion for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and $1.66 billion for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM). The House committee bill proposed $6.07 billion for these accounts, with $3.76 billion for WSP and $2.31 billion for ESCM. The Senate committee bill suggested $5.74 billion in total funding, with $3.82 billion for WSP and $1.92 billion for ESCM. Funding for ESCM would come from the base budget, while WSP would receive some funds from Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The FY2019 enacted appropriations provided a total of $6.08 billion in budget authority for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM). The funding for ESCM was exclusively through the base budget, while WSP received some funds through Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). Compared to FY2018 figures, there was a 9% increase in funding for WSP and a 15% decrease for ESCM. Congress has provided no-year appropriations for both WSP and ESCM in recent years. In recent years, Congress has provided no-year appropriations for Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM), allowing the State Department to retain funds indefinitely. For FY2018, over $7.6 billion was carried over for ESCM. The House and Senate committee bills proposed to continue this practice for WSP and ESCM. The House bill suggested funds for ESCM to remain available until September 30, 2023, instead of indefinitely. P.L. 116-6 provided no-year appropriations for WSP. The law stipulated that funds for worldwide security upgrades and acquisition and construction within the ESCM account would remain available until expended, while other funds for real property maintenance would be available only until September 30, 2023. The WSP allocation supports security programs at overseas and domestic State Department offices, including a guard force. The State Department requested a rescission of $301.20 million for WSP OCO funds. The State Department requested a rescission of $301.20 million for WSP OCO funds provided through the SAAA. This proposed cancellation was based on evolving security and political conditions, and would not affect DS operations. P.L. 116-6 provided for a rescission of $301.2 million of SAAA funds appropriated for Diplomatic Programs. The State Department requested $869.54 million for secure facilities overseas, part of the $2.20 billion recommended by the Benghazi ARB. This funding would support new posts, maintenance, and exceed the ARB's annual recommendation. The Senate committee bill stipulated that not less than $1.02 billion shall be made available for the department's FY2019 CSCS and MCS contributions. In FY2019, OBO intended to fund four CSCS projects and one MCS project. The House committee report expressed concern with the cost of new embassy and consulate compound projects. Congress provided the same amount for this purpose for FY2019. The State Department was mandated by Congress to provide detailed reports on the costs of embassy projects, particularly the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. The department opened the new embassy in May 2018, located in a building that previously housed consular operations. Plans are in place to construct an embassy annex and consider options for a permanent embassy in the long term. The State Department is considering options for a permanent embassy in Jerusalem, with plans to use unobligated funds for construction expenses. The Senate committee requires regular updates on the status of the new embassy compound. The FY2019 budget request includes a 20% reduction in funding for international organizations and peacekeeping activities. The CIO account funds U.S. contributions to international organizations, including the United Nations and NATO. The FY2019 request for CIO was $1.10 billion, increased by $100 million after the BBA passage. The department's request may lead to arrears with some organizations due to exceeding U.N. assessments. The CIPA account supports U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping activities. The Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account provides U.S. funding for U.N. peacekeeping missions worldwide. The State Department's FY2019 request for CIPA was $1.20 billion, aiming to share the funding burden more fairly among U.N. members. The request capped U.S. contributions at 25% of assessed expenses for a single operation. The State Department anticipated covering any unfunded portion through a reduced U.S. assessed rate. The State Department requested funds for CIPA and CIO, with the House committee bill proposing $2.95 billion, 29% higher than the department's request. The Senate committee bill would have provided $1.44 billion for CIO and $1.68 billion for CIPA. The Senate committee bill proposed $3.12 billion for CIO and CIPA, 36% higher than the department's request and 9% higher than FY2018. It included a provision to pay the full fiscal year 2019 US assessment for international organizations. Both House and Senate reports aimed to support peacekeeping costs at 25% statutory level, calling for cost-saving reviews and renegotiation of assessment rates. P.L. 116-6 allocated $1.36 billion for CIO and $1.55 billion for CIPA in FY2019. For FY2019, P.L. 116-6 provided $2.91 billion for CIO and CIPA, slightly less than committee bills but 2% higher than FY2018. The law assumed payment of full U.S. assessments for relevant organizations funded through the CIO account, with exceptions for withdrawn organizations. Consultation with Committees on Appropriations was required for any decision not to provide full assessments. Additionally, sufficient funds were allocated for contributions to peacekeeping missions through CIPA. The enacted legislation provided funds for contributions to peacekeeping missions at the statutory level of 25%. The State Department requested $246.2 million for FY2019 to implement the Impact Initiative, which is part of the State Department's \"Redesign\" project initiated by former Secretary Tillerson in 2017 to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The Impact Initiative includes 16 modernization projects in three focus areas. The State Department requested $246.2 million for FY2019 to implement modernization projects focused on Technology and Human Resources Operations, Modernizing Global Presence, and Creating and Implementing Policy, aimed at improving operational efficiencies. The funding includes $150.0 million from the IT Central Fund and $96.2 million from the D&CP account. These projects were derived from a listening tour initiated by former Secretary Tillerson in 2017, involving interviews with 300 individuals and a survey completed by 35,000 department personnel. The State Department requested $246.2 million for FY2019 for modernization projects focused on Technology and Human Resources Operations. This includes $150.0 million from the IT Central Fund and $96.2 million from the D&CP account. The projects aim to modernize IT infrastructure, systems, and applications, as well as address Human Resources issues such as leadership development and data analytics. The law and joint explanatory statement prohibit the Department of State from implementing a reorganization without prior consultation. The State Department requested $28.60 billion for foreign aid programs in FY2019, a 28% decrease from FY2018. Funds cannot be used to reorganize without consulting Congress. Foreign operations accounts fund various aid programs including economic, humanitarian, and security assistance. The FY2019 enacted appropriation provided $37.92 billion for foreign operations account, including $3.63 billion designated as OCO. Total enacted foreign aid within the international affairs budget was $39.85 billion, 0.7% below the FY2018 actual funding level. Account mergers and eliminations were proposed to simplify the foreign operations budget by channeling funds through fewer accounts and eliminating certain programs. The FY2019 foreign operations budget proposed merging and eliminating accounts, including zero funding for Development Assistance, Economic Support Fund, Assistance to Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia, and Democracy Fund. These programs would have been funded through a new Economic Support and Development Fund, with a proposed funding level of $5.063 billion, 36% lower than FY2018. Fifteen countries would no longer receive funding, and the International Organizations & Programs account, funding U.S. contributions to UN entities, would have been zeroed out. The FY2019 budget proposed merging and eliminating accounts, including zero funding for Development Assistance, Economic Support Fund, Assistance to Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia, and Democracy Fund. The Administration also proposed terminating the Inter-American Foundation and U.S.-Africa Development Foundation, consolidating small U.S. assistance grants into a new fund. The Administration proposed consolidating small grant programs to reach the poor under USAID for better integration with larger development programs and U.S. foreign policy objectives. Funds were requested for an orderly closeout of IAF and ADF. A new Development Finance Institution (DFI) was requested in FY2019 by merging OPIC and DCA, with $96 million for administrative expenses and $38 million for credit subsidies. $56 million in ESDF funds would support DFI operations. The Administration proposed creating a new International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) to incentivize private sector investment in development. Congress rejected the proposed changes to funding accounts in the FY2019 SFOPS legislation, maintaining the FY2018 bilateral account structure. The BUILD Act authorized the establishment of IDFC before the final FY2019 SFOPS appropriation was enacted. The FY2019 appropriations included the establishment of the International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) and allocated $5 million for transition costs. Top recipients of foreign assistance remained similar, with increases for Israel, Zambia, and Uganda, while other recipients saw reduced aid compared to FY2017. The FY2019 foreign operations budget allocations showed reductions in aid for top recipients compared to FY2017. Proposed cuts ranged from 61% in Europe and Eurasia to 2% in the Middle East and North Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA remained the top regional recipients, comprising nearly 80% of aid allocated by region. The House and Senate bills specified aid allocations for various countries and regional programs, including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Iraq, West Bank & Gaza, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Colombia, and Central America. The enacted legislation reduced aid to South and Central Asia by 4% and to the Western Hemisphere by 35%. In FY2019, the enacted legislation specified aid levels for countries like Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Colombia, Mexico, and Ukraine, as well as for Central America and the Countering Russian Influence Fund. The budget submission did not include any new foreign assistance initiatives, with a focus on decreasing foreign aid funding while prioritizing global health, humanitarian, and security assistance. The Administration requested a 23% reduction in global health funding for FY2019. In FY2019, global health programs faced a 23% reduction in funding compared to FY2018. Despite this cut, global health programs would have increased slightly as a proportion of the foreign aid budget. HIV/AIDS programs would continue to receive the majority of global health funding, with a proposed 27% cut from FY2018 levels. Family planning and reproductive health services would have seen a 42% reduction in funding. Assistance levels for various health sectors, including maternal and child health, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases, would have also been reduced compared to FY2018. In FY2019, global health programs faced funding reductions for various sectors, including HIV/AIDS, family planning, and neglected tropical diseases. The House committee bill proposed maintaining total funding for global health programs at $8.69 billion, with cuts to family planning and increases to polio, nutrition, and global health security. The Senate committee bill proposed funding global health programs at $8.792 billion, with slight increases across various sectors. Both bills included language preventing the misuse of appropriated funds. The House bill included a provision prohibiting aid to foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform voluntary abortion, while the Senate bill did not. P.L. 116-6 allocated $8.84 billion for global health programs in FY2019, a 1.7% increase from FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request for humanitarian assistance was $6.358 billion, a decrease from FY2018 funding. The Trump Administration proposed a decrease in funding for the International Disaster Assistance account in FY2019. They also sought to eliminate the Food for Peace and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance accounts, suggesting that activities could be funded more efficiently through other accounts. Additionally, the Administration requested authority to transfer and merge IDA and MRA base funds. The MRA request focused on conflict displacement in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as strengthening bilateral relationships with key refugee hosting countries. The House committee proposed $9.145 billion for humanitarian assistance accounts, while the Senate committee proposed $9.534 billion, with slight variations in funding allocations. In FY2019, Congress provided $9.534 billion for humanitarian assistance, with $1.716 billion for Food for Peace and $1 million for the ERMA account. The bills did not authorize broad transfers between IDA and MRA accounts, but allowed for transfers in response to infectious disease outbreaks. The funding was almost the same as FY2018, with 21% designated as OCO. The FY2019 security assistance request totaled $7.304 billion, a 19% reduction from FY2018. 63% of the request was for FMF aid to Israel and Egypt. Six countries were identified as joint DOD and State Department security sector assistance priorities. Reductions were proposed for INCLE, NADR, and IMET accounts, with a focus on concentrating resources for maximum value. The FY2019 security assistance request included reductions in the Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) accounts, with a focus on concentrating resources for maximum value and U.S. national security impact. The PKO account saw the biggest reduction (-46%), while the FMF account was reduced by 13% compared to FY2018. Specific allocations were proposed for 11 countries and a $75 million Global Fund for flexible allocation.

Funding for most accounts remained similar to FY2018 levels, except for INCLE, which increased by 9.4% to address illegal opioids, and PKO, which decreased by 9.2%. Bilateral economic development assistance includes programs in education, agriculture, governance, microfinance, and environmental management, implemented by USAID and other agencies. In FY2019, bilateral economic development assistance in the Administration's request totaled $6.354 billion, a 33% reduction from FY2018 levels. Key sectors such as food security, democracy promotion programs, and education saw significant cuts compared to FY2018 levels. The Administration also proposed merging I-AF and USADF into USAID, with small amounts of funding requested to close out their independent activities. The House committee bill would have provided $9.383 billion for economic development assistance. The House committee bill allocated $9.383 billion for economic development assistance, with specified allocations for education, conservation programs, food security, microenterprise, water and sanitation, and democracy programs. The Senate committee bill proposed $9.764 billion for economic development activities, with allocations for education, environment, food security, micro credit, water and sanitation, and democracy programs. Both bills funded various programs at FY2018 levels and rejected the Administration's proposal to merge I-AF and USADF into USAID. The enacted appropriation for FY2019, P.L. 116-6, provided $9.239 billion for nonhealth economic development aid. Minimum allocations included $1.035 billion for education, $285 million for biodiversity conservation, $125 million for sustainable landscapes, $1.001 billion for food security, $265 million for micro and small enterprises, $67 million to combat trafficking, and $435 million for water and sanitation programs. Independent agencies were funded at FY2018 levels. Foreign food aid programs like P.L. 480 Title II Food for Peace and McGovern-Dole International Food for Education are not part of the Department of State's appropriation. The Foreign Claim Settlement Commission and International Trade Commission are funded under different appropriations. The Department of State's appropriation also includes funding for international commissions not part of the International Affairs Function 150 account."
