    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Government Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Accountability Act.\" Congress finds that inefficiency, ineffectiveness, and unaccountability in Federal programs undermine confidence in the Government, hinder program improvement efforts, handicap policy making and oversight, and necessitate the identification and sharing of performance data among similar programs to enhance their results. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 aimed to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in Federal programs by focusing on program results and monitoring long-term goals and annual performance. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 aimed to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in Federal programs by focusing on program results and monitoring long-term goals and annual performance. Congress believes the President should establish a government-wide strategic and performance plan, and each Federal agency head should consult with relevant committees and Congress on the agency's performance plan. The Act aims to improve the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 by assessing Federal programs for efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. It also aims to help the executive branch make informed management decisions and provide congressional policymakers with information for more effective oversight. The Act aims to improve oversight, authorization decisions, and spending decisions for effective Federal programs. It also aims to eliminate wasteful programs, identify best practices, track low-performing programs, and respond quickly to poor performance. SEC. 5. PROGRAM ASSESSMENT. The Program Assessment section of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires Federal agencies to assess their programs every 5 fiscal years in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. This assessment includes evaluating program purpose, design, strategic plan, management, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. The Program Assessment section of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 mandates Federal agencies to assess their programs every 5 fiscal years. This includes evaluating program purpose, design, strategic plan, management, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. After assessment, the agency must determine how to save taxpayers money, merge duplicative programs, and identify best practices for resource allocation. The Federal agencies are required to assess their programs every 5 fiscal years to evaluate purpose, design, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Criteria are developed to identify programs for assessment based on similar functions, purposes, goals, or outcomes. The head of each Federal agency, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, should assess programs more frequently if they are of higher priority, special circumstances exist, improvements have been made, or if deemed necessary. The Office of Management and Budget will develop a system to cross-reference programs to identify duplicative missions and outcomes, and to find best practices for resource allocation. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on program assessments at the beginning of each fiscal year to ensure efficient resource allocation and cost savings. The final performance goals, criteria for evaluation, and public comments on program assessments will be included in a report to Congress along with results and any modifications to the Federal Government performance plan. The report to Congress will include details on program assessments, best practices for resource allocation, recommendations for improving low-performing programs, actions taken by agency heads, and availability in electronic form. During a fiscal year, assessments with classified information must be submitted to appropriate committees of jurisdiction in the House of Representatives and the Senate, along with an appendix listing the assessments and the committees they were submitted to. Requests for these assessments can be made by the Committee on Government Reform or the Committee on Governmental Affairs. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must provide classified assessments and appendices to the House of Representatives and Senate committees. The functions authorized by this section are considered inherently governmental and must be performed by Federal employees. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with Federal agencies, will develop a process to control and certify the quality of data from assessments. Requirements of this section will end on September 30, 2017. Guidance will be provided within 6 months to implement the new requirements, including a definition of the term \"program.\" Amendments will be made to align with the new section 1120 of title 31, United States Code. The table of sections in chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by replacing \"1119\" with \"1120\". SEC. 6. STRATEGIC PLANNING AMENDMENTS. The deadline for the strategic plan is changed to September 30 of each year following a presidential election starting in 2009. Each plan will cover a 4-year period beginning on October 1 after a presidential election."
