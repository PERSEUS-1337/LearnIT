    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Terror-Free Skies Act of 2017\". It includes findings related to the Act. Iran is designated as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism and a direct threat to the national security of the United States and its allies. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of Iran provides material and financial support to foreign terrorist organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Kata'ib Hezbollah. Iran also uses its national air carrier, Iran Air, and other Iranian and Syrian air carriers to transport weapons, troops, and military equipment for the IRGC and Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics. Iran Air, designated by the US Treasury for supporting IRGC, was removed from the sanctions list in 2016 despite continuing to assist the IRGC since 2006. Iran Air, owned by the Government of Iran, has flown unscheduled flights on weapons supply routes between Iran and Syria since January 16, 2016. The Treasury Department has not confirmed the cessation of Iran Air's illicit activities. Iran Air, owned by the Government of Iran, has continued illicit activities in support of IRGC, MODAFL, Hezbollah, and the Bashar al-Assad regime since January 16, 2016. The Government of Iran's use of commercial aircraft for illicit military activities is being reported. The President must submit a report every 180 days on Iran's use of commercial aircraft for illicit military activities, in consultation with key officials. The report will cover a 5-year period for the first submission and a 180-day period for subsequent reports. The commercial aviation sector of Iran, including Iran Air, has been involved in transporting illicit cargo, providing support to various military entities and terrorist organizations. Iran Air and other Iranian commercial air carriers may be designated as specially designated nationals if they are found to have used commercial aircraft for illicit military purposes after January 16, 2016. This determination would be made by the President and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury within 90 days. The appropriate congressional committees would be informed of this decision. The Senate Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence, along with the House Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and Intelligence, are involved in the designation of Iranian commercial air carriers as specially designated nationals if they are found to have used aircraft for illicit military purposes. SEC. 4. SUNSET. This Act will end 30 days after the President certifies to Congress that Iran has stopped supporting international terrorism."
