    "content": "Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the US, with 480,000 deaths annually. The economic costs of smoking totaled over $289 billion between 2009 and 2012. Despite a decline in cigarette use, 34.2 million American adults and 1.2 million students still smoke. Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), like e-cigarettes, have gained popularity, especially among youth. The use of e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), has increased among both adults and youth. While some believe ENDS are a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, concerns have been raised about the impact on public health, especially among youth. The emergence of vaping-related lung injuries has resulted in numerous hospitalizations and deaths. The use-associated lung injury (EVALI) has raised concerns with 60 deaths and 2,711 hospitalizations as of January 21, 2020. The FDA regulates tobacco products through the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) established in 2009 under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) within CTP provides recommendations on tobacco regulatory decisions. The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) consists of 12 members with diverse expertise. FDA regulates tobacco products differently from medical products, with a focus on public health protection. Tobacco manufacturers must meet specific requirements for registration, premarket review, and marketing authorization. Compliance with tobacco-specific regulations is mandatory for manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers. The FDA regulates tobacco products with a focus on public health protection. Importers, distributors, and retailers must comply with tobacco-specific requirements authorized under the TCA. These requirements include standards development, ingredient testing, health information submission, and distribution restrictions. The report outlines FDA's authority, general manufacturer requirements, unique tobacco product requirements, and compliance/enforcement. Policy issues and considerations for Congress are also discussed. Appendices detail the IQOS Tobacco Heating System and Tobacco Master Settlement. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System is discussed in the appendices of the report, which also covers the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement of 1998. The FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products under the TCA, with specific definitions provided in the report. The FFDCA excludes drugs, devices, and combination products from the definition of tobacco products, subjecting them to chapter V authorities. The FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products under the TCA, with specific definitions provided in the report. FDA promulgated regulations to assist manufacturers marketing tobacco-derived products based on their \"intended uses.\" The TCA explicitly covered certain tobacco products, but FDA has broad authority to regulate others under the FFDCA. In 2016, FDA extended its authority over all tobacco products, including ENDS, through the deeming rule. The FDA has authority over all tobacco products not covered by the TCA, including ENDS, cigars, pipe tobacco, and more. Manufacturers must comply with requirements such as user fees, registration, premarket review, and postmarket surveillance. FDA collects user fees from domestic manufacturers and importers to support CTP's activities. The FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is funded solely by user fees collected from tobacco manufacturers and importers. Unlike other FDA centers, CTP's tobacco product fee authorities are indefinite and do not require reauthorization. These user fees are assessed quarterly and the total amount collected each year is specified in statute. The FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is funded by user fees collected from tobacco manufacturers and importers, totaling $712 million for FY2019 and subsequent years. User fees are assessed on six tobacco product classes specified in statute, following the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 (FETRA) framework. The FETRA provisions determine allocations for each class and individual domestic manufacturer and importer allocations within each class. The FDA determines allocations for tobacco product classes based on FETRA provisions. User fees are assessed on specific classes, but not on ENDS manufacturers, hookah tobacco, or other newly deemed products due to lack of specified classes by Congress. Domestic tobacco manufacturers must register with FDA and make their information public. The FDA requires domestic tobacco product manufacturers to register and submit product listing information annually. This includes details like product category, unique name, labeling, and consumer information for each tobacco product. Manufacturers are encouraged to list each product separately if they differ in any way. FDA guidance allows for grouping related tobacco products under one labeling, reducing the burden on registrants. Registration and product listing can be done online through FDA's FURLS TRLM. Biennial inspections are mandatory for registered tobacco product manufacturers to review processes, identify violations, and propose corrective actions. Inspections must occur at least once every two years after initial registration. FDA personnel are authorized to inspect tobacco product manufacturers to ensure compliance with regulations and good manufacturing practices. Inspections must be conducted at reasonable times and include a written report detailing any health risks observed during the inspection. Regulations outline methods, facilities, and controls for manufacturing, packing, and storage of tobacco products to protect public health. The FDA regulates the manufacture, packing, and storage of tobacco products to protect public health. Manufacturers can recommend modifications to regulations before they are finalized. FDA has not yet issued GMP regulations, but tobacco companies have submitted recommendations for consideration. The FDA established a public docket for comments on tobacco companies' recommendations in 2013 but did not take further action on promulgating GMP regulations. The 2016 deeming rule granted FDA authority to issue GMP regulations for ENDS products, leading to industry stakeholders submitting recommendations. A public docket was opened in 2017 for comments on proposed ENDS GMPs, but no further action has been taken since then. The FDA has four premarket review pathways for tobacco products: PMTA, SE, SE exemption, and MRTP. Manufacturers need FDA authorization to market new tobacco products, unless they are substantially equivalent to a predicate product or exempt. Products covered by the TCA must undergo premarket review, including newly deemed products. FDA announced in July 2017 its requirements for premarket review. In July 2017, FDA announced its Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation, which included extending premarket review deadlines for newly deemed tobacco products. Legal challenges followed, leading to a court ruling in May 2019 imposing deadlines for application submissions and reviews. Since 2014, most new tobacco products have been marketed through the SE pathway, with challenges in preparing submissions for PMTA, SE, and MRTP pathways. FDA issued rules on SE reports in April 2019 and PMTA submissions for ENDS in June 2019, with a proposed rule on PMTA applications in September 2019. As of February 2020, FDA has not set a timeline for a final rule on PMTA. To legally market a new tobacco product that is not substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product, a marketing authorization order is required. The application for a PMTA order must demonstrate that the product is \"appropriate for the protection of public health\" by considering risks and benefits to users and nonusers. PMTA applications must include health risk investigations, product components, manufacturing methods, compliance with standards, and product samples. FDA has 180 days to decide on a PMTA application for a new tobacco product. Marketing can be restricted if authorized, and FDA can deny the application for various reasons such as public health concerns, manufacturing issues, false labeling, or non-compliance with standards. FDA can also withdraw or suspend a PMTA order if the product is no longer suitable for marketing. The FDA can withdraw or suspend a PMTA order if the tobacco product's marketing is no longer appropriate for public health, if false information is found in the application, if records are not maintained, if labeling is misleading, or if the product does not meet standards. Applicants may need to provide postmarket surveillance reports to the FDA. A new tobacco product is considered equivalent to a predicate product if it has similar characteristics or if any differences do not raise public health concerns. A tobacco product can serve as a predicate product if it was marketed before February 15, 2007, or deemed substantially equivalent to another product. If a new product is substantially equivalent, the manufacturer must submit a report to the FDA 90 days before market introduction. Products removed, adulterated, or misbranded cannot be predicate products. Products introduced between Feb 15, 2007, and Mar 22, 2011, can stay on the market while the FDA reviews the SE report. If a new tobacco product was introduced between February 15, 2007, and March 22, 2011, it could remain on the market while the FDA reviewed the manufacturer's SE report, as long as the report was submitted before March 23, 2011. The SE report should include details like design features, ingredients, heating source, and health information. FDA evaluates the scientific data in the report and issues a SE order letter accordingly. The FDA evaluates scientific data in SE reports for new tobacco products to determine if a SE order or NSE order is needed. Minor modifications to a tobacco product may be exempt from demonstrating substantial equivalence if deemed appropriate for public health protection. An exemption must be granted before the product can be legally marketed. A manufacturer must submit a SE exemption report detailing minor modifications to a tobacco product, establishing FDA exemption from demonstrating substantial equivalence. The report must explain the purpose and description of the modification, why it is minor, why a SE report is not needed, and certify that the modification does not increase harm or appeal to minors. ENDS manufacturers may seek MRTP pathway approval to market products that reduce tobacco-related disease risk. An MRTP order is required before interstate commerce. Products without an MRTP order cannot be marketed with reduced harm claims or certain descriptors. Manufacturers seeking MRTP pathway approval must provide detailed information in their application, including product description, advertising, labeling, conditions of use, formulation, research findings on health effects, and information on reducing risk. The FDA requires detailed information in MRTP applications, including data on product use and health effects. TPSAC evaluates health claims and provides recommendations to the FDA within 60 days. If approved, an MRTP order can be issued for up to five years if the product significantly reduces harm and benefits public health. Renewal of the MRTP order is required to continue marketing the product. A manufacturer may need to seek renewal of the MRTP order for certain tobacco products that do not meet the standard of significantly reducing harm. To market a tobacco product with an MRTP order, the manufacturer must demonstrate that it promotes public health and limits claims to reduced exposure to harmful substances. Scientific evidence must show a potential reduction in morbidity or mortality among users. To market a tobacco product with an MRTP order, manufacturers must agree to postmarket surveillance and studies on consumer perception, behavior, and health. FDA reviews surveillance protocols within 60 days to determine if data collection is sufficient for public health protection. FDA can regulate labeling, advertising, and comparing claims between products with an MRTP order and others on the market. The FDA regulates tobacco products with MRTP orders, requiring disclosure of health-affecting substances. The FDA can withdraw an MRTP order if new information shows it's no longer permissible, if the product doesn't reduce risk, or if postmarket surveillance is lacking. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research oversees tobacco-derived products making health claims, like nicotine replacement therapies. The FDA regulates tobacco products with MRTP orders, requiring disclosure of health-affecting substances. Prescription medications like Chantix and Zyban have been approved for smoking cessation. ENDS manufacturers making health claims would likely need approval from CDER. Tobacco product manufacturers must comply with specific requirements due to the unique harms of tobacco products. The Tobacco Control Act (TCA) gave FDA authority to adopt standards to protect public health from harmful tobacco products, but cannot ban certain tobacco products. New standards can regulate manufacturing, packaging, and distribution requirements for tobacco products. The FDA can set requirements for ingredients, additives, components, or parts allowed in tobacco products, testing and compliance with standards, measurement of product characteristics, appropriate labeling, and limited sale and distribution. Scientific evidence on risks and benefits to the population is considered before proposing a new standard, with a public comment period required. The FDA can establish tobacco product standards after a public comment period of at least 60 days. If deemed appropriate for public health, a final regulation must be issued, with a one-year waiting period before it takes effect. Standards can be reevaluated periodically and amended or revoked through FDA or citizen petitions. The FDA can establish tobacco product standards through public comment periods. A proposed rule for revoking an existing standard would be issued for public input. The agency must find the standard no longer protects public health to revoke it. Congress recognized flavors can make tobacco products more appealing to youth and expose users to harmful substances. FDA has the authority to ban characterizing flavors under Section 907 of the FFDCA. The Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) recommended the removal of menthol cigarettes from the market for public health benefits. The FDA is considering establishing a tobacco product standard for menthol in cigarettes, seeking input through public rulemaking. The FDA is considering establishing a tobacco product standard for menthol in cigarettes, seeking input through public rulemaking. Former Commissioner Gottlieb expressed interest in accelerating the promulgation of this tobacco product standard. FDA released an ANPRM in March 2018, \"Regulation of Flavors in Tobacco Products,\" that requested public comments on the role of flavors in tobacco products. In January 2020, FDA stated its intention to issue a proposed rule to ban characterizing flavors in cigars. The FDA's Comprehensive Plan aims to regulate tobacco products based on scientific evidence and public input, including potentially lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels. In March 2018, the FDA released an ANPRM seeking public comments on setting a maximum nicotine level for cigarettes and potentially other tobacco products. The comment period closed in July 2018 with nearly 8,000 comments received. The FDA has not taken further regulatory action on testing and reporting of tobacco product constituents as of February 2020. Once regulations are promulgated, manufacturers may be required to disclose tar and nicotine testing results to protect public health and prevent consumer deception. Tobacco product manufacturers must provide health information, including a list of ingredients and harmful constituents, to the FDA. Small manufacturers may have additional time to comply, and the FDA can delay compliance on a case-by-case basis. Compliance policy focuses on ingredient listings as specified in guidance. FDA's compliance policy for ingredient listings focuses on finished tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, smokeless tobacco, and newly deemed tobacco products like ENDS. The policy also includes components or parts made from or containing tobacco-derived ingredients that are burned, aerosolized, or ingested during use. For example, e-liquids of ENDS are subject to ingredient listing requirements, while batteries are not. The term harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) refers to chemicals in tobacco products or smoke that can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed into the body, causing harm. The FDA established a list of 93 Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) in tobacco products by 2012, including toxicants, carcinogens, and addictive chemicals. Manufacturers are required to report HPHCs by brand and quantity, with specifications on the type of harm they cause. FDA released a 2012 draft guidance with an abbreviated list of HPHCs for tobacco products. They have not updated this guidance yet and do not intend to enforce reporting for newly deemed tobacco products until after the final guidance is published. In August 2019, FDA sought public comment on 19 additional HPHCs in ENDS products, with the comment period closing in October 2019. Tobacco manufacturers must submit all relevant health-related documents to FDA. The FDA has the authority to require tobacco product manufacturers to provide health-related documents on the effects of tobacco products. This includes studies on constituents, ingredients, and behavioral effects at both population and individual levels. Manufacturers may also need to report any serious adverse experiences related to their products. The FDA requires tobacco product manufacturers to report any serious adverse experiences related to their products. FDA issued proposed rules in 2019 regarding the content of these reports and record-keeping requirements. Prior to 2009, restrictions on tobacco product distribution were enforced at the state level. In 2009, the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) granted the FDA authority to regulate the sale, distribution, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products for public health protection. The FDA reissued its 1996 Tobacco Rule in 2010, with the 2016 deeming rule extending its applicability. The 2016 deeming rule extended sale and distribution restrictions, labeling, and advertising requirements to newly deemed tobacco products. In FY2020, Congress amended the federal minimum age of tobacco product purchasing from 18 to 21. The FFDCA prohibits retailers from selling tobacco products to anyone under 21 years old. The federal regulations on the minimum age for tobacco product sales were changed by P.L. 116-94 from 18 to 21 years old. Retailers are now required to verify the age of individuals under 30 who are purchasing tobacco products. FDA must update the regulations by June 20, 2020 to reflect these changes. The final rule for the minimum age for purchasing tobacco products is set to take effect by September 20, 2020. Regulations prohibit free samples of tobacco products and vending machine sales, except in adult-only facilities. Certain retail outlets are not restricted from selling tobacco products. Compliance with state laws on tobacco sales to minors varied before the enactment of the TCA. In 1992, the ADAHMA Reorganization Act included the Synar amendment aimed at reducing youth access to tobacco by requiring states to have laws prohibiting tobacco sales to individuals under 18 to receive full SABG funding. The SABG is a block grant program that distributes funds to states for substance use prevention, treatment, and recovery services. The Synar regulations require states to enforce laws prohibiting tobacco sales to individuals under 18 to receive full SABG funding. SAMHSA encourages states to include tobacco products most used by youth in retailer inspections to receive full SABG funding. Congress amended the Synar amendment to require states to conduct annual, random inspections of retail outlets to prevent tobacco sales to those under 21. SAMSHA must update Synar regulations by June 20, 2020 to reflect these changes. The FCLAA and CSTHEA have labeling and advertising requirements for tobacco products. The Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA) imposes labeling requirements and advertising restrictions on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The FTC oversees these acts, including a ban on advertising these products on certain media platforms. Manufacturers, distributors, and retailers must comply with FDA regulations regarding labeling and advertising, including restrictions on sponsoring events with tobacco brand names. The Tobacco Control Act imposes restrictions on the marketing and branding of tobacco products. Labeling and advertising in audio and video formats are limited, with warning statements required. FDA regulations also require color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking. In 2011, FDA published a final rule requiring graphic warning labels on cigarette packaging, which was later vacated in 2012 on First Amendment grounds. FDA planned to propose a new graphic warning rule and was ordered to issue a proposed rule by mid-August 2019 and a final rule by mid-March 2020. The proposed rule specifies requirements for new cigarette health warnings. The FDA proposed new requirements for cigarette health warnings on August 16, 2019. The warnings would take up a significant portion of cigarette packages and advertisements. Non-compliance could result in various corrective actions by the FDA, including warning letters, penalties, and legal action. The FFDCA prohibits the adulteration and misbranding of tobacco products. The FDA prohibits the adulteration and misbranding of tobacco products, which includes contamination, unsanitary conditions, non-compliant packaging, and false labeling. The FDA prohibits adulteration and misbranding of tobacco products, including false advertising, sales to individuals under 21, and violations of regulations. FDA may require prior approval of labels on tobacco products but not advertisements, except for MRTPs. Compliance check inspections of tobacco retailers are carried out by FDA through contracts with states, territories, and third-party entities. FDA conducts undercover buy inspections to ensure tobacco retailers comply with federal laws. If a first-time violation is found, a warning letter is issued with no fines. Subsequent violations result in CMP complaints with fines based on the number of violations. The FDA enforces regulations on tobacco retailers, issuing warning letters for first-time violations and fines for subsequent violations. Fines vary based on the number of violations, and retailers may face a NTSO prohibiting tobacco sales. Congress amended the minimum age for tobacco purchases to 21, requiring updates in retail practices. FDA has conducted over a million compliance checks and issued thousands of warnings, fines, and NTSOs. During the ramp-up period, FDA will only use minors under 18 in its compliance check program. FDA can issue notifications and recalls for tobacco products presenting substantial harm to public health. Manufacturers or FDA can initiate a recall for FFDCA violations. FDA can mandate a recall for products causing serious health consequences or death. The FDA can issue an order to stop distribution of tobacco products and hold an informal hearing within 10 days. If evidence supports it, the order may include a recall with a specified timetable and progress reports. Stakeholders have raised concerns about FDA's regulation of tobacco products. The FDA and public health stakeholders are concerned about the rise in youth use of ENDS due to flavored products. While ENDS are seen as a safer alternative for adult smokers, there is worry that youth use may reverse progress in reducing smoking rates. The emergence of EVALI has increased concerns, leading to support for raising the minimum age for tobacco products to 21. Congress recently changed the minimum age for tobacco products to 21, but there are calls for further action to address youth tobacco use. Remote sales of tobacco products, including ENDS, pose challenges in enforcing purchasing restrictions for youth. FDA lacks authority to collect user fees from ENDS manufacturers, despite these products being regulated. The public health impact of ENDS is a topic of ongoing debate, with concerns about harm reduction and youth use. The public health impact of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) is debated, with concerns about harm reduction for adult smokers. ENDS have the potential to reduce harm among adult cigarette smokers, but data on their effectiveness as cessation tools are limited. The public health impact of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) is debated, with concerns about harm reduction for adult smokers. Limited evidence exists on the efficacy of ENDS as cessation aids compared to proven methods. Long-term health effects of ENDS are still unknown, and FDA has not approved them for cessation. Despite interest from adult smokers, the increase in ENDS use among youth, driven by flavored products, is concerning for public health. The availability of flavored ENDS products has created tension between industry and public health. Industry-funded research suggests flavored ENDS may help adult smokers quit, but studies show flavors entice youth to start and continue using tobacco products. The NASEM concluded that ENDS use among youth increases the risk of them using cigarettes. The FDA released a draft guidance document in March 2019 to enforce regulations on flavored ENDS products, prioritizing premarket review, distribution, and sale requirements to prevent youth access. In September 2019, FDA announced plans to finalize guidance on flavored e-cigarettes to combat youth use. Delays led to a Congressional hearing in December 2019. The final guidance, released in January 2020, focuses on premarket authorization based on product characteristics. Some stakeholders feel it doesn't do enough to reduce youth ENDS use. The final guidance on flavored e-cigarettes to combat youth use may not go far enough, leading Congress to consider further restrictions on flavors in ENDS products. Legislation introduced in the 116th Congress proposes banning all flavors, including menthol, in ENDS and other tobacco products. Congress may aim to reduce tobacco product use among youth while allowing ENDS for adult smokers. Concerns over the rise in youth ENDS use and the emergence of EVALI have prompted discussions on flavored tobacco products. The outbreak of EVALI began in June 2019, with 60 confirmed deaths and 2,711 hospitalized cases reported as of January 21, 2020. Most patients were male, under 35 years old, and had used THC-containing products. Vitamin E acetate, found in some THC-containing products, is closely associated with EVALI. The safety of inhaling vitamin E acetate has not been closely examined, although it is not generally associated with adverse health effects. FDA, CDC, and state/local health departments are investigating the issue of EVALI. FDA, DEA, and authorities are looking into the supply chain of ENDS linked to EVALI. 44 websites advertising illicit THC-containing vape cartridges have been seized, but none of the products are connected to EVALI cases. This raises questions about federal oversight of THC products in states where marijuana is legal. Compounds like THC are illegal at the federal level but some states have their own laws on marijuana. The DEA focuses on criminal networks in the illicit marijuana trade, so THC-containing ENDS products in states allowing marijuana may not be a priority for enforcement. ENDS products without tobacco components may not be considered tobacco products under FDA regulations and will be regulated on a case-by-case basis. The FDA regulates tobacco products on a case-by-case basis. Public health stakeholders support raising the minimum age of purchasing tobacco products to 21. Studies show that most smokers try their first cigarette before age 18. FDA's report concluded that raising the minimum age will likely prevent adolescent tobacco use. Raising the minimum age of tobacco product sales to 21 is expected to prevent or delay tobacco use initiation by adolescents and young adults. Congress amended the FFDCA in FY2020 to reflect this change, with FDA required to update regulations by June 20, 2020. Stakeholders view this positively, but some express concerns about the impact beyond age 21. Some health stakeholders view the positive impact of raising the minimum age of tobacco product sales to 21, but there are concerns about the tobacco industry supporting the initiative to avoid other measures. Remote sales of tobacco products, including ENDS, are seen as a way for minors to illegally purchase these products, with limitations on enforcement efforts due to the PACT Act of 2009. The Act restricts remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco but not other tobacco products like ENDS, complicating regulation and enforcement efforts. Legislation in the 116th Congress may ban all tobacco product remote sales, including ENDS. Congress could also amend the PACT Act to cover other tobacco products like ENDS. FDA does not collect user fees from ENDS manufacturers, so CTP uses fees from other tobacco products to address ENDS-specific issues. Some stakeholders suggest ENDS manufacturers and importers pay tobacco user fees to cover FDA's ENDS-related costs. However, FDA lacks authority to impose these fees without Congress specifying ENDS as a taxable class. Congress may need to amend laws to include ENDS in the tobacco product user fee formula. The FDA lacks authority to impose user fees on ENDS manufacturers without Congress amending laws to include ENDS in the taxable class. Recent interest in Congress and the executive branch suggests creating a new ENDS user fee program or amending existing laws to allow for ENDS user fees. The FDA requires ENDS manufacturers and importers to pay $100 million in user fees starting in FY2021. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System aerosolizes the tobacco plant itself and is considered a cigarette by the FDA, subject to additional regulations. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System uses Heatsticks to release nicotine-containing aerosol. The Holder warms the Heatstick for about six to seven minutes before needing to be charged. FDA received PMTAs from Phillip Morris International for the IQOS, seen as a potential precedent for ENDS products. The FDA authorized the IQOS Tobacco Heating System for marketing through PMTAs after substantial back and forth with Phillip Morris International. Concerns arise about small ENDS manufacturers lacking resources for the PMTA process and FDA potentially needing more resources for lengthy ENDS PMTA applications. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was reached with tobacco companies to recover costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Four states settled individually before the MSA. Companies agreed to make annual payments and adhere to restrictions on tobacco advertising. Prohibited targeting youth, use of cartoons, limited brand sponsorships, banned public transit and outdoor billboard advertising. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was signed by attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories to settle state lawsuits against major cigarette companies. The agreement included restrictions on tobacco advertising, such as banning company payments for cigarette promotion in various media and limiting the use of nationally recognized non-tobacco brand names for cigarettes. Additionally, the MSA prohibited gifts of non-cigarette items to youth in exchange for cigarettes and limited free samples of cigarettes to adult-only facilities. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was signed by attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories to settle state lawsuits against major cigarette companies. The MSA included restrictions on tobacco advertising, such as banning company payments for cigarette promotion in various media and limiting the use of nationally recognized non-tobacco brand names for cigarettes. Additionally, the agreement prohibited gifts of non-cigarette items to youth in exchange for cigarettes and limited free samples of cigarettes to adult-only facilities. The remaining four states - Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota - settled individually with the companies prior to the MSA. Under the terms of the MSA, the companies agreed to make annual payments in perpetuity and accept certain restrictions on tobacco product advertising, marketing, and promotion. Key restrictions included prohibiting cigarette companies from targeting youth in advertising, banning the use of cartoons in advertising, limiting brand-name sponsorship of one sporting or cultural event a year, banning public transit and outdoor billboard advertising, and limiting advertising outside retail stores to signs no bigger than 14 sq. ft. The restrictions imposed by the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) included banning company payments for cigarette promotion in various media, limiting the use of nationally recognized non-tobacco brand names for cigarettes, prohibiting gifts of non-cigarette items to youth in exchange for cigarettes, and restricting free samples of cigarettes to adult-only facilities. Additionally, advertising outside retail stores was limited to signs no bigger than 14 sq. ft."
