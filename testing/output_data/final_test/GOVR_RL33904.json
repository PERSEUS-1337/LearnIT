Proponents argue it is highly efficient, responsible for 50% of multifamily housing starts annually, and has driven the creation of affordable rental housing in the US. Critics claim it has displaced other forms of rental housing finance. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has become the leading source of financing for affordable rental housing, but critics argue it has crowded out other forms of rental housing finance. They claim the credit is perceived as costly and less efficient compared to demand-side subsidies like the Section 8 Housing Voucher Program. Policymakers may consider modifications to the LIHTC as they address affordable housing issues, raising questions about its effectiveness and efficiency. The report examines the effectiveness of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) in addressing affordable housing issues. It highlights the lack of definitive answers in economics literature regarding the impact of the tax credit on housing finance markets. The report questions whether the LIHTC actually helps solve the affordable housing problem or if it may crowd out other affordable housing development. The delivery system of the LIHTC is noted to be complex, potentially affecting the number of housing units available. The LIHTC has a complex delivery system that may increase costs and be less efficient than other affordable housing programs. There is a consensus that there is a shortage of affordable housing, with reports confirming it as a crisis. The affordability crisis is a key challenge facing the nation. The affordability crisis is a key challenge facing the nation, with housing affordability for middle- and lower-income groups measured in terms of cost burden. Cost burden measures the percentage of household income spent on housing, with households considered cost-burdened if more than 30% of annual income is spent on housing. In 2004, millions of renter households were considered housing-cost burdened, with a significant number paying more than 50% of their income towards housing. Low-income renters face the greatest burdens, with severe rent burdens potentially growing due to a decline in affordable housing units. The shortage of affordable rentals for low-income households is estimated at 5.4 million, with losses of units due to repair, abandonment, or demolition. Government intervention in housing markets may be justified if market failures exist, but subsidies should only be provided if there is economic justification based on efficiency. The lack of affordable housing may not be a market failure but a result of slow supply response to increased demand, leading to rising prices. State and local land-use regulations, zoning laws, and government interventions can hinder timely supply responses to changes in demand. The lack of affordable housing may be due to slow supply response to increased demand. Discrimination in lending, known as redlining, can also contribute to the issue. Capital subsidies for affordable housing could help improve capital allocation. Externalities in housing markets, where individual activities impact others' welfare, may also play a role in market failures. The externalities of housing, such as increased prices and blight, can lead to government intervention in neighborhood redevelopment. Studies on LIHTC's impact on neighborhood quality show mixed effects on single-family home prices. The lack of affordable housing raises economic issues, as households may neglect basic necessities when spending a disproportionate amount on housing. Households spending over 50% of income on housing may neglect other basic needs. A study found they spent less on food and healthcare compared to those spending less on housing. Inadequate healthcare spending can lead to poor health, creating private and social costs. This externality extends beyond housing, impacting healthcare as well. Government intervention in the housing market may be justified to increase equality of outcomes or equity of opportunity. Economists debate the effectiveness of supply-side subsidies like LIHTC versus demand-side subsidies like housing vouchers. Some argue that supply-side subsidies are necessary due to insufficient rental housing supply. The LIHTC is a key policy tool for affordable housing, but questions remain about its effectiveness and impact on housing supply. Studies show a positive impact, but data to determine the extent of its success are lacking. The LIHTC has been successful in generating many rental housing units for low- and moderate-income households, with estimates ranging from 500,000 to 900,000 units. Recent data from HUD suggests 1.3 million units were placed in service between 1997 and 2003. However, it is unclear if these units are net additions to the housing stock. Assessing the LIHTC's impact involves investigating marginality and \"crowding out\" of subsidized affordable housing. The LIHTC has been successful in creating rental housing units for low- and moderate-income households, but it is uncertain if these units are additional to the housing stock. Evaluating the LIHTC involves examining whether projects receiving tax-credit awards are at the margin of development and if tax credits are awarded to projects that would proceed without them. The effectiveness of the LIHTC depends on state housing authorities selecting and funding marginal projects. State housing authorities use criteria like project financing, sponsorship, and costs to select projects, including marginal ones. Factors such as project location, housing needs, resident characteristics, and affordability also influence project selection. Some suggest that officials may prioritize non-marginal projects over marginal ones. To focus on financing marginal projects, an alternative method could involve selecting marginal projects first and then choosing those that align with housing-agency priorities, though this would increase complexity, time, and cost. State housing authorities use criteria like project financing, sponsorship, and costs to select projects, including marginal ones. Officials may prioritize non-marginal projects over marginal ones to increase the likelihood of success in supporting housing production. The marginality problem is illustrated in Figure 1, showing the market for low-income housing capital. The tax credit could increase the stock of housing if widely available to all investors. The LIHTC is awarded to a few projects by state housing authorities, leading to only a portion of the supply curve shifting downward. Projects that receive the tax credit may have been built even without the subsidy, causing a \"crowding out\" effect. Investors claiming the credit for non-marginal projects do not have to offer reduced rents. The LIHTC allows investors to lease projects at market rates without offering reduced rents. When tax credits are awarded to marginal projects, the housing stock increases, with subsidized units beyond the initial stock. Economic studies question if government-subsidized housing truly adds to the housing supply or displaces unsubsidized production. The LIHTC may lead to crowding out of unsubsidized housing, reducing the overall supply of affordable units in the economy. Studies suggest that subsidized housing displaces other affordable options available in the private market, leading to a decrease in prices and removal of unsubsidized units from the housing stock. Crowding out occurs when residents of affordable housing are displaced by LIHTC units, benefiting developers at the expense of other low-cost housing owners. Studies show a high rate of substitution between current housing stock and LIHTC units, leading to price declines in the market. The total housing stock remains the same, but LIHTC units crowd out an equivalent quantity of unsubsidized housing. If housing supply prices were unresponsive to LIHTC, price declines in the market would benefit renters and provide new affordable housing. Subsidized housing could increase occupied housing per capita or crowd out equivalent-quality low-income housing from the private sector. Government-financed housing units can increase the total number of units in an area, but on average, three government-subsidized units displace two units that would have been provided by the private market. Crowding out is less in populous markets and more in areas with less excess demand for public housing. Subsidized housing may improve the quality of housing for the poor but does not significantly impact quantity or price. The impact of crowding out on tenants and developers depends on various factors. LIHTC units may benefit developers at the expense of others, allowing them to charge high rents. If tax credits are awarded to projects that do not displace affordable housing, LIHTC can help solve the affordable housing problem. The LIHTC program's success in addressing affordable housing is uncertain due to unclear evidence on the selection of marginal projects and net gains in housing stock. Assessing affordability of tax credit units is crucial, as developers must meet income and rent restrictions to qualify for LIHTC. The LIHTC program requires project owners to choose between two income levels (20-50 or 40-60 test) for occupants. To pass the test, a certain percentage of units must be occupied by individuals with income below a specified percentage of the area's median gross income. Rents should not exceed 30% of the elected income level. Area median gross income is determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The LIHTC program sets rents at or close to the maximum allowed, not tied to tenant income. A study shows a shortage of 2.8 million units for extremely low-income households, with a total deficit of over 10 million affordable units. The LIHTC program has a surplus of over 6 million rental units for higher-income households, but it is unlikely to address the affordable housing deficit for ELI and VLI households. The program's complex subsidy mechanism raises questions about its efficiency, particularly in the distribution of tax credits, the value of the credits, and cost effectiveness compared to other housing programs. The process of allocating and claiming LIHTC is lengthy and involves state housing agencies. The LIHTC program allocates tax credits annually to states for developers of rental housing. Developers apply for credits through state agencies, with only about one in five projects receiving an allocation. Tax credits are exchanged for equity and claimed by real estate investors after the completion of the development, which can take over a year from allocation to claiming. In the LIHTC program, tax credits are allocated annually to states based on population. HFAs administer the credits, with a minimum ceiling set for small states. Unused credits go into a national pool for redistribution. States must allocate all previous credits to be eligible for excess credits. HFAs award credits to developers based on a Qualified Allocation Plan prioritizing affordable housing for low-income households. The LIHTC program prioritizes projects serving low-income households, offering tax credits for various types of housing like apartments, single-family dwellings, and townhouses. Developers, including nonprofits and for-profits, compete for credits by submitting proposals to the HFA. Credits can be retained to reduce tax bills or sold for equity investment in real estate. Selling tax credits involves exchanging them for equity investment in real estate projects. Developers recruit investors to fund projects and offer tax credits in return. The sale is structured with a limited partnership between the developer and investor, sometimes administered by syndicators. The developer has a small ownership percentage but manages the project, while the investor has a large ownership percentage and looks to the tax credits to offset income tax liabilities. Investors providing equity in real estate projects receive tax benefits related to tax losses, operating costs, interest on debt, and deductions like depreciation. Most LIHTC investors are corporations, with public partnerships initially being the main source of equity investment. Different types of investors have varying motivations for investing in tax credits. Investors, including financial institutions subject to the Community Reinvestment Act, invest in tax credits primarily for the rate of return and tax sheltering purposes. Various industries such as real estate, insurance, utility, and manufacturing firms also invest in LIHTC projects. The value of the tax credits varies, leading to complexity and lack of consistency for investors. The credits are claimed in annual installments over a 10-year period. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is claimed in annual installments over a 10-year period. The credit rate varies depending on the type of project, with approximately 9% for new construction and 4% for rehabilitation or federally subsidized buildings. The total value of the tax credits to the taxpayer is determined by multiplying the annual amount of the tax credit by 10. The tax credit rates fluctuate monthly to ensure that the total expected present value of the subsidy over the 10-year period is equal to a certain percentage of the project's eligible basis. The tax credit rates for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) are calculated monthly by the U.S. Treasury Department. The rates vary depending on the type of project, with approximately 9% for new construction and 4% for rehabilitation or federally subsidized buildings. The current rates are 8.11% for the 9% credit and 3.48% for the 4% credit. These rates are used to calculate the credit amount for a project when it is placed in service, which can sometimes lead to discrepancies between the expected and actual credit amounts received by developers. The LIHTC rates fluctuated between 8.00% and 8.21% from June 2005 to June 2006. Changes in rates can impact the final credit amount allocated to a project, either benefiting or disadvantaging developers. Enhanced LIHTCs are offered for projects in difficult development areas and qualified census tracts to incentivize investment in distressed areas with high construction costs. In distressed areas designated by HUD, the LIHTC can be claimed for 130% of the project's total cost, increasing available credits by up to 30%. This results in a higher tax credit amount per year, leading to a higher effective present value for investors. Some policymakers propose fixing LIHTC rate amounts at 4% and 9% to simplify administration and eliminate financial risk for developers and investors. The credit provides a 10-year stream of tax credits equal to 70% of project cost, with an effective value of 84%. The discount rate associated with an 8.07% credit rate is around 3.30%. The investor's discount rate may differ from the U.S. Treasury rate due to the higher risk of private-sector investments. A typical investor's discount rate is around 4.21%, affecting the valuation of a 10-year stream of payments. The effective value of the LIHTC to investors can vary based on the investor's discount rate. The effective value of the LIHTC can vary for investors based on their discount rate compared to the federal rate. This variance adds complexity to the credit, compounded by the discounted equity price paid for tax credits. Typically, tax credits trade for around $0.95 per one tax credit dollar. The LIHTC delivers a significant tax benefit to investors, reducing their cost of capital by nearly 80%. The user cost of capital is a standard method to measure the impact of tax benefits on new investments. The LIHTC reduces the cost of capital for investors, making eligible projects more attractive for investment. This tax benefit enables projects to attract more funds from alternative uses, increasing investment in the tax-favored sector. The LIHTC significantly reduces the cost of capital for investors, with the user cost of capital estimated at 7.50% before the tax credit is applied. With the 9% LIHTC, the user cost of capital decreases to 1.57%, a reduction of 79.10%. The effectiveness of the tax credit diminishes as investor discount rates increase. Comparisons to other tax credit programs like the ITC and HRTC show the benefits of the LIHTC. The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (HRTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) offer different percentages of tax credits for qualified rehabilitation expenses on certain structures. The LIHTC reduces the user cost of capital by 79.1%, while the ITC reduces it by 11.7% and the HRTC by 24%. Policy questions remain about the justification and size of these subsidies, potential excessive profits for LIHTC investors, and the need for program modifications. The LIHTC program's cost effectiveness is compared to housing-production and housing-consumption programs. Project-based assistance like LIHTC supports rental housing production, while tenant-based assistance programs help tenants pay rent. The economics literature has mixed views on project-based vs. tenant-based housing assistance. Tenant-based housing assistance offers residents freedom of choice for housing and neighborhood, but some landlords may not accept vouchers. Voucher values fluctuate with market rents and are generally found to be more cost-effective than production programs. Studies show that the average total cost of housing-production programs exceeds the cost of providing vouchers, with estimates ranging from 8% to 44% difference in cost depending on location and number of bedrooms. LIHTC costs were 19% higher than voucher unit costs in metropolitan areas. The cost of LIHTC production in metropolitan areas was 19% higher than voucher unit costs. In nonmetropolitan areas, the cost differentials increased to 44%. Studies have shown that housing production programs have higher costs compared to voucher programs, with excess costs associated with housing production programs. Profit-maximizing firms investing in LIHTC projects tend to focus more on capital resources than other inputs. The LIHTC program provides subsidies to selected private suppliers, leading to higher returns for tax credit projects. Developers often reserve 100% of housing units for low-income households, indicating potential for larger profits. The Government Accountability Office found that LIHTC units cost more than housing vouchers, with federal costs being significantly higher. The LIHTC program has been criticized for higher costs compared to housing vouchers. LIHTC projects rely on additional subsidies for viability, including debt financing, tax credits, and federal housing assistance. Tenants of LIHTC units often receive housing vouchers, further subsidizing the projects. Advocates argue that deep subsidies are necessary due to demands in the affordable housing market, not the LIHTC program itself. The report highlights issues for policymakers to consider regarding affordable housing. It questions the cause of the lack of affordable housing, the effectiveness of the LIHTC program in adding to the housing stock, and the challenges in assessing housing affordability due to lack of uniform measures and data availability. Policymakers would benefit from knowing the annual level of affordable housing stock. The annual level of affordable housing stock is a key concern for policymakers. New units are added through construction or filtering, while units are removed through abandonment or upgrades to market-rate housing. Questions arise about the net gain in affordable housing, variations by state and over time, financing sources, and expiration of affordability requirements. Excess demand for housing is often cited as evidence of the affordability problem, with rental housing waiting lists indicating the need for affordable housing inventory. One approach to understanding the demand for affordable housing is to examine the LIHTC applicant pool. State housing authorities play a crucial role in selecting marginal projects for LIHTC, and analyzing data on applicants who do not receive credits could provide valuable insights into whether these projects are still developed as affordable housing. The LIHTC program plays a crucial role in creating affordable housing. Data on applicants who do not receive credits could provide insights into the demand for affordable housing. Congress may choose to maintain the LIHTC program as is, essentially making it an entitlement program. The LIHTC program may remain unaltered, functioning as an entitlement program with possible adjustments for inflation. Congress has considered various proposals for administrative changes, such as renaming the credit, altering income restrictions for tenants, and increasing credit amounts to states. There is also discussion on enhancing compatibility with other housing-finance programs, fixing tax credit rates, and targeting affordable housing production. The LIHTC program could be modified to target affordable housing for very-low income households or repealed to save revenue. The Congressional Budget Office suggested phasing out the program by ending tax credits for new projects. Proponents argue that the revenue saved could be used for housing vouchers, while opponents believe the LIHTC is necessary due to insufficient affordable housing supply. The LIHTC program sets the annual rate to ensure credits cover 70% of project costs. The Treasury uses a discount rate based on federal interest rates and a 28% tax rate to calculate the LIHTC value. The investor's discount rate, d, is their required rate of return. The investor's discount rate, d, is the rate of return required to attract funds from savers, calculated using the nominal interest rate, marginal tax rate, inflation rate, and risk premium for equity. The user cost of capital, c, is the minimum rate of return a corporation needs on an investment to break even, represented by the investor's real discount rate and the rate of return. The user cost of capital, c, is initially 7.50% before incorporating tax credits. The largest reduction in user cost is due to the LIHTC at 79.1%, followed by 11.7% from ITC and 24% from HRTC."
