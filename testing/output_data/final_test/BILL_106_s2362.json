    "content": "The Act titled \"Air Quality Standard Improvement Act of 2000\" aims to improve air quality standards. The Air Quality Standard Improvement Act of 2000 aims to establish more effective environmental standards, promote better resource allocation for addressing air quality risks, improve the use of scientific and economic analysis in developing standards, increase public health and environmental benefits while minimizing costs, require consideration of relevant information in evaluating costs and benefits, and promote public awareness of air quality standards. The Air Quality Standard Improvement Act of 2000 aims to require the EPA to conduct risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses for new air quality standards. The Clean Air Act is amended to include Title VII, which focuses on risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis for air quality standards. The term 'air quality standard' includes national ambient standards, prevention of significant deterioration limits, regulations for regional haze, emission limitations, mobile source standards, and limitations on emissions. The curr_chunk discusses various requirements and standards related to air quality, including limitations on fuel quality in mobile sources, emission limitations for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, preconstruction review requirements for new sources, emissions budgets for national ambient air quality standards, performance standards for new and existing sources, and standards to protect public health and the environment. The curr_chunk describes regulations related to air pollution control, including new regulations for electric utility steam generating units, designation of pollutants causing air pollution in foreign countries, air quality standards attainment dates, control measures for reducing interstate ozone pollution, and guidelines for reducing mobile source air pollution. The curr_chunk focuses on the identification of control measures for particulate matter under section 190. SEC. 702. RISK ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND COMMUNICATION. In carrying out the Act, the Administrator must base scientific conclusions on peer-reviewed studies, use reliable data, and make research data available to the public. Public information dissemination is also a priority. The Administrator must ensure that information on public health effects related to new or revised air quality standards is comprehensive, informative, and easily accessible for public comment before any regulation is finalized under the Act. Specifications for each population affected by health effects and the associated risks must be clearly outlined in documents supporting proposed or finalized regulations. The Administrator must provide detailed information on public health effects, uncertainties, and peer-reviewed studies related to new air quality standards. Additionally, a health risk reduction and cost analysis must be published in the Federal Register when proposing a new standard. The Administrator must publish in the Federal Register and solicit public comment on an analysis of quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits and health benefits likely to occur from compliance with new air quality standards. The curr_chunk discusses quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs likely to occur as a result of actions taken to comply with or attain new air quality standards, excluding costs from compliance with other regulations. The curr_chunk discusses the incremental costs and benefits of new or revised air quality standards, as well as the effects on the general population, including vulnerable groups like infants, children, pregnant women, and the elderly. The curr_chunk discusses factors affecting individuals at greater risk of adverse health effects from exposure to air pollutants, including risks associated with compliance with new standards and uncertainties in the analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the analysis supporting clauses and factors related to the measurement and valuation of benefits under the paragraph. It also authorizes appropriations for conducting studies, assessments, and analyses for fiscal years 2000 through 2003. The curr_chunk focuses on cost-benefit analysis, while the prev_chunk discusses the analysis supporting clauses and factors related to the measurement and valuation of benefits. The curr_chunk defines 'benefit' and 'cost' in relation to air quality standards, and explains 'cost-benefit analysis' as evaluating the costs and benefits of such standards. The curr_chunk discusses the preparation of new or revised air quality standards, including conducting cost-benefit analysis and analyzing potential distributional effects. It emphasizes the need for detailed information for informed decision-making and public awareness. The Administrator may promulgate an alternative air quality standard if the benefits do not justify the costs, based on an analysis conducted under subsection (b). The Administrator shall consider public health benefits for a primary national ambient air quality standard and public health and environmental benefits for any other air quality standard. Judicial review of the Administrator's determination is only allowed as part of a review of a final regulation and can be set aside if found to be arbitrary and capricious. The determination is found to be arbitrary and capricious. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out this section."
