    "content": "The \"Regulatory Cost Assessment Act of 2014\" amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to include a Federal Regulatory Budget Cost Control System. It introduces new provisions under Part A and Part B for Federal Regulatory Budget Cost Control, including definitions. The term 'CBO' refers to the Congressional Budget Office, while 'direct cost of Federal regulation' encompasses all costs incurred by the Federal Government in issuing and enforcing regulations. Federal regulation includes guidance documents issued after notice and comment, excluding military and agency management regulations. The term 'Federal regulatory cost' refers to all costs incurred by the private sector in complying with Federal regulations, excluding any benefits. 'Gross domestic product' is defined as the GDP of the United States in a fiscal year. 'OMB' stands for the Office of Management and Budget, and 'regulatory baseline' refers to the projected Federal regulatory cost. Section 323(a) of Federal regulatory cost projections for the fiscal year and outyears. SEC. 322. OMB-CBO REPORTS. OMB and CBO are required to submit a report every odd-numbered year, projecting the direct cost of Federal regulation, the regulatory cost as a percentage of GDP, the impact on the economy, and private sector compliance costs. The curr_chunk provides a detailed description of the effect of Federal regulations on the economy of the United States, categorized into regulation of the economy, security, the environment, health and safety, and the Federal budget. It also includes a discussion on expected cost reductions by Federal agencies and recommendations for improving the Federal regulatory budgeting process. The curr_chunk discusses the regulatory baseline, while the prev_chunk provides an overview of the impact of Federal regulations on the US economy and recommendations for improving regulatory budgeting. The CBO, in consultation with OMB, will submit a regulatory baseline projecting Federal regulatory costs for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four years. The baseline will be adjusted for GDP growth. Deadlines for submission are specified, with the first baseline due within 30 days of enactment. The regulatory baseline must be submitted within specific deadlines: the first baseline within 30 days of enactment, and subsequent baselines by September 15 of the fiscal year before the first fiscal year covered under the baseline. \"Establishment of level and allocations under SEC. 324.\" The concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year must establish the appropriate level for Federal regulatory costs for that year and the following four years. If no level is set, the default total is based on the first regulatory baseline submitted under section 323. For each fiscal year after the initial one, the Federal regulatory cost level will be based on the most recent fiscal year. The Committees on the Budget of the Senate and House will allocate the regulatory costs among committees and functional categories. The Committees on the Budget allocate regulatory costs among committees and functional categories for each fiscal year. Each committee must subdivide its allocation among subcommittees or programs. A point of order prohibits exceeding the allocated regulatory cost, which can only be waived by a three-fifths vote. The Committees on the Budget determine the Federal regulatory costs for a fiscal year and for bills or resolutions. SEC. 325. Analysis of federal regulatory cost by Congressional Budget Office. CBO prepares cost estimates for public bills reported by Senate or House committees, excluding Appropriations, and compares them with other available estimates. Look-back reviews are periodically submitted to Congress. CBO periodically submits reports to Congress that review cost estimates of public laws and compare them with actual costs incurred by the private sector in the fiscal years following the law's implementation. The President's annual budget submissions are amended to include a regulatory authority budget analysis of Federal regulatory costs for complying with current and proposed regulations. Additionally, there is a provision for estimating and disclosing the costs of Federal regulation. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to require detailed discussion on how the costs of complying with new regulations will vary based on business size. This includes factors contributing to cost variation. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to require a detailed analysis of costs and benefits for proposed rules and alternatives, specifically addressing costs for each industry and small entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act is amended to include a statement on monetary costs incurred by small entities, businesses, and individuals in complying with the rule. Additionally, agencies must provide numerical descriptions of monetary costs in their reports. The Regulatory Flexibility Act now requires agencies to submit cost estimates and cost benefit analyses for new proposed regulations with a Federal regulatory cost of at least $10,000,000 for any fiscal year to Congress, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget. SEC. 5. GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. In this section, definitions for terms like \"agency,\" \"rule,\" and \"guidance document\" are provided. A guidance document is defined as a statement of general applicability that sets forth a policy or interpretation on a statutory or regulatory issue. Agencies are limited in issuing guidance documents, requiring notice, opportunity for comment, and submission of a report to Congress before the effective date. The report submitted to Congress certifies that the guidance document is not a rule and explains why it does not meet the definition of a rule. SEC. 6. STUDY OF NONMAJOR RULES. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"covered guidance document,\" \"covered nonmajor rule,\" \"guidance document,\" and \"Federal regulatory cost.\" These definitions clarify the scope and impact of various regulatory documents and rules. The term \"Federal regulatory cost\" and \"rule\" are defined in this section. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to submit reports to Congress every 2 years on covered nonmajor rules and guidance documents, including the number developed, issued, and the regulatory cost. The Comptroller General of the United States must report to Congress every 2 years on the Federal regulatory costs of covered nonmajor rules and guidance documents, including the costs of individual rules and documents, as well as the aggregate costs. Additionally, any discrepancies in cost estimates for specific rules must be discussed."
