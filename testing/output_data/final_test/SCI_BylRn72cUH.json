    "content": "Basis pursuit is a compressed sensing optimization using a deep neural network prior instead of l1-regularization. By jointly learning the prior and reconstructing images without ground-truth data, this technique shows promise for high-resolution dynamic MRI. Model-based deep learning has shown promise in solving imaging-based inverse problems without ground-truth data by utilizing noise statistics for each training example and incorporating a deep convolutional neural network prior. This approach aims to address the challenge of collecting a large set of fully sampled data for training, making it more practical and cost-effective. In model-based deep learning, the technique of Deep Basis Pursuit (DBP) is used for image reconstruction in undersampled MRI. The approach combines CNN weights and reconstructed training set images during training, and fixes weights during inference. Comparisons are made with supervised learning and MoDL, showing that unsupervised DBP can achieve reconstruction quality similar to supervised learning, enabling applications where fully sampled data collection is not feasible. The focus is on a linear signal model under additive white Gaussian noise. The imaging system model involves acquired measurements y \u2208 C M, with complex-valued Gaussian noise vector v \u223c N c 0, \u03c3 2 I. In the ill-posed regime where M < N, x is solved through regularized least-squares with a regularization term Q(x) and strength \u03bb > 0. An alternative formulation considers model error due to noise with a constraint involving the expected noise power. CNNs are used for imaging inverse problems, learning the inverse mapping from a large corpus of training data. Network architectures for imaging inverse problems combine CNN blocks and data consistency blocks to incorporate knowledge of the forward model, allowing for robustness against CNN artifacts and training with limited data. These architectures are inspired by conventional first-order iterative algorithms and aim to solve the unconstrained problem efficiently. The iterative algorithms used in network architectures for imaging inverse problems alternate between data consistency and manifold projection. These algorithms are unrolled for a finite number of steps and optimized in an end-to-end manner to facilitate training with backpropagation. The image reconstruction is viewed as a feed-forward network parameterized by weights that operate on measurements and incorporate knowledge of the forward model. Training is done in an end-to-end fashion by minimizing the average training loss, and for inference, the weights are fixed. The Deep Basis Pursuit (DBP) model is proposed for inference with fixed weights and known noise statistics. Training is done unsupervised in the measurement domain, combining basis pursuit denoising with a CNN auto-encoder. The optimization aims to estimate noise using a CNN parameterized by weights. The Deep Basis Pursuit (DBP) model combines basis pursuit denoising with a CNN auto-encoder to estimate noise using a CNN parameterized by weights. The optimization involves an alternating minimization approach and convex subproblems solved with ADMM. The update steps include introducing slack and dual variables, with matrix-free optimization for efficient calculations. The Deep Basis Pursuit (DBP) model utilizes the Conjugate Gradient Method for solving subproblems iteratively. It alternates between CNN layers and data consistency layers in an optimization process. The network parameters are used to estimate the image from measurements and noise power. Training can be done end-to-end with ground-truth data or using a measurement loss function when ground-truth data is not available. The Deep Basis Pursuit (DBP) model is suitable for MRI reconstruction tasks due to its ability to learn image statistics from noisy measurements. Multi-channel MRI involves measuring signals with an array of coils, each with a unique sensitivity profile. The measurement model involves linear mixing, Fourier transformation, and sampling. The experimental setup includes dataset and implementation details. The measurement model for multi-channel MRI involves linear mixing of spatial sensitivity profiles, Fourier transformation, and sampling. The dataset used for experimentation includes 3D Cartesian proton-density knee scans of healthy volunteers scanned with an 8-channel receive coil array. Ground-truth data with noise were averaged from adjacent slices, and spatial sensitivity profiles were estimated using ESPIRiT. The study utilized ESPIRiT for coil sensitivity estimation in multi-channel MRI. Ground-truth images were reconstructed without regularization. Variable-density Poisson-disc sampling was used for under-sampling. Training, validation, and testing were done on slices from different groups of volunteers. Gaussian noise was added to the data. Euclidean norm loss function was used for training, with supervised loss applied in the image domain. The study used a U-Net architecture for CNN autoencoder training, applying loss in the image domain for supervised training and in the Fourier domain for unsupervised training. MoDL was also implemented with the same parameters. Evaluation included training DBP with and without ground-truth data, training MoDL with ground-truth data, and evaluating PICS using BART. The study compared supervised and unsupervised learning methods for image reconstruction using DBP and MoDL architectures. Results showed that DBP behaved more stably with increasing unrolls, likely due to the hard data consistency constraint. Best performance was achieved with different numbers of unrolls for each architecture. The study compared supervised and unsupervised learning methods for image reconstruction using DBP and MoDL architectures. DBP outperformed PICS at the optimal number of unrolls, showing better amplification and denoising of features in the image. Supervised DBP achieved the lowest error, followed by unsupervised DBP, PICS, and MoDL. Edge sharpness details were better retained with DBP compared to MoDL and PICS. The combination of basis pursuit denoising and deep learning can leverage undersampled data for model-based reconstructions without ground-truth images. The choice of measurement loss function and data SNR significantly impacts quality, with a large training dataset offsetting reconstruction errors in unsupervised learning."
