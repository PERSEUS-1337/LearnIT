PRIME Reauthorization and transfer to the Small Business Act, amending the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to create a program for investment in microentrepreneurs. Definitions for the PRIME program under the Small Business Administration include terms like Administration, Administrator, capacity building services, collaborative, and disadvantaged entrepreneur. The PRIME program defines terms like disadvantaged entrepreneur as a low-income person with limited access to capital or resources, disadvantaged Native American entrepreneur as a member of an Indian Tribe, and intermediary as an organization providing support services. The Education Assistance Act defines terms like 'intermediary' as a nonprofit entity supporting microenterprise development, 'low-income person' as someone with income below a certain threshold, and 'microentrepreneur' as the owner of a microenterprise. The term 'microenterprise' refers to a business with fewer than 5 employees and limited access to financial services. A 'microenterprise development organization or program' is a nonprofit entity that supports disadvantaged entrepreneurs. 'Training and technical assistance' are services provided to help these entrepreneurs. The Administrator will establish a program to provide training and technical assistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs through grants to qualified organizations. A 'very low-income person' is defined as someone with an income not exceeding 150 percent of the poverty line. The Administrator will establish a program to provide training and technical assistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs through grants to qualified organizations. These grants are to be used for various purposes such as providing training and capacity building services, researching best practices, and offering assistance to Native American entrepreneurs. The Administrator will establish a program to provide training and technical assistance to disadvantaged entrepreneurs through grants to qualified organizations, including nonprofit microenterprise development organizations, intermediaries, and Indian tribes. The Administrator will allocate assistance to ensure that activities described in subsection (c)(1) receive at least 75% of funding, and activities in subsection (c)(2) receive at least 15% of funding. No private organization or program referred to in this subsection exists within the tribe's jurisdiction. The Administrator will allocate assistance to ensure that no single person receives more than 10% of total funds in a fiscal year. At least 50% of grants must benefit very low-income persons, including those on Indian reservations. Qualified organizations can provide grants to small and emerging microenterprise organizations. In making grants under this section, the Administrator ensures diversity among grant recipients, including large and small microenterprise organizations serving various communities. Additionally, there is a limit on administrative expenses, and a prohibition on preferential consideration of certain SBA program participants. The program established under section 7(m) of the Small Business Act ensures that qualified organizations do not receive preferential treatment. Financial assistance requires a 50% match from non-Federal sources, which can include fees, grants, gifts, funds from loans, and in-kind resources. The Administrator may reduce or eliminate matching requirements for applicants with severe constraints on funds. Not more than 10% of total funds in a fiscal year can be exempted from matching requirements. Applications for assistance must be submitted as per Administrator's procedures. Recordkeeping and reporting requirements apply to organizations receiving assistance. Organizations receiving assistance from the Administration must submit audited financial statements, annual reports, and maintain necessary records. The Administration has access to review records for compliance with the assistance provided. The organizations receiving assistance from the Administration must collect data on individuals counseled or trained, hours of counseling, startup small businesses formed, small businesses expanded, and low-income individuals served. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Administrator to carry out training for Native American entrepreneurs, with $15,000,000 authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2007 and an additional $2,000,000 for subsection (c)(4). The Small Business Act is amended to redesignate section 37 as section 38. The Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 is transferred to section 36 of the Small Business Act. References to the \"Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs Act of 1999\" are now deemed references to section 37 of the Small Business Act. Grants or assistance provided under the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs Act of 1999 before the enactment of this Act remain unaffected."
