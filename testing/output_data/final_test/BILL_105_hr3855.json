The Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998 addresses the lack of Federal funding for freestanding children's teaching hospitals in graduate medical education. These hospitals receive significantly less funding compared to other teaching hospitals, creating a serious inequity. Children's teaching hospitals play a crucial role in training doctors, including pediatric specialists, and conducting pediatric research. They serve as referral centers, provide technological advancements, and are threatened by inadequate funding. The lack of graduate medical education funding is a major threat to children's hospitals with teaching programs, impacting their ability to cover patient costs and reduce expenses. SEC. 2. Program of payments to children's hospitals with graduate medical education programs. The Secretary will make payments to children's hospitals for operating approved medical residency training programs during specific cost reporting periods in fiscal years 1999 or 2000. The payment amount is based on the per resident rate and the number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospital's training programs. The Secretary will make payments to children's hospitals for operating approved medical residency training programs during specific cost reporting periods in fiscal years 1999 or 2000. The per resident rate is determined based on the direct and indirect medical education components for the cost reporting period. The Secretary will calculate a base national DME average per resident rate by averaging the rates from fiscal year 1997. This rate will be updated based on the consumer price index increase and adjusted for variations in labor-related costs for each hospital. The updated rate for hospitals will be adjusted for variations in wage costs using a factor determined under section 1886(d)(4)(E) of the Social Security Act for fiscal year 1998. The direct medical education component for a hospital is the updated rate adjusted for the hospital. The indirect medical education component is also considered. The Secretary computes the indirect medical education component for a hospital based on the amount paid under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1997, divided by the number of FTE residents participating in its program. The Secretary calculates the indirect medical education component for a hospital by dividing the amount paid under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period by the number of FTE residents in its approved residency programs. The national average is computed by summing these amounts for all hospitals and dividing by the total number of hospitals. The calculated amount is updated for each hospital by the applicable percentage increase defined in the Social Security Act. The Secretary calculates the indirect medical education component for a hospital by dividing the amount paid under section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Social Security Act for its cost reporting period by the number of FTE residents in its approved residency programs. If the Secretary determines that the funds provided for cost reporting periods are insufficient, pro rata reductions will be made. The Secretary will reduce payments under this section on a pro rata basis to ensure total payments do not exceed the funds allocated. Interim payments are made in 26 installments during each cost reporting period, with a final payment based on necessary information submitted by the hospital. The Secretary will recoup overpayments and determine final payment amounts for hospitals. The final amount is considered an intermediary determination subject to review. $285,000,000 is appropriated for payments in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, $285,000,000 is appropriated for payments. If payments for 1999 are less than specified, the amount for 2000 will be increased by the difference. These payments to hospitals replace other payments under specific sections of the Social Security Act but do not impact other payments. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, $285,000,000 is appropriated for payments to hospitals under a State Medicaid plan. The payments replace other payments under the Social Security Act but do not affect amounts payable to hospitals. Definitions include approved medical residency training program, children's hospital, direct graduate medical education costs, and Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
