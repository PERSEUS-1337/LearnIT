    "content": "The hybrid framework improves speech enhancement by balancing temporal and frequency precision in audio representations. Different noise types are effectively targeted by raw-audio and spectrogram approaches. By integrating raw-audio and spectrogram approaches, the hybrid model effectively removes noise in different regions of the time-frequency space. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance and robustness compared to using individual models. The objective function incorporates an energy-conserving loss function that considers both speech and noise signals, enhancing speech enhancement by balancing temporal and frequency precision. The text discusses the construction of a time domain network based on TasNet for speech enhancement. A reduced version of TasNet is used, and a hybrid system combining time and T-F domain networks is illustrated. The T-F domain network converts time-domain input to a spectrogram using STFT and then back to a waveform using iSTFT. The hybrid model with auxiliary loss is compared to U-Net with doubled parameter size. TasNet struggles to remove high-frequency noise in the time domain. The U \u2192 D model shares weaknesses with U-Net. The model outperforms recent studies in speech enhancement, showing the best performance in quantitative and qualitative measures. Results are compared with other methods in terms of speech distortion, background distortion, overall quality, PESQ, and SSNR. In this section, the detailed configuration of the models used is presented. Figure 3 shows the U-Net (1.5M) architecture, with 2D Conv representing a two-dimensional convolution block and 2D t-Conv representing a two-dimensional transposed convolution block. The baseline models in experiments use leaky-RELU activation function and 2D t-Conv for two-dimensional transposed convolution. The input spectrogram is processed in log-magnitude."
