    "content": "The \"Auction Reform Act of 2002\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows. Congress finds that circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated in 1997. There is no comprehensive plan for allocating additional spectrum for advanced communications services, and the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes. The Department of Defense is still determining if they can share spectrum for wireless services after the 700 megahertz auction. The FCC is addressing interference issues in the 800 megahertz band, possibly involving the 700 megahertz band. Holding the 700 megahertz auction before resolving the 800 megahertz interference issues is not recommended. The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, creating uncertainty about its availability for auction. This uncertainty reduces the value of the spectrum and lowers the likelihood of it being purchased by entities that would use it most effectively. The Commission's rules for vacating the band by broadcast stations do not provide certainty of its availability. The 700 megahertz band's availability for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services is uncertain. The transition of digital television must be advanced without unjustly enriching any incumbent licensee. Elimination of statutory deadlines for spectrum auctions. The FCC has the authority to determine the timing of auctions, including deadlines for bidding, revenue collection, and licensing processes. Auctions 31 and 44 will not proceed on June 19, 2002, unless specified otherwise. The FCC will not conduct auctions 31 and 44 on June 19, 2002, as specified in public notices. An exception applies to certain blocks. The FCC will not conduct auctions 31 and 44 on June 19, 2002, except for the C-block and D-block licenses on specific frequency bands. Entities qualified for auction 44 by May 8, 2002, can bid on C-block and D-block licenses. The auction for these licenses must start between August 19 and September 19, 2002, with proceeds deposited by December 31, 2002. The Commission must submit a report to Congress within one year of the enactment of this paragraph. The Commission must report to Congress within one year, detailing the rescheduling of auctions 31 and 44 and the progress in the digital television transition and spectrum allocation for mobile communications. The Commission will refund upfront payments to bidders for licenses in auction 44. Amendments are made to various acts, including the Communications Act of 1934 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes are repealed. The Federal Communications Commission must conduct rescheduled auctions 31 and 44 before the auction authority expires. Television broadcast station licensees must still complete the digital television service conversion. The Federal Communications Commission may not waive spacing requirements or interference standards for analog and digital broadcasting licensees within channels 2-51 to allow analog broadcasting during the transition to digital broadcasting if it results in service degradation or increased interference. The FCC prohibits waivers for analog and digital broadcasting licensees in channels 2-51 if it causes service degradation or interference. However, there is an exception for station licensees seeking to vacate frequencies in channels 63, 64, 68, or 69 for public safety purposes. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
