    "content": "The budget reconciliation process is a two-stage procedure that helps Congress adjust revenue, spending, and debt-limit levels to align with the annual budget resolution. Reconciliation directives in the budget resolution instruct committees to develop legislation to achieve desired budgetary outcomes. Compliance is based on the net revenue or spending effects of all changes in the legislation. The budget reconciliation process involves two stages where committees develop legislation to adjust revenue, spending, and debt-limit levels based on the net effects of changes. Instructed committees submit recommendations to Budget Committees, which then incorporate them into an omnibus budget reconciliation bill. If only one committee is instructed, it can report legislation directly to its parent chamber, bypassing the Budget Committee. The budget reconciliation process involves two stages where committees develop legislation to adjust revenue, spending, and debt-limit levels. The House and Senate consider the reconciliation legislation under expedited procedures, with limited debate time and restrictions on amendments. If final agreement on a budget resolution is not reached, the reconciliation process is not triggered. Reconciliation is an optional procedure and has not been used in every year of the congressional budget process. Reconciliation has been used in various years, with the first instance in 1980. In total, Congress has sent 25 reconciliation acts to the President, with 21 being signed into law and three being vetoed by President Clinton. Reconciliation practices in Congress have evolved over the years. Out of the 25 reconciliation acts sent to the President, 21 were signed into law, while President Clinton vetoed three and President Obama vetoed one. The process has seen changes in how spending and revenue changes are handled, with recent years seeing separate reconciliation measures for revenue and spending changes. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 brought significant changes in spending and revenues. Reconciliation directives in budget resolutions can lead to multiple measures, with some extending into the following year. For example, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was enacted in 2006. In the FY2010 budget cycle, reconciliation legislation was not considered until 2010, despite the budget resolution being adopted in 2009. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 brought significant changes in spending and revenues.
