    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rocky Flats Special Exposure Cohort Act\". The Congress enacted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 to provide compensation for beryllium-related and radiation-related health conditions for civilian workers involved in nuclear weapons production. The Act includes provisions for considering compensation claims from employees at various locations. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 allows for the designation of special exposure cohorts for employees at Department of Energy facilities if radiation dose estimates are not feasible and there is a likelihood of health endangerment. The Rocky Flats site in Colorado had inadequate monitoring of worker radiation exposure, leading to undetected internal radiation deposition in a former worker after more than 50 years. The facility lacked equipment to detect plutonium and americium in the lungs until the late 1960s. Exposure to neutron radiation at Rocky Flats was not monitored until the late 1950s, with many measurements found to be inaccurate. Workers had inhalation exposures that went undetected and unmeasured, with neutron doses in some areas of the plant being significantly higher than gamma doses. Radiation exposures of workers were often not measured, leading to estimated doses being assigned in some cases. The exposure histories and data available for Rocky Flats workers are inadequate to determine compensation eligibility under the Act. The dose reconstruction model used by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is flawed due to errors in default values for particle size and solubility of plutonium. Erroneous values in dose calculations for Rocky Flats claimants can lead to significantly underestimated doses compared to records and autopsy data. Administrative costs for claims processing are disproportionately high. Some workers with known plutonium exposure and health effects have been denied compensation due to flawed calculations and incomplete records. Achieving the Act's purposes for Rocky Flats workers requires addressing these issues. The purpose of this Act is to include Rocky Flats workers in the special exposure cohort for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. The Act aims to designate Rocky Flats workers as members of the special exposure cohort for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. The Act designates Rocky Flats workers with at least 250 work days before January 1, 2006, for compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. Reapplication for benefits is allowed regardless of previous denials."
