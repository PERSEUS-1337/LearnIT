    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act of 2017\". Congress finds that Medicare beneficiaries need to be hospitalized for at least three consecutive days for coverage of post-hospital care in a skilled nursing facility. Observation stays in hospitals have increased sharply since 2006, leading to a rise in outpatient visits. Observation stays in hospitals have increased sharply since 2006, with a 34% rise in observation stays to inpatient admissions ratio between 2007 and 2009. Outpatient observation status is becoming a substitute for inpatient admission, with an 88% increase in observation stays exceeding 72 hours. Care provided during observation is similar to inpatient care, and beneficiaries are often unaware of their status. Older Americans and people with disabilities can face unexpected financial burdens for skilled nursing facility care if they are placed in outpatient observation status during a hospital stay, which may not count towards Medicare coverage eligibility. This can result in thousands of dollars in costs, even if their total hospital stay exceeds three days. The Office of Inspector General found that beneficiaries faced high out-of-pocket charges for skilled nursing facility care not covered by Medicare. CMS's policy on inpatient hospital stays does not address the issue of observation status days not counting towards the 3-day requirement. This Act updates Medicare policy by deeming patients under observation as inpatients for the purposes of satisfying the Medicare 3-day inpatient stay requirement. It expands the Secretary's definition of \"inpatient\" to include time spent under observation, addressing the financial burden faced by patients needing skilled nursing care after their hospital stay. The 3-day rule was originally intended to ensure Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility stays after a 3-day hospital stay. This Act aims to provide access to skilled nursing care for beneficiaries who meet medical necessity requirements but do not meet the 3-day inpatient stay requirement due to being classified as \"outpatient observation status.\" Congress expects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor providers to ensure appropriate care levels are delivered. The Office of the Inspector General supports counting hospital observation days towards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement. Recommendations have been made to include time spent in observation status in meeting Medicare's stay requirement. A report found that Medicare beneficiaries classified as outpatients are paying more for similar care and have limited access to skilled nursing facility care. Counting outpatient observation days towards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement for Medicare coverage of skilled nursing facility services is supported by the Office of the Inspector General. Medicare beneficiaries in observation status are facing higher costs and restricted access to skilled nursing facility care. The Social Security Act is amended to consider individuals receiving outpatient observation services as inpatients, with the discharge date being when services cease. This amendment applies to services starting on or after January 1, 2017, with exceptions for completed post-hospital extended care services if an appeal is made within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may implement amendments to the Social Security Act through interim final regulations, program instructions, or other means, regardless of the date of enactment of the Act."
