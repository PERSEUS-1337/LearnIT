    "content": "The CDC has identified teen pregnancy as a major public health issue due to its high cost for families and society. Congress has authorized programs to prevent teen pregnancies, including the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, and the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program. The report discusses four teen pregnancy prevention programs authorized under the Social Security Act and appropriations law, administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It includes recent funding developments, the role of Congress and the executive branch in prevention efforts, and details on the types of grants, funding, requirements, and research activities of the programs. The report outlines four teen pregnancy prevention programs under the Social Security Act, detailing funding, requirements, and research activities. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 renamed one program and made retroactive changes. Funding distribution among states and territories is also included. Since the early 1980s, the federal government has supported programs focused on preventing teen pregnancy through public awareness campaigns, providing health services, and funding sexual education organizations. Policymakers have debated approaches to pregnancy prevention, with some advocating for abstinence before marriage to avoid unplanned pregnancies and STIs. Some stakeholders advocate for abstinence-only or sexual risk avoidance education for teenagers to prevent unplanned pregnancies and STIs. Others prioritize providing broad information to help teens make informed decisions about sex and contraception. Congress funds programs that support these approaches to preventing teen pregnancy. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education, Sexual Risk Avoidance Education, PREP, and TPP programs focus on preventing teen pregnancy through abstinence and contraception. Some programs use multiple models to meet the needs of youth. Public support exists for educating teenagers on both abstinence and contraception. The Power to Decide study in 2017 found that 8 out of 10 adults believe teens should receive more information on abstinence, birth control, and protection from STIs. The TPP and PREP programs aim to prevent teen pregnancy through evidence-based approaches, with HHS identifying effective models. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Evidence Review process was established by multiple HHS offices following the enactment of the FY2010 omnibus appropriations law (P.L. 111-117). The review aims to identify effective teen pregnancy prevention models based on rigorous evaluation studies from the past 20 years. It prioritizes programs targeting youth ages 19 and younger with educational, skill-building, or psycho-social interventions. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Evidence Review process evaluates research from 1989 to 2010 and conducts annual/biannual reviews to include new evidence on programs impacting sexual activity, partners, contraceptive use, STIs/HIV, and pregnancies. Studies must use RCTs or quasi-experimental designs and be rated for quality. The latest review includes 41 evidence-based programs. The TPP Evidence Review includes 41 evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention program models categorized based on key features like abstinence-only approach, sexual health education, youth development, clinic-based services, and target populations. HHS has funded research on interventions for teen pregnancy prevention. Research on teen pregnancy prevention interventions has been funded through annual appropriations of approximately $4.5 million to $6.8 million from FY2011 to FY2018 for Section 241 of the Public Health Services Act. This funding has supported federal evaluations on teen pregnancy, including evaluation of TPP grantees, technical assistance for program evaluation, the TPP Evidence Review, and measuring performance data for the TPP program and Pregnancy Assistance Fund grantees. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund provides competitive funding to support pregnant and parenting teens and adults in school-based and community-based settings. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010, has received annual funding ranging from $98 million to $110 million. The program funds evidence-based programs that reduce teen pregnancy through sexual risk avoidance and contraceptive use. However, the current cohort of TPP program grantees is facing discontinued funding by HHS. No more than 10% of TPP funding is allocated for training and technical assistance, outreach, and program support. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, funded annually at $98 million to $110 million, allocates 75% for Tier 1 grants replicating proven effective programs and 25% for Tier 2 grants for research and innovation. HHS sets eligibility and information requirements for funding recipients. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program, funded annually, allocates funds for Tier 1 and Tier 2 grants. The HHS Office of Adolescent Health approves materials used by grantees. Public and private entities are eligible to apply for TPP funding. Two cohorts of Tier 1 grantees have been supported, with the current round of funding in the process of being discontinued. Tier 1A grantees are intermediary organizations. The Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program funds Tier 1A grantees to provide capacity-building assistance for replicating evidence-based programs in areas with high teen birth rates. Tier 1B grantees replicate programs in communities with the greatest need, following HHS-approved evidence-based approaches. HHS funds Tier 1 and Tier 2 grantees to replicate evidence-based programs for teen pregnancy prevention. Tier 1 grantees must implement models consistent with the original evidence-based model with minimal adaptations. Tier 2 grants are funded in two cohorts from FY2010-FY2019, with the second cohort including 26 grantees in 11 states and the District of Columbia. HHS is currently funding three types of Tier 2 grants in the second cohort. The Tier 2 grants funded by HHS aim to advance adolescent health and prevent teen pregnancy through various initiatives. These include establishing intermediaries to support innovators, evaluating new prevention approaches, and assessing programs specifically designed for young males aged 15 to 24. Interventions for young men aged 15-24 to reduce teen pregnancy risk are funded by HHS and administered by CDC in partnership with OAH. 41 program evaluations were supported, with 12 showing positive impacts, 16 showing no impacts, and 13 having inconclusive results. Findings were published in a special supplement of the American Journal of Public Health in September 2016. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the PREP program with $75 million annually for teen pregnancy prevention. PREP educates adolescents on abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Funding has been extended multiple times with a focus on both abstinence and contraception in sexual education programs. The PREP program, established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, focuses on educating adolescents on abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Recipients of PREP funds must implement programs that provide information on adulthood preparation subjects, including healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The programs must be medically-accurate, include activities to educate sexually active youth on responsible sexual behavior, and provide age-appropriate information in a culturally appropriate context. The PREP program, established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, focuses on educating adolescents on abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and STIs. Recipients of PREP funds must implement evidence-based effective programs proven to delay sexual activity, increase condom or contraceptive use, or reduce pregnancy among youth. The program includes State PREP grants, Competitive PREP grants, Tribal PREP grants, and Personal Responsibility Education Innovative Strategies (PREIS) grants. Funding is allocated to states and territories through State PREP grants, with additional funding available for local entities through Competitive PREP grants. Additionally, there are set-asides for Tribal PREP grants, training, technical assistance, and evaluation. Total FY2017 funding for the PREP program was $63.7 million, with $40.5 million for State PREP, $10.3 million for Competitive PREP, $3.3 million for Tribal PREP, and $9.6 million for PREIS. State PREP funds are allocated based on youth population without requiring a match. 50 jurisdictions received funding, including states, territories, and other entities. In FY2010 through FY2019, states or territories that did not apply for formula funding are ineligible for funding. Competitive PREP funding is available for organizations in these states, awarded as a three-year grant. Ten states and territories did not apply for State PREP funding, leading to Competitive PREP funding being awarded to organizations in those states for FY2012 through FY2017. Competitive PREP funding for FY2015 through FY2017 was awarded to organizations in states that did not apply for funding in FY2016 and FY2017. Grantees in these states, except Kansas, were funded for two additional years through FY2019 as per the Bipartisan Budget Act. Applicants must outline their plans to reduce pregnancy and birth rates for high-risk youth populations. States, territories, and entities applying for State PREP or Competitive PREP funds must replicate evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk youth populations, including pregnant youth under 21 and mothers under 21. Grantees are encouraged to use the TPP Evidence Review but not required to adopt specific models. Tribal PREP grants aim to educate American Indian and Alaska Native youth aged 10-20. Tribal PREP grants support projects educating American Indian and Alaska Native youth on abstinence, contraception, and teen pregnancy prevention. Grantees must implement culturally appropriate programs replicating evidence-based models or promising practices within tribal communities. Indian tribes and tribal organizations are eligible to apply for funding. The PREIS grants fund innovative teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk youth populations, including technology-based and social media strategies. Grantees from FY2011 to FY2015 and the second cohort from FY2016 to FY2020 work to build evidence for these programs. Targeted populations include youth in foster care, homeless youth, and culturally under-represented groups aged 10 to 20. The PREIS grants fund teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk youth populations, including those in foster care, homeless youth, and victims of human trafficking. HHS evaluates the programs implemented by selected State PREP grantees. The PREIS grants fund teen pregnancy prevention programs for high-risk youth populations, including those in foster care, homeless youth, and victims of human trafficking in Maine, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. The impact evaluation is expected to be completed in 2018, with states developing similar approaches to supporting evidence-based strategies. Separate evaluation activities are carried out by PREIS and Tribal PREP grantees to assess the effectiveness of interventions in reducing pregnancies, births, and STIs. The 1996 welfare reform law established the \"Separate Program for Abstinence Education\" under Section 510 in Title V of the Social Security Act, which was later renamed the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program by the BBA of 2018. The program aims to provide youth ages 10 through 19 with education on abstinence and sexual risk avoidance. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program, funded through mandatory spending, has received funding through various legislative extensions since FY1998. The program aims to provide education on abstinence and sexual risk avoidance to youth ages 10 through 19. States can request Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education funds for FY2018 and FY2019 by applying for Maternal and Child Health Block Grant funds. The MCH Block Grant supports maternal and child health programs, and the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education funds are allocated based on program funding and states' proportion of low-income children. No matching funds are required, and HHS may competitively award funds to new entities within a state. The HHS Secretary must publish a notice to solicit grant applications for Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education funds within 30 days after the deadline for states to apply for MCH Services Block Grant funds. Eligible states must apply for the funds no later than 120 days after the MCH Services Block Grant deadline. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and various territories are eligible to apply for the funds. In FY2017, 37 states and two territories received funding under Title V. States and territories, including the Federated States of Micronesia, received funding under the Title V Abstinence Education Grant program to implement sexual risk avoidance education. The education must be medically accurate, age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and cover six specific topics. Information on contraception must be accurate, emphasizing that it reduces but does not eliminate risk, and no distribution or demonstration of contraceptive devices is allowed. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education funding requires states to collect and report program data, measure success through outcome measures like abstinence, and identify effective programs for delaying sexual activity. Grantees are directed to the TPP Evidence Review but not required to use the identified models. The Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program allows up to 20% of funding to be used for research to build evidence. HHS is required to conduct rigorous evaluations of the education programs funded under Title V, consulting with state agencies and stakeholders. A report on the evaluation results must be submitted to Congress. The report to Congress on the evaluation of Sexual Risk Avoidance Education programs must include information collected from states and entities. HHS conducted a multi-year evaluation of the Title V Abstinence Education Grant program, studying program implementation and impacts on teen abstinence. Programs targeted youth in elementary and middle school, engaging them for over 50 hours with outcomes tracked four to six years later. The evaluation found positive impacts on youth who participated. The impact evaluation of abstinence education programs found no significant difference in outcomes compared to the control group. Federal funding has supported abstinence-only education programs through various initiatives from FY2001 to FY2018, with appropriations laws specifying the use of evidence-based approaches and medically accurate information. The appropriations law allows up to 10% of funding for sexual risk avoidance to be used for technical assistance and administrative costs. Eligible entities for funding include states, territories, localities, school districts, and institutions of higher education. ACF awarded grants to various entities such as school districts, tribal governments, housing authorities, and nonprofit organizations. Grantees must implement evidence-based programs to delay sexual activity initiation and connect participants to community services. HHS tracks grantee performance for monitoring purposes, not to measure program impacts."
