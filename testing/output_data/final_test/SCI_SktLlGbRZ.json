Generative adversarial networks combined with cycle-consistency constraints have proven effective in mapping images between domains without aligned pairs. A novel model called CyCADA adapts representations at both pixel-level and feature-level, enforcing cycle-consistency and leveraging a task loss. This model can be applied in various visual recognition and prediction settings. State-of-the-art results in adaptation tasks, such as digit classification and semantic segmentation of road scenes, show challenges in transferring from synthetic to real-world domains. Deep neural networks struggle with generalizing knowledge to new environments, especially when shifting from non-photorealistic synthetic data to real images. Training models on synthetic data fails to generalize to real-world imagery, impacting performance significantly. Feature-level unsupervised domain adaptation methods aim to align features extracted from networks across different domains, like synthetic and real images, without labeled target samples. Techniques involve minimizing distance measures between source and target feature distributions. However, these methods have limitations in enforcing semantic consistency and modeling low-level appearance variances. Generative pixel-level domain adaptation models align distributions in raw pixel space to match the style of a target domain. Recent methods can translate images using unsupervised data from both domains, but may not preserve crucial semantic information. These models have shown success for small image sizes and limited domain shifts, with some recent advancements applied to larger images in controlled environments. CyCADA is an adversarial unsupervised adaptation algorithm that uses cycle and semantic consistency to adapt deep networks at multiple levels. The model aims to preserve semantic information during adaptation by reconstructing the original data from the adapted version. CyCADA is an adaptation algorithm that uses cycle and semantic consistency to adapt deep networks at multiple levels, enforcing pixel and semantic consistency. It unifies prior adversarial domain adaptation methods with cycle-consistent image-to-image translation techniques. CyCADA model is applied to digit recognition and semantic segmentation tasks across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results in various adaptation scenarios. The model improves per-pixel accuracy significantly and prevents label flipping between different datasets, showcasing the benefits of cycle-consistent pixel transformations for domain adaptation. The CyCADA model prevents label flipping between datasets and shows improvements in digit recognition and semantic segmentation tasks through pixel and feature adaptation. Visual domain adaptation was introduced with a pairwise metric transform solution and further studied in the context of visual dataset bias. Feature space alignment is achieved by minimizing the distance between source and target feature space statistics. Domain adversarial objectives improve this alignment by training a domain classifier to distinguish between the two representations. Different objectives such as minimax, symmetric confusion, and inverted label are used for optimization. These methods focus on modifications in the discriminative representation space, contrasting with pixel-space adaptation approaches. In contrast to feature space alignment methods, recent approaches focus on pixel-space adaptation using CoGANs and GANs for image transformation and generation.GANs have been applied successfully in various applications such as image editing and feature learning. Recent work in image-to-image translation problems has focused on using conditional GANs, but they require input-output image pairs for training, which is not always available in domain adaptation problems. Different approaches have been proposed, such as learning a source to target encoder-decoder with a generative adversarial objective, using a Domain Transfer Network to enforce consistency in the embedding space, and utilizing an L1 reconstruction loss to ensure similarity between generated target images and original source images. These methods work well for limited domain shifts but may be too limiting for larger domain shifts.

These methods work well for limited domain shifts but may be too limiting for larger domain shifts. In contrast, our method does not require pre-defining shared content between domains and simply translates images back to their original domains while ensuring they remain identical to their original versions. Other approaches like BiGAN, ALI, and CycleGAN have also shown promising results in image translation tasks. Recent work in image-to-image translation has focused on using conditional GANs, but they require input-output image pairs for training. Different approaches have been proposed for domain adaptation, such as learning a source to target encoder-decoder with a generative adversarial objective and using a Domain Transfer Network. Our method, inspired by the effectiveness of the cycle-consistency loss, aims to align global features through adversarial adaptation. BID29 learns a multi-source model and transfers it to a sparsely labeled target domain through distillation. BID3 uses an adversarial objective to align both global features. In image-to-image translation, recent work has focused on conditional GANs, requiring input-output image pairs for training. Our method aims to align global features through adversarial adaptation, using cycle-consistency loss. We perform segmentation adaptation by aligning label distributions globally and across superpixels in an image. The goal is unsupervised adaptation, learning a model that predicts target data without target labels. To address domain shift in unsupervised adaptation for image-to-image translation, a source model fS is pre-trained to perform the task on the source data. However, domain shift often leads to reduced performance on target data. To mitigate this, adversarial adaptation is used to map samples across domains, enabling the model to generalize to target data. This involves introducing a mapping from source to target G S\u2192T. Adversarial adaptation involves mapping samples from source to target domains to enable generalization to target data. The objective is to produce convincing target samples while minimizing instability and failure. The GAN loss ensures resemblance to target data, but preserving the original sample's structure and content remains a challenge. The adaptation method aims to preserve the original sample's content by enforcing cycle-consistency through a mapping from target to source. This is achieved by imposing an L1 penalty on the reconstruction error and ensuring high semantic consistency before and after image translation using a pretrained source task model. The adaptation method combines cycle consistency, semantic consistency, and adversarial objectives to produce a final target model. The adversarial objective involves a discriminator distinguishing between transformed source and real target images. The method introduced combines cycle-consistency, semantic transformation constraints, and adversarial objectives to create a target model. It generalizes prior adversarial objectives operating at pixel or feature levels and applies to digit classification and semantic segmentation. CyCADA is applied to digit classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The model is evaluated on various unsupervised adaptation scenarios, showing competitive performance across different datasets. Feature space adaptation is noted to provide additional benefits beyond pixel-only adaptation, especially for challenging shifts like SVHN to MNIST. Results for semantic image segmentation tasks using GTA and CityScapes datasets are also presented. Our method outperforms competing approaches on average in adaptation shifts of USPS to MNIST, MNIST to USPS, and SVHN to MNIST. The classifier uses a variant of the LeNet architecture and achieves 95.6% accuracy for all digit shifts. Ablation study shows the contribution of pixel space and feature space transfer. In adaptation shifts between USPS and MNIST, pixel space adaptation using CycleGAN BID48 outperforms prior approaches. Feature level adaptation offers a small benefit for small domain shifts. However, for the more difficult shift of SVHN to MNIST, feature level adaptation is more effective. Combining both pixel and feature level adaptation produces the best results. Ablation study shows that without semantic consistency loss, the unsupervised CycleGAN approach diverges when training SVHN to MNIST. Our modified approach uses source labels to train a weak classification model for enforcing semantic consistency in image translation, resulting in strong performance. Ablation study without cycle consistency loss shows failure in translating back to SVHN and reliance on weak source labeler for correct semantics. The task involves assigning semantic labels to pixels in input images. In the unsupervised adaptation setting, evaluation is based on performance in the target domain using three metrics: mean intersection-over-union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection-over-union (fwIoU), and pixel accuracy. Cycle-consistent adversarial adaptation can be applied at any network layer, but training the model in stages is more memory-efficient. The first stage involves image-space adaptation, followed by mapping the source data into the target domain. In the unsupervised adaptation setting, evaluation is based on performance in the target domain using metrics like mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and pixel accuracy. Image-space adaptation is followed by mapping the source data into the target domain. The adapted data is used to learn a task model for operating on target data. Feature-space adaptation is then performed using an intermediate layer of the task model. Model parallelism or larger GPU memory can be explored for future work. The method is also evaluated in a synthetic-to-real adaptation setting using the GTA5 dataset. In the adaptation setting, the GTA5 dataset is used for synthetic source domain adaptation to the real-world Cityscapes dataset. CyCADA outperforms baselines in adaptation, closing the gap to the target-trained oracle on pixel accuracy. Two base semantic segmentation architectures are compared, VGG16-FCN8s and DRN-26. Additional experiments evaluate cross-season adaptation in synthetic environments. Image-space adaptation is crucial for mapping source data into the target domain. In synthetic environments, image-space adaptation allows visual inspection of results, unlike feature-space methods. This helps ensure adaptation is not diverging completely. The method's applicability to real-world settings is evaluated from synthetic to real-world imagery, with results in Table 3 and qualitative results in Figure 4. CyCADA achieves state-of-the-art results in image-space adaptation, recovering 40% of performance lost to domain shift. It improves or maintains performance on all 19 classes, with good results on common classes. Comparison with BID34 showed worse performance. Visualization in FIG5 shows differences in saturation levels between original and adapted images. The adapted images from GTA5 to Cityscapes show changes in saturation levels and textures, with the model sometimes adding a hood ornament. CyCADA is a domain adaptation method that can adapt without target labels, achieving state-of-the-art results in image-space adaptation. CyCADA is a domain adaptation method that can adapt without target labels, achieving state-of-the-art results in image-space adaptation. The model is validated on various adaptation tasks, showing effectiveness even on challenging synthetic-to-real tasks. The process involves pretraining the source task model, performing pixel-level adaptation using image space GAN losses, semantic consistency, and cycle consistency losses, yielding learned parameters for image transformations and discriminators. The method involves transforming source images and labels, performing feature space adaptation to update the target model, and using a feature discriminator to guide the representation update. The generator is updated based on the discriminator accuracy, with equal weighting of losses. If no suitable discriminator is found after an epoch, the feature adaptation stops. The feature adaptation process involves using a variant of the LeNet architecture for digit experiments. The feature discriminator network has 3 fully connected layers, while the image discriminator network has 6 convolutional layers. A multilayer network is used for generating one image domain from another, consisting of convolution layers, residual blocks, and deconvolution layers. Training is done using the Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameters for each stage. For space adaptation, experiments were conducted using VGG16-FCN8s and DRN-26 architectures. Training details include batch size 100, learning rate 2e-4, and 50 epochs. The source semantic segmentation models were trained for 100k iterations with SGD for FCN8s and 115k iterations for DRN-26. Cycle-consistent image level adaptation followed CycleGAN BID48 architecture and hyperparameters. Images were resized to 1024 pixels width, and training involved randomly cropped images. The training involved resizing images to 1024 pixels while maintaining aspect ratio and using randomly cropped patches of size 400 by 400. Training was done for 20 epochs with SGD, momentum 0.99, and learning rate 1e-5. The segmentation model was trained separately using adapted source images and ground truth labels. Due to memory constraints, only one source and target image (crops of size 768x768) could be included at a time. The high momentum parameter was used due to the small batch size. Additionally, the SYNTHIA dataset was used for semantic segmentation evaluation. The SYNTHIA dataset, BID28, provides synthetic renderings of urban scenes across various environments and lighting conditions. In this study, adaptation techniques are evaluated specifically for seasonal changes, from fall to winter. Using only front-facing views mimicking dashcam imagery, the dataset consists of 13 classes with 10,852 fall images and 7,654 winter images. Pixel space adaptation using FCN8s architecture is explored for adapting across seasons in synthetic data. The focus is on interpreting performance improvements in unsupervised adaptation settings. In this study, adaptation techniques are evaluated for seasonal changes from fall to winter using the SYNTHIA dataset. Pixel space adaptation is explored with the FCN8s architecture to interpret performance improvements in unsupervised adaptation settings. The results show a shift from fall to winter with changes in snow coverage, leading to favorable semantic segmentation performance. CyCADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in image space adaptation but does not fully recover supervised learning performance. The model is able to distinguish between road and sidewalk during pixel adaptation without pixel annotations. CyCADA achieves near oracle performance in unsupervised adaptation, showing effectiveness in correcting common classes like road and sidewalk. Performance of a pixel level adaptation approach by BID34 on semantic segmentation data is illustrated. The study compares image to image translation results under different hyperparameter settings, showing that a \u03bb value of 10 preserves content but lacks the correct style, while \u03bb values of 1 or 2.5 result in inconsistent semantics. The model's performance is 11.6 mIoU, lower than the source model's 17.9 mIoU. Confusion matrices are used to analyze mistakes before and after adaptation. After adaptation, confusion matrices show improvements in reducing errors in digit recognition from SVHN to MNIST. However, some common confusions still persist, such as 7s being confused with 1s and 0s with 2s. Developing a model to overcome these errors between similar classes remains a challenge."
