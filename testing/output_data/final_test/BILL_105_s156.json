Congress approved the Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program under the Flood Control Act of 1944 to promote economic development, provide irrigation, and prevent floods. The Fort Randall and Big Bend projects are key components, generating hydropower and impounding water. These projects overlap with the Lower Brule Indian Reservation. Public Laws authorized the acquisition of Indian land on the Lower Brule Indian Reservation for the Fort Randall and Big Bend projects, impacting the Tribe's agricultural and pastoral lands along the Missouri River. Mitigation measures were put in place to address the effects of these projects on the reservation. The Army is authorized to protect, replace, and relocate essential facilities on the reservation for the Big Bend project. This includes schools, hospitals, offices, service buildings, employee quarters, roads, bridges, and related facilities. Additionally, a townsite for 50 homes with utilities and a community center for gatherings and tribal offices will be provided.
