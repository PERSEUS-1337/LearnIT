A pairwise comparator categorizes relationships between instances as 'greater than,' 'similar to,' or 'smaller than.' By comparing input with reference instances, the class can be reliably estimated. Order learning is applied to develop a facial age estimator with state-of-the-art performance. Performance improves when the order graph is divided into disjoint chains based on gender and ethnic group information. Comparisons are essential to measure quality, like a critic assigning stars to a film. In various decision processes, ranking through pairwise comparisons is common. This approach has been studied in machine learning, such as learning to rank and ordinal regression, to determine the order of objects based on comparisons. Order learning is a method to determine the ordering relationship between objects, which can be used for partial orders. It is related to LTR, ordinal regression, and metric learning. The goal is to classify objects based on whether they are 'greater than or smaller than' each other, represented by an order graph. Order learning involves determining the order graph and classifying instances based on their relationship. A pairwise comparator is used to compare instances and estimate the class, optimizing parameters and minimizing loss. This method is applied to facial age estimation, as it is easier to determine relative age differences than estimate exact ages directly. The proposed age estimator performs well in determining relative age differences between individuals. It can be further improved by dividing age classes into disjoint chains based on gender and ethnic group information. Pairwise comparison is used to estimate priorities of objects, with the scaling method reconstructing absolute priorities from relative ones. The scaling method was applied to monocular depth estimation and aesthetic assessment. Pairwise comparison ranking has been studied for handling large matrices or noisy elements. The pairwise approach to Learning to Rank (LTR) determines the relevance between two documents. Order learning predicts the order between objects, while ordinal regression predicts the rank of an instance. Ordinal regression predicts the rank of an instance, with a focus on penalizing misclassifications based on rank differences. It involves converting the problem into multiple binary classification tasks. This approach has been used in various applications such as age estimation and monocular depth estimation. Note that order learning, which involves pairwise comparisons between objects, is different from ordinal regression. In age estimation, ordinal regression focuses on determining if a person's age is greater than a threshold \u03b8, while order learning involves comparing the ages of two individuals. Order learning is conceptually simpler and requires fewer classifiers than the conversion scheme used in ordinal regression. Metric learning involves learning a distance metric from similar and dissimilar pairs of points, which can be used to enforce desired similarity criteria in clustering and classification. In age estimation, ordinal regression focuses on determining if a person's age is greater than a threshold \u03b8. Metric learning involves learning a distance metric to enforce similarity criteria in clustering and classification. Age can be estimated from facial appearance using various methods proposed in research. Niu et al. (2016) proposed OR-CNN and Chen et al. (2017) introduced Ranking-CNN for age estimation. Tan et al. (2018) grouped ages using group-n encoding, Pan et al. (2018) used mean-variance loss, Shen et al. (2018) used deep regression forests, Zhang et al. (2019) developed a compact age estimator, and Li et al. (2019) proposed a continuity-aware probabilistic network. Figure 1 shows examples of order graphs. Order learning involves determining which node precedes another node based on divisibility. An order on a set is represented by a directed graph, where an edge from node n to node m indicates that n divides m. This graph is acyclic due to antisymmetry and transitivity. Orders describe ranks or priorities of objects, such as age classes in age estimation. In order learning, a directed graph represents the order on a set based on divisibility. The graph is acyclic due to antisymmetry and transitivity. Orders determine ranks or priorities of objects, like age classes in age estimation. A subset of a set can form a chain if it is linearly ordered and maximal. In order learning, classes are represented in a directed graph to determine the order and categorize object instances. Different chains can be formed based on gender or quality assessment, with each chain representing a distinct set of classes. In order learning, classes are represented in a directed graph to determine the order and categorize object instances. Age classes compose disjoint chains, and the process involves categorizing instances into classes based on pairwise ordering relationships. The approach involves comparing instances based on class differences and defining their ordering relationship using a threshold. In order learning, classes are represented in a directed graph to determine the order and categorize object instances. The categorization is performed by a pairwise comparator using a Siamese network and a ternary classifier. Comparable instance pairs are used to train the comparator, which estimates the class of a test instance by comparing it with reference instances selected from the same chain. The consistency between the comparator result and the estimate is defined using an indicator function. The text discusses the concept of maximizing consistency in order learning using a pairwise comparator. The maximum consistency (MC) rule is used to estimate the class of an instance, taking into account possible classification errors. The quasi-transitive relation of ' , \u2248, \u227a' is used to categorize instances into classes, where '\u2248' is symmetric but intransitive. This approach helps in defining a mathematical order for categorizing instances. In the simplest case of 1CH, all classes form a single chain \u0398 c = {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}. Age estimation is done regardless of ethnic groups or genders. The comparator in Figure 2 is used to minimize inconsistency. The reference set is initialized and reduced via stochastic gradient descent. Reference images are sampled to minimize loss co. The reliability score of a reference candidate is defined. In the KCH approach, the reliability score of a reference candidate is defined, and the comparator is trained to minimize loss. The input instance is compared with references to estimate its class using the MC rule. Classes are assumed to form disjoint chains, such as in supervised 6CH for age estimation based on gender and ethnic group. Different chains are considered incomparable for age estimation. The supervised 2CH or 3CH approach divides chains by genders or ethnic groups. A K-way type classifier is trained to determine the chain of a test instance. The comparator and type classifier are jointly trained to minimize overall loss. During testing, the chain of an input instance is determined using the type classifier, and its class is estimated using the MC rule. The algorithm proposed in this subsection aims to separate classes into K disjoint chains without supervision or annotation data. It involves randomly partitioning the training set, selecting references with high reliability scores, updating membership, fine-tuning the comparator, and training a type classifier. The class of an instance is estimated using the MC rule. The algorithm aims to classify types without supervision by partitioning the training set into disjoint chains, selecting reliable references, updating membership, and training a type classifier. The reliability of references and affinity of instances are calculated using specific formulas. The process involves iteratively updating chain membership and selecting references to maximize reliability scores. The algorithm updates chain membership by maximizing affinity scores, iteratively refining representatives and assigning instances to optimal chains. A K-way type classifier is trained using the chains to refine membership. This iterative process decreases the same loss alternately. The algorithm updates chain membership by maximizing affinity scores and refining representatives iteratively. A K-way type classifier is used to refine membership, ensuring every class has a predefined number of instances. An age estimator is developed based on order learning, which is suitable for age estimation as it is easier to distinguish between older individuals than to estimate their exact ages directly.

A K-way type classifier is used to refine membership, ensuring every class has a predefined number of instances. An age estimator is developed based on order learning, which is suitable for age estimation as it is easier to distinguish between older individuals than to estimate their exact ages directly. In age estimation, categorization is based on geometric ratio rather than arithmetic difference. A two-step approach is used for comparison, reducing the number of comparisons needed while maintaining accuracy. Facial images are aligned and resized before feature extraction using VGG16 without FC layers. In Figure 2, VGG16 without FC layers is used to extract 512-channel feature vectors. These vectors are then input to a ternary classifier with three FC layers, resulting in 512-, 512-, and 3-channel vectors. The 3-channel vector is normalized to softmax probabilities of three categories. A type classifier is designed for determining the type of a test image in KCH with K \u2265 2, sharing the feature extractor with the comparator. The type classifier also uses three FC layers, yielding 512-, 512-, and K-channel vectors sequentially. The comparator and type classifier are jointly trained using VGG16 parameters pre-trained on ImageNet. The parameters are updated using the Adam optimizer. The learning rate is set to 10^-4 for the first 70 epochs and then reduced to 10^-5 for fine-tuning with selected references. The regularization constraint is enforced for unsupervised chains, ensuring equal distribution of training images among age classes. MORPH II and IMDB-WIKI are popular age estimation benchmarks with large datasets. The dataset used for pre-training age estimation networks includes 500,000 celebrity images from IMDB-WIKI. To address data imbalance, a balanced dataset is created by combining data from MORPH II, AFAD, and UTK, with 6,000 images sampled for each gender and ethnic group combination. Inconsistent labels are rectified before sampling, and the age distribution is considered during the process. During performance assessment, mean absolute error (MAE) and cumulative score (CS) are calculated. MAE measures the average error between predicted and actual ages, while CS calculates the percentage of images with errors less than a tolerance level. The proposed algorithm (1CH) is compared with conventional algorithms on MORPH II using different evaluation protocols. OHRank, OR-CNN, and Ranking-CNN are based on ordinal regression. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in age estimation using ordinal regression. It achieves state-of-the-art results in challenging tasks and yields the best performances in all settings. Order learning is shown to be effective for age estimation. Performance analysis on a balanced dataset shows superior results compared to other algorithms. The proposed algorithm for age estimation outperforms existing algorithms using supervised chains. Performance analysis on a balanced dataset shows worse MAE and CS scores compared to MORPH II due to the dataset's diversity. Processing facial images by gender (2CH) reduces MAE by 0.05 and improves CS by 0.2% compared to 1CH. Similar improvements are seen with 3CH or 6CH, which consider ethnic groups or both gender and ethnic groups. However, multi-chain hypotheses in MV sometimes degrade performances, with MV (6CH) yielding lower CS than MV (1CH). The proposed algorithm trains a single comparator but uses different references for each chain, while MV (6CH) requires training six age estimators. The proposed algorithm for age estimation outperforms existing algorithms by training a single comparator with different references for each chain. In contrast, MV (6CH) requires training six age estimators, making their training more challenging. The algorithm accurately identifies the age of a test image using type classifiers with high accuracy. The comparison results show the estimated age relative to a reference, with cyan, yellow, and magenta indicating older, similar, and younger ages respectively. The proposed age estimation algorithm outperforms existing methods by training a single comparator with different references for each chain. The algorithm accurately estimates age using type classifiers with high accuracy. Europeans have higher MAEs due to lower image qualities from UTK faces. Cross-chain test results show compatibility between certain chains for age estimation. The proposed algorithm for age estimation outperforms existing methods by using unsupervised chains, showing that gender or ethnic group is not the best data division for age estimation. Two chains are sufficient for a balanced set, with the unsupervised algorithm significantly improving performance compared to the supervised one. Regularization ensures each chain includes a certain percentage of training images, with sensitivity to this percentage being low. The performance of the algorithm for age estimation is not very sensitive to \u03ba. At \u03ba = 10%, chain 1 mostly consists of middle ages, while chain 2 includes 10s, 20s, 60s, and 70s. There is no strong age-dependent tendency at \u03ba = 50%, but certain combinations of gender, ethnic group, and age band show unequal division. Different \u03ba's yield various clustering results, with clusters outperforming the supervised algorithm. The unsupervised algorithm produces different clusters that outperform the supervised algorithm for age estimation. 'Looking-older' individuals in their 20s and 30s are separated from 'looking-younger' ones effectively. Order learning is proposed in this work, where classes form an ordered set.

The proposed algorithm outperforms MV, especially for older test subjects. The geometric scheme is more effective than the arithmetic scheme, with the best performance achieved at \u03c4 age = 0.1. Age differences determine similarity, with teenagers not similar if age difference is >1 and forties not similar if age difference is >5. The proposed algorithm outperforms MV, especially for older test subjects, with the best performance achieved at \u03c4 age = 0.1. Performance improves with more references, but saturates when M/N \u2265 5. In some cases, there are less than 5 references for certain ages in the dataset."
