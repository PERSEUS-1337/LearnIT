    "content": "The United States is a major net exporter of agricultural products, with exports totaling over $140 billion annually. The EU is a significant market for U.S. agricultural exports, accounting for about 10% of total exports. However, U.S. agricultural exports to the EU have not grown as quickly as to other markets, leading to a trade deficit of nearly $8 billion in 2015. This is a reversal from the trade surplus in the early 1990s. Trade between the United States and EU is dominated by non-agricultural products, with agricultural trade accounting for less than 5% annually. Major U.S. agricultural exports to the EU include tree nuts, soybeans, and distilled spirits, while major EU agricultural exports to the United States include wine, essential oils, and cheese. The statistics cover all 28 EU member states, including the UK (Brexit). Negotiations in the T-TIP deal involve agricultural issues such as market access, regulatory discussions, and intellectual property rights. Both U.S. and EU agricultural organizations aim for transparency, harmonization, and cooperation. Differences in laws and regulations, particularly regarding food safety and SPS measures, complicate negotiations. Negotiations in the T-TIP deal involve agricultural issues such as market access, regulatory discussions, and intellectual property rights. Differences in laws and regulations, particularly regarding food safety and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, complicate negotiations. The EU was rumored to consider concessions on SPS and other issues, but this interpretation has been discredited by policymakers in the US and EU. The USTR maintains a website with information on U.S. objectives and negotiating rounds. The European Commission maintains the EU's official website with negotiating proposals and fact sheets on T-TIP, including market access and regulatory cooperation. A USDA study suggests that removing tariffs in U.S.-EU trade could increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $5.5 billion, with gains in the U.S. livestock sectors. EU exports to the U.S. could also rise by $0.8 billion. The USDA reports that removing tariffs in U.S.-EU trade could boost U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $5.5 billion, with gains in the U.S. livestock and produce industries. Additionally, removing non-tariff barriers could further increase U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $4.1 billion annually. EU exports to the U.S. are estimated to rise by $1.2 billion. Overall, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to increase by 2%. The USDA reports that removing tariffs in U.S.-EU trade could boost U.S. agricultural exports to the EU by $5.5 billion, with gains in the U.S. livestock and produce industries. U.S. agricultural exports are estimated to increase by 2%, while U.S. imports rise by less than 1%. An EU-financed study of the economic impacts of T-TIP on agricultural output and employment concludes that the expected impact would be low compared to estimated impacts in other sectors. Some gains are expected in U.S.-EU agricultural trade, with U.S. exports of cereals/grains and vegetables/fruit expected to increase more than EU exports in these categories. The potential impact of Brexit on T-TIP remains unclear as both parties are evaluating the effect of Brexit on the negotiations. The exclusion of the UK from the EU could have implications on the trade agreement, with uncertainties surrounding the separation process that may take years to resolve. The UK's exclusion from the EU could impact potential trade gains under the T-TIP agreement. In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural products to the UK totaled $1.8 billion, while EU agricultural exports to the United States were $0.7 billion. Excluding distilled spirits and fish products paints a different trade picture. In 2015, U.S. exports of agricultural, fisheries, and distilled spirits to the UK totaled $1.9 billion, while UK exports to the United States totaled $2.3 billion. Concerns about EU bureaucracy, regulations, and national sovereignty were cited as reasons for the UK exiting the EU. UK food manufacturers supported remaining in the EU due to concerns about workforce and food supply. UK farmers had mixed opinions on leaving the EU, with some worried about losing agricultural support and others wanting to remove environmental regulations. The UK imports more food than it exports to the EU, with concerns about EU tariffs pricing out U.S. agricultural products. The average MFN tariff for agricultural imports in the US is 5.1%, compared to 12.2% in the EU. EU tariffs average over 40% for imported meat. The goal for U.S. agricultural exporters in the T-TIP negotiations is increased market access by reducing tariffs and modifying TRQs. The EU imposes high tariffs on agricultural imports, with averages exceeding 40% for meat products and over 80% for dairy products. Other EU trading partners have preferential tariff access, putting U.S. agricultural exporters at a disadvantage. TRQs are also a concern, allowing limited imports at lower tariffs before higher tariffs apply. The EU imposes high tariffs on agricultural imports, with averages exceeding 40% for meat products and over 80% for dairy products. TRQs are allocated to importers using licenses issued by national authorities. Only EU companies can apply for import licenses. The EU has TRQs on exports of various products, including beef, poultry, dairy, cereals, rice, sugar, and fruits/vegetables. Negotiations between the US and EU focus on eliminating certain agricultural tariffs. Negotiations between the US and EU in May 2016 are centered on eliminating specific agricultural tariff lines, including swine, lamb/sheep, dairy, cheese, chocolate, olives, and various food preparations. The EU's T-box tariff lines cover poultry meat, hams, swine meat preparations, grains, rice, bakery products, fertilized eggs, and miscellaneous items. The negotiations between the US and EU in May 2016 focus on eliminating agricultural tariff lines for various products, including swine, lamb/sheep, dairy, cheese, chocolate, olives, and food preparations. Recent information suggests that sensitive agricultural products like beef, pork, poultry, dairy, rice, and fruits and vegetables are not yet addressed in the negotiations. The European Council of Young Farmers calls for protection of these sectors, even with safeguard clauses like import quotas or sector exclusions based on factors like production costs and environmental standards. Senate leadership has emphasized the need for a strong agriculture framework in the final agreement, including tariff elimination on all products and liberalization in all sectors. The letter emphasized the importance of addressing regulatory barriers in agriculture, including import approval of biotechnology products and geographical indication restrictions promoted by the EU. High tariff barriers are compounded by non-tariff barriers like SPS measures and other restrictions that may hinder U.S. agricultural exports. Non-tariff measures (NTMs) include technical and nontechnical barriers that impact international trade. Nontechnical measures such as quotas, price controls, rules of origin, and government procurement restrictions create barriers for U.S. agricultural exports. These barriers include delays in biotech product reviews, prohibitions on growth hormones in beef production, and complex certification requirements for processed foods and animal products. U.S. businesses also face challenges with high EU tariffs, extensive regulations, and lack of up-to-date information, particularly for processed foods. The USDA has concerns about the lack of a science-based focus in establishing SPS measures, difficulty meeting food safety standards, differences in food labeling requirements across countries, and inconsistent testing requirements in EU member nations. EU non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports range from 23% to 102% for certain products like meat, fruits, vegetables, and crops. SPS measures are used to protect human, animal, or plant health from pests, diseases, contaminants in food. SPS/TBT measures in agriculture aim to ensure food safety by setting standards, testing requirements, and regulations for products traded internationally. This includes measures related to health, quality standards, testing, certification, and packaging regulations. Examples include product standards, residue limits for pesticides, and approval of biotechnology. Measures regarding food safety and public health in multilateral trade agreements are debated within the WTO. The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade outline rules for applying these measures based on scientific evidence to protect human, animal, and plant health. Improper use of these measures can create trade barriers. The use of SPS and TBT measures can create trade barriers if they are protectionist, lack scientific support, or are unwarranted. T-TIP aims to negotiate provisions that exceed WTO agreements, known as \"SPS-Plus\" and \"TBT-Plus.\" Efforts are also being made to address regulatory differences between the US and EU in agricultural trade. The EU and the United States have major differences in how they apply SPS and TBT measures, particularly in food safety regulations. The EU's precautionary principle leads to a more risk-averse approach, while the US has different regulatory standards. These differences have contributed to trade disputes between the two blocs. Trade disputes between the EU and the United States involve SPS and TBT rules, including concerns about bans on growth-promoting hormones in U.S. meats, restrictions on chemical treatments on U.S. poultry, and approval processes for biotechnology products. Other issues include BSE-related regulations, plant processing, pesticides, and animal welfare requirements. The EU also has concerns about SPS barriers to its exports of sheep and goat meat, egg products, and beef to the U.S. The EU has concerns about SPS barriers to its exports of sheep and goat meat, egg products, and beef to the U.S. Other issues include difficulties protecting IPR, such as EU geographical indications on food and drinks, and \"Buy American\" restrictions in the United States governing public procurement. T-TIP negotiations aim to address these issues and resolve long-standing trade disputes between the two trading blocs. Some are concerned about whether T-TIP can address regulatory differences and non-tariff barriers between the US and EU, especially in SPS matters. There are worries that sensitive agricultural products like beef, pork, poultry, dairy, rice, and fruits and vegetables may be excluded from the agreement. EU lawmakers also find a less ambitious agreement focusing only on market access unacceptable. Non-tariff barriers, including SPS and TBT issues, are being discussed in the T-TIP negotiations. Non-tariff barriers, such as SPS and TBT issues, are being addressed in the T-TIP negotiations. Regulatory coherence and cooperation are key goals for USTR in dealing with these issues, aiming to eliminate or reduce barriers without compromising regulatory sovereignty or binding outcomes. Regulatory convergence, cooperation, and harmonization are also part of the discussion. The goals in the T-TIP negotiations include eliminating non-tariff barriers like SPS and TBT issues to enhance U.S. export opportunities and promote regulatory compatibility between the U.S. and EU while maintaining health, safety, and environmental standards. This involves reducing unnecessary regulatory differences, promoting transparency, and facilitating trade. The T-TIP negotiations aim to eliminate non-tariff barriers such as SPS and TBT issues to boost U.S. exports and ensure regulatory alignment with the EU. This involves harmonizing regulations, promoting transparency, and facilitating trade. The EU's goals in the T-TIP negotiation include pragmatic and speedy procedures for trade regulations, a single approval process for exports from all EU countries, clear processes, and mechanisms for resolving trade disputes. The revised proposal emphasizes achieving more compatible regulations between the EU and the United States through regulatory cooperation and maintaining the level of protection while enhancing transparency and public participation. The EU's draft chapter on agriculture in the T-TIP negotiation includes provisions on geographical indications but does not directly address SPS issues. EU industry groups are pushing for regulatory cooperation, international standards, and trade facilitation to address non-tariff barriers. Challenges exist on specific issues, and some interest groups advocate for maintaining standards for human health, animal welfare, and the environment. The EU's proposed chapter on regulatory cooperation in the T-TIP negotiation covers animal welfare, which is a contentious issue for U.S. negotiators. It includes discussions on notice-and-comment procedures, testing requirements, and compliance issues like third-party labs versus self-certification. Some U.S. and EU stakeholders aim to include a range of standards for health, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability. Various reports indicate that U.S. and EU stakeholders are discussing policy issues related to the T-TIP negotiations, such as pesticides, antibiotics in animal production, and technology in agriculture. The EU has proposed addressing anti-microbial resistance in the SPS chapter of T-TIP, focusing on reducing antibiotic use in animal production. The U.S. is considering its approach to antibiotics in animal production, with some in Congress supporting restrictions similar to the EU. The EU's ban on ractopamine and hormones in livestock production may complicate T-TIP negotiations for the United States. Additionally, the EU's decision to ban cloning of farm animals and their products is at odds with the U.S., which believes cloned products are safe. The U.S. and Brazil have raised concerns about the EU's proposal at the WTO. The EU's proposal to restrict the use of glyphosate and establish criteria for endocrine disrupting chemicals is opposed by the United States and Brazil. There are concerns about potential restrictions on nanotechnology as well. U.S. agrochemical groups are against the EU's plans, which could impact agricultural exports. Endocrine disrupting chemicals could block $4 billion in U.S. agricultural exports annually. The T-TIP talks may help avoid trade disruption, but it is uncertain if these issues will be directly addressed. The U.S. Administration has pursued trade issues outside of T-TIP negotiations, such as import restrictions on pasteurized milk products by EU dairy producers. Biotechnology issues, including agricultural biotechnology, fall under SPS and non-tariff trade measures. Agricultural biotechnology involves genetically modifying plants and animals for desired characteristics like herbicide tolerance or pest resistance. Genetically engineered (GE) crops, such as soybean, cotton, and corn, have been widely adopted by U.S. farmers since 1996. GE varieties now dominate production in the United States and globally, with 28 countries planting GE crops on 444 million acres in 2015. A 2016 study by the National Academies found no evidence that GE foods are less safe than non-GE foods. EU officials have been cautious about GE crops. The EU has stringent regulations for genetically engineered (GE) crops, requiring authorization, labeling, and traceability. GE food and feed must undergo a safety assessment and coexist with non-GE farming. GE crops play a limited role in the EU's agricultural production, with Monsanto's Bt corn (MON 810) being the only GE plant authorized for cultivation in select countries. Bt corn production peaked at 367,300 acres in 2015, accounting for about 1% of the EU's total corn acreage, mainly in Spain and Portugal. Other GE products authorized for food or feed use in the EU include varieties of corn, cotton, soybean, canola, sugar beet, and microorganisms. The EU has authorized or is considering renewal of 57 GE varieties as of July 2016. In 2016, the EU authorized or is reviewing 57 GE varieties for renewal, with 22 registrations still under review. Soybean meal is the main GE product imported into the EU, primarily from Brazil. EU member states can ban cultivation of approved GE varieties. Regulations govern the handling of food and feed derived from genetic engineering in the EU, with further authorization required for cultivation or deliberate release into the environment. EFSA assesses environmental and health risks for authorization according to EU rules. The EU has established a minimum threshold of 0.9% for adventitious presence of authorized GE material in products, below which labeling is not required. The United States does not specify tolerance levels for GE in its laws, policies, or guidance. Some private processors and retailers may set their own tolerance levels. Many U.S. organic and non-GE food manufacturers adhere to the 0.9% tolerance level. In January 2015, the European Parliament adopted new legislation allowing EU member states to ban or approve GE crops. As of October 2015, 19 member states have requested restrictions on GE cultivation. Some EU countries are calling for a GE-free agricultural model in Europe. Other efforts to ban or restrict EU-approved GE products have been rejected by the European Parliament. The European Parliament rejected efforts to ban or restrict EU-approved GE products. Member states can now ban cultivation of GE crops even if approved. Several countries have opted out of GE crop cultivation, while others have not. Public opinion in most EU member states remains strongly opposed to GE food and crop cultivation. Public opinion in most EU member states remains strongly opposed to GE food and crop cultivation, with concerns about the safety and unnaturalness of genetically engineered food. Additionally, there are worries about the asynchronous approval of GE crops worldwide in trade negotiations like T-TIP. Trade associations representing biotechnology companies highlight these concerns. Trade associations representing biotechnology companies and related organizations have raised concerns about the increasing number of GE product approval requests in the EU, delays in approval timelines, failure of EU regulators to act as required by EU law, and the complexity of approvals for biotech products with \"stacked traits\". In April 2016, Senate leadership criticized the EU for missing import approval deadlines for biotechnology products, with some products awaiting approval since 2011 and 2012 despite positive evaluations by EFSA. Senator Chuck Grassley also pressed the EC in October 2014 to complete the review process for eight pending approvals. In April 2015, the EC authorized imports of 17 GM products, with over 40 additional GM applications waiting in the system. U.S. farm groups and producer groups have raised concerns about EU regulations affecting biotech product approvals and exports. The United States continues to express concerns within the WTO regarding EU measures on biotech products. The EU had a de facto moratorium on GE products from 1999 to 2003. In 2013, new regulations were released to clarify authorization procedures for GE products. The USDA believes these changes may not speed up the process and could reduce flexibility for risk assessors. U.S. producers are concerned about EU labeling and traceability regulations impacting exports, particularly soybeans. Some in Congress question approving T-TIP language that does not address the EU's biotechnology approval process. The USDA believes EU regulations on GE products may hinder the approval process and impact exports. U.S. producers seek consistent and timely biotech approvals from the EU to reduce risks. U.S. negotiators want the EU to align with their laws for biotech approvals. Several U.S. farm and feed groups are concerned about potential trade disruptions due to differences in biotech approval processes between the United States and EU. EU's hesitation in approvals is attributed to opposition from member states and support for national bans on GE crop cultivation. T-TIP negotiations could impact EU standards and labeling of GE products in the United States. EU negotiators have rejected a U.S. proposal to expedite approvals. EU negotiators have rejected a U.S. proposal to speed up GE product approval, citing concerns over regulatory changes and a shift towards a cost-benefit approach. Stakeholders highlight the lengthy approval process in the EU compared to the U.S. and suggest implementing legally prescribed timelines, transparency, and risk assessment to address trade disruptions. The U.S. is actively pushing for faster approval of GE crops. The United States is seeking to expedite approval for GE crops, which some European and U.S. advocacy groups see as an attempt to weaken the EU's risk assessment procedures. There are concerns that U.S. laws do not adequately regulate and test GE crops, while some support the EU's cautious approach and labeling requirements for GE products. The U.S. opposes EU directives allowing member states to ban or approve GE crops within their territories. The United States has raised concerns about the EU's opt-out policies violating the WTO's SPS agreement. They urged the EU to notify its policies to the WTO's SPS Committee. Geographical indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, like Parmesan cheese and Parma ham from Italy. GIs differentiate products in the marketplace and can be commercially valuable, offering relief from infringement and protecting consumers from misleading labels. Geographical indications (GIs) protect products like Parmesan cheese and Parma ham from specific regions. GIs are a form of intellectual property rights (IPR) along with patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. The use of GIs has become a contentious international trade issue, especially for U.S. wine, cheese, and sausage makers. GIs are included in the current U.S. trade agenda and have been a topic of debate in the T-TIP negotiation between the United States and EU. Laws and regulations governing GIs differ between the United States and EU, adding complexity to the issue. The United States and EU have differing laws on geographical indications (GIs), complicating the issue. GIs may be included in a potential T-TIP agreement under IPR or agriculture chapters. GIs are protected by the WTO TRIPS agreement, requiring recognition and protection as intellectual property. Both the US and EU commit to a minimum standard of GI protection and an \"enhanced level of protection\" for wines and spirits. The TRIPS agreement provides an \"enhanced level of protection\" for wines and spirits with geographical indications (GIs). WIPO oversees the International Register of Appellations of Origin, covering food and beverages, including Cuban cigars. EU regulations on GIs date back to the early 1990s. In the EU, regulations on GIs for agricultural and food products, wines, and spirits were initiated in the early 1990s. Legislation was changed in 2006 after a WTO ruling, with new rules in force since January 2013. The EU laws cover PDO, PGI, and TSG labeling schemes, linking product characteristics to geographical origin. The EU defines Geographical Indications (GIs) as distinctive signs used to identify products originating from a specific region with qualities linked to their geographical origin. GIs are seen as economically and culturally important, supporting local communities and rural development. The EU actively advocates for better international protection of GIs to prevent misuse and imitation, seeking \"TRIPS-Plus\" provisions for the direct and indefinite protection of EU names in other countries. The EU aims to protect EU names in countries outside the EU through a list of names, allowing co-existence with prior trademarks, phasing out other uses, ensuring a right to use, providing administrative protections, and creating a cooperation mechanism. Over 4,500 product names for foods, wine, and spirits are registered and protected in the EU, with two-thirds being wine registrations. One-fourth of registrations are for non-EU countries, mostly wine registrations. In the United States, GIs are protected as trademarks under the existing trademark regime administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). Trademarks are distinctive signs used by companies to identify their products or services, and can include names, logos, symbols, or designs. GIs registered as trademarks are included in PTO's U.S. Trademark Electronic Search System. The U.S. Trademark Electronic Search System registers GIs as trademarks, certification marks, and collective marks. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau oversees labeling resources for alcoholic beverages. U.S. trade policy addresses concerns about EU GI protections to protect market access for U.S. industries and common food names. The United States seeks protection for trademarks overlapping with EU-protected GIs and the ability to use U.S. trademarked names globally. U.S. food manufacturers view EU's protection of GIs as trade protectionism, limiting the use of common food names like parmesan and feta cheeses. The United States has concerns with the EU's system for protecting Geographic Indications (GIs), as it can impact trademark protection and market access for U.S. products. For example, \"feta\" is considered generic in the U.S. but protected as a GI in Europe, leading to restrictions on exporting feta cheese from the U.S. to the EU. GI registrations can be sold commercially, with concerns arising from GI protections in third country markets. Recent trade agreements between the EU and countries like Canada, South Korea, and South Africa may provide full protection of GIs, impacting U.S. agricultural exporters. Agreements with Canada and South Africa could recognize up to 200 EU GIs for milk and dairy products, affecting trade restrictions for U.S. products. The USTR's 2016 Special 301 Report highlights concerns about GI protections in trade negotiations with various countries, including the EU. Some Members of Congress are worried about EU GI protections creating trade barriers and impacting U.S. agricultural exports. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack and others have expressed concerns about the EU's system of protections for Geographical Indications (GIs) in trade agreements. The debate in the T-TIP negotiation threatens U.S. commercial interests by potentially blocking U.S. exports of agricultural products and discriminating against U.S. branded products. Many U.S. food producers are also members of the GI debate. Many U.S. food producers, including members of the Consortium for Common Food Names, aim to protect common food names and legitimate food-related GIs. Various agricultural groups support these efforts, while some are seeking to establish a system similar to the EU GI system for U.S. agricultural producers through the American Origin Products Association (AOPA). The American Origin Products Association (AOPA) aims to protect common food names and legitimate food-related GIs, increase value-added for AOPs, and create a national system for certification. Members include various agricultural groups such as Napa Valley Vintners, Idaho Potato Commission, and Vermont Maple Sugar Makers. This initiative responds to consumer demand trends and aims to address concerns in the U.S. wine industry regarding traditional and semi-generic names. The 2006 U.S.-EU Agreement on Trade in Wine addressed concerns regarding traditional and semi-generic names in the wine industry. Key provisions included measures on the use of 16 \"semi-generic\" names and traditional labeling terms. Despite the agreement, ongoing trade concerns include Geographical Indications (GIs) and market access issues. Ongoing trade concerns include Geographical Indications (GIs) and \"semi-generic\" terms, market access issues regarding \"traditional\" terms, new winemaking practices, technical issues, and regulatory coherence. EU officials aim to maintain GI protections in T-TIP negotiations, with proposals including protected food and agricultural products. Greece threatens to veto T-TIP unless GIs are protected, including feta cheese. Cheese names on the EU's GI list represent about 14% of U.S. cheese production. The EU's GI list represents about 14% of U.S. cheese production, valued at $4.2 billion per year. Recent reports suggest the EU may prioritize this list to 50 GIs. Concerns include registration costs, protection against fraud, and misleading origin indications. USTR believes the U.S. trademark system adequately protects European products. The issue of GIs in T-TIP negotiations may need to be addressed at a higher political level. The T-TIP negotiations present Congress with the challenge of concluding a comprehensive and high standard agreement between the United States and the EU. Factors such as offensive and defensive interests, import-sensitive sectors like agriculture, and non-tariff barriers need to be addressed for a successful outcome. The T-TIP negotiation aims to address market access and non-tariff barriers, with a focus on agriculture. European agri-business and food companies are lobbying for favorable terms. There are concerns about sensitive agricultural products and regulatory differences between the US and EU. Both sides insist that agriculture must be included in the final agreement. Senate leadership and US food/agriculture organizations expect a strong framework for agriculture in the T-TIP agreement. The UK's impact on T-TIP negotiation is uncertain post-Brexit. UK's alignment with US food regulations could be lost if it breaks from the EU. USTR urges completion of T-TIP negotiations due to EU's agreements with other countries. The UK's potential exit from the EU could impact preferential market access under a T-TIP agreement. Some in Congress have suggested a separate bilateral FTA with the UK post-Brexit. The sharp drop in the British pound may affect U.S. agricultural exports to the UK. Concerns have been raised about the slow progress of T-TIP negotiations. The T-TIP negotiations have not progressed as hoped, with waning political momentum and public support. Stakeholders in the U.S. agricultural sectors are looking to the TPP for guidance on issues like regulatory coherence and GI names. They are also monitoring separate negotiations between the EU and countries like Canada, Japan, and Mexico for insights on SPS and GI issues in global agricultural trade. The precautionary principle remains central to the discussions. The precautionary principle is central to the EU's risk management policy on food safety and health. It was established in the 1992 treaty and further outlined in a 2000 communication and EU food legislation in 2002. The principle allows for provisional risk management measures in cases of scientific uncertainty to ensure health protection. Guidelines for its application were also provided in the 2000 communication. The precautionary principle in international trade, under EU law, allows for rapid response to potential health or environmental risks. It can be used to halt the distribution of hazardous products. Different countries have challenged EU actions invoking this principle as protectionist. There is no universally agreed-upon definition of the precautionary principle in international law. The precautionary principle in international trade allows countries to set higher standards and inspect products, taking protective action if scientific evidence is inconclusive about their impact on health and the environment. This principle is a source of contention in trade, with some countries citing it as a reason for restricting imports. The precautionary principle in international trade is criticized for its ambiguity, arbitrariness, and bias against new technologies. Many U.S. agricultural and food organizations argue that it undermines sound science and innovation, leading to unjustifiable restrictions on exports. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports a science-based approach to risk management and opposes the adoption of the precautionary principle domestically and internationally. Several U.S. agricultural and manufacturing groups oppose the EU's use of the precautionary principle in regulatory decision making, arguing that it disregards scientific evidence and promotes disguised protectionism. Some in the U.S. agriculture and food industry are urging the T-TIP agriculture negotiations to address this issue, as the principle is central to the EU's risk management policy. The EU's use of the precautionary principle in regulatory decision-making is criticized by some U.S. groups for being too risk-averse and limiting scientific evidence. The T-TIP agriculture negotiations are urged to address this issue, as it is central to the EU's risk management policy. Some U.S. agriculture and food groups are concerned that the EU's maintenance of the precautionary principle in T-TIP negotiations could undermine sound science and food safety standards. The EU's regulatory cooperation proposals suggest the continued application of the precautionary principle, causing a divide in opinions. Recent developments in T-TIP negotiations suggest that the EU may have compromised on the precautionary principle. Critics argue that a U.S. proposal could lead to faster approvals of GE products in the EU and change policies on traces of GE products. However, U.S. and EU policymakers have dismissed these claims as misleading. EU's trade commissioner clarified that their proposal includes references to regulatory coherence. The EU's proposal in T-TIP negotiations emphasizes maintaining high levels of protection in public policy areas, including the precautionary principle. It assures that trade agreements will not lower consumer protection standards or change laws on GMOs, food safety, or environmental protection. The European Parliament's trade committee chairman also stresses the importance of upholding EU values in trade agreements. The EU is firm on maintaining high protection levels in T-TIP negotiations, including upholding the precautionary principle and not compromising on regulatory standards for GMOs or food safety. EU officials have reiterated that EU laws will not be changed, and efforts to harmonize regulations with the US will not weaken EU standards."
