    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010, and amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. It focuses on restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum coverage standards, and providing financial assistance. Starting in 2014, individuals must have health insurance, and certain employers face penalties for not providing coverage. Starting in 2014, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may qualify for credits toward their premium costs. Exchanges will be established to offer individual and small-group coverage, with private plans and multi-state qualified health plans available. Penalties will be imposed on certain employers who do not provide coverage, and market reforms will include prohibiting lifetime benefit limits and covering preexisting health conditions. In 2014, individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level may qualify for credits towards premium costs and subsidies for cost-sharing through exchanges. States have the flexibility to establish basic plans for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid. Existing plans will be grandfathered, and new plans can be sold in both individual and group markets outside of an exchange. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the PPACA will reduce federal deficits by $143 billion over a 10-year period. The PPACA will reduce federal deficits by $143 billion over 10 years and insure 94% of the non-elderly U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of coverage provisions is estimated at $788 billion over 10 years, partially offset by various sources including penalty payments and tax revenues. The CBO analysis estimates that the coverage provisions of the PPACA will cost $788 billion over 10 years, but these costs are offset by other changes in direct spending and revenues. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance, most of which will take effect in 2014. It includes topics such as individual mandate, employer requirements, private health insurance market reforms, and the Exchange. The PPACA requires various insurance market reforms, including the establishment of exchanges offering qualified health plans and premium subsidies. Immediate reforms in individual and group markets must be implemented before the full rollout in 2014, such as grants for consumer assistance, annual review of premium increases, coverage for preexisting conditions, and a re-insurance program. The PPACA includes reforms like creating re-insurance programs, establishing an Internet portal for coverage options, prohibiting limits on essential benefits, and ensuring patient protections. The PPACA includes reforms such as creating re-insurance programs, establishing an Internet portal for coverage options, prohibiting limits on essential benefits, and ensuring patient protections. Additionally, there are private insurance reforms that will become effective before 2014, including grandfathering existing health plans, small business tax credits, grants for workplace wellness programs, medical malpractice demonstration grants, and state requirements for establishing their own systems. The PPACA will establish new health insurance plans, including a \"qualified health plan\" (QHP) that meets specific requirements and provides essential health benefits. QHP issuers must be licensed in each state and offer silver and gold levels of coverage. The PPACA will establish new health insurance plans, including a \"qualified health plan\" (QHP) that must charge the same premium for a plan regardless of being offered in or out of the exchange. QHPs will include plans offered through the CO-OP program. A \"standard health plan\" will be established by the state for eligible individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid, have household income between 133% and 200% of the poverty line, are not eligible for minimum essential coverage, or are eligible for an employer-sponsored plan, and are under 65 years old. The PPACA defines terms related to private health insurance, including \"health plan,\" \"group health plan,\" and \"grandfathered plan.\" A health plan must provide essential health benefits and have a medical loss ratio of at least 85%. Grandfathered plans are those in which individuals were enrolled on March 23, 2010, and include plans renewed after that date. The PPACA defines terms related to private health insurance, including \"health plan,\" \"group health plan,\" and \"grandfathered plan.\" Essential health coverage includes various government programs, employer-sponsored plans, and other recognized health benefits coverage. The PPACA mandates most individuals to have health insurance starting in 2014, or face a penalty for noncompliance. This coverage must include essential health benefits and not exceed specified out-of-pocket limits. Noncompliance will result in a penalty calculated based on household income. The penalty for noncompliance with the PPACA mandate is either a percentage of household income exceeding the personal exemption or a flat dollar amount per taxpayer and dependents, capped at 300% of the flat dollar amount. The penalty percentages and flat dollar amounts will increase annually. Subsidies are available to help pay for premiums starting in 2014. Individuals will receive subsidies starting in 2014 to assist with premium and cost-sharing payments. Exemptions from the individual mandate include those with religious exemptions, members of health care sharing ministries, undocumented individuals, and incarcerated individuals. No penalty for lack of coverage for less than 90 days, certain income levels, or hardships determined by the Secretary of HHS. After 2014, individuals whose required contribution for a calendar year exceeds 8% of household income will be exempt from the penalty. Certain individuals residing outside the United States or in US possessions are considered to have minimum essential coverage and not subject to the penalty. Taxpayers failing to pay the penalty will receive a notice from the IRS and may have the penalty deducted from future tax refunds. Non-payment of the penalty does not result in criminal prosecution or penalties. Members of Congress and their staff can enroll in health plans created under the Act or offered through an exchange. Employers with at least 50 full-time equivalents (FTEs) may face penalties for not providing coverage or not meeting certain requirements. Non-payment of penalties does not lead to criminal prosecution. Employers with at least 50 full-time equivalents (FTEs) may face penalties for not providing coverage or not meeting certain requirements. The penalty for an applicable employer who provides coverage is similar to the penalty assessed against an employer who does not provide coverage. An employer may be subject to a penalty only in relation to its full-time workers, defined as those working an average of at least 30 hours per week. An employer is not subject to a penalty in relation to its part-time workers. Employers with at least 50 full-time equivalents (FTEs) may face penalties for not providing coverage or not meeting certain requirements. A small employer may offer full-time employees and their dependents coverage in an exchange plan, while a large employer may offer full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in a group health plan. An employer must file a return providing specific details about the coverage offered to employees to avoid penalties. In 2014, employers with at least 50 full-time equivalents may face penalties for not providing coverage or meeting requirements. The penalty for each full-time employee receiving a premium credit will be $3,000 per month, with a total penalty capped at the number of full-time employees minus 30 multiplied by $2,000 per month. Penalty amounts will be adjusted annually. Employers must notify employees about the exchange and services provided. No penalty for part-time workers. Employers with at least 50 full-time equivalents may face penalties for not providing health insurance coverage. Firms with over 200 employees must automatically enroll new full-time employees in a plan. Penalties for not offering coverage include a penalty equal to the number of full-time employees minus 30 multiplied by $2,000 per month in 2014, with adjustments in subsequent years. Employers not offering coverage must file a return stating so. Employers offering minimum essential coverage must provide free choice vouchers to qualified employees. A qualified employee is defined as someone whose contribution to the employer plan is between 8% and 9.8% of their household income, not exceeding 400% of the FPL for their family size, and not participating in the employer's plan. Vouchers will be indexed by the rate of premium growth after 2014. The voucher amount is based on the employer's plan cost for self or family coverage. The voucher is credited to the employee's health plan premium, with any excess paid to the employee. Employers are not penalized for providing vouchers. Small businesses may be eligible for a tax credit for health insurance coverage. Beginning in 2010, eligible employers can receive a tax credit towards their contributions to health insurance premiums. The credit covers up to 35% for for-profit employers and 25% for nonprofit employers. In 2014, the maximum credit increased to 50% for for-profit employers and 35% for nonprofits. The full credit is available to employers with 10 or fewer full-time equivalent employees with average wages of $25,000 or less. The small business tax credit is available for eligible employers starting in 2010, covering up to 50% for for-profit employers and 35% for nonprofits. The credit is in the form of a reduction in income and Medicare tax for nonprofits, and a general business credit for other qualifying employers. Unused credit amounts can be carried back one year and carried forward up to 20 years. PPACA will establish new federal standards for private health insurance coverage after full implementation in 2014. These standards will impact individual, small group, and large group markets, imposing new requirements on states and requiring coverage for specified benefits. States have the option to define \"small employers\" as those with 100 or fewer employees before 2016, and as those with 100 or fewer employees starting in 2016. PPACA will establish \"qualified health plans\" (QHPs) for small employers with 100 or fewer employees. States must uniformly apply standards for private health insurance. QHPs will have specific requirements for marketing, provider choice, essential benefits, and plan networks. QHP issuers must be licensed in each state, offer silver and gold coverage, charge the same premium in and out of the exchange, and comply with regulations. The PPACA will establish \"qualified health plans\" for small employers with 100 or fewer employees. States must apply standards for private health insurance uniformly. QHPs will have specific requirements for marketing, provider choice, essential benefits, and plan networks. QHP issuers must be licensed in each state, offer silver and gold coverage, charge the same premium in and out of the exchange, and comply with regulations. Existing plans may continue to offer coverage as grandfathered plans in the individual and group markets, subject to various insurance reforms. The PPACA establishes qualified health plans for small employers with 100 or fewer employees, with specific requirements for marketing, provider choice, essential benefits, and plan networks. New plans are subject to insurance reforms that prohibit excluding coverage for preexisting health conditions. The PPACA prohibits group health plans and issuers from using health status-related factors for coverage eligibility. It also allows for premium discounts based on wellness program participation and imposes nondiscrimination requirements on health care providers. Waiting periods are prohibited for group health plans and issuers in the group market. The PPACA prohibits health plans from imposing waiting periods greater than 90 days and requires issuers to offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis. Issuers in the individual and small group markets must determine premiums using adjusted community rating rules. The PPACA requires health plans to offer coverage on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis with adjusted community rating rules. Premiums can only vary based on specific risk factors like enrollment type, rating area, age, and tobacco use. Health plans must include essential health benefits and adhere to out-of-pocket limits applicable to high deductible health plans. The PPACA requires health plans to offer coverage with adjusted community rating rules and essential health benefits. It also includes provisions for pooling insurance risk among plan enrollees and across health plans, merging individual and small group markets, and establishing reinsurance programs by states. The PPACA requires health insurance issuers to contribute to a temporary reinsurance program for individual policies from 2014 to 2016. The program shifts the risk of high expenses from insurers to a nonprofit reinsurance entity, with total contributions of $12 billion in 2014, $8 billion in 2015, and $5 billion in 2016. States may collect additional amounts from issuers and modify existing high-risk pools. States will modify or terminate existing high-risk pools to align with reinsurance provisions. The Secretary will establish temporary risk corridors from 2014 to 2016, making payments to QHPs based on actual expenses compared to a target amount. States must adopt a risk-adjustment model for health plans and issuers in the individual market. The Secretary will apply risk adjustment to health plans in individual and small group markets, with plans of lower risk paying assessments to the state and higher risk plans receiving payments. Essential health benefits will be specified for Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) to cover, including categories like ambulatory services, hospitalization, mental health services, and prescription drugs. The essential health benefits package includes coverage for drugs, rehabilitative services, preventive care, and pediatric services. Health plans must adhere to specific cost-sharing limits and deductible amounts. PPACA prohibits deductibles on preventive health services in plans providing essential health benefits. The Secretary will define and update these benefits, ensuring they match typical employer-provided plans. States requiring additional benefits must reimburse individuals for the extra costs. QHPs must offer coverage at bronze, silver, gold, or platinum levels starting in 2014. Starting in 2014, health insurance issuers must offer coverage at bronze, silver, gold, or platinum levels, regardless of whether it is through an exchange. Excluding dental-only plans, issuers must offer a silver and gold plan in the exchange. Each level is based on a specified share of the full actuarial value of essential health benefits. Additionally, a catastrophic plan option will be available, providing coverage for essential health benefits with deductibles equal to out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified HDHPs, excluding at least three primary care visits. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance issuers to offer coverage at different levels (bronze, silver, gold, platinum) starting in 2014. Catastrophic plans with high deductibles will be available for young adults and those exempt from the individual mandate. $6 billion in funding will be used to encourage the creation of new health insurance cooperatives through the CO-OP program. The funds will be distributed as loans and grants to nonprofit member-run issuers offering Qualified Health Plans. Grant and loan awards must be made by July 1, 2013. The Secretary will prioritize grant and loan awards for applicants offering QHPs statewide, using an integrated care model, and with significant private support. Funding will establish at least one nonprofit health insurance issuer in each state and DC. If no issuer applies, grants will be awarded to encourage establishment. Grantees must follow PPACA provisions and regulations, with funds prohibited for propaganda. The law will prohibit the use of loan or grant funds for propaganda or influencing legislation. A qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer must meet specific requirements, including being organized as a nonprofit under state law, not being an existing insurance provider as of July 16, 2009, and not being sponsored by any government entity. Governance must adhere to ethics and conflict of interest standards. The governance of a qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer must operate with a strong consumer focus and be subject to a majority vote of its members. Any profits made must be used to lower premiums or improve benefits. The issuer must meet all requirements of other QHP issuers in any state, including solvency, licensure, network adequacy, and state law compliance. Coordination with state insurance reforms is required before offering a health plan in a state. PPACA allows qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers in the CO-OP program to form purchasing councils for cost efficiencies in areas like claims administration and actuarial services. The council cannot set payment rates or include government representatives. The Secretary of HHS is prohibited from participating in negotiations between issuers and healthcare providers or drug manufacturers. The CO-OP program under PPACA allows qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to form purchasing councils for cost efficiencies. The Secretary of HHS is prohibited from interfering in negotiations between issuers and healthcare providers or drug manufacturers. CO-OP organizations must comply with tax laws regarding nonprofit organizations, including restrictions on earnings benefiting private individuals, political activities, and lobbying. Grantees must apply for exempt status with the IRS and meet annual requirements. The CO-OP program under PPACA allows qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to form purchasing councils for cost efficiencies. Grantees must apply for exempt status with the IRS and meet annual information reporting requirements, including disclosing solvency requirements and reserves on hand. PPACA also enables states to create \"American Health Benefit Exchanges\" by 2014, similar to existing entities like the Massachusetts Connector and eHealthInsurance. These exchanges will provide qualified individuals and small businesses with new federal private health insurance standards. Exchanges will not be insurers but will provide access to insurers' QHPs for individuals and small businesses. They will be state-established entities with additional responsibilities like certifying plans and identifying eligible individuals for Medicaid, CHIP, and credits. The Secretary will make grant awards to states to create exchanges within one year of enactment, with grants renewable for progress. Exchanges must be self-sustaining by January 1, 2015. Exchanges must be self-sustaining by January 1, 2015, using assessments on insurers or other means to fund operations. The Secretary, in consultation with NAIC, will set standards for exchanges, QHPs, reinsurance, and risk adjustment post-enactment. States must implement these standards and private insurance market reforms by 2014. If a state is unable to establish an exchange by 2014, the Secretary will establish and operate one. PPACA allows for the creation of separate exchanges in each state for individuals and small employers. Exchanges may operate in multiple states with approval from each state and the Secretary. States may have more than one exchange serving geographically distinct areas. New individual and small-group QHPs can be offered inside and outside of an exchange. QHPs can be offered inside and outside exchanges, with premiums being the same. Premium credits and subsidies are only available through exchanges. Exchanges must certify QHPs, operate a hotline, provide comparative plan information, assign ratings, inform individuals of program eligibility, offer a cost calculator, and enroll eligible individuals in Medicaid or CHIP. The Secretary will establish procedures for enrolling individuals in exchange plans, investigating exchanges for misconduct, and conducting annual audits. Payment to exchanges may be rescinded for serious misconduct, up to 1% of the amount due. By January 1, 2019, GAO will conduct an ongoing study on exchange activities and enrollees in exchange plans, reviewing operation and administration, significant observations, recommendations for improvement, and physician acceptance of new patients in federal government health care programs. Beginning 2014, individuals may enroll in a plan through their state's exchange if residing in a state that established an exchange, not incarcerated, and lawful residents. Only lawful residents may obtain exchange coverage; unauthorized aliens will be prohibited. Initially, only small employers could offer coverage through an exchange, with states having the option to define \"small employers\" as those with 100 or fewer employees before 2016. Starting in 2016, small employers will be those with 100 or fewer employees. In 2017, states may allow large employers to obtain coverage through an exchange. Participating employers can limit workers' choice of exchange plans to a specific benefit level, such as silver. Members of Congress and their staff can only enroll in health plans. Beginning in 2014, individuals may be eligible for premium tax credits to help purchase health insurance based on income. However, even with subsidized insurance, some may struggle to afford cost-sharing for healthcare. Cost-sharing subsidies may be available for those eligible for premium credits, specifically for silver plans sold through an exchange. Beginning January 1, 2014, qualifying individuals will receive advanceable, refundable tax credits toward the purchase of an exchange plan. Individuals above 400% of the federal poverty level will not be eligible for credits. Qualifying individuals between 300% and 400% FPL would have to pay no more than 9.5% of their incomes in premiums. For those with income above 133% to 300% FPL, the percent of income they will have to pay toward premiums will rise from 3% to 9.5%. Qualifying individuals at or below 133% FPL would pay no more than 2% of income toward premiums. Beginning January 1, 2014, qualifying individuals will receive tax credits towards purchasing an exchange plan. Those below 133% FPL would pay a maximum of 2% of income towards premiums. Premium credit amounts are based on the second lowest cost silver plan. Individuals enrolling in more expensive plans must pay the difference out of pocket. Medicaid provisions of PPACA are not covered in this report. Beginning in 2014, states are required to extend Medicaid to all non-elderly citizens and certain legal aliens up to 133% FPL. If a person eligible for premium credits is also eligible for Medicaid, they will be enrolled in Medicaid. PPACA does not change noncitizens' Medicaid eligibility. PPACA does not change noncitizens' eligibility for Medicaid. Lawfully present taxpayers below 133% FPL who are not eligible for Medicaid may be eligible for premium credits in 2014. Individuals will generally be ineligible for credits if they are eligible for other types of coverage such as Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, military service coverage, employer-sponsored plans, or grandfathered plans. An individual eligible for subsidies could still qualify if their employer's plan costs exceed 9.5% of household income or if the plan covers less than 60% of total allowed costs. Individuals who qualify for premium credits and are enrolled in a silver tier exchange plan starting in 2014 can receive assistance in paying cost-sharing for health services. Out-of-pocket costs for high deductible health plans qualifying for health savings accounts are capped at $5,950 for single coverage and $11,900 for family coverage in 2010. Cost-sharing subsidies further reduce these maximums by two-thirds for individuals between 100% and 200% FPL, by one-half for individuals between 201% and 300% FPL, and by one-third for individuals between 301% and 400% FPL. The Secretary will provide additional cost-sharing subsidies to individuals between 301% and 400% FPL to ensure coverage of health care expenses. The Office of Personnel Management will offer at least two multi-state qualified health plans through every exchange, with enrollment being voluntary and eligible individuals may receive premium credits and cost-sharing assistance. A health insurance issuer offering a MSQHP must meet state exchange requirements, be licensed in each state, comply with state laws, offer a uniform benefits package, meet FEHBP standards, offer bronze, silver, gold, and catastrophic coverage, meet PPACA rating requirements, and offer the plan in all geographic regions. The OPM Director will enter into contracts with health insurance issuers offering MSQHPs in states that adopted adjusted community rating before PPACA. Contracts will be for at least one year and can be renewed automatically. Issuers must meet specific criteria and negotiate terms with the OPM Director. Noncompliant MSQHPs may be prohibited. The OPM Director will establish separate units or offices to ensure MSQHPs do not interfere with FEHBP. MSQHPs will have a separate risk pool and plans under FEHBP are not required to offer MSQHPs. PPACA will create a program for low-income individuals not eligible for Medicaid, similar to Washington State's BH Plan. The BH Plan, established by the Washington State \"Health Care Access Act of 1987,\" will have a similar state option under PPACA for individuals not eligible for Medicaid but with household income between 133% and 200% of the poverty line. Eligible individuals under 200% of poverty could qualify for premium credits in an exchange, but not if eligible for a state's basic health program. The Secretary will establish a program for states to create standard health plans, with funding equivalent to 95% of premium tax credits. The PPACA allows states to establish a basic health program that contracts with standard health plans to provide essential health benefits to eligible individuals. These plans must have a medical loss ratio of at least 85% and will receive funding equivalent to 95% of premium tax credits. The PPACA allows states to establish a basic health program that contracts with standard health plans to provide essential health benefits. The competitive process for health plans includes negotiation of premiums, cost-sharing, and benefits, with a focus on innovative features like care coordination, incentives for preventive services, and patient involvement in decision-making. States are encouraged to seek participation from multiple health plans to offer enrollees a choice between two or more plans. The PPACA allows states to establish a basic health program that contracts with standard health plans to provide essential health benefits. States will be allowed to negotiate a regional compact with other states to include coverage of eligible individuals. Beginning in 2017, states can apply for a waiver for up to five years of requirements relating to QHPs, exchanges, premium tax credits, and certain employer requirements. States applying for the waiver must ensure budget neutrality and comply with transparency regulations. The Secretary must ensure transparency and provide aggregate amounts of premium credits and subsidies to states. A waiver request can only be granted if the state plan offers comprehensive coverage, cost-sharing protections, coverage to a comparable number of residents, and does not increase the federal deficit. Under PPACA, the Secretary will promulgate regulations for interstate health care choice compacts by July 1, 2013, in consultation with NAIC. These compacts, available from 2016, will allow QHPs to be offered in all participating states while insurers must adhere to consumer protection laws of the purchaser's state. Insurers need to be licensed in all participating states and inform consumers that policies may not be subject to all state laws. States must enact laws to enter compacts approved by the Secretary, ensuring coverage is comprehensive, affordable, and does not increase the federal deficit. The new law requires that compacts must not increase the federal deficit or weaken state consumer protection laws. Insurers can offer nationwide plans subject to state benefit mandates and essential benefits package requirements. States can opt out of allowing nationwide plans. Insurers must file plan forms for review with each state. PPACA references the Hyde Amendment for coverage of abortion services by qualified health plans. Under the Hyde Amendment, HHS funds can be used for abortion in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to a woman's life, but not for elective abortions. PPACA allows individuals with premium credits to purchase plans covering elective abortions, with payment and accounting requirements to prevent subsidy use. President Obama's executive order reaffirmed abortion funding restrictions in PPACA after negotiations with House members. President Obama's executive order reaffirmed abortion funding restrictions in PPACA after negotiations with House members, allowing individuals with premium credits to purchase plans covering elective abortions. Plan issuers under PPACA can choose to provide coverage for elective abortions or abortions permitted by federal funds, with the option to not cover either type. States can prohibit abortion coverage in exchange plans by enacting laws. Issuers providing coverage for elective abortions must collect separate payments from enrollees for non-abortion health services and abortion coverage. The plan issuer must segregate payments for elective abortions and other services into separate accounts to comply with accounting requirements. The actuarial value of abortion coverage is determined based on average costs per enrollee per month, without considering cost reductions from services like prenatal care. Under PPACA, a qualified health plan providing coverage for elective abortions must notify enrollees at enrollment. The notice will detail the total combined payments for elective abortion services and other covered services. PPACA also includes conscience protection and upholds certain state and federal abortion-related laws. Exchange plans are prohibited from including elective abortion coverage without notice. The PPACA includes conscience protection and upholds state and federal abortion-related laws. It prohibits discrimination against healthcare providers or facilities for not providing, paying for, or referring for abortions. State laws on abortion coverage and procedural requirements are not preempted, and federal laws on conscience protection and abortion-related antidiscrimination are not affected. The PPACA includes conscience protection and upholds state and federal abortion-related laws. It prohibits discrimination against healthcare providers for not providing services related to assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing. The HHS Office for Civil Rights receives complaints of discrimination based on this issue. The PPACA includes provisions for addressing medical malpractice and liability insurance issues. States are encouraged to develop and test litigation alternatives while preserving individuals' right to seek redress in court. Congress may establish a state demonstration program to evaluate alternatives to the existing civil litigation system for medical malpractice claims, with $50 million appropriated for grants to states over a five-year period. The PPACA encourages states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims. States receiving grants must demonstrate how compensation will be paid and meet specific criteria. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and review states' applications with a panel of experts. States must report on the impact of funded activities on patient safety and medical liability insurance availability. The Secretary will also submit a report to Congress on the program's outcomes. The PPACA encourages states to develop alternatives to tort litigation for medical malpractice claims. States receiving grants must demonstrate how compensation will be paid and meet specific criteria. The Secretary will provide technical assistance and review states' applications with a panel of experts. States must report on the impact of funded activities on patient safety and medical liability insurance availability. Additionally, the Secretary must submit a report to Congress examining differences in quality of care, medical errors, resources used, dispute resolution time, and liability insurance availability and price. MedPAC and MACPAC will conduct independent reviews on the impact of state alternatives on their programs and beneficiaries. The law does not limit states' efforts to establish alternatives to tort litigation. PPACA also includes provisions to combat fraud and abuse related to multiple employer welfare arrangements. PPACA prohibits false statements in marketing MEWAs, requires registration with Labor Secretary, and allows cease and desist orders for fraudulent conduct. Labor Secretary can adopt regulatory standards for MEWAs operating in a state. The MEWA's alleged fraudulent conduct poses a danger to public safety or welfare. HIPAA prohibits discrimination based on health factors but allows wellness program incentives. PPACA incorporates HIPAA regulations on wellness programs. Wellness programs can offer rewards based on health factors, as long as they are available to all individuals. Rewards must be capped at 30% of employee-only coverage cost, but can be increased to 50% at discretion. Programs must be designed to promote health and not overly burdensome. The PPACA requires the establishment of a wellness program pilot program in 10 states by July 1, 2014, to apply wellness program provisions to health insurers in the individual market. The Secretary of Labor must prepare an annual report on self-insured group health plans, including various financial and benefit details. The Secretary of HHS is also required to submit a report within one year of enactment. The PPACA requires a study of group health plan markets and immediate private health insurance reform provisions under Title I, Subtitles A and B. The study compares employer characteristics, benefits, financial solvency, and risks of insolvency. The term \"immediate\" refers to the legal effective date of the provision, with actual implementation dates varying. The PPACA requires immediate private health insurance reform provisions under Title I, with implementation steps culminating in health plans certifying their use of new standards by December 31, 2015. A temporary high-risk pool program must be established within 90 days to provide coverage for eligible individuals until January 1, 2014, without preexisting condition exclusions. The Secretary can adjust the limit for HSA-qualified HDHPs to meet actuarial requirements for the high-risk pool program. Premium rates for coverage can vary based on age by a factor of 4 to 1. Eligibility criteria include being a U.S. citizen or national, not having prior creditable coverage, and having a preexisting condition. Effective for plan years beginning on or after six months after enactment, issuers in the group and individual markets must submit a report to the Secretary regarding the ratio of incurred loss to earned premiums. The report should detail the percentage of premium revenue spent on clinical services, healthcare quality improvement, and non-claims costs, excluding taxes and regulatory fees. This requirement applies to health insurance issuers offering group or individual coverage starting from January 1, 2011. The issuer must provide an annual rebate to enrollees if the ratio of premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is below 85% in the large group market and 80% in the small group and individual markets. States can adjust the percentages, but the Secretary may intervene if the 80% threshold destabilizes the individual market. The rebate amount is calculated based on the difference between the percentage and the ratio, multiplied by the total premium revenue. Health plans and insurance issuers are prohibited from establishing lifetime limits on essential health benefits and restricted annual limits. The Secretary ensures access to needed services with minimal impact on premiums. Annual limits will be prohibited starting January 1, 2014, similar to lifetime limits. Annual or lifetime limits can still be placed on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits. The law prohibits lifetime limits on essential health benefits and annual limits starting January 1, 2014. Rescissions of coverage are generally prohibited, except in cases of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. The Secretary must establish a process for reviewing unreasonable health insurance premium rates annually. The law requires annual review of unreasonable premium increases for health insurance coverage, with issuers justifying any hikes to the Secretary and states. Grants will be provided to states for this purpose, with $250 million allocated for grants. States must report on premium trends and recommend excluding issuers with excessive increases from the exchange. Coverage of Preventive Health Services Effective for plan years beginning on or after six months after enactment, group health plans and health insurance issuers are required to provide coverage for preventive health services. This includes evidence-based items or services rated \"A\" or \"B\" by the USPSTF, recommended immunizations by the CDC, preventive care for infants, children, and adolescents based on HRSA guidelines, and additional preventive care for women supported by HRSA guidelines. The law allows plans to cover or deny services not recommended by the USPSTF. The Secretary can develop guidelines for health plans to use value-based insurance designs. Dependent coverage extension effective for plan years starting six months after enactment. Extension of Dependent Coverage Effective for plan years beginning six months after enactment, coverage must be extended to adult children until age 26. For grandfathered group plans, coverage is limited to adult children without employer offers. Development of Uniform Explanation of Coverage Documents within 12 months after enactment for group and individual markets. Periodic review and updates by the Secretary. The Secretary will periodically review and update the standards for the Summary of Benefits (SB), consulting with various stakeholders. Federal standards preempt state law standards. Plans must provide a SB to applicants, enrollees, and policyholders within 24 months of enactment, in paper or electronic form. Enrollees must be notified of any materials.
