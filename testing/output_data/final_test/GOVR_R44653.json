    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies through 12 regular appropriations bills each fiscal year. If these bills are not enacted by October 1, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding until the process is completed. Extensions of CRs may be enacted until all regular appropriations bills are completed or the fiscal year ends. H.R. 5325 provides continuing appropriations for projects and activities covered by 11 of the 12 regular appropriations bills from October 1, 2016, through December 9, 2016. It also includes appropriations for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs for FY2017, emergency funds for Zika virus and flood relief. The bill was passed by the Senate and House on September 28, 2016, and signed into law on September 29, 2016. The curr_chunk provides a summary of the overall funding coverage, duration, and rate, as well as budget enforcement issues related to statutory discretionary spending limits. It also includes short summaries of agency-, account-, or program-specific provisions in the CR, organized by appropriations act title. For more detailed information on CRs and historical data, refer to CRS Report R42647. The CR's \"coverage\" specifies the purposes for funded projects and activities, often referencing previous appropriations acts. The \"duration\" of a CR indicates the period of budget authority provided. CRs use a \"rate for operations\" to fund activities at a restricted level based on total annual budget authority available under referenced acts. The CR provides continuing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2016 by regular appropriations acts, with some exceptions. Statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2017 are in effect, established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Budget authority includes both subject to limits and exempt authority, such as \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism\" (OCO/GWOT). The CR extends provisions from FY2016 appropriations acts, including funding for projects and activities like \"Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism\" (OCO/GWOT), continuing disability reviews, health care fraud control, disaster relief, and emergency requirements. Funds cannot be used for activities without FY2016 budget authority. The goal is to protect Congress's authority to provide annual funding as it chooses. Funding in the CR is effective from October 1. The CR provides budget authority for projects and activities funded in the 11 FY2016 appropriations acts covered by the CR at a rate based on the amount of funding provided in those acts for the duration of the CR (through December 9). Section 111 of the CR provides funding to maintain program levels under current law, with most projects facing a slight decrease in funding. However, Section 114 exempts certain appropriations from this decrease, such as OCO/GWOT, health care fraud control, and disaster relief. FY2017 appropriations are also subject to discretionary spending limits for defense and nondefense categories. The Budget Control Act (BCA) imposes spending limits on defense and nondefense categories. If spending exceeds the limit, sequestration involves across-the-board cuts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculates adjustments to the limits annually. For FY2017, discretionary spending caps are $551.068 billion for defense and $518.531 billion for nondefense. For FY2017 discretionary spending, OMB evaluates spending limits and enforces sequestration if necessary. The evaluation occurs within 15 days after the congressional session ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimates budgetary effects of interim CRs on an \"annualized\" basis. The total amount of annualized discretionary budget authority for regular appropriations subject to the BCA limits is $1,066.582 billion for FY2017. CBO estimates defense spending in H.R. 5325 to be $546.484 billion, below the defense limit, and nondefense spending to be $520.098 billion, above the nondefense limit. Adjustments can be made before the statutory discretionary spending limits are enforced by a sequester, which occurs 15 days after the end of the congressional session. The CR expires on December 9, 2016, with total annualized budget authority estimated at $1,149.084 billion. CRs include general provisions and specific agency, account, or program provisions, including anomalies to preserve Congress's appropriations prerogative. The CR includes provisions to preserve Congress's appropriations prerogative, create new laws, and change existing laws, often at the request of the President. Congress can accept, reject, or modify these proposals when drafting appropriations measures. Such provisions are temporary and expire when the CR ends. The CR includes provisions to preserve Congress's appropriations prerogative, create new laws, and change existing laws. This section of the report summarizes agency-, account-, or program-specific provisions in the CR, organized alphabetically by appropriations act title for 10 of the 11 regular appropriations acts covered. It also includes a provision directing the use of FY2017 advance appropriations for the Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act. The summaries provide brief explanations of the provisions and additional information when necessary. The CR includes provisions to preserve Congress's appropriations prerogative, create new laws, and change existing laws. For the duration of the CR, Section 116 increases funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to approximately $236 million, ensuring current caseload and participation while accounting for increased food costs. This anomaly allows the Commodity Credit Corporation to receive its $13 billion appropriation earlier to avoid running out of money. The CR includes provisions to preserve Congress's appropriations prerogative, create new laws, and change existing laws. An anomaly in the CR allows the Commodity Credit Corporation to receive its $13 billion appropriation a month earlier than usual to avoid running out of money. This anomaly does not change the appropriations level but permits higher funding apportionment for the Rural Rental Assistance program. The CR extends the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program. The Advancing Hope Act further extends the program until December 31, 2016. A sponsor of an approved new drug for a rare pediatric disease may receive a transferable voucher for priority review of another application. The CR does not extend Section 728 of the FY2016 Agriculture appropriation, which provided $271 million for land rehabilitation programs. Section 116(b) of the CR provides $20 million to the Department of Justice for authorizations in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) to address opioid abuse. This funding is for the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program for states, local governments, and Indian tribes to provide services related to opioid abuse. The CR includes provisions for various programs to address opioid abuse, such as training for first responders, medication-assisted treatment programs, prescription drug monitoring, and prevention programs for juveniles. It also prohibits the Department of Defense from funding new starts or accelerating production for major programs not funded in FY2016. The CR includes provisions for various programs to address opioid abuse and prohibits the Department of Defense from funding new starts or accelerating production for major programs not funded in FY2016. Among the Administration's proposed new starts barred by this provision are production of a new class of ballistic missile-launching submarines and the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, modernization of the radars on B-52 bombers, and replacement of the wings on A-10 ground attack aircraft. Among the programs for which the Administration has proposed production rate increases that are barred by this provision are the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, the Marine Corps's vertical take-off version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye carrier-borne radar plane. Section 121 authorizes the Defense Department to use up to $95.0 million to develop, acquire, and sustain new information technology systems to support the personnel security background investigations of the Office of Personnel Management. Section 122 would extend through FY2017 authorization. Section 123 extends authorization for the Department of Energy to fund the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund through December 9, 2016, to avoid disruption of projects in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. DOE must notify Congress within three days of using this authority. Section 124 of the appropriations act grants congressional approval of the District of Columbia budgets for FY2017, allowing the District to expend locally raised funds only for programs and activities funded the previous year. District officials can spend funds at the rate set in the Fiscal Year 2017 Local Budget Act of 2016. The appropriations act grants congressional approval of the District of Columbia budgets for FY2017, allowing the District to manage financial affairs and public services effectively. Funding is provided for the General Services Administration and the Office of Administration to carry out the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. The appropriations act provides additional funding for the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, emergency planning, and security costs related to the presidential inauguration. It also allocates funds for the National Archives for operations. The National Archives receives $4,850,000 for presidential transition responsibilities under the Presidential Records Act of 1978. The Small Business Administration is authorized to issue general business loans under the 7(a) loan guaranty program if demand exceeds the program's fiscal year authorization ceiling. The SBA suspended consideration of 7(a) loan applications in 1953 due to projected demand exceeding the $18.75 billion authorization ceiling. The program resumed on July 28, 2015, after the ceiling was increased to $23.5 billion. Previous legislation had also raised the ceiling to prevent exceeding demand. The DHS can use funds from the new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) as outlined in the FY2017 request to maintain staffing levels for TSA screeners and Customs and Border Protection personnel. This provision allows for adjustments to the structure developed since FY2016. The TSA repurposed funding for FY2016 to hire additional screeners and convert part-time screeners to full-time. The provision extends special procurement authorities for research and development activities at DHS. It also extends the authority for five agencies to collect recreation fees on federal lands and waters, with approximately $329 million collected in FY2015. The agencies collected $329 million in recreation fees in FY2015. The collected fees can be retained and spent without further appropriation for on-site improvements. An extension is needed to prevent the expiration of agencies' authority on September 30, 2017. Section 134 extends the Eisenhower Memorial Commission's authorization to establish a \"permanent\" memorial to President Eisenhower in the District of Columbia until December 9, 2016. Section 134 of the FY2016 appropriations law suspends the prohibition on issuing a construction permit for the Eisenhower Memorial until all necessary funds are raised. The Bureau of Land Management faces a revenue shortfall for processing oil and gas permits in FY2017 due to insufficient funds carried over from FY2016. The curr_chunk discusses providing $26.0 million in upfront revenue to process oil and gas APDs at the start of FY2017, with the amount later offset by collected fees. Additionally, $4.2 million is allocated to the National Park Service for security and visitor safety during the presidential inaugural ceremonies in January 2017. This funding increase was requested in anticipation of the inauguration being designated as a National Special Security Event. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) receives an additional $3.0 million for FY2017 for activities under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as mandated by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act. The EPA is required to implement new requirements and publish proposed rules to revise chemical regulatory procedures. Fees collected in FY2017 for TSCA implementation can be used as discretionary offsetting receipts. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA) provides $17 million to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address opioid abuse. The CR does not specify which HHS authorizations in CARA the funding is intended for or if it is sufficient for all activities. Section 138 extends the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) through December 9, 2016, tasked with assessing accreditation in higher education. NACIQI's termination date was set for September 30, 2016, but Section 422 of the General Education Provisions Act allows for a one-year extension for programs administered by the Department of Education. Section 139 eliminates the requirement for states and territories to spend $127 million on improving child care for infants and toddlers, a practice specified in recent appropriations acts. This change was established by the 2014 CCDBG reauthorization law (P.L. 113-186). The 2014 CCDBG reauthorization law (P.L. 113-186) requires states to spend 3% of their funds on improving infant and toddler care. Section 140(a) includes $140 million in cost-of-living adjustments for Head Start and Early Head Start grantees in FY2016 as part of their base grant for FY2017, allowing them to maintain program enhancements. The FY2016 appropriations act reserved $294 million for duration expansion grants under the Head Start Act. This amount was not considered part of a grantee's base grant for FY2017. The funding under the FY2017 CR was insufficient to support both increased base grant levels and the $294 million set-aside for duration expansion grants. Section 141 of the FY2017 appropriations act would make funding for CHIP's Child Enrollment Contingency Fund unavailable and rescind $6.2 billion from CHIP, including funds from performance bonuses and unobligated national allotments. Section 142 provides a gratuity payment to the widow of a deceased Member of the House. The gratuity payment to the widow of a deceased Member of the House is typically equal to one year's salary and is included in the next appropriations act. The Jason Simcakoski Memorial and Promise Act, part of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, requires the VA to expand the Opioid Safety Initiative without additional funding. The VA will expand the Opioid Safety Initiative to all facilities, designate pain management teams, participate in state drug monitoring programs, disclose veteran information, eliminate copayments for opioid antagonists, establish an office of patient advocacy, pilot complimentary health care, and create a commission for integrative health care options for veterans. The Veterans Expedited Recovery Commission will examine integrative health care treatment models and require the VA to document medical license violations for the hiring process. The Department of Transportation may provide funding to Amtrak according to the new budget structure created in the FAST Act. The appropriations bills would fund Amtrak under the new budget structure, with Section 143 crucial for timely implementation. Section 144 ensures ongoing funding for the Maritime Security Program, supporting U.S.-flag ship operators in foreign commerce. The program aims to maintain a fleet of 60 active ships for national defense and emergency sealift needs. Additionally, $500 million in Community Development Block Grant funds is allocated for disaster relief and recovery efforts. The act allocates $500 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG-DR) funds for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities in response to flooding in Louisiana and other disasters in 2016. States and local governments must submit disaster plans for HUD approval before using the funds, outlining how activities will support long-term recovery efforts. HUD must certify state and local compliance with the requirements. The act allocates $500 million in CDBG-DR funds for disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities. It requires HUD to certify state and local government disaster plans, prevent duplication of benefits, reduce waste, fraud, and abuse, and encourage timely fund expenditure. Grantees can use up to 5% for administrative expenses, cannot use funds reimbursable by FEMA or the Army Corps of Engineers, must maintain a public website on fund usage, and ensures regular CDBG allocation is unaffected by disaster assistance allocations. The act grants HUD broad authority to waive or establish alternative program requirements, except for provisions governing fair labor standards, fair housing, civil rights, and environmental review. It allows CDBG-DR grantees to adopt environmental reviews performed by other federal agencies to meet FEMA matching requirements without public review. Grants can be expedited if environmental reviews have already been conducted or if the project is exempt."
