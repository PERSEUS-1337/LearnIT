    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Open College Textbook Act of 2009\" and includes findings. The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and sharing of open educational resources. The President has proposed a significant Federal investment in online open-source courses for community colleges to make learning more accessible and affordable. The goal is to have the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. Over 80% of future jobs will require postsecondary education, yet only 36% of 18- to 24-year-olds are currently enrolled. The high cost of college textbooks remains a challenge. The high cost of college textbooks is a barrier for many students, with 200,000 qualified students not enrolling in college each year due to cost. On average, students spent $805 to $1,229 on books and supplies in the 2007-2008 academic year. Providing open textbooks for free could lower costs and improve learning by creating more flexible and accessible course materials. SEC. 3.
