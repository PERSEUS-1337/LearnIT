Efficiency has always been a priority for the House and Senate restaurants to support legislative work. By the mid-19th century, each chamber operated its own restaurants, which expanded as Congress grew. Today, both the House and Senate oversee their respective restaurant systems. The House and Senate each use private food service contractors to manage their restaurants, which have unique arrangements with congressional committees. Challenges include finances, facilities, food services, and employee wages. Historical context is important for understanding current and future operations. Dining at the Capitol became essential for Members of Congress. In the early 1800s, dining options at the Capitol quickly became necessary for Members of Congress. Separate eating establishments were established for each chamber by the 1830s or 1840s, with lunch counter service introduced in the early 1900s to meet the needs of busy individuals. Additional restaurant space was periodically added through renovations and expansions to accommodate the growing demands of Congress. In 1955, an extension of the Capitol was built with new private dining rooms for Representatives and Senators, which opened in 1962. New cafeterias and dining facilities were also added to each House and Senate office building. Carryout food service was introduced in the Cannon and Longworth House Office Buildings in 1953 to address lunch hour crowding. Various congressional entities have been involved in House restaurant management over the years. The House restaurant was overseen by various congressional entities, including the Commissioner of Public Buildings and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. The restauranteur set menu prices and kept profits but paid a fee to the House. Congress provided resources like coal, gas, and electricity for the restaurants. The Speaker charged the Commissioner of Public Buildings to oversee restaurant administration in 1828, and the Architect of the Capitol had similar authority from 1940-1971. Today, the AOC still manages House restaurant facilities. As the House grew, so did expectations for its restaurants. The House restaurants were overseen by various entities, with the Committee on Accounts taking control from 1921 to 1947. The Select Committee on the House Restaurant managed the system from 1969 to 1974. Calls for greater dining oversight arose in the early 1900s, but the House rejected the idea of running its own restaurants in 1904. The private restauranteur was removed in 1921, and the restaurant was operated by the Committee on Accounts. The House dining facilities faced complaints about being small, dirty, and lacking modern amenities. Efforts to improve included opening a new dining room in 1908 and a full restaurant renovation in 1911. Despite these changes, food and management issues persisted, with the restaurant manager struggling to make a profit after the ban on liquor sales, which was previously a major source of revenue. The House restaurant faced financial struggles even before the ban on liquor sales, with the Committee on Accounts taking over management in 1921. Concerns were raised about the venture being unprofitable and costing the government money. Despite initial challenges, food quality improved after the House took control of its restaurants. During the mid-twentieth century, new dining options were introduced in the Capitol and House office buildings, but they did not fully meet the House's needs. The Committee on House Administration established a Special Subcommittee on the House Restaurant during the 84th Congress to address restaurant space needs. A new private dining room for House Members opened in January 1962, but the House restaurant system struggled financially, partly due to extended operating hours. The House restaurant system faced financial challenges due to extended operating hours, leading to insufficient dining revenues to cover labor costs. Attempts to improve finances through menu price increases were not enough to offset rising costs. House restaurant workers were paid higher wages than private restaurant workers, impacting finances. Smaller eateries like coffee shops and catering services generated revenue but couldn't offset losses from other facilities. The Senate restaurant system, including the Hole in the Wall, faced financial challenges and relied on taxpayer subsidies. The Senate Club, established in the mid-1830s, operated until 1857 with expenses covered by the Senate contingency fund. The president pro tempore oversaw vendor selection for the Senate restaurant. The Senate restaurant system, including the Hole in the Wall, faced financial challenges and relied on taxpayer subsidies. The Vice President has control of the restaurant under Senate rules. The Senate Committee on Rules regulated Senate properties, including the restaurant. In 1942, management of the Senate restaurant was transferred from the Committee on Rules to the AOC. The Committee on Rules still had the right to approve policies and regain jurisdiction over the restaurants if desired. The Senate restaurant, criticized for high prices in the late 1800s, was popular despite its costs. Renovated in 1909, it became a bustling hub for Senate employees, Senators, and journalists gathering information during lunchtime. In 1909, the Senate restaurant in the Russell Senate Office Building expanded its dining space. Restauranteurs catered to individual Senators' tastes and offered various regional cuisines. The Senate bean soup and a chicken recipe tailored to Senator Benjamin Tillman's liking were popular menu items. Complaints about high prices and food quality led to calls for private catering in the 1910s. In 1911, members of the New England Pie Club rebelled against high restaurant prices by purchasing food at wholesale prices from the Senate restaurant. The Senate restaurant manager faced opposition from Senator W. Murray Crane, who advocated for the club's purchases. The House and Senate restaurants have been privately run at times, but for much of the twentieth century, they were operated by the chambers themselves. Some suggested that professional food service companies could better manage the restaurants. Some believed that food service companies could improve restaurant management, finances, and working conditions for employees. Currently, the House and Senate restaurants are operated by private contractors, with day-to-day activities overseen by a restaurant manager and key decisions made by designated members of Congress or committees. The House and Senate have always played a formal role in the restaurant system operation. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration adopted a resolution in 1947 to allow a private contractor to run the Senate restaurants due to financial issues. The restaurants operated at a loss under the contractor, leading to a reevaluation of the system by the Committee in 1960. In 1961, the Senate transferred management of its restaurants to the AOC to save costs and improve financial success. Workers became AOC employees, allowing them to work during Senate recesses. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, efforts began to transition back to Senate-operated restaurants. Efforts to unionize Senate and House restaurant employees in the late 1970s and early 1980s highlighted the jurisdictional complexity and exemption of legislative branch employees from workplace laws. The Senate restaurant employees began forming a labor union in 1960 when the Senate was run by a private contractor. In 1986, the Committee on House Administration explored privatizing House restaurants to improve finances. A Food Service Task Force recommended privatization and developed guidelines for vendor selection. The chosen vendor was approved in November 1986. The Food Service Task Force approved the vendor chosen by the AOC in November 1986, and Service America Corporation began managing the House restaurants on January 3, 1987. The contract with Service America required a 1% commission to be paid to the House. Workers were able to unionize under existing law after the switch from House employees to private restaurant employees. On February 27, 1987, a majority of the House restaurant system employees voted to join a union. Some workers opposed the change to private management, fearing they would lose benefits as federal employees. After a switch to private management by Service America, some federal employees were dissatisfied with changes in benefits and pay. The House's contract with Service America was terminated in July 1991 due to dissatisfaction with food and service quality. Service America claimed financial losses from running the House restaurants. Service America claimed financial losses from running the House restaurants, despite the restaurants running a surplus for six months under House management. Employees faced changes in benefits and pay, with some missing out on promised raises and seeing benefits cut back. The House considered returning the restaurant system to private management as a cost-saving measure. In 1993, the cafeteria in the Ford House Office Building was transferred to a local restauranteur who agreed to pay the House 4% of gross receipts. In March 1994, the House restaurants were required to be turned over to private management within 90 days. A competitive bidding process led to Marriott Management Services Corporation and Thompson Hospitality L.P. jointly operating the House restaurant system starting in July 1994. Employee job protections were a concern during the transition, but House restaurant employees were able to join a labor union again. In the early 2000s, subcontractors provided catering services for House eateries, impacting restaurant workers differently. By 2008, Restaurant Associates managed all House restaurants, chosen for their food quality, healthy choices, and environmentally friendly mission. They committed to greening measures under the \"Green the Capitol\" program, with costs reimbursed by the Chief Administrative Officer. Senate restaurants were operated by a private entity. The Senate restaurants were operated by a private vendor until 1961 when management was returned to the AOC. Financial challenges arose due to rising labor and food costs, leading to some years of profitability and others of losses. In 1984, there was a proposal to make the restaurants self-supporting, but no changes were implemented. In 1997, the Senate authorized a limited two-year early retirement. In 1997, the Senate authorized a limited two-year early retirement buyout for Senate restaurant employees, resulting in payroll savings. In March 2008, the Senate directed the AOC to negotiate Senate restaurant arrangements with a private vendor. The Senate signed a contract with Restaurant Associates in September 2008. Some workers were concerned about how their wages, benefits, and job security could be affected by the change to private sector employment. In July 2012, Senate restaurant employees reportedly voted against joining a workers union. Following the transition to private management of Senate restaurants in 2008, employees had the option to retain their existing benefits, including salary, health insurance, and retirement. However, some employees were reportedly not notified of changes to their benefits, such as frozen years-of-service for federal retirement benefits and ineligibility for overtime pay and employer-sponsored life insurance. The House and Senate restaurants, once the main dining options for Members of Congress and staff, have evolved into large institutionalized systems. Despite facing competition, they remain popular due to their convenience in facilitating legislative work. The House and Senate dining operations, within the Capitol complex, face challenges like finances, facilities, and employee wages. Despite competition, they remain popular due to convenience for Members of Congress and staff. The House and Senate restaurant systems prioritize convenient service to facilitate legislative work. Evolving into large institutionalized systems, they still face challenges with finances, facilities, and employee wages. Congressional involvement and oversight remain unique aspects of their operations."
