    "content": "The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the main federal law regulating pollution in the nation's surface waters, protecting \"navigable waters\" or \"waters of the United States\" (WOTUS). The definition of WOTUS determines which waters are federally regulated and has been debated for decades. The Army Corps of Engineers and EPA have defined this term in regulations, with Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 narrowing the scope of the CWA compared to previous regulations. The Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 narrowed the scope of the Clean Water Act, creating uncertainty about the protected waters. The 2006 Rapanos decision split 4-1-4, with different opinions on the application of dredge and fill provisions to wetlands. Agencies developed guidance in 2003 and 2008 to clarify implementation. The EPA and Corps provided guidance in 2003 and 2008 to clarify implementation of Supreme Court decisions on the Clean Water Act. This led to the 2015 Clean Water Rule, which defined the scope of protected waters under the CWA based on public input and over 1 million comments. The 2015 Clean Water Rule clarified the regulatory status of ambiguous waters following Supreme Court rulings, using the \"significant nexus\" standard. It identified jurisdictional categories of waters and established boundaries on jurisdiction scope, including traditional navigable waters and interstate waters. The 2015 Clean Water Rule established jurisdictional categories for waters, including tributaries and adjacent waters, based on defined definitions to ensure coverage of waters meeting the significant nexus standard. Tributaries and adjacent waters meeting the new definitions are jurisdictional by rule under the rule. The 2015 Clean Water Rule established jurisdictional categories for waters, including tributaries and adjacent waters, based on defined definitions to ensure coverage of waters meeting the significant nexus standard. Neighboring waters are defined as those located within specific distances of designated water bodies. The 2015 Clean Water Rule established jurisdictional categories for waters, including adjacent waters within 1,500 feet of the OHWM of the Great Lakes. Waters subject to case-specific evaluation for federal jurisdiction based on significant nexus to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or wetlands. Certain types of waters would require a significant nexus analysis, such as prairie potholes, Carolina bays, and Texas coastal prairie wetlands. The 2015 Clean Water Rule established jurisdictional categories for waters, including adjacent waters within 1,500 feet of the OHWM of the Great Lakes. Rule provides that two other categories of waters are subject to case-specific significant nexus analysis: (1) waters within the 100-year floodplain of a traditional navigable water, interstate water, or the territorial seas; and (2) waters within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or the OHWM of a traditional navigable water, interstate water, the territorial seas, impoundments, or jurisdictional tributary. Exclusions include restated exclusions under pre-2015 rules, new exclusions like stormwater management systems, and exemptions for existing \"normal farming, silviculture, and ranching activities\" and maintenance of drainage ditches. The Clean Water Rule clarified CWA jurisdiction for various activities, including agriculture and ranching. Industries and agriculture groups raised concerns about the broad interpretation of the proposed rule. The 2014 proposed rule for the Clean Water Rule was criticized for its ambiguous definitions and potential broadening of CWA jurisdiction. The final 2015 rule added key terms and exclusions, but concerns remained, especially regarding the inclusion of ditches under federal jurisdiction. Some states supported the rule, while local governments and industries raised objections. The 2014 proposed rule for the Clean Water Rule faced criticism for its ambiguous definitions and potential broadening of CWA jurisdiction. Some states supported clarifying the scope of jurisdiction, but there was no consensus on the final 2015 Clean Water Rule. Environmental groups generally supported efforts to protect waters, while some argued for further expansion of the proposed rule. The final 2015 rule required case-specific analysis for certain waters to determine jurisdiction. Corps and EPA officials defended the 2014 proposed rule but acknowledged concerns it raised. The Obama Administration defended the 2014 proposed rule but stated that the 2015 Clean Water Rule clarified key points. They emphasized that the 2015 rule did not protect new types of waters, did not exceed the CWA's authority, and addressed criticisms by defining tributaries more clearly and preserving agricultural exclusions. Stakeholders remained concerned despite the issuance of the final 2015 Clean Water Rule. The 2015 Clean Water Rule faced criticism from stakeholders for lacking clarity, expansive definitions, and a low threshold for \"significant nexus.\" Critics argued it would impose costs with little environmental benefit. Environmental groups supported the rule but also raised concerns about reduced jurisdictional reach and rolled back protections for certain waters. Currently, the rule is in effect in 22 states and enjoined in 28 states. Since the 2015 Clean Water Rule was finalized, its implementation has been influenced by courts and administrative actions. Industry groups, states, and environmental groups filed lawsuits challenging the rule. A district court prevented its enforcement in 13 states before it entered into effect on August 28, 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered a nationwide stay of the rule in October 2015. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of the 2015 Clean Water Rule, but later ruled that challenges to the rule should be filed in federal district courts. The EPA and Corps proposed an \"applicability date\" for the rule in November 2017, delaying its implementation until February 6, 2020. The 2018 Applicability Date Rule aimed to clarify the definition of waters of the United States while the 2015 Clean Water Rule was being revised. Lawsuits were filed challenging the rule, leading to a nationwide injunction by the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. This resulted in the 2015 Clean Water Rule going into effect in states without injunctions. The 2015 Clean Water Rule has been enjoined in multiple states, with court actions affecting its implementation. The Administration has also initiated steps to rescind and revise the rule following an executive order from President Trump. The agencies proposed a rule to review and revise the definition of 'waters of the United States' in two steps. The first step aims to rescind the 2015 Clean Water Rule and re-codify the previous regulatory definition of WOTUS. A supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking was published to seek additional comments on the repeal. A proposed step-two rule was announced to revise the definition of WOTUS, clarifying federal authority under the Clean Water Act. Some stakeholders urge Congress to define WOTUS through amendments to the CWA due to ongoing legal challenges and court rulings. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule and amend the CWA to add a narrower definition of navigable waters. H.R. 1105 would repeal the rule, while H.R. 1261 would nullify it and change the definition of navigable waters. The Clean Water Rule would be repealed and the definition of navigable waters changed under proposed legislation. H.R. 7194 aims to narrow the scope of waters under CWA jurisdiction, with H.Res. 152 and S.Res. 12 expressing the need to withdraw or vacate the 2015 Clean Water Rule. The farm bill, H.R. 2, included an amendment to repeal the rule, but it was not included in the Senate-passed version or the final conference report of H.R. 6147. The House-passed appropriations bills aimed to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule, but the Senate-passed versions and enacted public law did not include that provision. The House-passed appropriations bills aimed to repeal the 2015 Clean Water Rule, but the Senate-passed versions and enacted public law did not include that provision. The provisions in the bills would have authorized withdrawal of the Clean Water Rule without regard to established requirements, leading to ongoing struggles in interpreting navigable waters under the Clean Water Act. Stakeholders are seeking resolution on issues related to the scope of federally protected waters under the Clean Water Act. Some argue the scope is too broad, while others say it is too narrow. Regulations determining protected waters vary across the US, with different jurisdictional scopes in effect. Actions from the courts, Administration, and Congress could further alter federal jurisdiction. Some argue that the term navigable waters (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act is vague and should be addressed by Congress or the courts, while others believe the Corps and EPA are best suited to determine its scope."
