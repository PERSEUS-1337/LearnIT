    "content": "Factors affecting federal project delivery timing include changes in planning, design, funding priorities, construction complexities, local controversy, and compliance with various laws. Compliance with environmental laws has been a topic of debate in Congress, with scrutiny on the National Environmental. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider environmental factors in decision-making and prepare environmental impact statements for major actions. NEPA created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to oversee implementation. CEQ regulations introduced environmental assessments (EAs) and categorical exclusions to enhance environmental review processes. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider environmental factors in decision-making. Environmental assessments (EAs) are prepared to determine if a federal action will have \"significant\" impacts. Actions can be excluded from preparing an EIS or EA if they are known to have no significant environmental impacts. EIS preparation is a well-known NEPA requirement, but only a small fraction of federal actions require an EIS. In 2005, the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration reported that most highway projects were classified as categorical exclusions, while a small percentage required an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Projects needing an EIS often have significant impacts and high stakeholder interest. Critics argue that meeting NEPA's environmental review requirements can be inefficient and time-consuming, creating regulatory and logistical delays. Environmental organizations see NEPA as essential for responsible planning and public involvement in federal actions, cautioning against expediting the deliberative process. Critics argue that blaming the environmental compliance process for project delays is misplaced, as agencies are often overburdened and underfunded. Stakeholders have proposed administrative and legislative actions to expedite compliance with NEPA, collectively referred to as streamlining. Streamlining is defined differently by different stakeholders and agencies, but generally refers to processes intended to accelerate decision-making in projects involving multiple agencies. The environmental compliance process for projects involving multiple agencies can be complex, requiring compliance with various environmental laws. This can involve agencies with potentially conflicting missions working together to review project impacts. The need for streamlining efforts in reviewing FHWA's proposed projects arises from challenges in integrating state and federal environmental laws. Regulators often lack guidance and expertise in multiple laws, leading to delays in decision-making and progress. NEPA is a procedural statute with aims to consider environmental impacts and involve the public in federal decision-making. Regulators face challenges integrating various laws, leading to delays in decision-making. NEPA is a procedural statute that requires agencies to assess environmental consequences before proceeding with an action. It does not prioritize environmental concerns over other factors, but rather aims to integrate environmental considerations into federal decision-making. The law does not provide specific details on how this process should be carried out. The CEQ regulations, established in 1977 through an executive order, aimed to streamline the environmental review process under NEPA. Each federal agency was required to develop specific NEPA procedures for typical actions. Federal agencies were also directed to ensure their existing policies were in compliance with NEPA's intent. NEPA's 102(2)(C) requires federal decisions to include a detailed environmental impact statement (EIS) for actions significantly affecting the environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an environmental assessment (EA), which may lead to an EIS if impacts are significant. A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is issued if no significant impact is found during the EA process. The project may not have a significant environmental impact and could be categorically excluded from preparing an EA or EIS. Agencies list projects that are likely to be considered categorical exclusions, such as the construction of bicycle lanes and installation of traffic signals. Some agency procedures focus on determining if \"extraordinary circumstances\" could cause a normally excluded action to have a significant environmental effect. Under NEPA, an EIS must be prepared for every major federal action significantly affecting the environment. The term \"major\" in this context reinforces the significance of the action. It is crucial to determine if an action is federal and if its environmental impacts will be significant. Federal actions subject to federal control and responsibility include projects and programs funded, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies. Compliance with NEPA may be required for actions needing a federal permit or regulatory decision. CEQ regulations mandate agencies to assess project impacts on a case-by-case basis, based on context and intensity. Evaluating impact significance is subjective, with few federal court definitions. Courts determine if evidence shows potentially significant environmental effects for a project. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is a comprehensive document that evaluates the potential environmental effects of a project and assesses the agency's decision not to prepare an EIS. It includes elements such as Purpose and Need Statement, Alternatives, and Affected Environment. CEQ defines \"reasonable\" alternatives as practical and feasible options that use common sense. The EIS must also consider a \"no action\" alternative. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) evaluates the potential environmental effects of a project and assesses the agency's decision. It includes elements like Purpose and Need Statement, Alternatives, Affected Environment, and Environmental Consequences. The EIS is prepared in two stages, resulting in a draft and final EIS. Once the final EIS is approved, a public record of decision (ROD) must be prepared. The ROD includes a description of the measures proposed to mitigate adverse impacts and compliance with legal requirements. The ROD must include the final decision, all alternatives considered, and whether means to avoid environmental harm were adopted. A federal project cannot proceed until the ROD for the final EIS is issued. The lead agency must solicit comments from relevant agencies in the NEPA documentation. The NEPA process involves soliciting comments from relevant federal, state, and local agencies, as well as the public. Agencies with jurisdiction or expertise in environmental issues related to the project must provide input. NEPA regulations require concurrent preparation of documentation with other environmental requirements to streamline the compliance process and avoid duplication of effort. The documentation must also identify any federal permits, licenses, or entitlements needed for the project. The NEPA process requires identifying federal permits, licenses, and compliance with environmental laws. NEPA serves as a framework to coordinate with other environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act. Compliance with each applicable law would still be required even if NEPA requirements were removed. For more information on NEPA, refer to CRS Report RL33152. The debate over streamlining NEPA stems from concerns about project delays attributed to the NEPA process, including time needed for documentation and litigation. Stakeholders disagree on whether NEPA documentation alone significantly adds to project completion time. The NEPA process can contribute to delays in federal projects, but it is challenging to determine the extent of these delays. Limited data on the time needed for NEPA document preparation and the concurrent nature of document preparation with project design can lead to extended timelines. Changes in project specifications may also impact NEPA analysis and documentation, further complicating the assessment of delays directly attributed to the NEPA process. The NEPA process can cause delays in federal projects, but measuring the time taken for NEPA documentation is challenging. The time between the notice of intent (NOI) and the record of decision (ROD) may not accurately reflect the time needed to complete the project due to various unrelated reasons like funding issues or changes in agency priorities. The NEPA process can lead to delays in federal projects due to various reasons such as funding issues, changes in agency priorities, community opposition, or engineering requirements. Compliance with environmental laws is necessary for projects with significant environmental impacts, and the NEPA process may be extended to address other environmental requirements from agencies like the Corps, Fish and Wildlife Service, Coast Guard, EPA, and state regulatory agencies. This can include permitting processes or analyses required under separate statutory authority, leading to delays in the NEPA process. The NEPA process can cause delays in federal projects due to various reasons like funding issues, changes in agency priorities, community opposition, or engineering requirements. FHWA noted that many delays can be attributed to a fragmented approach in meeting NEPA and other requirements. Projects with significant impacts may face local controversy and opposition from stakeholders, leading to well-known delays. However, such projects make up a small percentage of all federal actions. The NEPA process can cause delays in federal projects due to various reasons like funding issues, changes in agency priorities, community opposition, or engineering requirements. Few data suggest that delays associated with NEPA are widely applicable to all federal projects. It takes longer to complete necessary NEPA documentation today than it did in the 1970s. The NEPA process has evolved since its enactment, with binding CEQ regulations outlining requirements introduced in November 1978. Many agencies did not have their own NEPA procedures until the 1980s, which may result in fewer overall project delays. Critics of NEPA often blame litigation for project delays, with individuals and groups using NEPA as a basis for lawsuits. Plaintiffs filing NEPA-related lawsuits since 2001 primarily cite inadequate NEPA documentation as a reason, such as insufficient analysis of project alternatives. NEPA litigation has declined since the 1970s, with 118 cases filed in 2005. The Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior were the most sued agencies. Despite the decrease in litigation, agencies still worry about potential lawsuits. Litigation concerns still impact the NEPA process, especially for complex projects. Project sponsors aim to create \"litigation-proof\" EIS by considering past legal interpretations. Stakeholders have varying views on this issue, with some seeing it as a way to ensure NEPA compliance while others believe it leads to unnecessary delays. Litigation remains a significant aspect of NEPA implementation due to its unique requirements. NEPA's requirements apply to federal agency actions, with no individual agency having enforcement authority. Litigation is often chosen by individuals and groups to challenge agency compliance with NEPA mandates. Public participation is a key element, impacting the potential for litigation. EAs are prepared to avoid public involvement as public participation requirements are not specified. Disagreement over EA vs. EIS is a common source of conflict under NEPA. Various proposals aim to streamline NEPA compliance, with similar elements in legislative provisions from the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses. These proposals are unique to different project categories and aim to expedite the process. Legislative streamlining provisions often require the lead agency to establish administrative procedures for processing permits, licenses, or environmental reviews. This coordinated process is typically outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the lead agency and participating agencies for certain projects. Legislation specifies decision-making authorities and methods for conducting environmental reviews under NEPA. Some legislative proposals allow the lead agency to establish a coordinated environmental review process under NEPA concurrently with other requirements. Proponents argue that this could lead to better and faster results, while critics are concerned about limits on agency input and strict deadlines that could restrict public involvement. CEQ's regulations aim to reduce delays and paperwork. CEQ regulations aim to reduce delays and paperwork by integrating NEPA requirements with other procedures, setting time and page limits on EISs, emphasizing interagency cooperation early on, and potentially putting these directives into law. The lead agency is responsible for NEPA analysis and documentation, with streamlining legislation designating specific agencies for certain projects. This legislation allows lead agencies to set deadlines for actions and implement dispute resolution procedures. Some proposals aim to reassert lead agency authority in legislation specific to individual agency actions, but this may not significantly streamline the compliance process as federal agencies already have this authority. One potential cause for delay in the NEPA process is obtaining federal agency approval for less complex documentation, which some suggest could be delegated to states to expedite the environmental review process. Delegating authority to states for environmental review processes could speed up the process by removing federal bureaucracy. However, environmental stakeholders are concerned that states may have vested interests in moving projects forward, potentially leading to less scrutiny than federal oversight. A challenge to state delegation includes a lack of qualified staff to process complex documentation, which has been identified as a cause of project delays. Delegating additional authority to state or local agencies may slow down the compliance process instead of streamlining it due to staff limitations. Project sponsors may face challenges in reviewing and approving documentation to ensure environmental requirements are met. One method to expedite the process is designating certain projects as categorical exclusions. This report focuses on legislative efforts to streamline the NEPA process. The report discusses using the regulatory process to add new categorical exclusions (CEs) to NEPA procedures. Agencies gather data to develop proposals for new CEs, often based on past actions. Proposed CEs go through public rule-making and comment before final approval. Congress may also designate new CEs through the legislative process. Proponents argue for legislative designation of categorical exclusions (CEs) to streamline the process due to the perceived cumbersome regulatory process. They believe projects with minimal environmental impact should be designated quickly. Opponents argue that legislative designation bypasses public comment and involvement, potentially overlooking significant environmental impacts. NEPA lacks provisions for judicial review of agency actions. NEPA lacks provisions for judicial review of agency actions, leading to no deadline for filing petitions for review. Courts have applied laches or the statute of limitations from the Administrative Procedure Act to address delays in NEPA litigation. The statute of limitations mandates civil actions against the United States to be filed within six years after the right of action accrues. The streamlining method involves establishing a specific statute of limitations on judicial review of final agency actions related to NEPA. Proponents argue for shorter time limits, while opponents fear it may hinder citizen enforcement of NEPA requirements. Recent activities include legislative changes, administrative adjustments, and the creation of NEPA task forces to expedite the process. Streamlining legislation aims to expedite the NEPA process for certain projects, with agencies like USDA, DOD, DOE, DOI, and DOT filing the majority of EISs. Legislation such as the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 include streamlining provisions for specific projects within these agencies. The Equity Act of 2005 (SAFETEA-LU, P.L. 109-59) and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) focus on construction and energy projects. The Water Resources and Development Act (P.L. 110-114) authorizes expedited planning for water projects and reducing biomass fuels on federal lands. Title I of the Equity Act of 2005 focuses on reducing biomass fuels near at-risk communities and in municipal watersheds to mitigate forest fire risks. It authorizes a new NEPA process for fuel reduction projects on national forests or BLM lands in specific areas. The law limits the number of project alternatives to be analyzed and requires a pre-decisional review process for Forest Service projects. The Forest Service is developing a new \"pre-decisional\" review process to replace the current administrative appeals process. Lawsuits against agency projects must be filed in the district court where the project is proposed. Proponents argue that biomass fuels are at dangerous levels, while opponents believe public participation and legal challenges are necessary. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 and the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 aim to streamline processes for fire protection and federal surface transportation programs. The legislation addresses issues related to public involvement, timber sales, and environmental concerns. Key provisions of SAFETEA-LU related to streamlining include establishing procedures for efficient environmental reviews, setting deadlines for decision-making, imposing a 180-day judicial limitation on claims challenging final agency actions, authorizing transportation funds to expedite the review process, establishing a dispute resolution process for disagreements, and allowing states to determine certain projects as categorical exclusions. The Energy Policy Act includes environmental streamlining provisions to expedite federal authorizations for energy development projects, such as permits and approvals required by various environmental laws. State pilot programs may assume federal responsibilities for compliance with environmental laws. For more details, refer to CRS reports on environmental issues in transportation reauthorization and NEPA implementation for highway projects. The Energy Policy Act includes provisions to streamline compliance with environmental reviews under NEPA for projects like the designation of right-of-way corridors for pipelines and electricity facilities on federal land in certain states within a two-year deadline. The Energy Policy Act requires the identification of right-of-way corridors for pipelines and electricity facilities in certain states within a two-year deadline. Additionally, the act mandates the completion of a programmatic EIS for a commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands resources on public lands in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. It also establishes an interagency coordination process for federal authorizations related to oil shale and tar sands projects. The Energy Policy Act mandates coordination among federal agencies for environmental reviews and authorizations for natural gas pipelines and utility facilities on public lands. It also establishes a process for siting interstate electric transmission facilities under the Federal Power Act. The Energy Policy Act designates the Department of Energy as the lead agency for coordinating federal authorizations and environmental reviews for transmission or distribution facilities. It also allows the DOE to set deadlines for these processes. Specific actions on public lands related to oil or gas exploration are presumed to be categorical exclusions under NEPA if they meet certain criteria. The Energy Policy Act allows for drilling oil or gas wells in certain circumstances, such as on previously drilled sites or within developed fields with approved plans. It also permits the placement of pipelines in approved corridors and maintenance of minor activities. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32873 on key environmental issues in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Policy Act of 2005 includes streamlining provisions for NEPA analysis for grazing permits administered by the USDA's Forest Service or the Department of the Interior's BLM. A backlog of permit applications and renewals exists, with annual provisions in the Interior appropriations bill allowing for permit extensions until NEPA compliance is completed. The Policy Act of 2005 streamlines NEPA analysis for grazing permits by USDA's Forest Service and BLM. Legislation directs renewal of grazing permits expired between FY2003 and FY2008, with NEPA analyses required before expiration. Reporting to Congress on analysis completion is mandated every two years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447, Division E, Title III, \u00a7 339) allows certain grazing decisions by the Secretary of Agriculture to be categorically excluded under NEPA for FY2005-FY2007 if current management meets objectives and is consistent with policy. A maximum of 900 allotments can be excluded. Section 2044 of the law addresses coordination of federal, state, and local actions for specific projects like water supply and ecosystem restoration. The provision in Section 2045 of the law calls for a coordinated project review process for water resources projects, requiring the Secretary of the Army to establish a schedule for consolidating environmental assessments, project reviews, and permit issuance. Non-federal interests must cover the costs of this process. The law mandates a coordinated review process for water resources projects, requiring the Secretary of the Army to establish a schedule for concurrent reviews and approvals by federal, state, and local agencies or Indian tribes. The process must be completed within a specified time frame and involve all relevant jurisdictional agencies. The law mandates a coordinated review process for water resources projects involving federal, state, and local agencies or Indian tribes. The process must be completed within a specified time frame and involve all relevant jurisdictional agencies. The Secretary may incorporate the process into an MOU with jurisdictional agencies and follow specified procedures for missed project deadlines. State authority is granted to identify participating state jurisdictional agencies. Administrative streamlining procedures are specific to each agency's programs, with examples including the Forest Service's expansion of CEs for NEPA process streamlining. The Forest Service expanded its list of categorical exclusions (CEs) to include various activities such as rehabilitation, timber harvesting, administrative changes, and land management plans. They also modified the application of \"extraordinary circumstances\" when determining project qualifications for a CE. The new rule allows for discretion in determining if extraordinary circumstances warrant NEPA analysis for exempt projects. An interagency agreement was announced to review safety and security issues at LNG import terminals, designating FERC as the lead agency for environmental reviews under NEPA. The interagency agreement designates FERC as the lead agency for environmental reviews under NEPA for LNG terminals and tanker operations. It outlines roles, responsibilities, early issue identification, information sharing, and cooperation among agencies to expedite reviews and permit issuance concurrently with FERC authorizations. FERC is designated as the lead agency for environmental reviews under NEPA for LNG terminals and tanker operations. NEPA task forces have been established to review NEPA's effectiveness and implementation at various agencies, including one created by a congressional committee to assess if amendments to the law are necessary. CEQ formed a task force in 2002 to improve NEPA implementation practices and procedures. The CEQ Task Force conducted research by reviewing public comments, literature, and case studies, and engaging with stakeholders. They released a report in September 2003 with recommendations for integrating the NEPA process with environmental management systems, coordinating NEPA with other environmental requirements, establishing categorical exclusions, developing focused environmental assessments, and monitoring proposals effectively. The CEQ Task Force released a report in September 2003 with recommendations for integrating the NEPA process with environmental management systems, coordinating NEPA with other environmental requirements, establishing categorical exclusions, developing focused environmental assessments, and monitoring proposals that rely on the use of CEs and EAs. Interagency workgroups have been established to develop handbooks and guidance to expedite energy-related projects while maintaining safety, public health, and environmental protections. The executive order established an Interagency Task Force within the Department of Energy, chaired by the chairman of CEQ, to expedite energy-related projects. The task force includes members from various government agencies and was directed to monitor actions permitted by law and regulation. The Interagency Task Force, chaired by the CEQ Chairman, was directed to assist federal agencies in expediting permit reviews for energy-related projects and coordinating permitting activities. Several MOUs were developed for streamlining environmental reviews, including one for Pipeline Repair Projects. Executive Order 13274 in September 2002 directed federal agencies to prioritize Environmental Stewardship and Transportation Infrastructure Project Reviews. The Interagency Transportation Infrastructure Streamlining Task Force, chaired by the Secretary of Transportation, expedited environmental reviews for transportation projects of national or regional significance. A total of 19 highway, transit, and airport projects were chosen for expedited review, with 12 projects already receiving a FONSI or ROD. The task force includes members from federal agencies involved in environmental project reviews. In April 2005, a Task Force was formed to review and make recommendations on potential changes to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Chaired by Representative Cathy McMorris, the Task Force held hearings to gather stakeholders' experiences with the NEPA process. The Task Force released a draft report in December 2005 with recommendations for amending NEPA, directing CEQ to promulgate regulations, and conducting studies on NEPA's implementation. The final report was issued later. The Task Force was formed in April 2005 to review NEPA and issued a final report in July 2006 with recommendations for amending NEPA and conducting studies on its implementation. Compliance with environmental statutes for federal projects is complex, even for those with minor impacts. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) oversees federal agencies' compliance with environmental requirements, but does not enforce regulations. CEQ's regulations are generic, allowing agencies to create their own procedures for projects. The time and nature of delays in preparing NEPA documentation for federal projects can vary, requiring tailored remedies. Streamlining proposals for NEPA-related delays have sparked controversy among stakeholders, including agency representatives, industry groups, and environmental organizations. While most agree that compliance with environmental requirements for federal projects could be more efficient, there is disagreement on how to achieve this. Industry representatives advocate for strengthening lead agencies' authority and enforcing hard deadlines to reduce delays, while environmental groups are concerned about speeding up the process and minimizing input from \"non-lead\" agencies. Streamlining proposals for NEPA-related delays have sparked controversy among stakeholders, with industry groups advocating for strengthening lead agencies' authority and enforcing hard deadlines, while environmental organizations are concerned about weakening environmental protections by speeding up the compliance process. The debate on additional streamlining methods is ongoing, and the inclusion of such provisions in legislation by the 110th Congress remains uncertain. Additional information on environmental compliance issues and agency streamlining activities can be found on federal agency websites and CRS products. The curr_chunk provides references to various reports and websites related to environmental compliance issues, including the Department of Energy's Office of NEPA Compliance, Department of the Interior's Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance, Federal Lands managed by BLM and Forest Service, grazing regulations, oil and gas exploration on public lands, FHWA's NEPA project development and relevant SAFETEA-LU provisions.
