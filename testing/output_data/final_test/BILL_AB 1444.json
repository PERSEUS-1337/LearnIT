    "title": "AB 1444",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 13332.19 of the Government Code is amended to define \"design-build\" as a construction procurement process where both design and construction are procured from a single entity. This process is used for capital outlay projects and involves a design-build entity that can provide licensed contracting, architectural, and engineering services. The design-build solicitation package includes performance criteria, concept drawings, contract forms, and other necessary documents for soliciting bids. The \"design-build phase\" follows the contract award to a design-build entity, where they complete design and construction activities to finish the project. \"Performance criteria\" describe the project scope, including building size, design, materials, and operational requirements. Concept drawings may be included to detail the state's needs. Funds for a design-build project must be approved by the Department of Finance and State Public Works Board before being spent by state agencies. Exceptions include real property acquisition, equipment, minor capital projects, performance criteria appropriations, preliminary plans before 2005, and projects at the Salton Sea. Amounts appropriated for projects at the Salton Sea must be approved by the State Public Works Board. Any funds spent on the design-build phase prior to approval of performance criteria will be reverted if not approved. Design-build projects with capital outlay appropriations must have bid packages approved by the Department of Finance before solicitation. Changes to performance criteria require written approval from the Department of Finance. Bid or proposal alternates in the design-build solicitation package must be approved by the Department of Finance. The State Public Works Board can increase a design-build project by up to 20% of the capital outlay appropriations, regardless of reversion. The Department of Finance has the authority to decide which fund sources will cover the augmentation for projects with multiple funding sources. Augmentations exceeding 20% will be deferred until additional funds are allocated by the Legislature. The State Public Works Board can increase a design-build project by up to 20% of the capital outlay appropriations for a construction reserve without augmenting the project. Any augmentation exceeding 10% must be reported to the Chairperson of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. The Department of Finance can modify approved scopes for major design-build projects and must report changes and cost implications to relevant committees. Additionally, the Department must report to committees when the estimated cost of a design-build project exceeds 20% of the amount recognized by the Legislature. Section 10187.5 of the Public Contract Code is amended to define \"best value\" as a value determined by evaluation of objective criteria related to price, features, functions, life-cycle costs, experience, and past performance. This determination may involve selecting the lowest cost proposal meeting department interests and project objectives, choosing the best proposal for a set sum, or a tradeoff between price and other factors. The curr_chunk defines terms related to construction subcontracts, the Department of General Services, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Department of Water Resources, and the design-build project delivery process. The curr_chunk defines terms related to design-build entities, design-build teams, and the definition of \"Director\" for different departments. The curr_chunk amends sections in the Public Contract Code and Government Code related to notifying boards about selecting design-build entities and defining terms for foreign-trade zones. The curr_chunk defines \"public corporation\" and \"private corporation\" in relation to establishing foreign-trade zones. It also repeals Section 6301 of the Government Code and amends Section 6302 to allow public corporations to apply for the privilege of operating foreign-trade zones. Any private corporation can apply to establish and operate a foreign-trade zone under the act of Congress. Section 6303 and 6305 of the Government Code are repealed, while Section 6304 is amended to specify the conditions and regulations for operating the zone."
