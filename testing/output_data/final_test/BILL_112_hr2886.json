    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening Homeland Security, Intelligence, and Essential Law Enforcement Departments Act of 2011\" or the \"SHIELD Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the importance of ensuring uninterrupted compensation for the United States Armed Forces and federal law enforcement officers to maintain morale, security, and national interests. Federal law enforcement officers play a crucial role in various activities such as dignitary protection, criminal investigation, homeland security, border security, intelligence gathering, and combating waste, fraud, and abuse. These functions are essential for the government and commerce to operate smoothly during times of crisis, and their interruption due to lack of Congressional appropriations or government shutdowns could pose risks from violent criminals, terrorists, and other threats. During a debt ceiling crisis, priority payments will be made for the pay and allowances of military members and critical law enforcement officers. In case of a funding gap, emergency appropriations will be allocated for defense and federal law enforcement. During a funding gap, emergency appropriations will be allocated for military pay and allowances to ensure uninterrupted compensation for active service members of the Armed Forces and critical law enforcement officers. During a funding gap, the Secretary of the Treasury will provide necessary funds to ensure uninterrupted pay and allowances for critical law enforcement officers. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, a \"critical law enforcement officer\" is defined as an employee with the authority to make arrests, carry firearms, and perform emergency work. The term \"period of lapsed appropriations\" refers to a period when funds for pay and allowances are not available due to delayed enactment of appropriation Acts or resolutions. The curr_chunk discusses appropriating funds for pay and allowances, with a reference to the term \"total public debt\" as defined in section 3130 of title 31, United States Code."
