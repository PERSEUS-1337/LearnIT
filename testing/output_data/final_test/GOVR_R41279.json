    "content": "In 1971, Jack Gross started working for FBL Financial Group, Inc. and was later reassigned to a new position, leading him to sue the company for age discrimination. The company argued that the decision was not based on age but on other lawful reasons. The jury found in favor of Gross, shifting the burden of proof to FBL to show they would have taken the same action regardless of age. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the jury's decision in favor of Gross, citing flawed jury instructions. The Supreme Court reviewed the case to determine if direct evidence of discrimination is required for a mixed-motive instruction in an ADEA case. ADEA case shifts to the employer regardless of evidence type, disparate treatment and impact claims can be made in employment discrimination cases. Disparate treatment requires proof of intent to discriminate, shown directly or circumstantially. The courts have established rules for adjudicating disparate treatment claims, often seen in cases involving Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the ADEA. Plaintiffs can prove their claims through indirect or direct methods, with the burden-shifting framework from Supreme Court cases like McDonnell Douglas v. Green and Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine used when evidence of discrimination is lacking. In mixed-motive cases, the plaintiff can present evidence of age discrimination directly, without the need for the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting model. The confusion stems from Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, where the Court addressed whether Title VII covers employment actions partly based on discriminatory reasons. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 established mixed-motive claims under Title VII, allowing for discrimination claims if race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor in an employment practice. This amended the rules regarding employer liability in mixed-motive cases, partially overruling previous decisions. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 established mixed-motive claims under Title VII, allowing for discrimination claims if race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor in an employment practice. Despite these amendments, Congress did not add similar language to the ADEA for mixed-motive claims. The Court later clarified in Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa that direct evidence of discrimination is not required for a mixed-motive jury instruction under Title VII. The Court granted review in Gross to determine the evidence required for a burden-shifting jury instruction in an ADEA mixed-motive case. In Gross, the Court ruled in favor of FBL, stating that the ADEA does not allow for mixed-motive claims like those under Title VII. An employee must prove that \"age was the 'but-for' cause of the adverse employment action.\" The Court ruled in Gross that the burden of proof lies with the employee to show that age was the sole cause of the adverse employment action, without shifting to the employer. This decision differed from previous appellate court rulings that applied the mixed-motive framework to the ADEA. The Court emphasized the textual differences between Title VII and the ADEA, noting that the ADEA does not include a provision for proving age as a motivating factor, unlike Title VII. The Court held that the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework does not apply to ADEA claims, as the ADEA does not authorize mixed-motive claims like Title VII. Instead, the ADEA prohibits adverse employment actions based on age, requiring employees to prove age as the reason behind the employer's action for a disparate treatment claim. Employees seeking to establish a disparate treatment claim under the ADEA must prove that age was the \"but-for\" cause of the employer's action. The burden of persuasion lies with the plaintiff, who must show by a preponderance of evidence that age was the decisive factor in the employer's decision. This means that in mixed-motive ADEA claims, employees need to demonstrate that age was the determining factor, unlike traditional Title VII claims where showing age as one of several reasons was sufficient. The Court remanded the case for a new trial in a dissenting opinion arguing that the ADEA should prohibit employment actions motivated in part by age. Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer dissented in the Gross decision, criticizing the Court's reliance on a question not presented by the parties. They argued against the new \"but-for\" causation standard for age discrimination claims, making it harder for employees to prove their case when both legitimate and illegitimate reasons are involved in an employment action. The Gross decision established a new \"but-for\" causation standard for age discrimination claims, requiring employees to show age was the deciding factor in employment decisions. This shifts the burden of proof to the employee and could impact claims under statutes like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Gross decision established a new \"but-for\" causation standard for age discrimination claims, shifting the burden of proof to employees. This standard may also impact claims under statutes like the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Other non-discrimination statutes could be susceptible to similar interpretation, potentially leading to congressional efforts to overturn the ruling. The legislation (H.R. 3721 / S. 1756) aims to address employment discrimination by allowing plaintiffs to use circumstantial or direct evidence to prove their claim. If passed, the burden would shift to employers to show they would have taken the same action regardless. This type of congressional action has precedent, such as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 which clarified time limits for suing employers for pay discrimination."
