The \"Family Farm Estate Tax Deferral Act of 2010\" allows for the exclusion of qualified farmland from the gross estate if certain conditions are met, such as the executor electing the application of the section and the decedent being a U.S. citizen or resident. The \"Family Farm Estate Tax Deferral Act of 2010\" allows for the exclusion of qualified farmland from the gross estate if specific conditions are met, including income limitations, property usage for farming purposes, and ownership of farmland by the decedent or their family for a certain period. The \"Family Farm Estate Tax Deferral Act of 2010\" allows for the exclusion of qualified farmland from the gross estate if specific conditions are met, including income limitations, property usage for farming purposes, and ownership of farmland by the decedent or their family for a certain period. Qualified farmland is defined as real property located in the United States, used for farming purposes, acquired from or passed to a qualified heir, and being used as a farm at the time of the decedent's death. Material participation in the operation of the farmland by the decedent or a family member is also required for the exclusion. The adjusted value of farmland for estate tax purposes is determined by deducting allowable amounts under section 2053(a). Terms used in this section have the same meaning as in section 2032A. Tax treatment of dispositions and failures to use farmland for farming purposes includes the imposition of a recapture tax if conditions are not met after the decedent's death. After the decedent's death, if the qualified heir disposes of farmland or stops using it for farming, a recapture tax is imposed. The amount of the recapture tax is determined similarly to the rules of section 2032A(c) for additional estate tax. The recapture tax imposed on qualified farmland is adjusted to reflect any increase in its value at the time of taxation compared to the adjusted value included in the estate. Rules similar to those in section 2032A apply for this purpose. Additionally, a special lien for additional estate tax applies under section 6324B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new subsection regarding the application of special liens for estate tax on qualified farmland. The notice of lien filed against qualified farmland must state that the lien is imposed solely for the estate tax exclusion granted under section 2033A. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 now includes an exception for woodlands subject to a forest stewardship plan, allowing for the disposition of standing timber on qualified woodlands under approved plans. Compliance with the forest stewardship plan is required within a 10-year period. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for certain conservation transactions that are not treated as dispositions, including qualified conservation contributions and sales of qualified conservation easements to qualified organizations. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for conservation transactions that are not considered dispositions, including qualified conservation contributions and sales of qualified conservation easements to qualified organizations. Definitions for these terms are provided in the code. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act. The Dollar Limitation on Exclusion is increased to $5,000,000. The Percentage of Value of Land Excludable is increased to 50 percent with a 2.5 percentage point adjustment. These amendments apply to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act."
