    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Access to Emergency Defibrillation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that over 220,000 Americans die annually from cardiac arrest, with 80% caused by ventricular fibrillation. The chance of survival decreases by 10% each minute after sudden cardiac arrest. Sixty percent of cases occur outside hospitals, with a national survival rate of only 5%. Communities with public access defibrillation programs have achieved survival rates as high as 50%. Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can reach 50%. The American Heart Association states that widespread defibrillator use could save up to 50,000 lives annually. Successful public access defibrillation programs ensure early notification, CPR, defibrillation, and advanced care for victims. SEC. 312 of the Public Health Service Act establishes public access defibrillation programs to improve survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The Secretary awards grants to develop public access defibrillation programs, training personnel and placing defibrillators in public areas for immediate care of cardiac arrest victims. The public access defibrillation programs aim to ensure proper maintenance and testing of devices, provide CPR and defibrillation training to the public, integrate emergency services with defibrillator locations, and encourage businesses to have defibrillators and train employees in CPR and defibrillation. The grant program prioritizes states with low cardiac arrest survival rates or response rates, or those showing a strong commitment to public access defibrillation. Funds can be used to purchase FDA-approved automated external defibrillators. The grant program prioritizes states with low cardiac arrest survival rates or response rates, or those showing a strong commitment to public access defibrillation. Funds can be used to purchase FDA-approved automated external defibrillators and provide training, information to the community, and support for placement in public places. Additional activities may be carried out as determined by the Secretary. To be eligible for a grant under the program, entities must submit an application outlining their public access defibrillation program, including training courses and accessibility plans for cardiac arrest victims in the community. The program requires training in CPR and AED use, involvement of medical professionals, coordination with EMS, maintenance of AEDs, and notification procedures for incidents. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 to fund the public access defibrillation program. Up to 10% of the grant amount can be used for administrative expenses. Data collection on program effectiveness in improving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rates is required. SEC. 313. PUBLIC ACCESS DEFIBRILLATION DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. The Secretary awards grants for public access defibrillation projects to provide CPR and defibrillation in unique settings, train community members, and increase access to defibrillators. Grant funds must be used to purchase FDA-approved defibrillators. The Secretary awards grants for public access defibrillation projects to provide CPR and defibrillation in unique settings, train community members, and increase access to defibrillators. Grant recipients must meet specific requirements such as providing AED training, informing the community about the project, and collaborating with local EMS systems. Additional activities may be carried out as deemed necessary by the Secretary. Eligible entities include political subdivisions of states, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations. Entities eligible for grants must submit an application to the Secretary detailing their innovative public access defibrillation project, including data collection on its effectiveness. The grant funds emergency CPR and defibrillation for cardiac arrest victims to improve survival rates. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2007, with a limit of 10% for administrative expenses. \"Grant funds for emergency CPR and defibrillation to improve survival rates are authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2007, with a limit of 10% for administrative expenses.\" The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award a grant to a health care organization to establish a national information clearinghouse for increasing public access to defibrillation in schools. The organization will promote defibrillation access by providing information, program materials, support for CPR and AED training programs, and fostering partnerships with public and private organizations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award a grant to a health care organization to establish a national information clearinghouse for increasing public access to defibrillation in schools. This includes working with various organizations to promote defibrillation access, establishing a database for sudden cardiac arrest in children, and providing assistance for communities to develop screening programs for at-risk youth. Health care organizations must submit an application to the Secretary to be considered for the grant. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award a grant to a health care organization to establish a national information clearinghouse for increasing public access to defibrillation in schools. The organization must submit a report to the Secretary within 5 years of receiving the grant, detailing activities carried out with the funds. An evaluation will be conducted by the Secretary within 3 months of receiving the report to assess the success of the clearinghouse. $800,000 may be appropriated from funds authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 for these programs. Funds may be appropriated for programs described in this section for fiscal years 2002 through 2006."
