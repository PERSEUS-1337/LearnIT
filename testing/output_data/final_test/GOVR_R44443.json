    "content": "High-frequency trading (HFT) involves supercomputers executing trades in microseconds or milliseconds with low latency. It differs from traditional pit trading and slower electronic trading. HFT is a term for ultra-fast electronic trading with short positions, lacking a universal legal definition. High frequency trading (HFT) is a form of automated trading that uses algorithms for decision making and low-latency technology to minimize response times. It now represents 55% of trading volume in U.S. equity markets and 40% in European markets. In futures markets, HFT has also seen significant growth. The CFTC found that algorithmic trading systems (ATS) are prevalent in various futures markets, with ATS accounting for a high percentage of trading volume. High-frequency traders aim to make small profits per trade, with some strategies reportedly earning profits almost all the time. These traders use a variety of strategies that can be combined for trading. The CFTC oversees high-frequency trading (HFT) and other types of trading in the derivatives markets it regulates, including futures, swaps, and options on commodities. HFT strategies can be passive, involving limit orders, or aggressive, involving immediately executable trades like market orders. The SEC also oversees HFT and other trading activities. The SEC regulates high-frequency trading (HFT) and other trading activities in the securities markets. Most trading today is done through automated electronic systems, leading to shrinking profits for HFT due to increased competition. The SEC regulates high-frequency trading (HFT) in the securities markets, leading to shrinking profits for HFT. More attention has been given to HFT in equity markets than in futures markets. Some HFT strategies, like order anticipation and momentum ignition, raise concerns for market structure integrity. These strategies may share similarities with illegal practices like front-running and spoofing. The SEC regulates high-frequency trading (HFT) in securities markets, leading to shrinking profits for HFT. Some HFT strategies raise concerns for market structure integrity and may share similarities with illegal practices like spoofing. The 2014 SEC staff literature research survey on HFT provides insights into the pros and cons of HFT strategies, but there are limitations due to outdated data. Passive market making in HFT involves providing liquidity by matching buyer and seller orders or trading through its own securities inventories. Market makers profit from the bid-ask spread and may receive liquidity rebates from ECNs. High-frequency traders benefit from subsidies for limit orders, especially in volatile markets. SEC analysis shows that passive HFT strategies improve market quality by reducing bid-ask spreads and price volatility. HFTs are typically better informed due to their speed in processing market data, giving them an advantage over non-HFT traders. Arbitrage trading profits from price differentials between securities, such as ETFs and underlying stocks on different exchanges. High-frequency traders, better informed due to their speed, benefit from subsidies for limit orders and improve market quality by reducing bid-ask spreads and price volatility. Adverse selection occurs when less-informed traders buy high and sell low, while better-informed traders buy low and sell high, earning profits. The entry of high-frequency traders engaging in market making decreased adverse selection, contrary to aggressive HFT strategies. High-frequency trading (HFT) firms engage in various strategies, including slow market arbitrage and momentum ignition. Slow market arbitrage involves exploiting small price differences for stocks between different exchanges, while momentum ignition aims to cause rapid price movements in securities. The extent and effects of HFT arbitrage strategies remain unclear, as indicated by a SEC staff survey. High-frequency traders engage in strategies like spoofing to manipulate algorithms and trigger aggressive buying or selling. The line between spoofing and momentum ignition is nuanced, with spoofing being illegal under the Dodd Frank Act. While federal securities laws do not explicitly outlaw spoofing, the SEC considers it a manipulative practice violating antifraud and anti-manipulation rules. Order anticipation, also known as liquidity detection trading, involves high-frequency traders using computer algorithms to identify large institutional orders in dark pools or other trading venues. This practice provides valuable intelligence on hidden large investor liquidity, allowing the trader to potentially trade ahead of the large order to benefit their firm. The line between this strategy and front-running, which is not permitted, can be nuanced. The SEC distinguishes between legal order anticipation strategies and illegal front-running, where a firm or person trades ahead of a large order to benefit from price movements, violating a duty to the buyer or seller. The SEC emphasizes that order anticipation strategies should not involve misconduct or violation of duties, such as using pattern recognition software or pinging market centers to identify large buyers or sellers. The SEC distinguishes between legal order anticipation strategies and illegal front-running. They emphasize that order anticipation strategies should not involve misconduct or violation of duties. The SEC expressed a desire to examine the effects of high-frequency order anticipation strategies further, characterizing momentum ignition and price anticipation as having both positive and negative aspects in the HFT literature survey. The SEC expressed concerns about aggressive high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies, noting their impact on price discovery and market trading transaction costs for institutional investors. Studies found that aggressive HFT can increase adverse selection costs for non-HFT passive traders and contribute to extremely volatile market conditions. The SEC flagged worries about order anticipators being labeled as \"parasitic traders\" who profit by preying on others without making prices more informative. The SEC expressed concerns about aggressive high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies impacting price discovery and market trading costs for institutional investors. Regulators are worried about order anticipation strategies detracting from market quality and harming large traders. There are also concerns about certain aggressive HFT strategies contributing to market fragility and volatility, as seen in past market crashes. CFTC Chair Timothy Massad analyzed the frequency of \"flash\" events in Treasury markets following the October 14, 2015 Treasury market meltdown. CFTC staff analyzed the frequency of \"flash\" events in Treasury futures and other active futures contracts like corn, gold, WTI crude oil, E-mini S&P futures, and EuroFX. They found that similar events were not uncommon, with corn averaging more than five per year. There were over 35 flash events in 2015 alone for WTI crude oil futures. Massad did not identify a specific cause for the increased frequency of these events. Regulators are concerned about the increased frequency of \"flash\" events in various futures contracts, with some linking it to algorithmic trading. The Dodd Frank Act now prohibits disruptive trading practices like spoofing in commodity markets. This is the first U.S. provision to specifically ban spoofing. The Dodd Frank Act prohibits disruptive trading practices like spoofing in commodity markets. High-speed trading with automated algorithms makes it challenging to detect spoofing. The CFTC clarified that intent to cancel bids before execution is necessary to prove spoofing. The agency does not need to prove intent to move the market for activities to be considered spoofing. The CFTC has used its anti-spoofing authority in recent enforcement actions. Michael Coscia, owner of Panther Energy Trading, was convicted of spoofing and commodity fraud in 2015. The DOJ charged him in 2014 for algorithmic trading strategies flagged by the CFTC. Coscia and Panther Energy were fined $2.8 million in 2013 and faced a trading ban for actions in 2011. The CFTC found that Panther placed orders to cancel them on futures contracts in various commodities. In April 2015, the CFTC accused U.K.-based trader Navinder Singh Sarao of unlawfully manipulating and spoofing the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract, contributing to the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010. In October 2015, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against Chicago-based firm 3Red Trading for spoofing and employing manipulative tactics in trading futures. The CFTC now includes HFT under \"automated trading\" and released a proposed rule on Regulation Automated Trading on November 24, 2015. The CFTC released a proposed rule, Regulation Automated Trading (Reg AT), on November 24, 2015, to govern certain HFT practices without using the term HFT. The regulation also mentions algorithmic trading systems (ATS), which are computerized systems based on automated rules for trading. Automated trading is prevalent on futures exchanges, with the CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) being the largest operators in the United States. The purpose of Reg AT is to update trading rules in response to the shift from pit trading to electronic trading. The CFTC's proposed rule, Regulation Automated Trading (Reg AT), aims to regulate automated trading to minimize disruptions and operational issues. It mandates risk controls for exchanges, clearing members, and firms heavily trading on exchanges. The rule also proposes registration of proprietary traders engaging in algorithmic trading on regulated exchanges through direct electronic access. The goal of Reg AT is to enhance CFTC oversight of automated trading. Reg AT aims to enhance CFTC oversight of automated trading activities in response to concerns about market volatility and fragility. The CFTC has implemented rules to prohibit manipulative devices and price manipulation in automated trading. The CFTC has implemented rules to address concerns about market volatility and fragility in automated trading, focusing on risks such as operational, market liquidity, market shocks, and unlawful conduct like spoofing. Some research suggests that high-frequency trading (HFT) and automated trading can improve market efficiency by reducing bid-ask spreads and trading costs. The SEC has taken steps towards requiring certain HFT broker-dealers to register with FINRA for oversight. The SEC has proposed limiting an exemption that allowed high-frequency traders to avoid FINRA registration, aiming to enhance regulatory oversight of active proprietary trading firms. The SEC proposed regulatory changes to enhance oversight of high frequency traders, with Commissioner Aguilar stating that the proposals will hold them accountable for misconduct. Recent enforcement actions were taken against firms like Barclays and Credit Suisse for misleading investors in their dark pools, resulting in settlements and fines. Credit Suisse settled charges with the SEC and NYAG for $84.3 million for misrepresenting its HFT dark pools. Athena Capital Research LLC settled for $1 million for manipulating stock prices in 2009. During a six-month period, Briargate Trading LLP used an algorithm named Gravy to manipulate closing prices of Nasdaq-listed stocks by engaging in marking the close. In October 2015, the SEC settled with Briargate and co-founder Eric Oscher for $1 million for orchestrating a scheme involving spoof orders to manipulate NYSE stock prices. Briargate placed sham trades to create false interest in stocks, followed by bona fide orders on the opposite side to take advantage of artificially inflated or depressed prices. The 114th Congress has introduced legislation potentially impacting high-frequency trading (HFT) practices and regulation. Bills like S. 1371, S. 1373, and H.R. 1464 propose a tax on various financial transactions involving securities and derivatives, with different tax rates based on the type of security. The 114th Congress has introduced legislation proposing taxes on financial transactions involving securities and derivatives, with different rates based on the type of security. There is uncertainty if these proposals would affect certain HFT strategies like spoofing, where no ownership transfer occurs. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to impose taxes on financial trades, including those conducted by high-frequency traders. Additionally, a bill aimed to regulate HFT practices by requiring registration, reporting, and adherence to business conduct requirements overseen by the CFTC. The bill also granted the CFTC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of HFT regulations. In the 114th Congress, committee hearings discussed concerns about increased market speed and potential fragility due to automated trading. Senators urged for the implementation of pilot programs, including a consolidated audit trail, to improve surveillance of trading activities. The SEC is considering implementing a consolidated audit trail to enhance surveillance of trading activities, as well as potentially eliminating rebates for brokers. They are also looking into improving transparency in how brokers route institutional customers' orders and strengthening recordkeeping requirements for algorithmic trading. Additionally, the SEC is exploring ways to address aggressive trading strategies that could worsen price volatility. The SEC is considering implementing a consolidated audit trail to enhance surveillance of trading activities and potentially eliminating rebates for brokers. They are also looking into improving transparency in how brokers route institutional customers' orders and strengthening recordkeeping requirements for algorithmic trading. Additionally, the SEC is exploring ways to address destabilizing trading strategies that could exacerbate price volatility, including subjecting certain active proprietary traders to rules surrounding broker-dealers by the SEC and self-regulatory organizations. Various hearings in the 114th Congress have touched upon issues related to high frequency trading in securities as part of oversight of the SEC and CFTC."
