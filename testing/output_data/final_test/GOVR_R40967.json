    "content": "The worldwide recession is impacting aerospace manufacturing, particularly commercial companies facing a decline in global air travel and new orders. Boeing projects a long-term need for 29,000 new planes worth $3.2 trillion by 2028. The defense segment is currently offsetting the downturn, but analysts foresee challenges ahead for military aircraft producers. The international aerospace market is evolving rapidly. The aerospace manufacturing industry is evolving rapidly, with concerns about the impact of competitors from countries like China and Russia on U.S. manufacturers. In 2008, aerospace manufacturing supported over 500,000 high-skilled jobs with an average wage of $79,700, significantly higher than the average manufacturing wage. Many jobs in this sector require a bachelor's degree in engineering. Collective bargaining agreements with major aerospace unions play a role in the industry. In 2006, 21% of aerospace workers were union members or covered by union contracts, compared to 13% of all private industry workers. Major firms in the U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry include Boeing, United Technologies, Northrop Grumman, Gulfstream Aerospace, and Textron. Aerospace manufacturing centers are located in Washington state, California, Texas, Kansas, Connecticut, and Arizona, with a combined workforce of over 305,000 in 2008. Other states like South Carolina are also expanding their aircraft manufacturing production base. Boeing announced plans to open a new production line in North Charleston, South Carolina for its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The facility is expected to create over 3,800 jobs within seven years, significantly boosting the state's aerospace manufacturing industry. The impact of the economic downturn on aerospace manufacturing is not reflected in the 2008 data used in the report. The aerospace industry is cyclical and highly susceptible to changing international situations and market forces. Factors like economic activity, regional conflicts, terrorism, and disease outbreaks can influence demand for air travel. Evidence suggests a weakening aircraft market, which may reverse the strong market upturn. The aerospace manufacturing industry, which had been experiencing a strong market upturn since 2003, is now facing a weakening aircraft market. AIA reported an increase in industry-wide estimated sales in 2008, with commercial aircraft and parts shipments totaling $96.6 billion. This accounted for 63% of total industry shipments, down 4% from 2007. In 2008, new orders for civil aircraft and parts dropped by 33% from $184.5 billion to $124.1 billion. Defense aircraft and parts shipments increased by 40% to $55.8 billion, accounting for 37% of total industry shipments. Defense segment relies on U.S. government for sales, with agencies like DOD and NASA being major customers. The aerospace industry relies on government contracts to support commercial sector during economic downturns. Major suppliers include General Electric, United Technologies, Vought Aircraft Industries, Spirit AeroSystems, and Crane Corporation. The U.S. large commercial jet manufacturing industry has been prominent for many decades. The U.S. large commercial jet manufacturing industry has evolved into a duopoly of Airbus and Boeing, with parts of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner outsourced globally. A dispute before the WTO alleges that the EU provided illegal subsidies to Airbus, giving them an unfair advantage in the market. The EU counterclaims that Boeing received billions in subsidies through U.S. military programs and tax breaks, giving Airbus an unfair advantage in the commercial aircraft market. Boeing heavily relies on international sales, with 70% of its commercial airplane sales outside the U.S. Aerospace exports by U.S. manufacturers increased from $53 billion in 2003 to $97.4 billion in 2007, with a slight decrease in 2008. Top export markets include Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. In 2008, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany were the top five export markets for U.S. aerospace products, accounting for 36.2% of total aerospace exports worldwide. The U.S. also increased exports to emerging markets like Brazil and China, with exports to China more than doubling from $2.7 billion to $5.5 billion between 2003 and 2008. Aerospace imports to the U.S. were mainly from France, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, totaling $27.9 billion in 2008. U.S. aerospace exports helped reduce the trade deficit, with a trade balance of over $57 billion in 2008. In 2008, Boeing and Airbus faced a recession with a backlog of undelivered aircraft. Despite delivering new aircraft and being profitable, both saw a decrease in net orders. Airbus and Boeing received fewer new orders in 2009 compared to 2008, leading to expectations of reduced aircraft production rates. The global airline industry is facing a surplus of aircraft, leading to expectations of reduced production rates. The economic crisis in Dubai could also impact sales for Boeing and Airbus, who rely on the Middle Eastern market for orders. Boeing and Airbus have substantial backlogs of orders dating back to 2003, with Boeing working on a seven-year backlog and Airbus on a six-year backlog. Both manufacturers have slowed production lines for 2009, with analysts expecting this trend to continue into 2010 or 2011. Boeing projects a 3.2% annual fleet growth and 5.4% cargo growth from 2009 to 2028. The long-term outlook for aircraft manufacturers is positive, with the global market expected to absorb 29,000 new airplanes by 2028. However, both Boeing and Airbus face challenges in the near and medium term, such as Boeing's delayed 787 program. The Boeing 787 program is over two years behind schedule due to issues with advanced composite technology and outsourcing. Boeing has a backlog of 840 planes valued at $140 billion, impacting profitability. Airbus faced similar delays with the A380 program. Airbus is developing the A350 XWB to compete with Boeing's 787 and 777. The A350 XWB has over 500 orders but deliveries are expected to start in 2013. The regional jet market is currently in a downturn, with Bombardier and Embraer dominating the market. The regional jet market is currently dominated by Embraer and Bombardier, with deliveries slowing down. Despite a drop in new orders, RJs are still an important market for the U.S. aerospace manufacturing sector. Forecast International projects a total of 3,754 regional aircraft to be produced between 2009 and 2018 at an estimated cost of $115 billion. Bombardier projects deliveries of 12,400 aircraft in the 20- to 149-seat segment over the next 20 years. Forecast International also points to increased potential competition from new entrants into the regional jet market: COMAC, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Sukhoi. The general aviation sector covers all aircraft not for military use or scheduled flights, including a wide variety of aircraft types from single engine piston aircraft to corporate jets. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) reported a booming market in 2008, with deliveries of business jets exceeding 1,000 for the first time. However, the recession in 2008 led to a significant decline in orders for new GA aircraft and business jets, with U.S. production off by almost 46.8% in the first nine months of 2009. Industry analysts project a further decline in orders for 2009. Overall, worldwide shipments of general aviation aircraft fell 7.1% in 2008 to 3,969. Kansas, known as the \"Air Capital of the World,\" is directly affected by the downturn in the general aviation market. Hawker Beechcraft and Cessna Aircraft have already reduced production and shed jobs, with layoffs announced and factories closing. Cessna Aircraft, the largest US corporate jet manufacturer, plans to lay off 4,600 employees in 2009, with 4,000 job cuts in Wichita. Concerns include competition from low-cost rivals in China and Russia. Non-US firms dominate the RJ and GA markets, while Boeing and Airbus control the commercial jet sector. Attempts by aerospace firms from other nations to enter the market have mostly failed, but new initiatives are emerging. New initiatives in the aerospace industry are emerging, with Russia and China now aiming to dominate their domestic markets and potentially the global market. China's COMAC is developing the C919 aircraft to compete with Boeing and Airbus in the same market as the A320 and B737 series. China's COMAC is developing the C919 aircraft to compete with Boeing and Airbus, aiming for lower operating costs. Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) also plans to become a major aircraft manufacturer. Both countries face challenges in building reliable, cost-effective commercial airplanes and obtaining certification from U.S. and EU aviation authorities. Congress has been discussing issues affecting the aerospace industry for years. The Presidential Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended a national aerospace policy and the removal of barriers hindering industry growth. Policies were proposed to maintain U.S. global aerospace leadership through investments in industrial base, workforce, and research infrastructure. Export licensing laws can impact customer's ability to acquire aerospace products from the U.S. The aerospace industry faces challenges with export control requirements, particularly for smaller companies. Overseas competitors are developing products without U.S. components in response. Environmental concerns, such as reducing carbon emissions, are also impacting the industry globally. The aerospace industry is facing challenges with greenhouse gas emissions regulations, particularly the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for aviation. There is a workforce challenge in the industry, with a shortage of qualified workers and students pursuing science and engineering careers. Despite a decline in engineering bachelor's degrees between 1986 and 2006, recent data shows an increase in degrees conferred since 2000. The current aerospace industry workforce is aging. The aerospace industry workforce is aging, with retirements projected in the coming years. The average age of aerospace professionals is 45, with engineers averaging 43 years old. Boeing reports the average age of aerospace engineers at 54 years. Concerns arise as 26% of aerospace professionals are eligible to retire, leading to a potential \"silver tsunami\" of skilled workforce reduction. Aerospace companies are struggling to replenish their workforce with younger engineers due to significant competition for a limited pool of talent. The aerospace industry is facing challenges in replenishing its workforce with younger engineers due to competition from other industries and countries."
