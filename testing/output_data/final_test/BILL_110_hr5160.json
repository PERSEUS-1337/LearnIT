SEC. 7. AUTOMATIC DEFERRAL IRAS. This section allows employers to make nonelective contributions of up to 10 percent of compensation for eligible employees with at least $5,000 of compensation for the year. An automatic deferral IRA is treated like an individual retirement plan and can be considered a Roth IRA if it meets certain requirements. It involves contributions made under specific arrangements, with employees being treated as having elected to have the employer make payments. Employees can elect to have their employer make payments to an automatic deferral IRA on their behalf, instead of receiving cash directly. Eligibility is based on certain criteria, with a substitution of '$5,000' for '$450' for determining employee eligibility. An election out option is available. Employees can elect to have their employer make payments to an automatic deferral IRA on their behalf. An election out option is available for employees who do not want elective contributions made or who choose to make contributions at a specified level within 30 days of the first contribution. The term 'qualified percentage' is determined under the trust agreement for each employee. Employees are informed of their rights and obligations under the arrangement through a written notice before they become eligible to participate. The notice must be accurate, comprehensive, and easily understood by the average employee. The qualified percentage, determined under the trust agreement, ranges from 3 to 10 percent. The notice for employees must explain their right to elect contributions, how contributions will be invested without an election, and provide a reasonable period for decision-making. Employees must be provided with a notice explaining their right to elect contributions and the default investment arrangement if no election is made. The default investment arrangement involves investing the employee's interest in the trust as per regulations and providing notice to each employee with an interest in the trust. Employees must be provided with a notice explaining their right to elect contributions and the default investment arrangement if no election is made. The employer must make elective contributions within 30 days after the end of the month. Employees can terminate participation at any time during the year and may resume participation at the beginning of the next year. Eligible employees can elect to participate 30 days before the start of the program. Employees have the right to elect contributions and the default investment arrangement. State laws conflicting with employer's ability to create automatic deferral IRAs are preempted. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code allow for automatic deferral IRAs starting in 2008. Additionally, small employer pension plan startup cost credit is expanded. Amendments to the Internal Revenue Code expand small employer pension plan startup cost credit by including startup costs for employer-established IRAs and providing an additional credit amount based on qualified startup costs and the number of employees participating in eligible employer plans. The amendment expands the small employer pension plan startup cost credit to include costs for employer-established IRAs and adjusts the definition of eligible employer plan. The effective date for this change is for costs incurred in taxable years after the enactment of the Act. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to clarify that an individual retirement plan established through a payroll deduction program is not considered a pension plan. This amendment takes effect upon the enactment of the Act."
