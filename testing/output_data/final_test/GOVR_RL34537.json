    "content": "The purpose of the original pre-disaster hazard mitigation pilot program, Project Impact, and its successor, the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, is to implement hazard reduction measures before a disaster occurs. Eligible projects include retrofitting public buildings against hurricane-force winds, acquiring properties out of flood plains, elevating structures in flood plains, flood-proofing buildings, managing vegetation for wildfires, and creating \"safe rooms\" in tornado-prone areas. There is debate on the balance between preparing for the next disaster and responding to it. The debate centers on the distinction between structural and non-structural mitigation measures. Structural projects involve building levees to protect communities, while non-structural projects focus on land use patterns and removing structures from flood plains. FEMA's Project Impact, established in FY1997, aimed to fund mitigation activities before disasters occur. Project Impact, initiated by FEMA in FY1997, focused on community-based efforts to mitigate natural hazards. The program selected communities based on their disaster experience, ongoing risk, and collaboration among officials. Emphasis was placed on community involvement and awareness, with local governments, NGOs, and businesses committing to mitigation activities. Elite attitudes towards disaster mitigation policies showed low priority for natural hazards in local communities. The low priority given to natural hazards in local communities and at the state level is highlighted. Nonstructural mitigation measures are unpopular compared to structural solutions. Some are questioning structural mitigation as a solution, pointing out that it may encourage people to move into hazardous areas. The emphasis on nonstructural or land use approaches reflects concerns that previous policies may have increased rather than decreased the population at risk. The concept of disaster mitigation had been discussed for decades, but without serious damage in the 1980s, it was difficult to advance. However, in the early 1990s, attitudes changed due to massive losses from major disasters. The relative calm of the Reagan years was followed by disasters of great scale, making mitigation more sensible to more people. The disasters of Hurricane Hugo (1989), Loma Prieta earthquake (1989), Hurricane Andrew (1992), Midwest floods (1993), Northridge earthquake (1994), and Hurricanes Fran and Floyd (1996, 1999) led to a push for proactive disaster mitigation. The lack of organized research on pre-disaster mitigation prompted cautious funding by Congress until the benefits were proven. Recent catastrophic events have shown mixed results in mitigation efforts, but have generated significant HMGP funds influencing Congress' considerations. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy both generated significant HMGP funds, impacting Congress' considerations for PDM funding. Mitigation efforts in Louisiana for Katrina faced delays due to disputes with FEMA over fund usage. In contrast, Sandy's mitigation efforts have been slow but without disputes. FEMA allocated over $3 billion to New York in 2014, with only $15.7 million from HMGP. This indicates a need for improvement in accelerating the administration of mitigation programs. The PDM program aims to accelerate mitigation efforts, funded through a pilot program since 1997. FEMA recognizes the importance of pre-disaster mitigation in saving costs and supports active participation in such programs. These activities range from developing mitigation plans for communities to collaborating with industries. The PDM program, funded since 1997, aims to accelerate mitigation efforts by collaborating with various stakeholders. An initial $2,000,000 is allocated for developing pre-disaster mitigation programs, with subsequent appropriations totaling $30 million for 1998 and $25 million per year for the following three years. The funds will be used after submitting a pre-disaster mitigation spending plan to the Committees on Appropriations. The PDM program, funded since 1997, received initial funding of $2 million for pre-disaster mitigation programs, followed by $30 million for 1998 and $25 million annually for the next three years. Congress authorized the program from 2000 to 2003 in the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, placing it under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Project Impact, the first PDM program, aimed to make communities disaster-resistant and was considered a success despite its modest initial funding. FEMA's Project Impact aimed to make communities disaster-resistant and was considered successful. Some suggested that funding criteria should prioritize areas with the greatest risk for mitigation measures. Despite its success, Project Impact was eliminated from the FY2002 budget, but later rebranded as the Pre-Disaster program. In 2002, FEMA rebranded Project Impact as the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, increasing funding to $150 million for FY2003 and FY2004. Congress mandated that PDM funds be awarded competitively, leading FEMA to establish a competitive grant program. The Bush Administration proposed consolidating all mitigation funds into the PDM program, reducing post-disaster funding from 15% to 7.5% of total disaster costs. Congress aimed to shift resources towards pre-disaster mitigation, leading to changes in the Stafford Act. The PDM program funding levels have varied over time, with a proposal to reduce post-disaster funding to 7.5% and increase funding for pre-disaster mitigation. However, funding levels for PDM are now falling again, despite efforts by Congress to increase funding in previous legislation. The PDM program allows Governors to nominate communities for pre-disaster mitigation assistance, with FEMA making final selections. Funding for PDM increased significantly in FY2003, reflecting a shift towards general mitigation efforts. This change in approach aimed to address mitigation in disaster-prone areas at the most appropriate time. The Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) under the Stafford Act provides post-disaster funding to states for mitigating future disaster damage. There is debate on whether pre-disaster mitigation would be more effective, as funds are only available after a disaster. Some argue that communities with recent disaster experience are more likely to take action to reduce future risks. Community support is crucial for implementing mitigation measures. Mitigation measures are most effective with broad community support. After Hurricane Katrina, Congress increased funding for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program based on studies showing cost savings in disaster relief spending. The findings of studies show that FEMA mitigation grants are highly cost-effective, with benefits reaching beyond direct disaster costs to include indirect savings at the local level and within the business sector. The studies consider damages like business interruption and environmental costs, providing independent evidence to support the effectiveness of mitigation measures. The MHMC study in 2005 highlighted savings from mitigation efforts, providing a foundation for future actions. In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office also recognized the cost savings of pre-disaster mitigation, noting benefits to FEMA programs. In FY2007, Congress increased PDM funding to $100 million, which was raised to $114 million in FY2008 and then reduced to $90 million in FY2009. The state minimum for eligible projects was set at $500,000, which was later raised to $575,000 or 1% of the amount appropriated for PDM with the passage of P.L. 111-351. This made PDM a competitive and formula-driven program, retaining interest in mitigation for states. The state minimum in the PDM program retains interest in mitigation for states. The formula change created a hybrid program with competitive grants and guaranteed formula amounts. Earmarks and state minimums accounted for a significant portion of the funding, reducing the available amount for open competitive grants. Amendments were made in reaction to the trend of directed funding. In response to directed funding trends, amendments were made to curtail earmarks in the FY2010 appropriations bill. The provision eliminating congressionally directed spending was added to P.L. 111-351. Congress also established limits on grant sizes and total amounts to states in the Stafford Act. The maximum PDM award for a state is $17 million, with federal share caps of $1 million for plans and $3 million for projects. The Bush Administration requested $75 million for FY2009, but Congress funded the program at $90 million. The budget justification did not explain the $39 million reduction from FY2008. FEMA noted that the carryover amount from FY2007 to FY2008 may have led to the conclusion that additional funding was not needed. PDM funds have a significant state and local participation, causing a lag time in fund expenditure. Funds carried over are dedicated to selected projects awaiting final clearance. The proportionality of planning grants vs. project grants reflects funding availability, with funding levels affecting project selection. Funding for the PDM program during the Obama Administration fluctuated, with requests ranging from $150 million to $100 million. Having an updated mitigation plan in place before a disaster event is crucial for effective recovery and allows for consideration of mitigation projects. The FY2011 request for the PDM program dropped to $100 million, with subsequent years (FY2012-FY2015) requesting no funds. Explanations included existing fund balance and overlap with other mitigation programs like HMGP and FMA. HMGP can only be used after a disaster, while FMA is for NFIP-insured structures. These programs may overlap with PDM but have distinct structures and intents. The PDM program saw a large number of grant awards, with 149 grants awarded for FY2008 and 443 applications received for FY2009. Planning grants accounted for 79 percent of the awarded grants in FY2008, distributed to many more communities. Despite changes like earmarks and reduced funding, the number of awards remained relatively consistent, with 131 grants awarded for FY2013. In FY2009, 149 grants were awarded, and in FY2013, 131 grants were given for various hazards. The Government Accountability Office found that flooding was the primary hazard for over half of the projects, with hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes also being addressed. Some projects funded in FY2008 aimed at traditional PDM activities like property acquisition and wildfire mitigation, while others were earmarked for ineligible purposes. The PDM program guidance materials list ineligible projects such as equipment, fire suppression activities, dams, and emergency alert systems. The program has historically focused on preparedness vs. mitigation, with recent attention on the lack of wildfire mitigation grants. Only 0.5% of FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance projects are for wildfires, despite a new policy in 2008 expanding eligible activities for wildfire projects. The PDM program is being updated to align with changes in HMA programs. Over 50% of wildfire projects funded are from California and Colorado. Congress is discussing grant award pace, funding methods, priority uses for funds, program resources, authorization length, and mitigation direction. New initiatives from 2010 budget suggest new directions for PDM program funding criteria. The PDM program funding criteria focus on hazard nature, state/local government commitment, and cost-effective mitigation activities. FEMA lists ineligible activities and aims to provide clarity for applicants. Peer review panels help derive suggested changes. Due to limited funding, peer review panels have not been consistently assembled in recent years. In recent years, FEMA has not consistently assembled peer review panels for the PDM program, limiting program management insights. The ineligible activities list for FY2008 included 8 items for PDM planning and 23 for PDM project grants, with a focus on compliance with environmental and historic preservation. FEMA released unified guidance for all mitigation programs, including PDM, in 2010 and updated it in 2013. Some observers argue that FEMA's interpretation of eligible PDM projects has become overly restrictive, especially regarding equipment purchases for addressing different hazards. They believe that warning systems and generators should be eligible expenses under the PDM program. The PDM program guidance outlines ineligible project activities, including maintenance costs for structures, purchasing generators for non-mitigation projects, and projects with available funding from other sources. Some communities want to use PDM funds for warning systems like sirens, which FEMA considers eligible for disaster preparedness grants. FEMA considers alert notification systems eligible for disaster preparedness grants but not under the PDM program. Stand-alone generators are generally not eligible unless they power a mitigation effort, such as hurricane storm shutters or critical public facilities. Some congressionally earmarked projects for PDM in FY2008 included activities deemed ineligible by FEMA, like fire suppression and emergency alert systems. In FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010, the PDM program received earmarks for mitigation projects. Congress may disagree with FEMA's guidance on project eligibility. FEMA has worked with communities to find eligible projects when directed projects were ineligible. Earmarks for mitigation projects were also seen in the FY1999 Appropriations bill but are no longer part of the program due to congressional actions. The PDM program no longer includes earmarks due to congressional actions. Funding distribution has been broad but not always rapid, with some delays attributed to previous fund carryovers. The pace of the program is affected by the complexity of mitigation projects, requiring local consensus and resources. The PDM program's slow distribution of funds can be attributed to factors such as the availability of funds until expended, the need for local consensus and resources, and the lengthening process due to congressionally directed funding. This has led to delays in award distribution and justification of expenditures by recipient communities. The PDM program's slow fund distribution is due to factors like fund availability, local consensus, and congressionally directed funding, leading to delays in award distribution and expenditure justification by recipient communities. FEMA allocates unexpended funds for ongoing expenses, administrative costs, technical assistance, management costs, and reconsideration of projects. FEMA's recent chart outlines the broad uses of unallocated program dollars. FEMA has issued a chart outlining the uses of unallocated program funds, including ongoing expenses, administrative costs, and project reconsideration. Issues arise when reserved funds and other costs are not clearly identified in program lists, affecting how funding awards and spending are reported to Congress. DHS/FEMA requested legislative authority in the FY2015 budget to award remaining grant funds, including those from previous congressional directives. The FEMA Administrator may award grant funds from the National Pre-disaster Mitigation Fund at his discretion. Funding not used by intended applicants or not applied for within two years may be reallocated. Some question if these funds should be used for mitigating terrorist events. Some PDM advocates question the allocation of funding for mitigation of terrorist events, noting disparities in funding amounts between mitigation and preparedness programs. While PDM program funding exceeded $100 million, preparedness efforts for all-hazards, including terrorism, received billions in DHS/FEMA grants. FEMA's grant programs allow for the purchase of equipment not eligible under the PDM program. The PDM program focuses on mitigating natural disaster hazards, with funding restricted to projects related to protecting public buildings or private residences. Projects are typically large-scale and costly, such as relocating neighborhoods or building safe rooms. Funding for all-hazard preparedness, including terrorism, is separate from PDM grants. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA2K) emphasized the importance of hazard mitigation planning, requiring local mitigation plans for FEMA grants. States using PDM funds to develop enhanced plans can receive higher levels of HMGP funding. Mitigation plans are essential for FEMA grants and must be updated every five years. Local mitigation plans must be updated every five years to remain eligible for FEMA hazard mitigation project grant funding. Planning grants are a significant part of the PDM program, with a high percentage of grants focused on planning efforts in recent years. States prioritize updating their own plans to ensure continued eligibility for funding. In the use of PDM funds, states prioritize updating their plans to remain eligible for FEMA hazard mitigation project grant funding. Planning grants receive relatively low funding compared to project grants, with project grants being more expensive due to their large undertakings like property acquisitions. The remaining $20 million for FY2007 awards includes administrative costs, technical assistance, state management costs, and funds for reconsideration. Planning grants have had a significant impact on communities' readiness for mitigation strategies due to their high percentage of selected applications. Planning grants are prioritized due to the requirement for plan updates every five years and their practicality for local governments with limited funding. The DMA 2000 had a significant impact on communities' readiness for mitigation strategies by providing financial incentives and requiring plans to be updated every five years. By July 2008, over 17,000 jurisdictions had mitigation plans in place. The funding available for PDM grants was much lower than the amounts requested, indicating a high demand for the program. In FY2006 and FY2007, the funding requested was nearly triple the amounts available, showing the program's importance in building local hazard mitigation capacity. In FY2012, FEMA had requests for over $270 million in federal mitigation funding despite an appropriation of just over $35 million. Recent budget proposals may have reduced interest in the program and raised questions about its availability for local communities. The PDM program has been reauthorized multiple times through different pieces of legislation. The PDM program has been reauthorized multiple times through various bills, with the most recent authorization expiring in FY2013. Legislation in the 113th Congress aims to reauthorize the program through FY2018 with a $200 million annual budget. Despite not being reauthorized currently, a bipartisan group of House Members supports continued funding for the program. The original sunset date of the program was intended to allow for more information on its effectiveness to be gathered. The PDM program, currently with a recurrent sunset date, may be authorized without a sunset date if questions about its efficacy are resolved. Unlike the Stafford Act, which is a free-standing authorization, the PDM program is a grant program not funded from the Disaster Relief Fund. Some argue that a three to four year reauthorization cycle provides incentives for the program. The PDM program's three to four year reauthorization cycle incentivizes program improvement and allows for Congressional oversight. Without reauthorization, FEMA lacks authority to grant extensions, hindering project completion and funding. Consistent reauthorizations may be necessary for program success. The PDM program transitioned to a competitive process with a focus on cost-benefit ratios, allowing more communities to access funding for mitigation planning. State emergency managers expressed concerns about limited access for smaller states. Congressional direction for the program is now primarily through annual appropriations law. State emergency managers are concerned that the competitive process for PDM funding limits smaller states' access. They advocate for funds to be distributed based on a base plus population formula to support state and local planning. NEMA opposes prioritizing funding at the national level, as it creates more losers than winners and hinders community engagement in mitigation efforts. Since 2007, the PDM program has required a $500,000 minimum per state for eligible projects. This minimum amount, combined with recent appropriations, limits the availability of funds for the competitive process. Congress may need to reconsider the program's structure, either returning to award selection by Governors and the President, establishing a strictly competitive grant process, or maintaining a hybrid program. The state minimum awards and Congressional earmarks have significantly reduced the funds available for competitive distribution. In response to diminishing funds for competitive distribution, the administration proposed a risk-based allocation formula in the FY2010 budget submission. This approach would allow states to prioritize projects based on FEMA's risk assessment, utilizing the HAZUS program for estimating damage from various disaster scenarios. The latest GIS technology is used by FEMA to estimate hazard-related damage before or after disasters. The reauthorization legislation introduced a competitive process into law, increasing the minimum amount per state to $575,000. The Administration's risk-based proposal to replace the competitive process was not mentioned in subsequent budget submissions. Congress faced a decision on whether to adopt the Administration's initiative or continue with the competitive approach. The House Homeland Security Appropriations Report indicated that FEMA's proposed risk-based approach for awarding PDM grants faced opposition. The agency failed to explain the benefits of the new method, leading the House Appropriations Subcommittee to reject the change. With no mention of the risk-based funding approach in subsequent budgets, the future of the competitive grant program remains uncertain due to low funding levels. In FY2014, FEMA increased PDM funding from $23 million to $63 million using carryover funds. The award application period was extended until late July 2014. FEMA will review applications based on the Agency's priorities without using outside practitioners. A proposal suggests moving the PDM program and HMGP program from FEMA to a newly created Federal Mitigation and Recovery Authority or a different Department for a different approach to mitigation administration. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, criticism arose regarding FEMA's role in long-term recovery versus emergency response programs. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 raised questions about FEMA's long-term recovery role, leading to suggestions for a separate authority with expertise in rebuilding and mitigation programs. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, criticism arose regarding FEMA's role in long-term recovery versus emergency response programs. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 raised questions about FEMA's long-term recovery role, leading to suggestions for a separate authority with expertise in rebuilding and mitigation programs. The rebuilding cycle could be partnered with mitigation programs to make communities more resilient to weather events. PDM requires planning, community-wide participation, and diverse skills from FEMA. Some experts question if the roles are complementary, but the appropriate institutional arrangements for emergency response may differ from long-term planning for mitigation and recovery. In response to Hurricane Sandy, questions arose about FEMA's role in long-term recovery. The National Disaster Recovery Framework was not the organizing principal for federal government efforts, leading to an ad hoc Recovery Strategy led by the HUD Secretary. The Disaster Resilience Competition, run by HUD, raises concerns about leadership in this area. A proposed separate authority for mitigation and long-term recovery work may be considered. The unveiling of the \"Disaster Resilience Competition\" hints at future directions for pre-disaster mitigation efforts. The President announced a competitive program in 2014 with $1 billion in funding, part of the initial $16 billion for HUD's CDBG program. $180 million is allocated for projects in Sandy-affected states, while $820 million is for other states with disasters in 2011-2013. The program aims to support resilience projects at the local level, encourage policy changes for extreme weather and climate change, and rebuild areas to be better prepared for the future. Panelists discussed the challenges of evaluating local codes and zoning in PDM grant proposals, noting the difficulty in changing codes and the opposition from developers and property owners. Chair Norton sought input from state and local officials on this issue. The debate surrounds the impact of regulations on building standards, property values, and property owners' rights. While valid concerns exist, the importance of mitigating disasters through strong local codes and zoning is emphasized, as seen in the National Flood Insurance Program. These regulations are crucial for participation in the flood insurance program. The importance of strong local regulations for mitigating disasters is emphasized, particularly in flood-prone areas. These regulations must be legally enforceable and take precedence over conflicting local laws. A dominant federal role in disaster spending may discourage responsible hazard mitigation among nonfederal interests. Shirking responsibility for hazard mitigation among states and local governments may take two forms: unwillingness to spend funds for disaster planning and avoiding regulating land use in hazard-prone areas. The PDM program is voluntary, with participating communities taking the initiative to protect citizens and property, often covering 25% of the project costs. This program has been criticized for its voluntary nature. The 113th Congress is considering legislation to link mitigation concepts with zoning, aiming to enhance existing programs by encouraging states to adopt and enforce building codes. Congress is also evaluating the PDM program within federal hazard mitigation policy, which involves varying approaches and funding for specific hazards. FEMA administers various mitigation grant programs, including the PDM program, HMGP program, and FMA program. The RFC and SRL programs were merged into FMA under Biggert-Waters 2012. These programs aim to address specific hazards and provide flexibility to state and local governments. Congressional intent is to fund similar projects and give discretion in addressing hazards. FEMA's Mitigation Directorate reported that over $827 million was awarded to 1,924 projects nationwide in 2012 through various grant programs. The HMGP program received the majority of funding from the DRF, while other programs like PDM and FMA are funded separately. Efforts have been made to ensure these programs are complementary, with guidance allowing applications to be considered by multiple programs. The 111th Congress expressed interest in a Unified Hazard Mitigation Assistance (UHMA) guidance. FEMA runs several mitigation programs, including the Repetitive Flood Claims grant program, Flood Mitigation Assistance program, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and Severe Repetitive Loss grant program. The Committee directed FEMA to report on a mitigation strategy showing how each program contributes to mitigation goals within six months of enactment of the Act. FEMA aims to unify administrative requirements of hazard mitigation assistance programs. FEMA aims to unify administrative requirements of hazard mitigation assistance programs by simplifying the application process and improving program implementation. Congressional consideration includes whether to combine programs for greater impact or maintain a mosaic approach. Funding for a combined mitigation program could come from the DRF through an annual allocation rather than separate events. A combined mitigation program could address all hazards, with potential savings accruing to both the NFIP and private insurance industry. The Biggert-Waters Act aimed to consolidate multiple mitigation programs under the NFIP into the FMA. The FMA combines multiple flood insurance mitigation programs, offering a greater federal share for severe and repetitive loss structures. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation program has grown over the last decade, with studies showing cost reductions from earlier mitigation investments. Evaluation of the PDM program varies, with FEMA staff highlighting flexibility while others criticize unspent funds and rigid program guidance hindering local government access to funding. The PDM funding program faces challenges in flexibility for local governments. Most funds are used for mitigation projects and planning, with some earmarked by Congress in FY2008 and FY2009. The PDM program faced challenges with earmarked grants that did not align with FEMA's guidance. Despite reauthorization lapsing, Congress has shown continued interest in mitigation, with recent legislation introduced to add a mitigation component to FEMA's FMAGs. Mitigation has gained traction in the past decade due to its cost-benefit advantages. Mitigation has gained traction in the past decade due to its cost-benefit advantages and the rebranding of \"resilience.\" There is debate over whether mitigation contributes to resilience or if resilience encompasses a broader concept beyond addressing natural hazards. Some argue that resilience goes beyond engineered projects to include human habits and desires, making mitigation a part of overall resilience. The National Preparedness Goal defines resilience as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and rapidly recover from disruptions. The President's recent budget (FY2015) contained an Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative, directing $400 million into the PDM program for resilience and mitigation measures. Recent budget submissions have shown varying positions on PDM, with debates over the relationship between mitigation and resilience. Resilience is defined as the ability to adapt to changing conditions and recover from disruptions. The Congress may consider federal mitigation policy in the future and the role of the PDM program, with varying positions on PDM and debates over the relationship between mitigation and resilience."
