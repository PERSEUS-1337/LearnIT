    "content": "Experts and policymakers are increasingly concerned about protecting ICT systems from cyberattacks, which are unauthorized attempts to access systems for theft, disruption, or damage. Cybersecurity is the act of protecting ICT systems and their contents, a concept that can be broad and difficult to define precisely. It involves activities and measures to protect computers, networks, hardware, software, and information from threats in cyberspace. Cybersecurity involves protecting information systems from unauthorized access, ensuring integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. It is a broad field aimed at implementing and improving activities to safeguard against cyber threats. Cybersecurity is often confused with privacy, information sharing, intelligence gathering, and surveillance in public discussions. Privacy involves controlling access to personal information, which can be protected by good cybersecurity practices. Surveillance and intelligence gathering can be both threats and tools for cybersecurity. Monitoring information flow within a system is crucial for cybersecurity. Flow within a system is crucial for cybersecurity, with risks depending on threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts. Risk management is essential for effective cybersecurity, with attackers falling into categories such as criminals, spies, nation-state warriors, hacktivists, and terrorists. Cybersecurity is an ongoing battle between attackers and defenders. Cybersecurity is an ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders, with vulnerabilities including insider threats, supply chain weaknesses, and zero-day vulnerabilities. Successful attacks can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ICT systems, leading to cybertheft or cyberespionage. Cyberattacks involve exfiltration of information for the attacker's benefit, denial-of-service attacks, botnet malware control, and industrial control system disruption. Successful attacks on critical infrastructure could have significant national security and economic impacts. Cyberattacks can be costly to individuals and organizations, with estimates of annual global economic impacts varying widely. The annual cost of cybercrime is often cited at $400 billion, with costs increasing due to the expansion of ICT infrastructure. Managing cyberattack risks involves removing threat sources, addressing vulnerabilities, and lessening impacts through mitigation and restoration efforts. Cyberespionage costs are substantial but difficult to quantify. The federal role in cybersecurity includes securing federal systems and assisting in protecting nonfederal systems. More than 50 statutes address various aspects of cybersecurity, with different sectors and organizations having varying levels of risk reduction. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops standards for federal civilian ICT under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. The federal government has various agencies responsible for overseeing cybersecurity, including the Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Justice (DOJ). Each agency has specific roles in protecting federal civilian systems, national security systems, and enforcing relevant laws. The Obama Administration established the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) under the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide integrated analysis on cybersecurity threats. Federal agencies allocate a significant portion of their IT funding to cybersecurity, with DOD spending accounting for a large proportion. The FY2017 budget request includes over $19 billion for cybersecurity, amounting to 23.3% of the total IT investment. Various bills have been introduced addressing cybersecurity issues such as cybercrime laws, data breach notification, and FISMA reform. For more information on federal cybersecurity spending, refer to CRS Report R44404. The FY2017 budget request includes significant funding for cybersecurity, with bills introduced to address cybercrime laws, data breach notification, and FISMA reform. Laws enacted in the 113th and 114th Congresses have focused on various cybersecurity issues such as critical infrastructure protection, information sharing, Internet of Things, and workforce improvements. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and DHS are tasked with developing cybersecurity frameworks for critical infrastructure protection. Legislation requires incident-response plans for cybersecurity risks, assistance to states for emergency response networks, and collaboration mechanisms for the healthcare sector to reduce cybersecurity risks. Additionally, procedures for data breach notification and FISMA reform have been established. System s P.L. 113-283 retains most provisions of FISMA with amendments, giving DHS authority over federal cybersecurity. P.L. 114-113 establishes EINSTEIN program, additional cybersecurity measures, and reporting requirements. P.L. 113-282 authorizes NCCIC for information sharing. P.L. 113-282 authorized NCCIC for information sharing and incident response among public and private-sector CI entities. P.L. 114-113 facilitates sharing of cyberthreat information and defensive measures, allows private-sector entities to operate defenses on their systems, expands NCCIC functions, establishes reporting requirements, requires an international cyberspace policy, consultations on cybercriminal measures, and broadens cybercrime penalties. P.L. 113-274 mandates a multiagency strategic plan for cybersecurity. P.L. 113-274 mandates a multiagency strategic plan for cybersecurity R&D, specifies research areas for NSF, and requires workforce assessments by DHS. P.L. 113-246 and P.L. 113-277 provide statutory authority for cybersecurity workforce programs and hiring authorities for DHS. P.L. 114-113 requires OPM to establish an employment-code structure for federal cybersecurity personnel. Comprehensive legislation on cybercrime and data-breach notification has been introduced but not enacted. Legislation on cybercrime and data-breach notification has been introduced in recent Congresses but has not been enacted. Ongoing controversies include balancing penalties and authorities with privacy and civil liberties protection. Debate also focuses on harmonizing federal and state standards for data-breach notification and determining precautions and responses required from organizations holding sensitive information. Debate on cybersecurity of the Internet of Things involves various issues across sectors and applications. Over 150 bills addressing cybersecurity issues have been introduced in the 114th Congress, with some focusing on data-breach notification and cybercrime laws. The Obama Administration has also proposed legislative measures on these issues. The Obama Administration has taken notable actions during the 114th Congress, including enacting legislation to provide statutory authority for programs previously established through executive action. This includes the NCCIC, Scholarship for Service program, NIST cybersecurity framework process, and the EINSTEIN intrusion-protection program for federal agencies. Executive Order 13691 was also implemented to promote information sharing and analysis organizations after data breaches like the 2015 Office of Personnel Management incident. The Obama Administration has implemented cybersecurity initiatives, including a national action plan and the appointment of a federal chief information security officer. Legislative and executive actions aim to address cybersecurity needs such as preventing disasters and espionage. Presidential Policy Directive 41 outlines the government's response to cybersecurity incidents affecting both government and private-sector entities. The well-established near-term needs in cybersecurity include preventing disasters and espionage, reducing impacts of successful attacks, improving collaboration, clarifying agency roles, and fighting cybercrime. Long-term challenges involve design, incentives, consensus, and environment (DICE), with a focus on integrating security into ICT design, addressing distorted economic incentives for cybersecurity, and the profitability of cybercrime compared to the costs of cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is costly, imperfect, and uncertain in terms of economic returns. There is a lack of consensus on its meaning, implementation, and risks among stakeholders. Cultural barriers hinder agreement on alternative security approaches in the rapidly evolving cyberspace environment. New technologies like social media, mobile computing, and cloud computing present both challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity improvement. The potential opportunities for improving cybersecurity include economies of scale from cloud computing and big data analytics. Legislation and executive actions in Congress could have significant impacts on cybersecurity challenges, such as cybersecurity R&D, cybercrime penalties, the NIST framework, and federal initiatives in cloud computing shaping the evolution of cybersecurity."
