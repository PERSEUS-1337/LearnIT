    "content": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) uses modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) to determine income eligibility for Medicaid and premium credits in the exchanges. MAGI includes adjusted gross income (AGI) plus certain additional income sources. Concerns have been raised about the use of MAGI by Congress and the Obama Administration. The use of MAGI in the ACA for Medicaid and premium credit eligibility has raised concerns due to its exclusion of certain income categories, unlike other federal low-income programs. This report outlines the provisions in ACA related to MAGI and discusses what is included in this income definition. Legislation has been enacted to address concerns about Social Security benefits not being included in MAGI calculations. The report discusses legislation to include all Social Security benefits in the MAGI definition for Medicaid eligibility and premium credits in health insurance exchanges. Medicaid is a means-tested program providing health insurance to low-income individuals, with ACA expanding coverage to those with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (NFIB) stated that states cannot lose current Medicaid funding for refusing to expand the program. States accepting ACA Medicaid expansion funds must follow new coverage rules. Participation in the expansion is optional without losing current federal Medicaid funds. Other ACA provisions, including exchanges and MAGI use, remain intact. The ACA Medicaid expansion covers most nonelderly citizens up to 133% FPL, using MAGI for income comparison. The new MAGI counting rule applies to assess financial eligibility for Medicaid's nonelderly populations. Certain groups are exempt from income eligibility determinations based on MAGI, while prior law's rules still apply for specific groups. The ACA Medicaid expansion covers most nonelderly citizens up to 133% FPL using MAGI for income comparison. Certain groups are exempt from MAGI income eligibility determinations, including foster care children, individuals receiving SSI, the elderly, certain disabled individuals, the medically needy, and enrollees in a Medicare Savings Program. States have the option to extend Medicaid to individuals eligible under the new eligibility group up to 133% FPL during a transitional period between April 1, 2010, and January 1, 2014. The ACA allows states to extend Medicaid coverage to individuals up to 133% FPL without using MAGI counting rules. States can apply different income counting methodologies, such as SSI rules, with approval. Health insurance exchanges must be established by January 1, 2014, by states or the Secretary of HHS. The ACA exchanges coordinate private health plans for individuals and small businesses, offering comprehensive coverage meeting ACA market reforms. Eligible individuals may receive premium assistance through tax credits based on income. Premium tax credits are advanceable and refundable, available starting in 2014. The ACA provides premium tax credits to applicable taxpayers with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. The credit amount varies based on MAGI, premium costs, and other factors, potentially covering the entire cost of coverage. The ACA provides premium tax credits to eligible taxpayers with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. The amount a taxpayer contributes towards the premium is capped as a percentage of their MAGI, with lower MAGI individuals paying less than higher MAGI individuals. For example, those with MAGI between 100% and 133% of the FPL would contribute 2% of their MAGI, while those with income between 300% and 400% of the FPL would contribute 9.5% of their MAGI. The ACA provides premium tax credits to eligible taxpayers with household income between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. The premium credit amount is calculated based on the arithmetical difference between the maximum premium contribution amount and the premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan in the enrollee's local area. For example, an exchange enrollee with MAGI at 200% FPL may be required to pay up to 6.3% of MAGI towards the cost of exchange coverage, which would amount to approximately $117 per month in 2012. The ACA provides premium tax credits based on household income. The premium credit is calculated by comparing the premium of the second-lowest-cost silver plan to a set amount. Household income is defined based on MAGI, with deductions for certain exclusions. The Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) used for calculating premium tax credits under the ACA includes deductions for trade and business, property losses, and alimony payments. MAGI consists of AGI plus certain foreign income and tax-exempt interest. Initially, only taxable income was included in MAGI, leaving out non-taxable sources like Social Security benefits and pension income. Other non-taxable income such as fringe benefits, gifts, and inheritances are also not included in MAGI, affecting the determination of low-income status. The definition of MAGI raised concerns regarding the exclusion of non-taxable Social Security benefits for determining low-income eligibility. Under the ACA, individuals aged 62-64 receiving early Social Security benefits could qualify for Medicaid or premium credits based on their MAGI, even if their total income was higher. The ACA definition of MAGI was amended to include non-taxable Social Security income, addressing concerns about its exclusion. There is interest in Congress to make the definition of income for Medicaid eligibility more inclusive. The ACA aimed to standardize Medicaid eligibility rules for various groups to simplify definitions and reduce complexity. Using MAGI based on tax returns streamlines income verification, while alternative definitions may complicate the process. Consistency in definitions ensures Medicaid and premium credits eligibility are mutually exclusive. The current legislative proposals focus on including Social Security benefits in income definitions for eligibility in low-income programs like Medicaid. States must use the same rules as the related cash assistance program to determine Medicaid eligibility. Other federal low-income programs also exclude certain types of income and assets from MAGI. The Medicaid program has complex income eligibility rules based on different categories, such as Title IV-E foster care, AFDC, and SSI. States may have variations in income counting rules, including mandatory and optional exclusions. This complexity makes determining Medicaid eligibility challenging. The AFDC program had complex eligibility rules with exclusions and disregards that made it harder to qualify for benefits. States could also obtain waivers to operate outside standard rules. SSI program assessed unearned and earned income for eligibility. The SSI program assesses unearned and earned income for eligibility, with exclusions for various types of income such as food stamps, housing assistance, and student grants. Non-recipients' income and resources may also be considered. States have the authority to use different rules for Medicaid coverage. The Medicaid program allows states to cover higher-income individuals through various eligibility pathways by using disregards to reduce their countable income. The transition to MAGI income counting rules in 2014 aimed to simplify income definitions for most Medicaid-eligible populations. The transition to MAGI income counting rules in 2014 aimed to simplify income definitions for most Medicaid-eligible populations, reducing variability and complexity. However, the MAGI definition may allow individuals with a higher percentage of total income relative to the federal poverty level to qualify for Medicaid, as gifts and inheritances are not counted in income eligibility determinations. Individuals with income higher than 133% of the Federal Poverty Level may qualify for Medicaid by receiving gifts to cover living expenses. Those exempt from MAGI income counting rules may also be eligible. They can choose the pathway that benefits them the most, such as using MAGI income eligibility definition to protect funds not considered in SSI income rules. Rules to protect funds not counted in Medicaid eligibility determination, individuals can choose eligibility category, potential issues with using non-MAGI income measures for validation. Administrative challenges in verifying non-taxable income for programs like SSI. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that around 19 million individuals would receive premium credits in 2019, with Medicaid eligibility facing fewer issues due to existing processes for income verification. Medicaid requires collection of Social Security numbers and wage information, while health insurance exchanges would need to develop processes to verify nontaxable income not currently included in Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). The ACA requires coordination between Medicaid and premium credits, with exchanges identifying Medicaid-eligible individuals. Changes to the MAGI definition of income raise questions about which definition to use. The current definition of income for tax purposes differs from that used by low-income programs for eligibility. The tax system defines income and household differently, with a tax unit consisting of the taxpayer and spouse. A household, according to the Census, may include multiple tax units. Beginning in 2014, tax unit 2 would have a Medicaid eligibility pathway not currently available under current income rules. Use of MAGI may allow Medicaid entitlement that would not exist for tax units 1 and 2. Income for tax purposes is the income taxed at the personal income tax level. Income includes taxpayer's income, spouse's income, and under certain circumstances, minor children's income. Some types of income may be excluded from tax purposes if taxable to other personal income tax units or at other levels. The purpose of social programs is to provide support to individuals and families in need, using a concept of household income to determine eligibility. Social programs may consider everyone in the household as a single unit, regardless of tax status. Income definitions for social programs are more inclusive than those for income taxes. Many social programs require reporting of gifts and inheritances as they can support applicants or recipients. Definitions of income and rules for counting income vary across social programs. Concerns have been raised about using MAGI to determine Medicaid eligibility and premium credits in ACA. The initial intent of using MAGI was to standardize income definitions for Medicaid eligibility and align with the health insurance exchange. However, including other nontaxable income sources could complicate administration, especially for premium credits."
