In amending the National Security Act of 1947, the President is required to provide all necessary information to congressional intelligence committees for assessing intelligence activities' lawfulness, effectiveness, cost, benefit, and risk. Information provided must be accessible to all members of the committees unless the President requests otherwise. The President can request limited access to information or material in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital US interests. The request must be detailed in writing to the congressional intelligence committees' Chair and ranking minority member. If a request is made, the committees can jointly decide on limiting access, but if they disagree, access will be restricted. The President can request limited access to information or material in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital US interests. Access to the information shall be limited as requested by the President, but must be made fully available to congressional intelligence committees with a detailed statement of reasons. Covert actions require findings to be reported to the committees, unless the President requests limited access after determining the need. Access to findings can be limited in extraordinary circumstances affecting vital US interests.
