    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Synthetic Drug Prevention, Treatment, and Education Act\" and it addresses synthetic recreational drugs by amending Title III of the Public Health Service Act. The \"Synthetic Drug Prevention, Treatment, and Education Act\" requires the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a study on preventing and treating synthetic recreational drugs and establish a database of these drugs in coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration. The \"Synthetic Drug Prevention, Treatment, and Education Act\" mandates the Secretary to identify synthetic recreational drugs by specifying a list of substances meeting specific criteria. The Secretary identifies substances marketed for recreational human use as synthetic recreational drugs. A campaign is developed by various agencies to address Cannabimimetic Agents. The Drug Enforcement Administration will create a national outreach campaign to educate various groups on preventing and treating the use of cannabimimetic agents. Federally-qualified health centers may receive grants for programs aimed at increasing public awareness and addressing the use of these agents. The maximum grant amount for programs addressing cannabimimetic agents is $250,000, with $5,000,000 authorized for appropriations from 2018 to 2020. Definitions for 'cannabimimetic agent' and 'Federally-qualified health center' are provided in this section. The term 'Federally-qualified health center' is defined in section 1861(aa) of the Social Security Act."
