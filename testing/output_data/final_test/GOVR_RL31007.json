    "content": "The House and Senate approved $25.086 billion in appropriations for energy and water development programs, $2.1 billion more than the Administration's request. The bill was signed into law by the President on November 12, 2001. A point of debate was an attempt to increase funding for DOE's nonproliferation programs by $131 million, which was ultimately not included in the final bill. The House and Senate passed H.R. 3338 with $226 million for nonproliferation funding, $30.3 million for security funding for the Bureau of Reclamation, and $139 million for the Corps of Engineers. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act 2002 included funding for various agencies, with a final appropriation of $25.086 billion. The final bill (P.L.107-66) appropriated $25.086 billion, with $4.49 billion allocated for the Corps of Engineers and $914 million for Department of the Interior programs. The Administration requested $820 million for FY2002 for DOI programs, an increase from FY2001. The request for DOE programs was $18.1 billion, with the final bill appropriating $18.75 billion. The final bill appropriated $19.5 billion for the Department of Energy (DOE) budget, which includes energy research, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. Funding for fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics is included in a separate appropriations bill. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other independent agencies received $184 million in appropriations for FY2002. The final bill approved $184 million for independent agencies in FY2002, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The bill also appropriated $4.486 billion for civil projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for FY2002. The FY2002 bill appropriated $4.486 billion for civil projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with Congress adding $480 million more than requested by the Clinton Administration. The Corps has faced criticism for its evaluation and implementation processes. The Corps of Engineers has faced criticism for its project evaluation and implementation processes, leading to calls for reforms and reviews of its programs and policies. The 106th Congress directed the Corps to study the feasibility of establishing an independent review panel for project studies. Legislation proposing changes to the project development process was introduced in the 107th Congress. The House Appropriations Committee acknowledged ongoing criticisms and cited a poorly managed study on navigation improvements. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees addressed criticisms of the Corps of Engineers, stating they are satisfied with the Corps' professional response. The Corps has a backlog of $40 billion in projects. Legislation regarding an Auburn Dam study was dropped from consideration in Congress. Debates in Congress over flood protection along the American River in California, particularly to safeguard Sacramento, have involved proposals like strengthening levees, improving flood warning systems, and considering the construction of a new dam near Auburn. The contentious issue of building a multi-purpose dam at the Auburn site has faced opposition from environmentalists, while others support the idea for water supply development. Some suggest enhancing levees and other flood protection measures for Sacramento instead of building a large dam. The final bill included a provision prohibiting the acceleration of the schedule to finalize the revision of the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual. This issue revolves around how to operate dams along the Missouri River, impacting water releases for various uses like barge traffic and species protection. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended altering dam operations to benefit the pallid sturgeon and other endangered species. The Corps is evaluating the impact of proposed spring water releases on Missouri River water users. The House-passed bill prohibited funds for increasing springtime water releases below Gavins Point Dam. The House provision in the Water Resources Development Act threatened to halt work on the manual, while the Senate version included a milder restriction on accelerating the process. An amendment allowed the Corps to consider alternative species recovery methods and to consider input from other agencies and individuals to maintain other authorized purposes. This language was included in Section 116 of the final bill. Funding for Everglades restoration projects, including the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, is included in annual appropriations acts. The annual Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act and the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provide funding for Everglades and South and Central Florida projects. The FY01 budget included $150 million for the South Florida ecosystem, $28 million for WRDA 2000 pilot restoration activities, $95 million for Central and Southern Florida project construction, $20 million for Everglades ecosystem restoration, and $26 million for Kissimmee river restoration. The Energy and Water Development bill provides funding for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The final appropriation for FY2001 included $776.5 million for BOR and $39.9 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account. The final bill appropriated $36.2 million for CUP and $878 million for BOR, totaling $914 million. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations allocated $36.2 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account and $878 million for the Bureau of Reclamation, totaling $914 million. The Bureau of Reclamation has been involved in constructing major dams and water diversion structures in the West. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) manages over 600 dams in 17 western states, supplying water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. BOR is the largest water supplier in the region and the second largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. The FY2002 budget for BOR's water and energy projects was $762.5 million, including funds for specific projects like the Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota and the Mni Wiconi rural water supply project. The House and Senate bills differed in funding amounts for water projects, with the final bill allocating $22.5 million for Garrison, $30 million for Mni Wiconi, and $16 million for Animas-La Plata. The House Appropriations Committee did not fund the President's request for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee funded $40 million for CALFED-related projects under other accounts in the absence of authorizing legislation. An attempt to cut this funding by $10 million was tabled on a 56-44 vote. The final bill included $30 million for projects supporting CALFED goals but did not fund the program itself. The Conference Committee report directed funding towards specific CALFED-related projects like planning for the Sites Reservoir and assessing raising Shasta Dam. The Energy and Water Development bill included funding for various DOE programs, such as renewable energy, nuclear power, science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons. The final appropriation for DOE programs was $19.5 billion, which was higher than the Administration's request of $18.1 billion for FY2002. The final Energy and Water Development bill appropriated $19.5 billion for DOE programs in Title III, exceeding the Administration's request of $18.1 billion for FY2002. The Department of Energy plays a significant role in combating terrorism due to its involvement in nuclear weapons production and maintenance. The FY2002 request for nuclear weapons capability included $792.5 million, with $307 million for weapons of mass destruction (WMD), specifically nuclear weapons. This funding is primarily for physical security of DOE's facilities, with an increase in requested funding for FY2002 compared to FY2001. Other activities include combating terrorism, with $47 million appropriated for FY2001. The Conference Committee allocated $47 million for combating terrorism in FY2001, with $45 million requested for FY2002. Additionally, $68 million was appropriated for research and development in FY2001, with $56 million requested for FY2002. The Committee expected new security requirements post-9/11 to be addressed within the emergency supplemental appropriation or the FY2003 budget. Secretaries of the Army, Energy, and Interior were directed to report physical security requirements by February 15, 2002. Additional funding for DOE's anti-terrorist activities was included in the FY2002 Defense Appropriations and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. The Appropriations and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, passed in December, allocated $118 million for DOE's weapons program security and $226 million for Nonproliferation and National Security Programs. The Bush Administration proposed cutting Renewable Energy funding by $99 million, but the final bill provided $396 million - $120 million more than requested and $20 million above the FY2001 level. The Administration requested reduced funding for various renewable energy programs, including photovoltaics, wind, geothermal, and concentrating solar power. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the lack of clear rationale for the budget cuts and emphasized the importance of long-term energy solutions over immediate relief for the energy crisis. The House bill provided $376.8 million for renewable energy, with cuts in some programs like Concentrating Solar Power and Small Hydro. Reductions included eliminating the Renewable Energy Program for American Indians and International Renewables. Increases were proposed for Photovoltaics and Electric/Storage, including funding for the Transmission Reliability Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $435 million for renewable energy, $158.3 million more than the request. The Senate bill allocated more funds for Biomass Power, Electric/Storage, Hydrogen, and Concentrating Solar Power compared to the House recommendation. The Senate bill allocated additional funding for Concentrating Solar Power, National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), Small Hydro, Electric/Storage, Biomass Power, and Hydrogen. The final appropriation was $396.0 million, $19.2 million more than the House recommendation and $39.0 million less than the Senate recommendation. The FY2002 appropriation bill included increases for Electric/Storage, Biomass/Biofuels, and Hydrogen, but also had cuts for Renewable Support and Implementation. For nuclear energy programs, the Bush Administration requested $223.1 million, with the enacted measure providing $250.1 million. The bill also included $18.1 million for the \"nuclear energy research initiative\" (NERI). The FY2002 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill provided $32 million for the \"nuclear energy research initiative\" (NERI), exceeding the requested $18.1 million. Additionally, the bill allocated $12 million for the new \"nuclear energy technologies\" program, which aims to develop a \"Generation IV Technology Roadmap\" for advanced nuclear power plants. Funding also includes $3 million for industry costs related to Nuclear Regulatory Commission applications and $2 million for testing new reactor designs at DOE national laboratories. The DOE allocated $2 million for testing new reactor designs, fuels, and materials at national laboratories. An additional $4.5 million was requested for nuclear energy plant optimization, with the final budget increasing the program to $7 million. The DOE justifies federally funded nuclear power research as essential for reliable electricity without harmful emissions, despite opposition from environmental groups targeting nuclear R&D for elimination due to radioactive waste concerns. Controversy surrounds the electrometallurgical treatment of DOE spent fuel, where radioactive isotopes are separated from uranium and plutonium. DOE allocated $25.8 million for the treatment program in FY2002, with a slight increase in funding from FY2001. The House-passed bill increased the funding to $26.1 million, while the Senate approved the requested amount. The Senate approved the funding level for electrometallurgical treatment at $26.1 million, which opponents argue is unnecessary and could be used for making nuclear weapons. The process is linked to technology from the canceled Integral Fast Reactor program. No funding was requested for the Advanced Accelerator Applications program, which aims to study particle accelerators for nuclear weapons and radioactive waste treatment. The House-passed bill provided no new funding for the program, but the Senate approved $70 million - $55 million for Other Defense Activities and $15 million to close out the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) program. The enacted bill provides $50 million for the AAA program, with $4.5 million for research on spent fuel treatment in Nevada. DOE requested $38.4 million to shut down the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) at Hanford, Washington. The Clinton Administration had considered restarting the Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) for nuclear research and medical isotope production but decided to permanently shut it down in January 2001. Energy Secretary Abraham suspended the final decision on closing FFTF until late July 2001 for further study. The House and Senate provided full funding for FFTF shutdown activities, with a review of the medical isotope production option announced in August 2001. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved the use of money for FFTFshutdown activities until 90 days after receipt of the Secretary's recommendations for alternative actions at FFTF. DOE's science programs cover basic research activities in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, BES, BER, fusion energy sciences, and advanced scientific computing, making it a significant supporter of basic and physical science research. For FY2002, DOE requested $3.160 billion for Science, slightly below the previous year's level. The House-passed bill provided $3.166 billion, slightly above the request but below the FY2001 level. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees approved funding for DOE's science programs, with the House providing $3.166 billion, slightly above the request but below FY2001 levels. The Senate allocated $3.269 billion, expressing concern that the increase was inadequate due to budget constraints. The final bill provides $3.233 billion, with additional funding for BES and the Spallation Neutron Source. The final bill provides $1.004 billion for BES, including full funding for the Spallation Neutron Source construction. The House and Senate approved increases for BES and BER programs, with the Senate approving $47.0 million above the request for BER. The Genomes-to-Life project is a new initiative proposed within BER. The Genomes-to-Life project proposed within BER aims to use DOE computational and advanced imaging capabilities to study protein behavior and create computer models of cellular behavior. The House-passed bill fully funds the project, while the Senate approved a $10 million increase. The final bill allocates $527.4 million for BER, $84.4 million above the request, with most of the increase designated for Congress-identified projects. Funding for the nanoscience initiative is expected to remain stable, with a request for $4 million to establish nanoscale science research centers. The House and Senate supported funding for nanoscience centers through competitive selection. The final bill allocated $3 million for engineering and design of three nanoscience centers. Funding for the Advanced Scientific Computing program was reduced by $5 million. Congress expressed support for the Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing program and urged maximum involvement of the academic community in the ASCR program. The House directed DOE to increase academic community involvement in the ASCR program and develop a rationale linking Office of Science programs to national energy needs. It also called for a plan to transfer safety regulation of non-defense nuclear facilities to external agencies in FY2003. The Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship program, established by Congress in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, aims to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration within the Department of Energy. The program's goal is to preserve the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Stewardship program, established by Congress in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, aims to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. The program requires the DOE to demonstrate capability to refabricate and certify existing weapon types and maintain the ability to design, fabricate, and certify new warheads. Stockpile stewardship activities are funded through the NNSA's Weapons Activities program, with $5,300.0 million requested and $5,429.2 million appropriated for FY2002. The three main elements of stockpile stewardship include Directed Stockpile Work and Campaigns, with requested and appropriated amounts specified. The final legislation provides funding for Stockpile Work, Campaigns, and Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities, as well as $200.0 million for upgrading nuclear weapons complex facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported $6,062.9 million for Weapons Activities, with concerns about aging weapons components, physical plants, and production complex progress. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 19. The Senate passed a bill on July 19 without amending the Weapons Activities section. NNSA manages Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors programs. Total funding for NNSA was $7,233.5 million appropriated. Stewardship activities occur at the nuclear weapons complex, consisting of three laboratories and four production sites. NNSA manages and sets policy for the complex. The Directed Stockpile Work program involves maintenance, refurbishment, and modifications of nuclear weapons in the stockpile. Activities in FY2002 include refurbishment of the W87 warhead, engineering modifications on B61 bombs, aging studies on certain components, life extension and upgrades to the W80 cruise missile warhead, and engineering work on the W76 warhead for Trident missiles. Conferees expressed concerns about the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review. The Administration's Nuclear Posture Review raised concerns about potential wasted funds by NNSA in early FY2002. Conferees instructed NNSA to minimize weapon-unique investments and expressed particular concern about refurbishing the W80 warhead. They required advance approval for using FY2002 funds for long-term life extension of the warhead. Additionally, there are 17 campaigns for focused scientific and engineering efforts in FY2002, with requests ranging from $1.3 million to $747.1 million. In FY2002, there are 17 campaigns with requests ranging from $1.3 million to $747.1 million. Examples include Enhanced Surveillance, Advanced Design and Production Technologies, and Tritium Readiness. These campaigns aim to assess weapon components, improve manufacturing processes, and develop means to produce tritium. One campaign attracting congressional interest has seen a significant increase above the FY2002 request. The United States has been unable to produce pits for nuclear warheads since 1989. The campaign supports two pit projects at Los Alamos National Laboratory, with estimated costs totaling $5 billion over two decades. The appropriated amount includes $213.0 million for the program. The FY2002 cost for the pit program was projected at $2.0 million for pit activities and $4.0 million for design activities. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the project for being behind schedule and over budget, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funding by $109.2 million to $237.7 million to fully fund relevant activities. The current schedule aims to certify a pit for use in the stockpile by FY2009. The current schedule to certify a pit for use in the stockpile by FY2009 is deemed \"unacceptable.\" The Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities (RTBF) program provides infrastructure and operations at nuclear weapons complex sites. The request includes funding for Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. Specific items in the final legislation include additional funding for Pantex Plant, Y-12 Plant, the National Center for Combating Terrorism at the Nevada Test Site, and nuclear weapons. For FY2002, DOE requested $2.506 billion for nuclear weapons R&D, including funds for Advanced Simulation and Computing and experimental facilities. This is part of the stockpile stewardship program aimed at maintaining the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. The request also includes funding for the National Center for Combating Terrorism at the Nevada Test Site and nuclear weapons incident response. For FY2002, the DOE requested $2.506 billion for nuclear weapons R&D, including funds for Advanced Simulation and Computing, Inertial Confinement Fusion, and other R&D activities. Funding is allocated for Stockpile R&D, Directed Stockpile Work, and R&D within the RTBF account. Increased activity is expected for weapon assessment and certification, while funding for advanced radiography is set to decline. Efforts will focus on developing a supercomputer and visual interactive environment for weapon research. The FY2002 request for nuclear weapons R&D includes funding for Advanced Simulation and Computing, Inertial Confinement Fusion, and other R&D activities. Construction funding for the NIF project would increase by 24.2%, with no change in scope or mission. The first laser light is expected in June 2004, and completion is scheduled for September 2008. Funding for NIF risk reduction and technology development activities is lower than recommended in the rebaseline. The House bill provided $2.44 billion for nuclear weapons R&D, 2.7% below the request but 3.3% above the FY2001 level. The House cut $100 million from the request for the Advance Simulation and Computing program, citing advances in high-performance computing technology in the private sector. The House approved full funding for NIF construction but expressed concerns about the program, directing DOE to address recent GAO findings. The Senate approved $2.79 billion for nuclear weapons R&D, 11.3% above the request and 18.3% above the FY2001 level. They noted progress in stockpile stewardship but certification capability is still a challenge. The Senate increased funding for directed stockpile work R&D, advanced radiography, inertial confinement fusion, and advanced simulation and computing. Additional funds are allocated for an advanced hydrodynamic test facility and various ASC projects. The Senate approved $2.79 billion for nuclear weapons R&D, with additional funds for an advanced hydrodynamic test facility and various ASC projects. The Senate also provided $2,629.0 million for nuclear weapons R&D for FY2002, including funding for directed stockpile work R&D, campaigns, and R&D activities. The Senate approved funding for nuclear weapons R&D, including $2.79 billion for ICF and ASC programs, $658.1 million for R&D activities within RTBF, and $25 million for advanced hydrodynamic test facility. The Bush Administration's FY2002 request for nonproliferation and national security programs was $773.7 million, a decrease of $100.5 million from FY2001. The House bill, H.R. 2311, restored some of the Administration's proposed cuts to Arms Control, International Materials Protection, and IMPCA programs. R&D funding increased to $216 million, IMPCA received $190 million, and Arms Control was reduced to $75.7 million. The total nonproliferation and national security program funding in the House bill was $845.3 million, while S. 1171 funded these programs at $880.5 million. The final bill appropriated $803.6 million, with a rejected proposal to redirect $130 million by Representative Edwards. The Conference Committee rejected a proposal to redirect $130 million from other weapons programs to increase non-proliferation activities in the Former Soviet Union. Despite the House passing H.R. 3338 without additional nonproliferation funding, the Senate version included $226 million for DOE's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation programs, which survived in the final bill passed on December 20. This funding included $78 million for Nonproliferation and Verification R&D, and $15 million for the IPP and NCI programs. The FY2002 funding for DOE's Environmental Management Program includes $6.33 billion, with the House-passed bill providing $7.03 billion and the Senate approving $7.28 billion. The enacted bill ultimately provides $7.14 billion for the program. The FY2002 enacted bill provides $7.14 billion for the Environmental Management Program, $170 million above the FY2001 level and $803 million above the request. The budget focuses on completing work at sites for long-term savings and includes funding for defense facilities closure projects, such as Rocky Flats and Fernald sites. The FY2002 enacted bill provides $7.14 billion for the Environmental Management Program, with $912 million requested for site/project completion by 2006 at DOE sites. The final bill includes additional funding for cleanup projects at various DOE locations, with a focus on post-2006 completion accounts for defense and non-defense activities. The Administration sought $2.92 billion for post-2006 completion, slightly below the FY2001 level. The FY2002 enacted bill provides $7.14 billion for the Environmental Management Program, with additional funding for cleanup projects at various DOE locations. The final bill allocates $3.57 billion for projects at Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Savannah River, Hanford, and other sites. $1.033 billion is provided for the Office of River Protection, and $375 million for the civilian nuclear waste program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended deep cuts in the nuclear waste program, citing concerns about Yucca Mountain as a potential waste repository. Senator Harry Reid strongly opposes using Yucca Mountain for this purpose. The proposed funding cut drew opposition in the Senate, with warnings of program delays and layoffs of personnel. Senator Reid added a Sense of the Senate resolution to increase funding for the Yucca Mountain project, despite proposed cuts. The program milestones would be delayed, including the final Environmental Impact Statement and site recommendation. The license application process would also be pushed back. The Yucca Mountain project faced delays in milestones and funding cuts. The license application to the NRC was postponed to FY2003. Funding sources included the Nuclear Waste Fund and defense nuclear waste disposal account. The House bill cut $2 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund, while the Senate proposed $25 million from the Fund. The final bill allocated $95 million. The final bill allocated $95 million from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $280 million from the defense account for the Yucca Mountain project. The 2010 target for opening a permanent repository is 12 years later than the original deadline set in 1998. Utilities have won court decisions upholding the Department's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for damages. The DOE's four Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to market excess power generated by dams and water projects for conservation and management purposes. The PMAs, including BPA, SEPA, SWPA, and WAPA, sell power at wholesale rates to utilities and federal agencies, with priority given to preference customers like municipal utilities and co-ops. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) do not own generating facilities but own transmission facilities. The 104th Congress debated selling the PMAs, authorizing divestiture of one in 1995. The Administration's request for FY2002 was $205.1 million, with slight increases for some PMAs. No press to dispose of remaining PMAs due to uncertainties in electric utility restructuring. The conferees settled on $207.5 million for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs), with $200,000 allocated for a technical analysis by WAPA. BPA plans to borrow $374.5 million for various programs in FY2002 and requested an additional $2 billion in borrowing authority for critical infrastructure needs, which was included in the Senate bill but not approved by the House Appropriations Committee. The final bill did not include an increase in permanent borrowing authority for the Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs). Beginning in FY2001, PMAs were authorized to use power revenues from customers for power purchases, replacing appropriated funds previously used. This change was likely due to the repayment of funds to the Treasury rather than the Department of Energy (DOE), impacting discretionary spending caps. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) appropriations are typically non-controversial as the agency covers its costs through fees. The House Appropriations Committee reported a provision prohibiting FERC from authorizing the Gulfstream Natural Gas Project. An amendment to strike the language was defeated in the House. The provision is not in the Senate's version of the bill. Independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the NRC, ARC, and Denali Commission. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested a budget of $513.1 million for FY2002, with $6.2 million allocated for the NRC inspector general's office. The House-passed bill added $10 million to cover costs for reviewing new reactor designs and early site permits for potential new reactors. The Senate provided a $10 million increase in the budget for new license reviews, design certifications, and site permits for potential new reactors. The final Energy and Water bill approved $516.9 million for the NRC, including funding for the NRC inspector general's office. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees criticized the NRC in 1998 for not improving its regulatory system in line with industry safety standards. The NRC faced criticism from committees for inconsistencies in regional offices, interference in nuclear plant management, and outdated review processes. Despite this, the panels praised NRC for regulatory process changes in the FY2000 budget cycle. Industry critics raised concerns about potential relaxed safety oversight with the new procedures. NRC's budget has been funded by fees on nuclear power plants and other licensed activities, with industry arguing against paying for programs from which they did not directly benefit. The FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill addressed this concern. The FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill phased down the NRC's fee recovery to 90% over 5 years. Fees on licensees offset 96% of the FY2002 NRC appropriation, with an additional $10 million covered by fees for new licenses, permits, and certifications. The enacted bill requires fees to recover 96% of the additional $10 million, in line with the rest of the NRC budget. The summarized text chunk includes various CRS reports on topics such as Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal, Renewable Energy, Western Water Issues, Department of Energy Programs, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, Army Corps of Engineers Reform Issues, and Water Resource Issues in the 107th Congress."
