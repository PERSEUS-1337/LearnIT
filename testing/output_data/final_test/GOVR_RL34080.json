    "content": "Food and agricultural imports, particularly from China, have raised safety concerns in the U.S. due to incidents like contaminated dairy products causing infant deaths and illnesses. Several countries have banned Chinese dairy imports, and in 2007, adulterated pet food ingredients from China were also reported. In early 2007, contaminated pet food ingredients from China caused the deaths of many dogs and cats. The U.S. FDA detained imports of farm-raised seafood from China due to unapproved drug residues. The Chinese government took steps to improve food and drug safety, including new inspections and plant closures. In late 2007, China signed a memorandum with the U.S. government to ensure food and feed product safety. The FDA plans to station officials in China for closer oversight. Public and congressional scrutiny increased on China's food safety regime and U.S. import safeguards during the 110th Congress. Congressional committees held hearings and investigations on food imports from China and other countries, reviewing laws and regulations to ensure import safety. Many bills were introduced to expand federal authorities for imported and domestic foods. In late 2007, China signed a memorandum with the U.S. government to ensure food and feed product safety. The FDA plans to station officials in China for closer oversight. Congressional scrutiny increased on China's food safety regime and U.S. import safeguards during the 110th Congress. Many bills were introduced to expand federal authorities affecting both imported and domestic foods. The CRS report discusses the recent Chinese food safety concern regarding melamine in dairy ingredients, U.S.-China Trade Trends, monitoring of import safety, and other developments. In September 2008, a food safety crisis unfolded in China due to melamine-contaminated milk powder, resulting in thousands of sickened children and several deaths. In mid-July 2008, Chinese health officials were informed about a high number of kidney stones in babies who had consumed a milk product. However, a nationwide recall of 700 tons of melamine-tainted milk powder was not announced until September 11, 2008. Melamine is an industrial chemical that can cause kidney stones, kidney damage, and kidney failure when ingested. The crisis initially focused on milk powder from the Chinese company Sanlu, in which Fonterra owns a 43% share. Sanlu obtains its milk from middlemen who collect it from local farmers. Investigators found that middlemen supplying milk to Sanlu were adding melamine to boost protein content readings of watered-down milk. This practice may have been ongoing for years, leading to recalls of Chinese dairy products in multiple countries. As of late September 2008, at least 12 countries had banned Chinese dairy imports due to concerns about melamine contamination. The Food Safety Authority found high levels of melamine in Chinese-made White Rabbit Creamy Candies and warned against consumption. Various countries were testing dairy protein products from China, including biscuits and chocolate potentially made from contaminated milk powder. The European Commission requested urgent scientific advice from the European Food Safety Agency regarding the situation. The European Food Safety Authority stated that consuming chocolates and biscuits with contaminated milk powder does not pose health concerns for adults in Europe. Children with moderate consumption would not exceed the tolerable daily intake, but high daily consumption could lead to exceeding the limit. The EU has banned imports of baby foods with Chinese milk powder and requires testing of products with over 15% milk powder. The U.S. FDA issued a health advisory on the matter in 2008. The U.S. FDA issued a health advisory in 2008 regarding the safety of infant formulas and products potentially contaminated with melamine from China. King Car Food Industrial Co. recalled certain instant coffee and milk tea products due to possible contamination. Consumers were warned not to consume these products or White Rabbit Creamy Candy. The FDA issued a health advisory in 2008 regarding Chinese dairy products, with a focus on milk-derived ingredients like casein. Import sampling and testing were broadened to ensure safety, with casein being the largest type of dairy-related import from China. China accounted for a small percentage of U.S. casein imports. In 2002, 68% of casein purchases were used for nondairy food products in the U.S. Imports of agricultural and seafood products increased by 36% from 1997 to 2007, with a 95% increase in value. Specialty nutrition products mainly use caseinates, while various products like live animals, wine/beer, and seafood doubled in volume during this period. In 2005, 15% of U.S. food consumption was imported, with high proportions for certain categories like fish, shellfish, fresh fruits, processed fruits, and tree nuts. Chinese agricultural and seafood imports to the U.S. increased significantly from 1997 to 2007. China was the third leading foreign supplier of food and agricultural products to the United States in 2007, with seafood products like shrimp, shellfish, and salmon being the top imports. Other products included fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, teas, and spices. China also became the leading exporter of seafood to the U.S. in 2004, with aquaculture facilitating export growth for shrimp, tilapia, catfish, eel, and crab. The U.S. exports more food and agricultural products to China than China exports to the U.S. In 2007, U.S. food, agricultural, and seafood exports to China totaled 14.7 MMT and were valued at $8.8 billion. Many of these exports may be sent to China as lower-value products, processed there, and returned to be consumed in the United States. International trade rules permit a foreign country to apply its own regulatory authorities and institutional systems in meeting safety standards under the concept of \"equivalence.\" FSIS, under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, determines equivalence of other countries' meat and poultry safeguards for imports to the United States. A foreign plant must have a program equivalent to the U.S. system to ship products. FSIS also conducts reinspection at U.S. border entry points. FSIS operates a reinspection program at U.S. border entry points using the Automated Import Inspection System (AIIS) to target shipments for inspection. China is not certified to ship FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products to the U.S. Meat and poultry imports from other countries have increased, with approximately 4 billion pounds annually now. FSIS physically examined about 20% of imports in FY1996 compared to 10% in recent years. About 4% of imports undergo microbiological testing. The FDA conducts microbiological testing on food imports and can refuse entry if they appear to be adulterated or in violation of the law. Importers must provide prior notifications and entry bonds for every shipment, with import information entered into the OASIS database for inspection. FDA inspectors collaborate with Customs and Border Protection officials to assess the relative risk of shipments and determine if closer scrutiny is needed. The volume of FDA-regulated food imports has tripled. The FDA's ability to inspect foreign food facilities is limited compared to FSIS. FDA lacks staff and funding to increase its overseas presence, only visiting facilities in response to concerns and with foreign government permission. The volume of FDA-regulated food imports has tripled in a decade, with only 1% physically examined in FY2007. The FDA's budget for food activities in FY2007 was $457.1 million, with approximately 1,900 food safety staff in field offices across the US. The agency may have the authority to set equivalency standards for Chinese imports, but lacks the statutory authority to mandate equivalency according to the Government Accountability Office. FDA compiles a monthly \"Import Refusal Report\" for rejected food shipments using OASIS data. The FDA compiles a monthly \"Import Refusal Report\" for rejected food shipments, which are either re-exported or destroyed by the importer. The reports are posted on the FDA website for the most recent 12 months only. The data includes the source company and reason for refusal, but does not provide aggregated annual figures. The system does not allow for calculating the volumes of rejected products or their proportion of total imports. The FDA compiles a monthly \"Import Refusal Report\" for rejected food shipments, which are either re-exported or destroyed by the importer. The reports are posted on the FDA website for the most recent 12 months only. CRS prepared a tabulation of nearly 8,500 FDA-regulated food and food-related products refusals in FY2007, with China, Mexico, and India having the most shipments refused. The higher number of refusals from a country does not necessarily indicate lower product safety. Canada had fewer import refusals compared to China and Mexico, despite being the top importer to the United States. India, not a top exporter, had the second highest number of refusals. China had over 700 refused shipments, with a significant portion being seafood, particularly eel, due to concerns of veterinary drug residues. Catfish products were also frequently refused for similar reasons. Various other finfish products were refused for multiple concerns. The FDA refused numerous seafood shipments from China due to concerns such as veterinary drug residues, filthy appearance, and Salmonella contamination. Additionally, over 200 shipments of fruits and vegetables from China were rejected for various reasons including pesticide levels, unsafe additives, and lack of proper documentation. Chinese officials have defended their safety record, stating that U.S. inspectors approved \"99 percent\" of Chinese food and medical shipments in the last three years. They argue that rejected shipments were unauthorized and bypassed Chinese controls. Officials also urged U.S. importers to prioritize standards over low prices. In September 2007, a Chinese official blamed issues with Chinese exports on U.S. importers not providing proper information on U.S. standards or the U.S. failing to verify Chinese exporters' approval. FDA officials noted a low refusal rate for shipments from China in FY2006, cautioning that only 1% of entries are examined due to resource constraints. Former FDA deputy commissioner mentioned a significant increase in food and ingredient exports from China to the U.S. from 2002 to 2006. The FDA OASIS database does not confirm if Chinese imports are less safe than others, despite criticism over incidents involving adulterated food. In 2007, pet food from China containing melamine sickened animals in North America. Another incident involved antibiotics in Chinese catfish. China's catfish tested positive for banned antibiotics in the US, leading to a halt in sales. Analysts have noted China's struggles to meet international food safety standards, causing rejections of their exports in Japan, Europe, and other countries. China's challenges in meeting global food safety standards are common among developing countries. Specific obstacles include difficulties in standardizing production practices at the farm level, noncompliance with regulations, heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides, widespread antibiotic use in livestock, poultry, and aquaculture, industrialization, lax environmental controls, and concerns about contaminants in fields and waters. China faces challenges in meeting global food safety standards due to issues such as waste contamination in fields and waters, a fragmented marketing system, a complex regulatory structure, and outdated standards. Responsibility for food safety is divided among various Chinese agencies at different levels of government. The General Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) oversees quality assurance for imports and exports, including food and toys. China has around 400,000 food or feed manufacturers, with only 12,000 to 15,000 registered with AQSIQ for export. One-third of China's food exports come from non-registered establishments, and 78% of China's 448,000 food enterprises are small \"cottage industries\" with 10 employees or fewer. The Ministry of Health and the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) have minimal roles in regulating exports. The Administration released two reports in late 2007 focused on improving oversight of food imports, including Chinese imports. The Action Plan for Import Safety and FDA's Food Protection Plan prioritize risk assessment and prevention for all imports, emphasizing cooperation. The Administration's plans for improving oversight of food imports involve cooperation with private industry stakeholders and foreign governments, as well as new regulations and legislative authorities. Additional funds are being sought to support these initiatives in the FY2009 budget request. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) was signed with the Chinese government to enhance the safety of food and feed imports from China, following meetings between officials from both countries. The MOA between the US and China aims to establish a cooperative mechanism for registration and certification systems for imported products. China will require exporters to register with AQSIQ and undergo annual inspections to meet US standards. AQSIQ will notify FDA of failed inspections and develop tracing and testing systems. Both countries will notify each other of public health risks within 48 hours, and AQSIQ will facilitate FDA access. The MOA between the US and China establishes a cooperative mechanism for registration and certification systems for imported products. China will require exporters to register with AQSIQ and undergo annual inspections to meet US standards. AQSIQ will notify FDA of failed inspections and facilitate FDA access to Chinese processing and cultivation sites. Export certificates are required for commodities with high import refusal rates, with a working group developing further implementation details within 120 days. Stakeholders raised concerns about the agreement neglecting other Chinese products with questionable safety records. Several stakeholders raised concerns about China's willingness or capacity to meet its obligations under the agreement, noting the government's strict food standards but lack of enforcement. Questions were raised about unfair preferential treatment for Chinese imports, FDA resources for oversight, legal authority for information sharing, and the agency's ability to demand certificates from foreign importers. A \"Joint Progress Statement\" issued on June 18, 2008, highlighted cooperation and communication mechanisms established between the US and China on food safety events. The FDA and China have developed steps for electronic certification of China-exported products to meet FDA standards, training Chinese officials on U.S. regulatory requirements. FDA has multiple international agreements for food safety, including with China for lead in tableware. The FDA has approved visas for establishing permanent offices in China to oversee food and drug safety. They plan to have staff in three locations, with the first office opening in October 2008. In a significant move, FDA issued an import alert in 2007 for aquacultured products from China due to contamination with unapproved antimicrobial agents. Seafood imported from China was found to be contaminated with unapproved antimicrobial agents, including nitrofuran, malachite green, gentian velvet, and fluoroquinolones. The FDA issued an import alert, detaining all affected products until they are proven free of contaminants through independent testing. This alert is broader in scope than usual, highlighting the prevalence of imported seafood in the US, with over 40% coming from aquaculture operations. Shrimp and catfish are among the top 10 most consumed seafood items. The aquaculture industry in China is the largest in the world, producing 70% of total seafood. Concerns have risen about the use of unapproved animal drugs and chemicals in aquaculture operations. Despite Chinese government initiatives to improve food safety, issues like tainted dairy products have prompted stricter regulations. The Chinese government has implemented stricter regulations for milk dealers, including registration and regular inspections to prevent tampering. They have also updated consumer food laws and adopted a national framework for agricultural product safety. China requires registration of land and processing facilities for exported products, with exporters needing facilities to test for pesticide residues. The government samples and tests products for export to meet foreign standards, while also encouraging investment in production and processing for technology and infrastructure improvements. Processed foods in China are now required to be manufactured under HACCP standards to assess risks and prevent hazards. The former head of the government's food and drug safety agency was sentenced to death for taking bribes. Additionally, 180 food manufacturers using industrial materials were closed down by a government agency. China has been using industrial materials in various food products, leading to the closure of unlicensed food manufacturers. The country's AQSIQ announced the implementation of inspection and quarantine labels on all food exports. China has prioritized oversight of food exports, restricting eligibility for a small number of food processors. The State Council has introduced regulations to enhance controls over food producers and distributors. The State Council in China has introduced regulations to enhance controls over food producers and distributors. This includes making more records public, imposing higher fines on violators, and establishing a \"blacklist\" for exporters and importers of unqualified food products. Local governments are primarily responsible for food safety oversight. Additionally, the SFDA has allocated $1.6 billion to improve food and drug supervision, with new rules to tighten oversight of processors and their raw materials. The Standardization Administration of China plans to revise 4,000 food safety standards by 2010, focusing on additives, dairy, meat, eggs, and fisheries. It is uncertain if these commitments apply to other Chinese bodies like AQSIQ. The State Council in China has introduced regulations to enhance controls over food producers and distributors, including imposing higher fines on violators and establishing a \"blacklist\" for exporters and importers of unqualified food products. U.S. exporters were facing sanitary barriers to trade in China, with meat and poultry imports being suspended due to Salmonella bacteria and unapproved feed additives. Poultry exports from seven U.S. states were banned due to Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza, a move disputed by the United States. China also rejected 47 tons of U.S. frozen sardines in early October 2007. In early October 2007, China rejected 47 tons of U.S. frozen sardines contaminated with Listeria, possibly in response to U.S. complaints about Chinese goods' safety. Members of Congress criticized China's food safety record and U.S. efforts to ensure the safety of imports. Several bills with food import safety provisions were introduced in 2007 and some passed, including Section 1009 in the Food Safety title of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. This requires an annual report to Congress on FDA-regulated food products imported by country and type, inspections performed, and enforcement actions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 provides funding for FDA and FSIS, with a provision prohibiting FSIS from implementing a certain rule. Several food safety bills were pending in 2008, including proposals for formal certification of importing establishments and foreign countries to ensure the same level of safety assurances as the U.S. system. This includes a provision prohibiting FSIS from implementing a rule allowing certain poultry products to be imported from China. Several food safety bills in 2008 proposed measures to ensure the safety of imported products, including revoking import privileges if foreign safeguards are inadequate, collecting user fees from importers for inspection costs, increasing physical inspections and testing, and requiring public notification of smuggled or recalled food products. H.R. 3100 and S. 2418 are among the bills with import safety provisions, such as certifying private laboratories conducting tests on FDA-regulated imports. In 2008, food safety bills proposed measures for imported products, including revoking import privileges for inadequate safeguards, collecting user fees for inspection costs, increasing inspections and testing, and requiring public notification of smuggled or recalled food. Senator Durbin's bill (S. 3385) and a draft proposal by Representative Dingell focused on imported foods, with provisions for importer verification programs, expedited review for meeting safety standards, and FDA authority to require export certificates for higher-risk foods. The Durbin bill and Dingell draft focus on imported food safety measures, including certification by qualified entities, accreditation of third parties, agreements with foreign governments for inspections, and FDA authority to review foreign food safety systems. Importers would need to register with the FDA and pay fees. The Durbin bill and Dingell draft propose measures for imported food safety, including registration with the FDA, annual fees, dedicated import inspectors, stricter country-of-origin labeling, and limiting imports to ports near food testing labs. Recent developments call for mandatory country-of-origin labeling for fresh meats, produce, and peanuts, effective September 30, 2008. The omnibus 2008 farm bill maintained this date and expanded coverage to include chicken.
