    "content": "The House and Senate passed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and President Trump signed it into law as P.L. 115-232. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues that may generate high levels of congressional and constituent interest. CRS will update this report to reflect enacted legislation and provides background information on authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001. Some issues discussed were previously addressed in the FY18 NDAA and related CRS products are identified for more detailed analysis. The authorized personnel strength of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force fluctuated in response to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress increased Army and Marine Corps end-strength but began reversing the increases due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. End-strength for the Air Force declined from 2004-2015 but increased from 2016-2018, while the Navy's end-strength declined from 2002-2012, increased in 2013, and remained stable through 2017 with a modest increase in 2018. Authorized end-strengths for FY2018 and FY2019 are shown in Figure 1. The FY2019 budget proposed increases in end-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force compared to FY2018. The enacted bill approved end-strengths identical to the Administration's request and adjusted minimum end-strengths required by law. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 16 years. The Selected Reserves' end-strength has decreased by 6% over 16 years, mainly due to reductions in Navy Reserve. FY2019 budget proposed increases for Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard. Enacted bill approved end-strengths identical to the Administration's request. The Department of Defense operates a health care delivery system serving 9.4 million beneficiaries through military treatment facilities and TRICARE. TRICARE is administered by the Defense Health Agency, while MTFs are administered by service surgeon generals. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) operates six MTFs in the Washington DC area and aims to streamline the MHS structure for improved medical readiness. The FY2017 NDAA directed reforms to transfer MTF administration to the DHA and reorganize internal structures by October 1, 2018. Service Surgeons General will become principal advisors to their respective services and chief medical advisors to the DHA. The DHA submitted its final implementation plan to Congress in June 2018, detailing reforms to standardize care delivery across the MHS with less overhead. DOD included recommendations for legislative actions to assist with implementation, such as a phased-in approach for 10 U.S.C. \u00a71073c and authority for the Secretary of Defense to waive specific requirements if needed. Section 711 of the enacted bill incorporates DOD's recommendation for a three-year phased-in approach to implementing 10 U.S.C. \u00a71073c. The DHA Director will take over MTF administration by September 30, 2021. Section 711 of the bill outlines requirements for MTF closures, research, public health, education, and a feasibility study for a Defense Health Command. Section 712 directs the DHA Director to implement an organizational framework by October 1, 2018 to enhance DOD health benefits and military medical capabilities integration. The DHA Director will take over MTF administration by September 30, 2021. Section 712 of the bill maximizes interoperability of military medical capabilities and integrates them to support combatant commander requirements. It also establishes four defense health regions and assigns new responsibilities to service surgeons general. According to Arlington National Cemetery news, the cemetery will run out of space for future burials in about 25 years. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, submitted a report to Congress on Arlington National Cemetery's capacity. The report identified current status and future options, including restricting eligibility and expanding the cemetery's footprint. A survey conducted in July 2017 found that 94% of respondents want the cemetery to remain active, with nearly 50% supporting expansion with modified eligibility criteria. The Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery (ACANC) is expected to make recommendations on future eligibility criteria, capacity issues, and expansion plans in the committee's annual report to the Secretary of the Army. Section 582 of the enacted bill requires the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to prescribe revised criteria for interment at ANC to preserve Arlington Cemetery. The SECDEF is required to establish revised criteria for interment at ANC by September 30, 2019 to preserve Arlington Cemetery as an active burial ground. A report for Congress on unmanned aircraft in Arlington National Cemetery is required to prevent flights over the cemetery and restrict flights during funeral services, due within 90 days of the Act's enactment. Section 2852 of the enacted bill commemorates the southern expansion of Arlington Cemetery by granting a permanent easement of 0.1 acres for Freedman's Village and Gate. If the property is acquired for burial purposes, the Army will relocate the commemoration. The bill also increases the authorization to $60 million for Arlington extension projects. The bill adopts Senate Section 4601, authorizing $30 million for ANC military construction in FY2019. Congress has been focused on improving the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) system, with recent reform proposals aiming to reduce DeCA's reliance on appropriated funds while maintaining patron benefits. Studies have explored the option of consolidating commissaries and military exchanges, with a recommendation in 2015 to create the Defense Resale Activity (DeRA) by merging the systems. In FY2018 NDAA, Congress authorized $1.4 billion for commissary operations and $40 million for a new commissary in Stuttgart, Germany. The President's FY2019 budget requested $1.3 billion for DeCA to operate 237 commissaries worldwide with over 14,000 civilian FTE employees. Section 579 of the bill requires the SECDEF to make changes to the Defense Resale Activity. Section 579 of the enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility of allowing small business activities for military spouses on military installations in the US, including partnerships with commissaries and other facilities. The report will consider usage of installation resources and seek to minimize costs for military spouses. The report due by March 1, 2019, will extend certain MWR and commissary privileges to eligible veterans and their caregivers, including Purple Heart recipients, veterans with disabilities, former POWs, and caregivers. A fee determined by the SECDEF will offset expenses related to credit/debit card purchases for these individuals. The provision regarding expenses related to card network use and transaction processing fees will take effect on January 1, 2020, after a briefing by the SECDEF to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. Section 627 of the bill requires a study by the SECDEF to determine the feasibility of consolidating military commissaries under DeCA and NAF exchange entities into a single defense resale system, with a report due by January 1, 2019. The SECDEF is tasked with studying the consolidation of military commissaries under a single defense resale system, including costs, technology merger, best practices for cost reduction, timeline for conversion, business case analysis, recommendations for legislation, and any other necessary elements. $1,266,200,000 is authorized for commissary operations in FY2019. The enacted bill authorizes $1,266,200,000 for commissary operations in FY2019. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) within DOD addresses domestic abuse and child abuse in military families, providing an annual report to Congress. Approximately half of military servicemembers are married, with 1.6 million dependent children across active and reserve components. In FY2017, the rate of child abuse or neglect in military homes was 13.7 per. In FY2017, child abuse or neglect in military homes decreased to 13.7 per 1,000 children from the previous year's rate of 14.4. There were 17 child abuse-related fatalities, with 65% being 1 year old or younger. Spousal abuse rate in FY2017 was 24.5 per 1,000 military couples, up from FY2016's rate of 23.4. DOD collected data on intimate partner abuse since FY2006, with 916 incidents in FY2017 involving 756 victims and five fatalities. The FY2019 NDAA adds a punitive article to UCMJ for domestic violence. The FY2019 NDAA adds a punitive article to UCMJ for domestic violence, criminalizing certain acts against a spouse, intimate partner, or immediate family member. Provisions in the bill authorize victims of domestic violence to receive Special Victims' Counsel services and expedited transfer eligibility for servicemember victims. The SECDEF is required to standardize expedited transfer procedures for servicemembers who are victims of sexual assault or physical domestic violence. The bill does not expand SVC services to victims of other violent crimes. The FY2019 NDAA focuses on legal issues related to sexual assault. It includes provisions for victims of domestic violence to access SVC services and expedited transfer eligibility for servicemembers. Sections 534, 577, and 578 address the feasibility of expanding services, multidisciplinary teams for domestic violence and child abuse, and a pilot program for child abuse risk factors. Congressional concern over juvenile sex offense cases on military installations led to Section 1089 to improve the response to such cases. Section 1089 of the FY2019 NDAA aims to enhance the response to juvenile-on-juvenile problematic sexual behavior on military installations by establishing a formal policy and creating a confidential database. The Senate bill's Section 1035, which would have removed the military's exclusive jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by juveniles on military installations, was not adopted. However, concerns were raised about the lack of State or local criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed on portions of military installations with exclusive Federal jurisdiction, prompting the service secretaries to seek relinquishment of jurisdiction. The FY2019 NDAA requires service secretaries to relinquish jurisdiction over military installations within 15 months. U.S. citizens, noncitizen nationals, legal residents, and individuals from certain countries can enlist in the Armed Forces. The MAVNI program allows enlistment for those vital to national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) program allowed the recruitment of legally present aliens with vital skills. New security screening requirements were established in 2016, delaying basic training until individuals met specified protocols. The MAVNI program's future is uncertain as new requirements tighten enlistee skills and delay training until security protocols are met. The program may be reactivated at a later date, pending notification to Congress. The MAVNI program is seen as an important option for acquiring critical skills for military service. The program's future is uncertain due to new requirements tightening enlistee skills and delaying training until security protocols are met. It may be reactivated at a later date, pending notification to Congress. Between 2012 and 2018, DOD implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to sexual assault prevention and response. In FY2016, estimated sexual assault prevalence rates in the DOD's active duty population were 4.3% for women and 0.6% for men, slightly lower than in 2014. Section 546 of the FY2015 NDAA called for the establishment of a Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces. The Defense Advisory Committee on Investigation, Prosecution, and Defense of Sexual Assault in the Armed Forces (DAC-IPAD) reviews cases of sexual misconduct in the military. The committee found that expedited transfer policies only apply to active duty victims in the SAPR program, excluding FAP victims. The enacted bill requires DOD to standardize policies related to expedited transfers. The enacted bill requires DOD to modify policies related to expedited transfers for all sexual assault victims, including extending the transfer policy to a servicemember's dependent who is a victim. The bill also directs DOD to study the feasibility of allowing cadets and midshipmen who are victims of sexual assault to transfer to another service academy. The Administration objected to a provision in the Senate bill that would have authorized military judges to issue and enforce domestic protective orders. The enacted bill requires DOD to report on collateral misconduct of sexual assault victims, which can hinder reporting due to fear of punishment for other offenses. Psychological trauma from sexual assault can lead to negative behavioral changes in victims. The Department of Veterans Affairs defines psychological trauma related to sexual assault as military sexual trauma (MST). DOD's policies recognize trauma from sexual assault as trauma-informed care. The enacted bill requires DOD to carry out a pilot program for servicemembers with PTSD from military sexual trauma, impacting discharge and veterans' benefits eligibility. The enacted bill addresses military sexual trauma (MST) and its impact on servicemembers' discharge and veterans' benefits eligibility. It includes provisions for appealing decisions through Discharge Review Boards, recommendations for legal actions following a sexual assault investigation, and requirements for reporting the final disposition of sexual assault cases. The enacted bill focuses on improving compliance with sex offender reporting requirements within the DOD and expediting security clearance reinvestigations for certain personnel convicted of sexual offenses. Mandatory penalties for sex-related offenses were not included in the bill. Veterans' Benefits: The Impact of Military Discharges on Basic Eligibility, by Umar Moulta-Ali and Sidath Viranga Panangala. Congressional interest in military pay raise and recruitment of high-quality personnel. Section 1009 of Title 37 provides formula for annual increase in basic pay indexed to ECI. Basic pay increase for 2019 set at 2.6% unless Congress or President intervenes. The FY2019 President's Budget requested a 2.6% military pay raise, which was enacted without any changes, maintaining the automatic adjustment of 37 U.S.C. \u00a71009. This increase in basic pay is effective at the start of the calendar year and is consistent with the Economic Cost Index. Since 1998, DOD and VA have worked to improve interoperability of electronic health records, a historical barrier to care access. Congress is interested in their efforts to develop a joint EHR, as directed in the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act. The DOD and VA aimed to improve health care information exchange by creating an interagency program office. The Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) was developed for data sharing between legacy systems. Plans for a new integrated EHR by 2017 were abandoned in 2013 in favor of separate systems meeting interoperability requirements. On August 25, 2014, DOD issued a request for proposals for a new EHR to replace its legacy systems. In July 2015, DOD awarded a $4.3 billion EHR contract, known as MHS Genesis, to the Leidos Partnership for Defense Health (LPDH). VA later decided to adopt the same EHR platform and awarded a $10 billion contract to Cerner. The Coast Guard also joined the contract, increasing the award ceiling to $5.5 billion. Deployment of MHS Genesis at all military treatment facilities (MTFs) is planned by 2022. The VA plans to implement MHS Genesis at three operational sites by 2020, with deployment at all military treatment facilities (MTFs) by 2022. DOD is directed to report on corrective actions taken before expanding MHS Genesis. Congressional oversight may be necessary as DOD, VA, and the Coast Guard implement the new EHR system. In 2017, incidents involving Navy ships in the Western Pacific led to serious damage and the deaths of 17 sailors, prompting a Congressional inquiry. The FY2019 NDAA includes provisions to address issues in the Surface Warfare community, such as fleet readiness and training gaps for junior surface warfare officers. Section 334 of the bill seeks to improve training and qualification standards for Navy watchstanders. Section 334 of the FY2019 NDAA aims to enhance training and qualification standards for Navy watchstanders, aligning them with international standards. It also calls for a report to Congress on the training curriculum for surface warfare watchstanders. The Senate Armed Services Committee report highlights concerns about the lack of at-sea training for surface warfare officer candidates before they report to their first ships. The Senate Armed Services Committee report raises concerns about gaps in foundational safety, seamanship, and navigation knowledge for surface warfare officers due to lack of at-sea training before reporting to their first ships. The report directs the Secretary of the Navy to review training methods, consider using yard patrol craft for training, and submit a report to Congress by October 1, 2018. Additionally, the Navy is required to maintain a career record of watchstanding hours, a practice currently done for military pilots but not for surface warfare watchstanders. The U.S. surface warfare community is debating whether to establish two career paths for SWOs: ship engineering systems and ship operations/combat systems. The Administration opposes this, stating it could limit core skill mastery. The enacted bill does not mandate separate paths but requires a review by GAO. Concerns include high shipboard workload leading to human error from fatigue. The Navy's process for determining manpower requirements does not fully account for ship workload, leading to a risk of human error due to fatigue. The Navy needs to update its manpower factors and reassess workload to ensure crews can maintain readiness and prevent safety issues. The enacted bill requires the Navy to ensure manning levels on forward deployed ships are consistent with ship class requirements. Congress is notified when manning levels on a covered ship drop below 90% for manning fill and 87% for manning fit. Congress is interested in federal efforts to address substance abuse, especially in the opioid crisis. Data shows lower substance abuse rates among military personnel compared to the general population, with a decline in new diagnoses since 2009. Opioid prescriptions are higher for servicemembers than the general population. Opioid medications are prescribed at a higher rate for servicemembers than the general U.S. population, possibly due to deployment-related effects. However, the incidence rate for dependence or abuse among servicemembers decreased by 38% between 2012 and 2016. The opioid death rate among servicemembers is significantly lower than the U.S. population. The Department of Defense attributes these trends to its education, prevention, and treatment programs. The DOD operates a prescription drug monitoring program to identify at-risk beneficiaries and restrict multiple opioid prescriptions. Data exchange between TRICARE contractors and military facilities is not shared with state authorities. The enacted bill directs DOD to establish a Military Health System Prescription Drug Monitoring Program for sharing patient-specific information with state prescription drug monitoring programs. It also implements an opioid safety pilot program for a maximum of three years to address opioid safety concerns. The enacted bill directs DOD to establish a Military Health System Prescription Drug Monitoring Program for sharing patient-specific information with state prescription drug monitoring programs and implements an opioid safety pilot program for up to three years. Congress is considering various legislative proposals to address the opioid crisis, focusing on authorities, programs, and services from different departments, but not explicitly addressing opioid abuse within DOD. Approximately 200,000 servicemembers are discharged from the Armed Forces every year, including enlistees completing their first term, mid-career members, retirees, and those with medical disabilities. Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds to support programs helping servicemembers transition to civilian life with counseling and resources. Veterans make up about 6% of the civilian labor force. Transitioning servicemembers are provided with counseling, resources, and tools to access veteran benefits and utilize their skills for post-service education and employment opportunities. DOD programs like TAP, COOL, and Skillbridge assist in this transition. Congressional concerns about servicemembers transitioning to civilian employment are addressed through various provisions to enhance transition services and education support. The enacted bill extends Military OneSource services for one year post-separation. Various provisions aim to improve outreach to separated veterans, but some were not adopted. A GAO report in November 2017 highlighted gaps in services for veterans. The GAO report from November 2017 revealed that less than half of eligible servicemembers completed TAP before the 90-day deadline. The SASC expressed concerns about low participation in optional workshops and recommended mandating attendance. The enacted bill now requires TAP counseling to start 365 days before transition, with tailored pathways for different member groups. The enacted bill mandates tailored pathways for different member groups in the TAP program, removes restrictions on credentials earned under military training authority, and requires reports on implementation. The American Council on Education (ACE) provides credit recommendations for military courses and occupations. The COOL program translates military experience to civilian credentials. Spouses of servicemembers can participate in certain elements of TAP. A pilot program for spouse participation in TAP was not adopted. DOD would have been required to provide members with certain benefits. The House bill did not adopt a provision requiring DOD to provide information about apprenticeship programs during pre-separation counseling. However, conferees emphasized the value of apprenticeships for separating servicemembers and urged DOD to make information on apprenticeship programs easily accessible. Employment for Veterans: Trends and Programs, coordinated by Benjamin Collins, discusses the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for military retirees, which provides a monthly benefit to surviving spouses. The SBP payment is usually 55% of the retired base pay, but may be reduced for spouses receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) offsets SBP payments reduced by DIC. SSIA payments are capped at $310, taxable, and adjusted for inflation. FY2018 NDAA made permanent the SSIA authority and ensured equitable treatment under SBP for members under the modernized retirement system. Technical corrections in calculation are proposed in the Senate bill. The Senate bill proposes technical corrections in the calculation and publication of Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) cost of living adjustments. The House provision expressing a sense of Congress to eliminate the widows' tax was not included in the enacted bill. Another House provision not adopted was allowing terminally ill participants to designate a new beneficiary under 10 U.S.C. \u00a71448(b)(1). TRICARE is a DOD-administered health insurance program for servicemembers, retirees, family members, and survivors. The effective date of election is the first day of the following month. References to related CRS reports are provided. TRICARE offers different plan options for DOD beneficiaries based on their status and location, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Congress has enacted legislation since 1966 to provide robust healthcare benefits, with TRICARE accounting for 52% of the total cost of care in the military health system. Recent reforms include new plans with an annual enrollment period and updated benefit structures. The enacted bill focuses on administration and delivery of health benefits under TRICARE, including changes to the dental benefit, increased pharmacy co-pays, and assessment of the Defense Health Agency's oversight during TRICARE contract transitions. No cost-share reforms were included in the FY2019 Budget request. Section 713 and 734 of the enacted bill address the administration of TRICARE dental benefits and a study on beneficiaries' participation in Medicare Part B. The changes will be effective for future TRICARE contract transitions, with the dental benefit administered through FEDVIP starting January 1, 2022."
