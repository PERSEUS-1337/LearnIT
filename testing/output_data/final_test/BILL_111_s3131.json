    "content": "The Act titled \"Hudson River Valley Special Resource Study Act\" defines the study area as the portion of the Hudson River from Rodgers Island to the southern boundary of Westchester County, New York. The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the \"Secretary\" in this Act. The Hudson River Valley is rich in cultural, historical, natural, recreational, and scenic resources. It is home to rare animal species, habitats, and plants, as well as various trail systems connected by the Walkway Over the Hudson bridge. The Hudson River Valley has a rich history, from Native American communities to important events like Henry Hudson's voyage and the Industrial Revolution. It also birthed movements in American art, architecture, and literature through influential figures like Andrew Jackson Downing and Thomas Cole. The Hudson River Valley, with its renowned scenery and natural resources, played a central role in shaping American art, literature, and environmental ideals. It has been the subject of various inventories and studies, including a 1996 National Park Service study that called it \"the landscape that defined America.\" SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF STUDY. The Secretary will conduct a study of the Hudson River Valley in New York to assess its national significance and potential designation as a National Park unit. The study will follow specific guidelines and criteria outlined in relevant laws and focus on park unit and landscape protection models. The protection models for National Park units encompass large non-Federal lands, promote public-private collaborations, and respect private landowners' rights. The Secretary must submit a report to the Senate and House committees within 24 months of funds being available, detailing the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the authorized study."
