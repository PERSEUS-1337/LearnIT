The QIZ program, part of the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement, aims to strengthen the Middle East peace process and boost the economies of Jordan and Egypt. The program has been in place for 15 years, with potential benefits for both political and economic transitions in the region. The Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) program, created by the 1996 West Bank and Gaza Strip Free Trade Benefits Act, allows certain goods to enter the U.S. duty-free if produced in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or co-produced in export processing zones with Israel, Jordan, or Egypt. Congress established the program to support the Middle East peace process and end the Arab economic boycott of Israel. Jordan and Egypt were the only Arab countries in the region with peace treaties with Israel. The Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) program was created to stimulate economies and increase employment in the Middle East and promote joint production between Israel and other countries. The events of September 11, 2001, led to broader U.S.-Middle East trade initiatives to assist the region. The Bush Administration initiated the Middle East Free Trade Areas (MEFTA) in 2003, resulting in trade agreements with Morocco, Bahrain, and Oman by 2013. President Obama's MENA-TIP in 2011 aimed to promote trade liberalization and democracy in the region, noting the potential for non-oil exports. Many MENA countries lack free trade agreements with the U.S. and rely on the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for trade benefits. The GSP program is the main trade preference option for many countries, but for MENA countries, the QIZ program offers more benefits. The QIZ program allows for duty-free eligibility on high-tariff products, co-production to meet content requirements, and U.S. content contribution. In 2013, the USTR expanded the QIZ program in Egypt, adding new zones and increasing the number of QIZs to six. The QIZ program in Egypt has been expanded, raising the total number of QIZs to six. Some QIZs in Jordan are not currently exporting under the program but still produce goods for export to the United States. The program allows for duty-free benefits to the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and certain goods co-produced by Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt in export processing zones. Production requirements mandate that products must be grown, produced, or manufactured in the designated areas, with specific country input share requirements to qualify for tariff-free benefits in the United States. Under the QIZ program, U.S. components may contribute up to 15%, with inputs from Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt totaling 20%. Jordan and Israel split the 20% input requirement, with Jordan at 11.7% and Israel at 8%. Egypt and Israel split the requirement equally at 10.5% each. Jordan embraced the program in 1997, opening its first QIZ. Jordan embraced the QIZ program in 1997, opening its first zone. The program led to a significant boost in Jordan's economy, attracting foreign investment, particularly from Asian countries like India. The QIZs allowed for duty-free access to the U.S. market, making Jordan a competitive destination for apparel exports. Between 1996 and 2006, Jordan's QIZ exports and total exports to the United States grew significantly. The top countries investing in Jordan's QIZs were India (22%), other Asian countries (40%), Jordan (17%), and the United States (3%), accounting for 82% of total investment. U.S. QIZ imports from Jordan rose from $0 to $1 billion, boosting Jordan's GDP mainly through textile and apparel exports. Jordan's QIZ exports to the United States grew significantly between 1996 and 2006, mainly through textile and apparel exports. Despite initial success, concerns arose about the sustainability of Jordan's QIZ growth due to limited diversification, technology absorption, and domestic linkages. Production demands strained Jordan's resources, and profits from exports were not effectively reinvested back into the country. In 2001, the United States and Jordan negotiated a free trade agreement, replacing the QIZ program. Jordan no longer needed to co-produce with Israel for tariff elimination but had to meet a higher content requirement. Jordan's QIZ exports peaked in 2006 at $1,022 million before declining. U.S. exports to Jordan increased to $1,712 million in 2012, including cereals, motor vehicles, machinery, arms, and aircraft. Jordan's exports remained diversified, including cereals, motor vehicles, machinery, arms, ammunition, aircraft, and military equipment. While its participation in the QIZ program phased out, exports to the rest of the world continued to grow, reaching $8 billion in 2011. Jordan expanded its use of existing zones to produce for other countries and focused on utilizing its natural resources for trade. Top world trading partners include Iraq, the United States, Saudi Arabia, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Jordan's exports to the world are more diversified than those to the United States, with top exports being fertilizer, apparel, mined cement components, and pharmaceuticals. Between 2002 and 2011, Jordan's exports to the world averaged 31% of its GDP, with exports to the United States averaging 6% and QIZ exports to the United States averaging 3%. The QIZ program was a significant driver of growth for both exports and GDP, contributing to roughly 30% of Jordan's GDP growth during the years of 2001-2004. Total Jordanian exports to the United States contributed 43% of Jordanian GDP growth at their peak in 2003. The United States contributed 43% of Jordanian GDP growth at their peak in 2003. Asian investment in Jordan's QIZs led to an influx of foreign workers due to a lack of skilled domestic laborers and reluctance of Jordanian workers. Women in Jordan were not actively participating in the labor force, partly due to cultural reasons. The QIZs faced challenges such as difficult working conditions, low wages, and labor issues. The 2001 U.S.-Jordan FTA was being considered by Congress, with concerns raised about labor conditions in Jordan despite its strong labor protections. To address these concerns, the U.S. and Jordanian governments agreed to resolve disputes without trade sanctions. Issues with labor conditions in QIZ factories were highlighted in a 2006 report, revealing that some conditions did not meet Jordan's labor laws and ILO standards. Exceptions were reportedly made to attract investment. The U.S. and Jordan addressed labor issues in QIZs through conversations and joint efforts with various organizations and apparel companies. A 2006 report highlighted sub-standard labor conditions in QIZ factories, leading to the development of an Action Plan based on ILO guidelines. The 2006 U.S.-Jordan FTA Labor Subcommittee played a key role in implementing changes. The 2006 U.S.-Jordan FTA Labor Subcommittee led initiatives to improve labor conditions in Jordan, including funding the ILO/World Bank \"Better Work\" program. A new initiative in 2013 aimed at promoting labor rights and improving working conditions. The QIZ program initially boosted the Jordanian economy but employed more foreign workers than Jordanians, providing new opportunities for women. The QIZ program in Jordan led to the growth of local services in various sectors, supporting exports. Despite decreasing in importance after the FTA with the US, Jordan's trade capacity increased. Egypt's QIZ program, starting slowly, grew significantly, driven by its strong textile exports and a large economy. Egypt joined the program in 2004, influenced by Jordan's economic growth and WTO agreements. Egypt joined the QIZ program in 2004 due to the expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in 2005. This led to the shift of apparel exports to QIZ tariff-free status and the creation of new exports. In 2013, the USTR expanded the QIZ program to include two new areas in Upper Egypt and all production facilities in the six QIZs. Egypt's QIZ program, established in 2004 after the expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, includes all production facilities in six QIZs. Foreign investment played a significant role in Jordan's QIZ export growth, while Egypt's textile sector is mainly Egyptian-owned. Investors shifting focus to Egypt from Jordan led to concerns about competitiveness, labor shortages, and audits. Egypt topped the list of locations investors were considering for new investment in its apparel sector due to its strong industrial base, experience in textiles, and vertical integration. Despite improvements in its rank among U.S. trading partners, unrest and uncertain events have dampened demand for U.S. exports from Egypt. Total imports from Egypt to the U.S. grew from $2 billion between 2005 and 2012. Between 2005 and 2012, U.S. total imports from Egypt increased from $2 billion to $3 billion, with QIZ imports quadrupling to about $1 billion. U.S. exports to Egypt rose to nearly $7 billion in 2010 before dropping to $5.5 billion in 2012. By 2012, U.S. QIZ imports accounted for half of total imports from Egypt. Egypt's key exports to the U.S. include apparel, while mineral fuels, chemicals, and fertilizers are also significant. In 2012, Egypt's total exports to the world reached $32 billion, with apparel ranking as the eighth-most important export. U.S. exports to Egypt are diverse. Between 2005 and 2011, Egypt's exports to the world averaged 13% of its GDP, with U.S. exports accounting for 1% and QIZ exports at 0.5%. The QIZ program's economic impact on Egypt shows that in 2005 and 2006, QIZ exports to the U.S. contributed 2% to GDP growth. Egypt's GDP growth in 2005 was 7%, with total exports to the United States contributing 7% to GDP growth. Unlike Jordan, Egypt has fewer labor issues in its industries due to a skilled and self-sufficient workforce. Foreign guest workers make up less than 10% of the total workforce in Egyptian firms, compared to nearly 80% in Jordan's garment export factories. The Ministry of Manpower and Migration in Egypt enacted regulations in 2011 to limit foreign access to worker visas, with only jobs requiring skills not available among Egyptians open to foreigners. The impact of the QIZ program on Egypt's economy has been minimal, with QIZ exports to the US accounting for less than 3.5% of total exports and less than 1% of GDP. Congressional interest in the program may address its effectiveness for economic development and potential expansion or contraction. The curr_chunk discusses potential changes to the QIZ program, including eligibility criteria, co-production arrangements, and the establishment of a regional trade preference program. It also mentions the limited export program in the West Bank/Gaza Strip under the QIZ amendment. Exports from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the United States under the QIZ program have specific material origin requirements. The exports peaked at $8 million in 2008, while U.S. exports to the territories peaked at $18 million in 2007. The products exported have diversified over the years, with varying compositions depending on the needs of the territories. In 2011, both mechanical and electrical machinery were exported from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the United States under the QIZ program."
