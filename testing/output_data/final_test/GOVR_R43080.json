The Administration also requested $85.0 million to expand the Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) with three elements. The proposed Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) aims to provide technical assistance to state, local, and tribal governments to analyze data on their criminal justice systems, reduce costs, improve public safety, and help ex-offenders reenter society. Funding would be used for implementation and incentive grants for states adopting policy changes based on data analyses and recommendations. 17 states are currently engaged in the JRI program. The Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) is a public/private partnership involving OJP's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Pew Center on the States, the Vera Institute of Justice, and the Council of State Governments Justice Center. Several states are receiving assistance with data analysis, policy recommendations, and funding for criminal justice reform. The House committee-reported bill allocated $25.0 million for JRI, while the Senate committee-reported bill allocated $30.0 million. The Administration requested $50.0 million for the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) to enhance the accessibility of criminal records for law enforcement purposes. These records are crucial for criminal investigations, background checks, and identifying individuals involved in stalking or domestic violence. The Administration requested $5.0 million for National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP) grants to improve background checks and prevent unauthorized individuals from purchasing firearms. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed consolidating NCHIP and NARIP under a new \"National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Initiative grants\" program with a budget of $55.0 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for NCHIP and $12.0 million for NARIP. Congress ultimately allocated $58.5 million for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Initiative grants. The Congress allocated $58.5 million for National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Initiative grants, with $12.0 million designated for states meeting NARIP requirements. The NCHIP and NARIP programs were consolidated under the new NICS Initiative. The Administration did not request funding for a tribal assistance grant program for FY2014, but proposed setting aside 7% of funds for tribal justice assistance. The Senate committee bill allowed OJP to set aside up to 5% of funds for grant programs. The House committee recommended $30.0 million for tribal assistance under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. Congress provided $30.0 million for tribal assistance in FY2014. The Juvenile Justice Programs account includes funding to reduce juvenile delinquency and improve juvenile justice systems. Congress allocated $261.0 million for juvenile justice programs in FY2013. The Administration's FY2014 request included $332.5 million for juvenile justice programs, with additional funding for existing and new initiatives. This includes the Juvenile Justice Education Collaboration Assistance (JJECA) initiative for evidence-based practices in school environments and a grant for gender-specific needs of girls in the juvenile justice system. The request also proposed a Juvenile Justice Realignment Incentive Grants program for competitive grants to states. The FY2014 request included funding for a Juvenile Justice Realignment Incentive Grants program and a web portal for children of incarcerated parents. The House Committee recommended $196.0 million for Juvenile Justice Programs, while the Senate committee-reported bill proposed $279.0 million. P.L. 113-76 allocated $254.5 million for Juvenile Justice Programs, eliminating funding for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program. The act did not provide funding for the proposed Juvenile Justice Realignment Incentive Grants program but included funding for competitive grants. The Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) program provides funding for death, disability, and education benefits to public safety officers and their survivors. The FY2013 appropriation for PSOB was $77.9 million, with a requested increase to $97.3 million for FY2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 included $97.3 million for PSOB to support law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 allocated $97.3 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, which funds hiring and training of law enforcement officers, new crime-fighting technologies, and innovative policing strategies. The Administration requested $439.5 million for FY2014, but Congress provided $214.0 million. Additionally, the proposed comprehensive schools safety program under COPS requested $150.0 million. The proposed comprehensive schools safety program aims to fund hiring school safety personnel, purchasing safety equipment, developing public safety plans, conducting threat assessments, and training crisis intervention teams. The program requires collaboration between law enforcement, mental health, and education disciplines to enhance school safety efforts. The House committee-reported bill includes $75.0 million for this program. The bill includes $75.0 million for a school safety program funded through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant. The program aims to research school violence, develop safety technologies, and provide pilot grants for innovative approaches to enhance school safety nationwide. The Crime Victims Fund (CVF) was established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 to provide funding for victim compensation and assistance programs. It is largely funded by criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys' Offices, U.S. courts, and the BOP. The obligation limit for the CVF was set at $730.0 million for FY2013 and $800.0 million for FY2014, with $45.0 million designated for the Vision 21 Initiative. The Administration allocated $45.0 million for the Vision 21 Initiative and $10.0 million for Victims of Trafficking Grants.
