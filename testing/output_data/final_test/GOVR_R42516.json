    "content": "The debates and discussions among U.S. government officials and outside stakeholders about the use of partnership in support of national security are inchoate, but key facets include worldview, goals, effects, priorities, resourcing, assessments, roles, responsibilities, and risk. Recent strategic guidance documents such as the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report, 2010 National Security Strategy (NSS), 2010 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), and 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) address these issues. Internal DOD guidance like the Guidance for the Employment of the Force (GEF) also covers partnership. The treatment of \"partnership\" in strategic guidance documents is inconsistent and partial, with some facets like resourcing barely addressed. A state's national security strategy is influenced by its worldview and shapes its definition of national interests. These starting points impact desired effects, prioritization of efforts, and assessment of results in partnership strategy. The 2006 QDR emphasized the importance of partnership in response to new global threats like terrorism and contingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It outlined a causal logic where the US would help build partners' capabilities for them to employ effectively. The 2010 QDR and NSS continued to emphasize the importance of partnership in global security, with a focus on collective action and common interests. The approach shifted towards viewing partnership as a default way of doing business, rather than a rationale-driven strategy. The 2010 NSS and 2012 DSG highlight the importance of partnership in global security, emphasizing the role of shared norms in shaping international outcomes. The DSG reflects a shift towards partnership as the default approach to security, moving away from prioritizing large-scale contingencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2010 NSS and 2012 DSG emphasize partnership in global security, moving away from focusing solely on counterterrorism. The DSG highlights the importance of partnership in addressing a broad range of security challenges and questions the role of U.S. leadership in partnership activities. The debates surrounding the use of partnership in national security strategy revolve around justifying its frictions and costs, the role of shared norms, and the extent of U.S. government influence. One argument is that partnership is essential due to the increasing complexity of global security challenges, while another suggests that it allows for cost savings as partners take on more responsibilities. These two perspectives are not mutually exclusive. Recent strategic guidance has emphasized the importance of building international partners' capabilities to address the broader array of security challenges in the 21st century, such as counter-terrorism requiring new, local approaches. The 2006 QDR highlighted the need for partnership efforts to meet these challenges. The 2006 BPC roadmap emphasized the necessity of partnership at home and abroad to achieve strategic objectives and combat terrorism. It also highlighted the potential for savings by building the capabilities of partner agencies and international partners. The 2010 QDR echoed these concerns and emphasized the importance of partnership in addressing a wide range of security challenges. The 2010 QDR and 2012 DSG emphasized the importance of partnership in addressing security challenges and sharing global leadership responsibilities to generate savings. Partnership is seen as a key tool to avert crises and mitigate risks in the context of constrained resources. Key questions revolve around the fundamental goals of partnership in supporting national security. The fundamental goal of partnership in support of national security is to save money and meet a greater array of global security challenges by working with partners. The appropriate balance between these goals drives decisions about prioritization and resourcing. Partnership can be used to enable partners to do specific things, provide better situational understanding, ensure U.S. access, and shape partners' perceptions and decision-making. Partnership activities aim at multiple effects such as building local goodwill, developing capabilities, fostering collaboration, and demonstrating commitment. Strategic logic linking interests to effects and activities is essential for prioritizing efforts and accountability. Recent guidance lacks clarity on this logic trail. The 2006 QDR and its BPC roadmap emphasized the importance of partnership in countering terrorism by improving governance, internal security, and the rule of law in partner countries to build legitimacy and prevent threats. The 2006 QDR emphasized the importance of partnership in countering terrorism by improving governance, internal security, and the rule of law in partner countries to prevent threats. The 2010 QDR echoed this rationale and ambition, aiming to strengthen local forces and civilian capacity to combat terrorism. The 2010 NSS emphasizes building the security capacity of partner states through whole-of-government partnership approaches to achieve various national security interests, including countering violent extremism and promoting economic growth. It broadens the scope of effects geographically with traditional allies and emerging centers of influence. The 2010 QDDR emphasizes broad partnerships with traditional allies, emerging centers of influence, and new partners to achieve various national security interests. The term \"partnership\" encompasses U.S. engagement with other states and multilateral organizations, focusing on security and capacity-building efforts. The 2010 QDDR emphasizes broad partnerships with traditional allies, emerging centers of influence, and new partners to achieve various national security interests, focusing on security and capacity-building efforts. The 2012 DSG provides less clarity on the specific desired ends of partnership compared to previous defense guidance documents, reflecting a broader-spectrum view of future security challenges and the importance of partnership activities such as rotational deployments of U.S. forces and training exercises. The 2012 DSG outlines potential benefits of partnership activities, such as access, deterrence, capacity-building, and strengthening alliances. However, it lacks clarity on how these activities specifically contribute to protecting U.S. interests and the strategic logic behind their effects. Key questions remain on how partnerships enhance U.S. national security and generate desired outcomes. Opportunities for partnership in support of national security are theoretically unbounded, so prioritization is essential to focus effort and conserve resources. Priorities might be based on geography, functional concerns like CT and countering weapons of mass destruction, or qualities of a potential partner. Partnership strategy should adjudicate and synchronize these concerns. The 2010 NSS and QDDR provide exhaustive lists of areas and arenas for partnership, but lack detailed guidance on prioritization. DOD's publicly available strategy documents do not prioritize partnership, focusing on the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions. Internal guidance on partnership within DOD is reportedly more detailed. DOD's internal guidance on partnership is evolving, with earlier emphasis on \"willing and capable\" partners. However, recent guidance acknowledges the importance of engaging with states that may not fully fit this criteria but are strategically significant. Prioritizing all willing and able partners may not always be the most effective approach in protecting U.S. interests. The evolving DOD guidance on partnership recognizes multiple rationales for engagement beyond \"willing and capable\" partners, leading to challenges in prioritization. Key questions include how to determine partnership priorities and reconcile concerns with specific regions, threats, and partner characteristics for a coherent approach. The partnership strategy should prioritize among different partners and outline investment curves and expected pay-offs over time. Strategic guidance often assumes partnership yields savings without demonstrating how. The 2006 BPC roadmap recognized various ways partnerships can lead to savings. The 2006 BPC roadmap went beyond other strategic guidance by acknowledging various ways partnerships can generate savings over time. It mandated DOD officials to consider the fiscal impact of partnerships in future deliberations. Key questions include how partnerships yield savings, when savings are reflected in budget requests, and how anticipated savings influence the prioritization of partnership activities. Congressional oversight of partnership efforts lacks a clear assessment model, hindering the evaluation of their impact on national security. Assessing partnership efforts requires a focus on effects rather than just outputs. Clear articulation of desired ends and a logic for assessing progress are essential. Partnership assessment is complex due to multiple simultaneous effects and partial achievements along a spectrum, rather than success or failure in binary terms. Strategic evaluation is crucial in gauging the impact of partnerships on protecting U.S. interests. Assessing partnership efforts requires clear articulation of desired ends and a logic for assessing progress. The 2006 BPC roadmap recognized the need to assess return on U.S. investment but did not outline how to do so. Key questions include how to best assess the effects of partnership efforts in protecting U.S. interests. Partnership efforts should be assessed for their impact on U.S. interests, with a focus on generating multiple effects and integrating diplomacy, development, and defense. Clear division of roles and responsibilities is essential for effective assessment. The 2010 NSS emphasizes the need for partnership and clear division of roles and responsibilities among departments to achieve integration of effort and whole-of-government approaches. Congressional oversight reinforces the clear division of labor, but specific agency roles and responsibilities are not assigned. The 2006 guidance documents at DOD emphasized the need for integration of effort and clarification of roles and responsibilities among stakeholders, including other U.S. agencies, NGOs, the private sector, and international partners. It called for the use of national security planning guidance to confirm priorities and assign roles. The 2010 QDR emphasized the importance of interagency integration for successful partnerships in national security efforts. It called for strengthening general purpose force capabilities for security force assistance, raising questions about the division of labor between general purpose forces and Special Operations Forces in partnership efforts. Key questions include establishing shared priorities and refining them for national security partnership efforts. The curr_chunk discusses the distribution of roles and responsibilities among U.S. government departments for partnership in national security. It raises questions about ensuring alignment with foreign policy goals, updating guidance, and integrating defined roles. Partnerships in national security require effective oversight by Congress to manage potential risks and rewards. Partners may become reliant on U.S. assistance, slow their growth, or use capabilities against U.S. policy objectives. Partnerships in national security require effective oversight by Congress to manage potential risks and rewards, such as ensuring partners do not misuse U.S. assistance or act against U.S. policy objectives. Key questions include safeguards for partners assuming responsibility, encouraging shared objectives, and mitigating risks through due diligence."
