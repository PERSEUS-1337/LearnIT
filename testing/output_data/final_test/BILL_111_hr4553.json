    "content": "The \"21st Century Buy American Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Grants will be provided to domestic manufacturers. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to establish a grant program for eligible U.S. manufacturers under specific criteria, including producing nonavailable items or being the last manufacturer in the country facing hardship. The grant program established by the Secretary of Commerce provides funding up to $5,000,000 for eligible U.S. manufacturers. Eligible entities can use the grant for increasing competitiveness for government contracts or production of nonavailable items. To receive a grant under this section, an eligible entity must meet certain criteria such as increasing production capacity for national security items, creating jobs, modernizing manufacturing facilities, or covering costs for adjustment assistance under the Trade Act of 1974. No funds can be used for profits of the eligible entity. An eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Commerce with specific information to receive a grant under this section. The application should include details on the expected creation or retention of domestic jobs. The Secretary evaluates grant recipients annually to determine fund allocation. The term \"nonavailable item\" refers to items deemed unavailable under the Buy American Act. The Buy American Act prohibits items that are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the US in sufficient quantities or quality, have been waived under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or are listed as nonavailable articles in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
