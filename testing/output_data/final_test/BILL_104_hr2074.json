The Sweetgrass Hills Protection Act of 1995 establishes the Sweetgrass Hills Natural Area within the Bureau of Land Management's Sweetgrass Hills Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Montana. The natural area includes lands, waters, and interests depicted on a specific map for conservation purposes. The Secretary of the Interior can make minor boundary revisions in the Sweetgrass Hills Natural Area to enhance management efficiency. The Secretary will administer the natural area in accordance with applicable laws and may use statutory authority for conservation purposes. Hunting and fishing will be permitted on the lands. Acquisition of lands will be carried out as needed. The Secretary is directed to acquire lands within the natural area for conservation purposes through donation, purchase, or exchange. Lands owned by the State of Montana can only be acquired by donation or exchange. Minerals and mining within the area are addressed in Section 5. After the enactment of this Act, lands within the natural area are withdrawn from mining claims, mineral leasing, geothermal leasing, and disposal of mineral materials. No patents will be issued after July 19, 1995, for any location or claim in the natural area under the mining laws of the United States. After the enactment of this Act, any party deprived of property rights may file a claim seeking compensation in the United States Claims Court within one year. The court has jurisdiction to render judgment according to section 1491 of title 28, United States Code. Federal lands within the Natural Area cannot be used for mining activities. Reclamation requirements must be met for any mining-related disturbances on lands or waters within the area. The Secretary will review the validity of all unpatented mining claims within the natural area within three years of the Act's enactment. If a claim is found invalid, it will be declared null and void. Authorization for appropriations is granted to carry out the purposes of this Act."
