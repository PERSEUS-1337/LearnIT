The Congress finds that the Government of Sudan's intensified war outside its control has resulted in over 2,000,000 deaths and 4,000,000 displaced. A comprehensive peace process, humanitarian relief, and U.S. leadership are crucial for a lasting resolution in Sudan. The absence of credible civil authority in Sudan hinders self-sustenance and peace progress. The government uses divide-and-conquer tactics through traditional rivalries, but international reconciliation efforts have helped reduce suffering. Militias are organized for raiding and enslaving in areas outside government control. The Government of Sudan disrupts populations in areas outside its control to avoid international accountability. It plans to use oil sales to escalate the war in these areas and manipulates food aid as a weapon to starve targeted groups. The Government of Sudan's actions, including genocide, are outside of international control. Efforts by the United States and other donors have helped address deficiencies in aid delivery, offsetting Sudan's manipulation of food donations in the civil war. While immediate needs in some areas have been met, populations in areas outside government control still face extreme disruption. The Nuba Mountains and other regions remain at risk. The Nuba Mountains, Bahr al Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions are excluded from relief distribution by OLS, increasing famine risk. International relief operations are costly and unsustainable, focusing only on immediate food needs. Populations in areas outside government control are vulnerable due to disengagement of front-line states. The United States should apply pressure. The United States should use various means of pressure to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war in Sudan, including multilateralizing economic and diplomatic tools, supporting democratic institutions in areas outside government control, promoting reconciliation mechanisms, strengthening humanitarian relief mechanisms, and cooperating with trading partners and multilateral institutions.
