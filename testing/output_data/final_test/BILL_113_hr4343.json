The United States Constitution vests legislative powers in Congress, executive power in the President, and judicial power in the Supreme Court and inferior courts established by Congress. The Constitution outlines these powers with precision. The United States Constitution allocates power to the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, ensuring that each branch is limited to its own powers and cannot encroach upon the powers of others. The increase in states, population, and wealth has created temptations for those in power to overstep their bounds. The United States Constitution divides power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to prevent overreach. However, there has been a trend of Congress creating administrative agencies with blended powers, violating the Constitution by delegating legislative, executive, and judicial authority to these agencies. Congress has departed from the separation of powers structure of the United States Constitution by delegating legislative, executive, and judicial powers to various administrative agencies, establishing a system of rules executed by the executive branch in violation of the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantee. The Constitution prohibits Congress from delegating legislative power to other branches or entities, including administrative agencies. Chief Justice Marshall emphasized that Congress cannot delegate strictly legislative powers. Chief Justice Fuller stated that a criminal offense created by an Executive Branch agency must be fully defined by Congress to be valid. The Constitution prohibits Congress from delegating legislative power to other branches or entities, including administrative agencies. Congress must enact statutes containing general rules to be executed by the President and adjudicated by the courts. By abdicating its legislative responsibility to unelected bureaucrats, Congress undermines constitutional protections of checks and balances and presidential veto power. Congress has abdicated its legislative power, leading to onerous burdens on the American people and violating the separation of powers. Chief Justice Roberts warns of the dangers of the growing administrative state with hundreds of federal agencies involved in daily life. SEC. 3. RESTORING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. The United States Code will be amended to include a new chapter titled \"SEPARATION OF POWERS\" which prohibits any delegation of legislative powers in bills passed by Congress to any branch of government or organization. This includes creating or clarifying criminal or civil offenses. The new chapter \"SEPARATION OF POWERS\" in the United States Code prohibits any delegation of legislative powers to the Executive Branch, except for specific circumstances like presidential proclamations or internal government regulations. Additionally, no new presidential directives, adjudicative decisions, rules, or regulations can be implemented within 90 days of this bill becoming law. The new chapter \"SEPARATION OF POWERS\" in the United States Code prohibits any delegation of legislative powers to the Executive Branch, except for specific circumstances like presidential proclamations or internal government regulations. No new presidential directives, adjudicative decisions, rules, or regulations can be implemented unless authorized by a bill compliant with Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution. The Comptroller General must report to Congress within six months to identify any statutes with prohibited delegation of legislative powers for potential repeal or amendment. The enforcement clause in the new chapter \"SEPARATION OF POWERS\" prohibits delegation of legislative powers to the Executive Branch, except for specific circumstances like presidential proclamations or internal government regulations. Title 1 of the United States Code is amended to include a new chapter 2B with an enforcement clause stating that no bill can become law without Congress meeting certain requirements. Individuals affected by noncompliant laws can use this as a defense in legal actions. Additionally, individuals aggrieved by actions of executive officers due to noncompliant statutes have a cause of action under specific sections of the United States Code. Title 1 of the United States Code is amended to include a new chapter 2B with an enforcement clause allowing individuals to challenge noncompliant laws in court. Sections 2201 and 2202, Title 28, United States Code, provide for judicial action against the United States to seek relief, including an injunction against enforcing noncompliant laws. The standard of review in such cases shall be de novo. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE. If any provision of this Act is held invalid in court, it does not affect other provisions that can still be enforced. The Act's provisions are declared severable."
