Nonrefundable credits cannot exceed tax liability, while refundable credits can result in a cash payment if they exceed tax liability. Refundable credits benefit low-income taxpayers. Examples include the earned income tax credit, additional child tax credit, American opportunity tax credit, and health coverage tax credit. The curr_chunk discusses various tax credits, including the health coverage tax credit, credit for tax withheld on wages, fuel excise taxes credit, and overpayment of tax credit. It also mentions the premium assistance credit under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Additionally, it notes expired refundable credits such as the first-time homebuyer credit and the Making Work Pay credit. The curr_chunk discusses refundable tax credits, including the EITC and ACTC, which subsidize low-wage work and help mitigate federal taxes for low-income workers. These credits are categorized based on earnings or expenditures, with the EITC and ACTC comprising the majority of refundable credits claimed in 2009. Refundable tax credits like the EITC and ACTC help low-income workers by reducing federal taxes, particularly payroll taxes. These credits can result in a net increase in income for extremely low-wage workers. For example, in 2011, a taxpayer with $20,000 in earnings and one child could receive a refund of $2,025 from these credits. In 2011, a taxpayer with $20,000 in earnings and one child could receive a refund of $2,025 from refundable tax credits like the EITC. Taxpayers making under approximately $26,000 see a net increase in income due to these credits, with the poverty level for an adult under 65 with one child being $15,504. The migration and family patterns of unauthorized aliens in the US impact their ability to claim refundable tax credits. Unauthorized resident aliens in the United States, including legal permanent residents and temporary nonimmigrants, violate the INA and are subject to removal. The estimated unauthorized alien population was 11.2 million in 2010, with a significant percentage residing in the US for over a decade. The Pew Hispanic Center's report highlights the long-term presence of unauthorized adults in the country. The Pew Hispanic Center's report shows that a significant portion of unauthorized aliens in the US have been residing in the country for 15 years or more, with 28% living for 10 to 14 years. The proportion of unauthorized aliens in the country for at least 15 years has doubled since 2000. These individuals are typically younger than the overall US population and more likely to be in child-bearing and child-rearing years, with 46% being parents of minor children. Around 9 million people were estimated to be in \"mixed-status\" families in 2010, including at least one unauthorized adult alien and one US-born child. The number of U.S.-citizen children with at least one unauthorized parent has more than doubled since 2000, totaling 4.5 million. The implications of these demographics for refundable tax credits add complexity to the debate on restricting such credits to those legally authorized to work in the United States. Steven Camarota's 2002 study highlighted that costs associated with unauthorized aliens are largely due to their American-born children who are granted U.S. citizenship at birth. Efforts to bar unauthorized aliens from federal programs may not reduce costs significantly as their citizen children can still access them. Unauthorized aliens who are head of household may or may not be allowed to receive federal benefits for their U.S. citizen children, depending on the program. \"Quasi-legal\" migrants, who have temporary employment authorization documents (EADs) issued by the Department of Homeland Security, fall into a complex category. These migrants can legally obtain Social Security cards and may have temporary relief from removal, such as Temporary Protected Status. The curr_chunk discusses unauthorized aliens in the United States who have sought asylum, have pending cases for at least 180 days, are immediate family or fianc\u00e9es of legal permanent residents, have overstayed nonimmigrant visas, and have petitions pending for adjustment of status. They have not been formally approved to stay permanently and may have obtained SSNs for temporary work authorization. Some may be part of mixed-status families with ITINs. The Internal Revenue Code does not have a special classification for these individuals. The Internal Revenue Code does not have a special classification for unauthorized aliens in the United States. They are classified as resident or nonresident aliens for tax purposes, depending on their status. Resident aliens are taxed like U.S. citizens, while nonresident aliens have special tax rules. Unauthorized aliens who meet the substantial presence test are classified as resident aliens, otherwise, they are nonresident aliens. This classification is only for tax purposes and does not affect their status. Nonresident aliens, including unauthorized aliens, are subject to federal taxes and need a taxpayer identification number, usually their Social Security number (SSN). SSNs may be issued to lawful permanent residents, authorized working aliens, and other aliens required by law to have one for certain benefits. In FY2011, the SSA issued 5.4 million new SSNs, with 1.3 million going to noncitizens allowed to work. In FY2011, the SSA issued 5.4 million new SSNs, with 1.3 million going to noncitizens allowed to work. Additionally, 28,622 SSNs were issued to legally present aliens not authorized to work. Unauthorized aliens used to obtain SSNs for nonwork purposes prior to 1996, but since then, the IRS issues ITINs to alien taxpayers ineligible for SSNs. The number of taxpayers filing with ITINs has increased over the past decade. The number of taxpayers filing with ITINs has significantly increased over the past decade, with a 246% rise from 530,000 in 2001 to over 1.8 million in 2007. This increase coincided with provisions in immigration reform bills requiring unauthorized aliens to demonstrate tax payment for earned legalization. The 2011 TIGTA audit showed a larger number of ITIN filers in 2007 compared to the 2009 audit, partly due to multiple claims for the Additional Child Tax Credit. In Processing Year 2010, around 238,000 ITIN filers submitted over 608,000 tax returns for multiple years simultaneously, claiming over a billion dollars in Additional Child Tax Credits (ACTC). Not all claims were refunded due to statute of limitations rules. Unauthorized aliens with valid SSNs from legal entry and work authorization may also be paying taxes. The Social Security Actuary estimates that 75% of unauthorized aliens working are paying Federal taxes. Security Actuary estimates that 75% of unauthorized aliens working are paying FICA tax using SSNs, raising questions about their eligibility for refundable tax credits under federal tax laws and PRWORA. The Internal Revenue Code imposes restrictions on these credits. The Internal Revenue Code restricts aliens from claiming certain refundable tax credits based on residency and SSN requirements. Only the EITC currently mandates SSNs for taxpayers, spouses, and qualifying children. Other expired credits had similar SSN requirements. The EITC, 2008 stimulus credit, and Making Work Pay credit require valid SSNs for claiming the credits, but do not specify the SSN's current validity. Some resident aliens may have lawfully obtained SSNs while authorized to be in the country, potentially allowing them to claim the credits. The 1996 welfare law established restrictions on noncitizens' eligibility for public assistance, with exceptions for legal permanent residents with a U.S. work history or military connection. Qualified aliens, refugees, and certain abused spouses and children are in a less restrictive category for benefit eligibility. The 1996 immigration law expanded eligibility for certain abused spouses and children, as well as Cuban-Haitian entrants, for asylum or related relief. Non-qualified aliens, including unauthorized aliens, nonimmigrants, short-term parolees, asylum applicants, and other temporary permission holders, are in a more restrictive category. Unauthorized aliens are generally barred from federal public benefits, except for emergency services and specific programs. The 1996 welfare act expanded eligibility for certain abused spouses and children, as well as Cuban-Haitian entrants, for asylum or related relief. Unauthorized aliens are generally barred from receiving many federal benefits, unless they fall within limited exceptions. The act also imposed an SSN requirement for claiming the EITC to prevent misuse. The IRS has not indicated that any refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits under PRWORA Section 401. There is a question about whether unauthorized aliens should be eligible to receive refundable credits without a statutory SSN requirement. If the IRS does not interpret Section 401 to apply to refundable tax credits, it is unlikely that this interpretation could be challenged in court. However, if the IRS were to deny a refundable tax credit to an unauthorized alien due to PRWORA Section 401, then that individual would theoretically have standing to challenge the decision in court. If an unauthorized alien is denied a refundable tax credit under PRWORA Section 401, they may have standing to challenge the decision in court based on how the IRS interpreted the statute. The level of deference given to the agency's interpretation of the statute can impact the outcome of the review. The Chevron deference standard determines the level of deference a court gives to an agency's interpretation of a statute. If Congress has directly addressed the issue, the court must follow the law. Otherwise, the court assesses if the agency's interpretation is permissible. The Chevron deference standard determines the level of deference a court gives to an agency's interpretation of a statute. If Congress has directly addressed the issue, the court must follow the law. The court will generally defer to the agency's position if it is a permissible construction of the statute, regardless of whether it is the only possible interpretation. Lower deference is given to less formal agency interpretations like revenue rulings, based on factors such as the agency's care, consistency, and persuasiveness of its position. Revenue rulings by the IRS are generally given deference, but a court can reject them if the reasoning is unpersuasive. Other IRS positions may receive even less deference. When determining if refundable tax credits are federal public benefits under PRWORA Section 401, a court would likely start by examining the statutory language. The Supreme Court follows the \"plain meaning rule,\" relying on the statutory text for interpretation without looking at legislative history. Section 401 defines \"federal public benefit\" to include various types of payments or benefits. The question at hand is whether refundable tax credits are considered a \"grant\" or \"benefit\" under Section 401 of PRWORA. Courts often rely on statutory language or accepted meanings in law when interpreting specific terms. The term \"grant\" or \"benefit\" described in Section 401 of PRWORA does not have a statutory definition or appear to be terms of art. Courts typically interpret words without specific definitions based on their ordinary meanings, often derived from the dictionary. It is unclear if refundable tax credits fall under the definition of \"grant\" or \"benefit\" in this context. The court may interpret terms like \"grant\" and \"benefit\" in Section 401 of PRWORA based on their ordinary definitions from sources like the Oxford Dictionaries. Refundable tax credits may not be considered federal public benefits under these definitions. The court may interpret terms like \"grant\" and \"benefit\" in Section 401 of PRWORA based on their ordinary definitions. Refundable tax credits, such as those in IRC Sections 31, 33, 34, and 37, may not be seen as federal public benefits as they are essentially tax refunds. The government's refusal to pay these refunds could raise constitutional issues under the Fifth Amendment. Refundable tax credits could be considered as a \"grant\" or \"benefit\" under Section 401 of PRWORA. Courts may classify them as such based on their refundable nature and criteria like being provided by a federal agency. They could also be seen as a type of listed benefit, like welfare or health benefits. This interpretation could be supported by case law examining refundable tax credits. Some courts have classified refundable tax credits as welfare-type benefits in case law. The EITC is seen as public assistance for state law purposes due to its refundable nature and focus on helping low-income families. However, the child tax credit may not qualify as it is not limited to assisting low-income families. Courts may reach different conclusions for each credit. It is possible that no refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits under Section 401, as the provision does not explicitly include them and there is no clear legislative intent for such treatment. Some argue that refundable tax credits should not be considered federal public benefits under Section 401 due to lack of explicit inclusion and legislative intent. PRWORA Section 432(a) supports this argument by not requiring consultation for tax credits when verifying immigration status for federal benefits. The lack of explicit inclusion and legislative intent suggests that refundable tax credits may not be considered federal public benefits under PRWORA Section 401. This is supported by the fact that consultation with the Treasury Department is not required for tax credits when verifying immigration status for federal benefits. Additionally, other congressional actions, such as the SSN requirement for certain tax credits, further indicate that Congress may not have intended refundable tax credits to fall under PRWORA Section 401. The legislative history of PRWORA does not clarify if refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits. Current law limits alien eligibility for various federal assistance programs, but is silent on alienage for certain programs like school lunch and nutrition. The legislative history of PRWORA does not clarify if refundable tax credits are considered federal public benefits. Congress was aware of the EITC's existence but did not offer solid evidence of intent to treat it as a federal public benefit. Section 451 of PRWORA aims to disallow the EITC for unauthorized resident aliens by requiring SSNs for claimants and their qualifying children. The legislative history of PRWORA does not clarify if refundable tax credits like the EITC are considered federal public benefits. Section 451 of PRWORA aims to disallow the EITC for unauthorized resident aliens by requiring SSNs for claimants and their qualifying children. Congress's intent regarding the EITC's eligibility for unauthorized aliens remains uncertain, with conflicting interpretations of Section 401 and Section 451. The legislative history's silence on this issue may limit its usefulness in legal interpretation, which now focuses more on the language of the statute itself. The modern view of statutory interpretation emphasizes the language of the statute over legislative history. It is unclear if refundable tax credits are federal public benefits under PRWORA Section 401. Unauthorized resident aliens face restrictions in claiming refundable credits due to SSN requirements. Unauthorized nonresident aliens are also prohibited from claiming certain credits in the IRC. Unauthorized nonresident aliens are prohibited from claiming certain tax credits in the IRC, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit. Policy options to address concerns with current law include amending the IRC to require SSNs for all filers claiming tax credits, not just refundable ones. Amending the IRC to address concerns with current law by requiring SSNs for all filers claiming tax credits, including both refundable and non-refundable components. This could impact families, especially mixed status families, and options include barring unauthorized aliens from claiming refundable credits or allowing mixed immigration status families to receive a prorated amount of credits based on legal authorization to reside and work in the US. Amending Section 401 of PRWORA to clarify that refundable tax credits are not \"federal public benefits\" and specifying eligibility criteria based on SSNs. Authorizing funds for cross-checking immigration status and tax returns to prevent unauthorized aliens from claiming credits they are not eligible for. The existing refundable tax credits serve different purposes and may need to be distinguished based on eligibility for unauthorized aliens. Refundable credits that are refunds of overpayment of taxes may raise constitutional concerns if denied. There are categories of noncitizens who may qualify as resident aliens for tax purposes. Nonimmigrants permitted to work in the US include E treaty traders, H temporary workers, NAFTA workers, F foreign students with permission, J and Q cultural exchange visitors, L intracompany transfers, K fianc\u00e9s of US citizens, O and P athletes/entertainers, R religious workers, T trafficking victims, U crime victims, and V family members waiting over three years. Spouses and children can accompany but usually cannot work. Social Security Numbers were issued to 1.3 million noncitizens in FY2011. In FY2011, 1.3 million original SSNs were issued to noncitizens, with a peak of 1.8 million in FY1996. The composition of noncitizens receiving SSNs has changed over time, with 49% in FY2011 having permanent work authorization compared to 12% in FY1992. In FY2011, the Social Security Administration issued 28,622 nonwork SSNs, showing a decline from previous years."
