Congress finds that the 1988 Reservation Addition to the Jicarilla Apache Reservation was purchased by the tribe and added to the reservation in 1988 by proclamation of the Secretary of the Interior. The Court of Appeals of the State of New Mexico is handling a lawsuit involving a county road passing through the 1988 Reservation Addition claimed to be established before the land was acquired by the Jicarilla Apache Nation in 1985. The parties, Jicarilla Apache Nation and County of Rio Arriba, have reached a Settlement Agreement approved by the Secretary of the Interior, requiring ratifying legislation by Congress to resolve all claims related to the disputed county road. The parties have agreed to resolve claims through the Settlement Agreement and implementing legislation. The Secretary must confirm specific events before Section 4 of the Act takes effect, including the abandonment of a disputed county road by Rio Arriba County and the execution of a quitclaim deed by the Jicarilla Apache Nation. If these conditions are met, the Secretary will publish the findings in the Federal Register. The Act ratifies and approves the Jicarilla Apache Nation's quitclaim deed for the Settlement Lands to Rio Arriba County, subject to conditions in section 3. The Secretary will issue a patent for the Settlement Lands to Rio Arriba County with perpetual restrictive covenants and exceptions. The Jicarilla Apache Nation's quitclaim deed for the Settlement Lands to Rio Arriba County is ratified and approved, with perpetual restrictive covenants and exceptions. Tract A on the Settlement Lands is designated for governmental purposes only, excluding use for prisons or jails. SEC. 5. BOUNDARY CHANGE. The lands conveyed to Rio Arriba County in the patent will no longer be part of the Jicarilla Apache Reservation, and the reservation's exterior boundary will be adjusted accordingly."
