    "content": "The \"Safe Air Travel for Animals Act\" includes provisions for defining transport, reporting incidents involving animals during air transport, and improving cargo hold conditions for animal health and safety. Civil penalties and compensation for loss, injury, or death of animals during air transport are also addressed in the Act. Congress acknowledges that animals are sentient beings capable of feeling pain and suffering, and it is inappropriate for them to be treated as baggage during air transport. Over 500,000 animals are transported by air annually, with up to 5,000 experiencing loss, injury, or death. Mishandling by baggage personnel, temperature fluctuations, and lack of oxygen in cargo holds contribute to most injuries. Airlines are not required to report incidents involving animals, leaving the public unaware of safety records for transporting animals.
