    "content": "When legislation is introduced in the House or received from the Senate, it is referred to one or more committees based on jurisdictional statements in House Rule X. These statements define policy subjects for standing committees to oversee on behalf of the chamber, often covering broad policy areas. Multiple committees can claim jurisdiction over different aspects of a subject, leading to potential overlap. The House Parliamentarian provides guidance on measures related to specific policy areas in notes below each standing committee's jurisdictional statements in the House Manual. For example, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee oversees road construction and maintenance, while the House Committee on Appropriations handles funding for these projects. The House Committee on Ways and Means has jurisdiction over revenue collection for government support, including funding for highways from the Highway Trust Fund. Other committees may also have jurisdiction over aspects of roadways depending on their connections to related issues. When legislation from the Senate is received in the House, it is referred to committee to ensure each committee with jurisdiction over the subject matter can consider and report on it. Multiple referrals to different committees are common in the House due to standing rules. Each committee acts on matters within its jurisdiction. When legislation is received in the House, it is referred to committees for consideration based on jurisdiction. The Speaker can make primary, additional, sequential, or split referrals to ensure proper review. Time limits are often placed on referrals, especially for sequential ones. The Speaker sets deadlines for committees to report on legislation, with deference given to primary committees. Special committees may be appointed to review specific matters and report findings to the House. House rules give the Speaker the power to refer legislation to committees, with the House Parliamentarian making day-to-day referral decisions. Prior to 1975, there was no formal mechanism for a measure to be referred to multiple committees, but this changed with the adoption of H.Res. 988 in 1974. In 1975, Congress established a policy for identifying a primary committee of jurisdiction for legislation. This policy was reinforced in the 104th Congress in 1995. Committees may also create memoranda to clarify jurisdictional boundaries for ambiguous topics. The House establishes jurisdiction for committees through referrals of bills and resolutions, as outlined in Hinds' Precedents of the U.S. House of Representatives. Once a measure is referred to a committee, future similar measures are also referred to that committee, even if the initial referral was in error. Amendments to laws are presumed to fall within the originating committee's jurisdiction. Specific types of measures may have jurisdiction defined in statute. Certain measures may be defined in statute, with the House rulebook containing 35 sets of statutory legislative procedures that apply to specific items. Statutory procedures may include automatic referral provisions, such as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 allowing expedited consideration of disapproving recommendations. Subcommittee jurisdictions are not explicitly stated. Subcommittee jurisdictions are generally determined by the full committee that created them, with some committees relying more on subcommittees for processing legislation. Legislative jurisdiction involves reporting measures to the House, while oversight jurisdiction allows committees to review matters within their purview. Oversight jurisdiction allows committees to review matters within their purview, conduct hearings, and investigations. Legislative jurisdiction is defined in Rule X, directing standing committees to review laws and programs within their jurisdiction. Committees have additional oversight duties and functions specified in Rule X. Committees interpret their oversight responsibilities differently. Some committees may have broad interpretations of their oversight responsibilities, leading to disputes over which committee is best suited for certain activities. Multiple committees may be involved in overseeing specific aspects of a subject, similar to how different committees can share oversight responsibilities based on their legislative jurisdictions."
