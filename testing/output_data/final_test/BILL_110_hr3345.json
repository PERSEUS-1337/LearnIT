    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Substitute Teaching Improvement Act\". The Congress finds that inadequate training for substitute teachers negatively impacts student academic performance, with many school districts in the US lacking proper training programs for substitutes. Schools with disadvantaged populations are more likely to have under-prepared substitute teachers, leading to lower student achievement. On any given day in the United States, over 270,000 classes are taught by substitute teachers, with many states allowing individuals with only a high school diploma or GED to teach. Schools with lower academic achievement are more likely to have less qualified substitutes. Formal training for substitute teachers has been proven to enhance education quality, reduce liability, minimize complaints, and increase retention rates. Establishing a program to increase substitute teaching effectiveness through training and evaluation. Grants provided to eligible local educational agencies for comprehensive training programs. Eligible agencies include high-need agencies or partnerships with higher education institutions or non-profit organizations. Use of funds specified in Section 4. A local educational agency receiving a grant must use the funds for training substitute teachers in classroom management, teaching strategies, professionalism, and educational laws. Additionally, funds should be used to train principals and permanent teachers on integrating substitutes effectively in school operations. This includes best practices in recruiting and retaining substitutes, preparing students for substitutes, proper planning and follow-up, and the use of permanent substitutes. The grant funds must be used for training substitute teachers in classroom management, teaching strategies, professionalism, and educational laws. It should also include training for principals and permanent teachers on integrating substitutes effectively in school operations, such as recruiting and retaining substitutes, preparing students for substitutes, proper planning, follow-up, and the use of permanent substitutes. Additionally, a resource kit for substitute teachers should be developed, and data should be collected on substitute teachers and management practices in participating districts. This includes information on the demand for substitute teachers, qualifications, training received, and complaints registered against them. The Secretary of Education will commission a study on substitute teaching and report findings to Congress within two years. Additionally, a report on the impact of funded programs must be submitted within one year after the last demonstration grant expires. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed in the Act. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2012."
