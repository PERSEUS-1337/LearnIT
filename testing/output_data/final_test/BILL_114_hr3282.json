    "content": "The \"Protecting Honest Fishermen Act of 2015\" may be cited as the Act. It focuses on seafood safety. The \"Protecting Honest Fishermen Act of 2015\" focuses on seafood safety through coordination with the national sea grant college program and inspections to prevent seafood fraud. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and maintain a list of offenders on their public website. The \"Protecting Honest Fishermen Act of 2015\" requires the Department of Health and Human Services to list exporters of seafood by country and track violations of federal laws related to seafood safety. This does not limit the Secretary's authority to enforce food safety laws, including the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The \"Protecting Honest Fishermen Act of 2015\" mandates the identification of seafood sources and tracking of violations of federal laws related to seafood safety. Beginning in 2017, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies, must enforce seafood traceability requirements for imports and interstate sales. This includes disclosing where the fish was caught and submitting necessary information under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The packaging of seafood must display the acceptable market name, scientific name, wild or farm-raised status, harvest method, gear type, and catch date. The labeling of seafood must include information such as the catch date, weight or number of product, any treatments affecting weight, processing country, and if the seafood is farm-raised, including country of cultivation and aquaculture location. The labeling of seafood must include details like catch date, weight, processing country, and for farm-raised seafood, country of cultivation and aquaculture location. Importers, processors, distributors, and retailers must ensure accurate labeling and provide traceability documentation to avoid unknowingly selling mislabeled products. Alternative means of disclosure may be allowed for certain information categories. Instead of including certain information categories in seafood packaging or labeling, importers, processors, distributors, or retailers can choose to provide the information upon request to authorized officials for inspections. The categories of information include details required by the Secretary of Commerce. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires disclosure of specific information for seafood products, including location of aquaculture production, date of catch, and weight or number of product. Domestic fishermen must provide this data when fishing in the exclusive economic zone. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires seafood importers to comply with specific requirements. Seafood imported from an exporter will be refused admission if it violates the Act or other federal laws. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act mandates that seafood importers must meet certain requirements. If products are refused entry based on a prior shipment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide if seafood from that exporter needs certification for entry. Individual seafood shipments can be allowed if evidence from an accredited laboratory is provided to the Secretary. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires seafood importers to meet specific requirements. If a prior shipment triggers a refusal, the Secretary of Health and Human Services or Commerce can allow future shipments if they determine compliance with regulations, including those against seafood fraud. The Secretary of Commerce enforces penalties for violating the Act, similar to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. A list of offenders, by country, is maintained on the Department of Commerce's website. The Secretary of Commerce maintains a list of seafood exporters by country and tracks violations of Federal law related to seafood fraud. The Secretary also increases inspections of seafood shipments for fraud, ensuring that the percentage inspected each year is not lower than the previous year. The Secretary of Commerce tracks seafood exporters and violations of Federal law related to seafood fraud. Inspections and tests for seafood fraud prevention should also support the FDA in implementing seafood safety requirements. This does not limit the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services in enforcing food safety laws under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. States have the authority to take legal action against seafood fraud under the Act. Civil actions can be brought by State officials or agencies to stop fraud, recover losses, or receive damages. Individuals can also bring civil actions. Preemption is addressed in the Act. SEC. 5 of the Act states that State authority to enforce seafood safety and fraud prevention measures is not preempted by the Act. SEC. 6 provides definitions. The term \"other applicable Federal laws and regulations\" in the Act refers to various statutes, regulations, and agreements related to seafood importation, exportation, transportation, sale, harvest, processing, or trade, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and other relevant regulations. The term \"seafood fraud\" refers to mislabeling or misrepresentation of required information under the Act or other Federal laws."
