Existing methods overlook the fact that both models share the same input data, limiting the student's benefit. Inspired by human teaching behavior, data augmentation agents are designed to facilitate knowledge distillation. Data augmentation agents play distinct roles in facilitating knowledge distillation, generating specific training data for the teacher and student networks. This focus is on KD when the teacher network has higher precision than the student network. In educational psychology, teachers can adapt curricula based on students' prior experiences to help them comprehend and consolidate knowledge. Role-wise data augmentation improves knowledge distillation effectiveness over existing methods for training neural architectures. The code for replicating the results will be publicly available. Teachers can customize teaching material based on students' backgrounds, such as using examples like flamingos or ice cream cones to explain the concept of the color pink. Knowledge distillation is a common framework for training machine learning models, transferring knowledge from a higher-capacity teacher model to a lower-capacity student model through soft targets defined by output class probabilities. In knowledge distillation, it is crucial to extract as much knowledge as possible from the teacher model's hidden layers to effectively train a student network. The training data points play a significant role in facilitating the absorption of the teacher's knowledge by the student. Blindly adding more training examples may not always be beneficial and could introduce unnecessary biases. Augmenting the training data for both the teacher and student models could be a promising approach, similar to how human teachers adjust their teaching based on students' feedback. In this study, a two-stage, rolewise data augmentation process for knowledge distillation is proposed. The process involves training a teacher network with specific data augmentation policies and then distilling the knowledge into a student network with different augmentation policies. This approach can be combined with existing methods for knowledge distillation and applied to any models. Network quantization is essential for deploying models on embedded devices or in data centers to reduce energy consumption. Knowledge distillation-based quantization involves training a full-precision teacher model alongside a low-precision student model. Previous research has shown performance degradation when transferring knowledge from a full-precision teacher to a low-precision student, especially with bit-widths below four. Using adaptive data augmentation can generate more training data for the low-precision model, proving advantageous. Adaptive data augmentation is beneficial for low-precision networks by addressing specific weaknesses like learning rotation-related patterns. The proposed method shows more significant improvement compared to full-precision models. Knowledge distillation involves a teacher model transferring knowledge to a student model for performance enhancement. Automated data augmentation methods like generative adversarial networks and Bayesian optimization have been used to enhance training neural models for image classification tasks. In contrast to existing knowledge distillation methods, a new approach incorporates both intra- and inter-relationships within and across feature maps. Automated data augmentation methods, such as Bayesian optimization and Population-based augmentation (PBA), are used to enhance training for image classification tasks. PBA utilizes an evolution-based algorithm to automatically augment data efficiently, improving the training process for neural models. Population-based augmentation (PBA) uses an evolution-based algorithm to automatically augment data for image classification tasks. PBA starts with a population of models trained on a subset of the original data, replacing weights of underperforming models with better ones and mutating policies for exploration. The learned augmentation schedule is retained for future use, improving training for different models on the same task. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a method used in classification tasks where the student network learns from the teacher network by minimizing a loss term. The KD term involves comparing the output of the student network with the teacher network using a loss function. Different KD methods exist, such as Relational KD, which considers intra-relationships in feature maps to improve knowledge transfer. The feature-based KD method includes benefits of using soft labels and considers interrelationships between feature maps of different layers. Quantization of weights and activations is done using DoReFa 2, and back-propagation is approximated using the straight-through estimator. The proposed method involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and then distilling knowledge from the teacher to a student network while learning another augmentation schedule. The teacher's performance influences the training signals for the student, and a dynamic per-epoch schedule of augmentation policies is learned using PBA. This schedule is then used to augment the whole training dataset. The method involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and distilling knowledge to a student network using KD methods. An epoch-based augmentation schedule is learned for the student network based on feedback from the teacher network. This schedule is then used to augment the entire training dataset for further training of the student network. The method involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and distilling knowledge to a student network using KD methods. In stage-\u03b2, an augmentation agent learns schedules of policies different from stage-\u03b1, receiving feedback only from N S. The approach is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The study involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and transferring the knowledge to a student network using KD methods. Data augmentation models are tested on a \"reduced\" CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 dataset with 4,000 training images and 36,000 validation images. The policy search space includes 15 operations with varying magnitudes and discrete probability values. The study involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and transferring the knowledge to a student network using KD methods. Discrete probability values from 0% to 100% are used for data augmentation. Models evaluated include AlexNet and ResNet18 with 200 epochs and a batch size of 128. Various optimization techniques are employed such as SGD with Nesterov momentum. Weight decay and quantization strategies are also implemented. The study involves training a teacher network with PBA-based augmentation and transferring the knowledge to a student network using KD methods. The implementation includes decaying the balancing hyper-parameter \u03bb in the KD loss by 0.5 every 60 epochs. A new method called II-KD is proposed to combine intra-and inter-relationships within and across feature maps for improved performance. The study combines components of three KD methods and introduces a new KD extension called II-KD. The KD method uses a single balancing hyper-parameter \u03bb and incorporates KD terms with equal coefficients. Gradient clipping is applied for KD loss during back-propagation. Feature maps from specific layers are selected for AlexNet and ResNet18 models. The proposed KD extension is evaluated on CIFAR-100 with ResNet18 for different bit-width settings. Our proposed KD extension on CIFAR-100 with ResNet18 for different bit-width settings outperforms other KD methods, showing effectiveness in utilizing multiple supervising signals from the teacher. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our two-stage role-wise augmentation with KD for network quantization. Training with learned data augmentation schedules does not significantly improve the performance of low-precision networks. Transferring knowledge from full-precision to low-precision students helps in training, especially on CIFAR-100 dataset. The proposed pipeline consistently enhances the performance of low-precision student networks, with 4-bit N S comparable to full-precision on CIFAR-10 and within 1.0% loss on CIFAR-100. Even with 2-bit precision, the results are promising compared to other baselines, although there is a performance gap with full-precision models. The approach outperforms the strong baseline using II-KD by more than 1.0%. Augmenting the training dataset for N S with A S consistently outperforms using transferred schedules A T among different KD methods. Blindly applying the teacher augmentation schedule A T may negatively influence accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with different bit-widths. Training for 4-bit and 2-bit networks involves training from scratch without data augmentation. Teacher after Stage-\u03b1 uses schedules discovered by PBA to re-train N T, while Student with only II-KD trains N S without data augmentation. Comparing Vanilla Training and Teacher after Stage-\u03b1, accuracy is reported for N T, and for the rest, accuracy is reported for N S. Applying the teacher's schedule degrades N S performance by 0.58% for AlexNet on CIFAR-100 compared to KD methods. Quantitative analysis of augmented schedules for full-precision ResNet18 and 4-bit ResNet18 is reported. The augmented schedules for full-precision ResNet18 and 4-bit ResNet18 are quantitatively compared in terms of probability and magnitude on CIFAR-100. The schedules for the 4-bit network show a different emphasis on augmentation operations compared to the full-precision network, with an increase in probability and magnitude as training progresses. Initially, KD plays a more significant role for the 4-bit network, with augmentation policies becoming more important as training continues. KD methods provide rich training signals, making data augmentation unnecessary in early training phases. The schedule for student AS evolves smoothly with lower policy updating frequency compared to AT. For low-precision NS, KD methods ensure a smooth training process without frequent augmentation policy changes. This validates the assumption that NS has its own optimal augmentation schedule AS different from AT. The effectiveness of proposed methods on conventional settings is verified using full-precision networks NT and NS. ResNet18 is the teacher and ResNet8 is the student network. Results show that the proposed method outperforms standard baseline training, with a discovered augmentation schedule boosting the performance of shallow NS based on II-KD. The proposed method improves the performance of shallow NS based on II-KD, showing potential for full-precision training tasks. Different settings for training with full-precision ResNet8 as NS and ResNet18 as NT are compared in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-100. Previous literature on KD focuses on knowledge representation and distillation strategies, but fails to adapt to different learning capabilities between teacher and student. The proposed method aims to address the issue of different learning capabilities between teacher and student by customizing distinct agents for data augmentation. It combines data augmentation and knowledge distillation, with a feature-based KD variant that improves learning, especially in low-precision scenarios. The approach allows the student to learn better from the teacher, with different learned schedules for each."
