    "content": "Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) aim to capture compressible information in a dataset, but the latent space may not contain enough information to reconstruct specific images. To address this, a GAN-style decoder is trained to generate images that the VAE encoder can map to the same latent space region, allowing for visualization of the captured information. This approach is crucial for turning a VAE into a truly generative model. Research has focused on improving VAE reconstruction performance, with efforts to enhance the model's capabilities. The VAEs aim to capture compressible information in a dataset by using an ELBO objective function. This function consists of a negative log-probability of generating the original image from the latent representation and a KL-divergence between the probability distribution representing a latent code and a 'prior distribution'. These terms relate to the minimum description length principle. The KL-term in VAEs measures the information in the latent code, while the log-probability of the image measures the information needed to change the image produced by the decoder into the input image. The latent space captures compressible information of the dataset without encoding image-specific details, preventing overfitting. However, this may result in poor image reconstruction due to insufficient information in the latent code. The latent code in VAEs may not contain enough information for good image reconstruction, especially for complex datasets like ImageNet or CIFAR. To generate realistic images, we need to consider the information discarded by the encoder, similar to providing a verbal description of an image for artists to interpret. To generate realistic images with VAEs, a latent space renderer-GAN (LSR-GAN) can be used. This model uses a generator network to create an image from a latent vector z, aiming to convince a discriminator it is real while mapping close to z. This approach considers the information discarded by the VAE encoder for better image reconstruction. The LSR-GAN model adds an additional cost to the GAN loss function for the generator to map close to the latent vector z. The VAE encoder's weights are frozen during training, and a hyperparameter \u03bb balances image realism and information capture in the latent space. This modification can be applied to any GAN or VAE, providing a powerful method for visualizing latent space information and stabilizing GAN training. Incorporating VAEs with GANs aims to improve reconstruction performance. The VAE decoder is designed to generate images based on latent space information, rather than accurately reconstructing them. The LSR-GAN model generates images for both normal VAEs and \u03b2-VAEs, providing examples of image generation. In this section, we delve into the performance of VAEs and LSR-GAN through systematic experiments. We also discuss the shortcomings of VAEs as generative models and provide technical details in the appendices. The text discusses using VAE encoder to generate a distribution in the latent space and feeding it to the LSR-GAN generator for image representation. Examples are shown for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The VAE struggles with diverse images, resulting in poor reconstructions. This process is also repeated for a \u03b2-VAE. The text discusses the smoothness of the latent space in VAEs, showing little variation for standard VAEs and more for \u03b2-VAEs. Input-output pairs are generated by the LSR-GAN generator, capturing shape and background but losing detail. Some reconstructions capture the object type, but errors occur, such as rendering the wrong object with a \u03b2-VAE. A schematic representation of a VAE is provided, sampling an input x from a dataset D. The VAE encoder outputs mean and standard deviation vectors for each input x, sampled from a normal distribution. The decoder generates reconstructions x = D\u03b8(z) for complex datasets, with a loss function equal to the negative evidence lower bound (ELBO). LSR-GAN is a hybrid model combining VAE and GAN. It is a two-stage model where the VAE is trained first, then the GAN. The discriminator in LSR-GAN functions like a normal GAN, distinguishing real images from fake ones to optimize the loss function. The LSR-GAN combines VAE and GAN, using a ResNet for better performance. The discriminator architecture is similar to DCGAN. The VAE generates a latent representation for an image, which is then used as a seed for the generator in LSR-GAN, producing sharper reconstruction images than VAE. LSR-GAN outperforms VAE in generating sharper reconstruction images. Quantitative measures show a significant improvement in sharpness and image quality for LSR-GAN compared to VAE on CIFAR-10 dataset. The KL-divergence aims to maximize latent space usage, while minimizing reconstruction loss pushes most of the latent space far from training examples. VAE generates testing examples closer to training examples, while LSR-GAN is trained on random samples to produce diverse images across the latent space. Generating recognizable images from diverse datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet is challenging. Images generated by seeding LSR-GAN with random latent variables for various datasets are shown in Appendix E. Generating a latent representation that is disentangled is a challenging task, with attempts made using methods like the \u03b2-VAE. This approach involves weighting the KL-divergence term in a VAE by a parameter \u03b2 to encourage disentanglement. However, achieving disentanglement in practice is difficult, and various techniques have been proposed to address this issue. In the study, the authors explore the impact of adjusting the parameter \u03b2 in a VAE to make it more similar to an auto-encoder. They find that increasing \u03b2 improves reconstruction performance but may lead to overfitting the training set. Comparing different values of \u03b2, they observe that larger values result in more significant differences between input and output images, while smaller values capture more details. The LSR-GAN model generates clearer images but has a lower reconstruction error than the VAE decoder. The poor performance of LSR-GAN is attributed to using the same latent space information as the VAE, leading to sharper images at the cost of incorrect boundaries. Increasing the parameter \u03b2 in a VAE improves reconstruction performance but may lead to overfitting. The mean squared error remains constant until \u03b2 = 1, after which it rapidly increases. A \u03b2 = 1 VAE encodes all useful information well, performing like an auto-encoder. Classification accuracy drops as \u03b2 increases above 1, attributed to the VAE's latent space capturing most useful information. The VAE with \u03b2 = 1 captures useful information well in the latent space. High-\u03b2 VAE fails to capture \"objectness\" on CIFAR-10. VAEs can be interpreted in the framework of minimum description length (MDL) formalism for communication efficiency. In the context of VAEs, the communication efficiency can be improved by using a code z and error = x\u2212x to transmit information more efficiently than raw pixel values. The goal is to minimize the description length L by finding an optimal coding strategy based on the Shannon bound. In VAEs, communication efficiency can be enhanced by using a code z and error = x\u2212x to transmit information more efficiently. The precision of errors and code determines data accuracy. Balancing precision of model transmission affects reconstruction cost and communication cost. KL-divergence term represents communication cost of transmitting a random variable. The loss function of a VAE is equivalent to the expected message length of communicating a sample from the dataset using a random variable with uncertainty. By minimizing the loss function, a coding scheme with the minimum description length is found. The VAE balances accuracy and reconstruction error by encoding a message as a random variable drawn from a distribution. The ELBO is the correct objective function from an MDL perspective. The decoder in a variational autoencoder reconstructs images using compressed information, ignoring image-specific details to prevent latent variable collapse. This collapse acts as a dimensionality selection technique, resulting in blurry outlines in the reconstructed images. The decoder in a variational autoencoder can have a blurry outline due to hedging its bets, but evidence shows VAE performances are not massively suboptimal. With a powerful encoder and decoder, it's possible for the encoder to communicate an identifier of the input image for the decoder to reproduce the image without conveying visual content, leading to posterior collapse. Some evidence suggests that with strong encoders and decoders, the amount of information stored in the latent space decreases, indicating a weakness in the VAE set-up. The VAE set-up may have weaknesses when the dataset is not large enough, but data augmentation could help. Evidence suggests that VAEs may struggle to extract information in the latent space for language modeling, but for images, a properly trained VAE can capture compressible information. The failure of VAE decoders to produce high-quality reconstructions, except for simple datasets like MNIST, may be due to the need to communicate noncompressible information. Therefore, the VAE decoder should not be seen as a generative model. The VAE decoder should not be viewed as a generative model, as it is designed to produce blurry reconstructions to ensure the latent space captures common information. VAEs are considered a simpler alternative to GANs for generating samples, but may give slightly worse results. Modifying VAEs to improve performance risks losing their ability to learn features of the whole dataset without encoding specific information. The VAE is not an ideal generative model due to its inability to accurately reconstruct data and generate new samples. Using a GAN as a data renderer with the VAE encoder can help generate images representing the information in the VAE's latent space. LSR-GAN is useful for generating random samples, but may not produce recognizable real-world objects for diverse datasets. The VAE-GAN hybrids aim to improve VAEs, but fixing them may actually break their functionality. This paper offers a corrective perspective on VAE literature, emphasizing the importance of not altering VAEs that perform as intended. The standard VAE maximizes log-probability for image generation, assuming pixel errors are normally distributed with variance \u03c3 2. The log-probability of generating images in VAEs is maximized by assuming pixel errors are normally distributed with variance \u03c3 2. It is cheaper to communicate residues if they are more tightly concentrated, leading to the minimization of N log(E MSE) /2. Public implementations of VAEs often assume \u03c3 2 = 1/2, ignoring its true value. VAEs often assume a variance of 1/2 for pixel errors, leading to difficulties in comparing results. Hybrid models like LSR-GAN combine VAE and GAN, with AAE and VAE/GAN being notable examples. The VAE/GAN model introduced feature-wise errors and included reconstruction, generated, and real images in its generator input. MDGAN and other hybrid models aimed to match GAN manifold to real data. However, our model differs by feeding the generator output back into the encoder and training in two stages, a unique approach not seen in other models. The Introspective Adversarial Network (IAN) and IntroVAE are models that use introspective methods. IAN encodes features extracted by the discriminator, while IntroVAE constructs an inference and generator model in a loop. VEEGAN is similar to our LSR-GAN, introducing a network to map images to a Gaussian distribution. LSR-GAN aims to map real and synthetic images to a Gaussian distribution using F \u03b8. It minimizes the distance between generator input and F \u03b8 output. GMMN freezes the autoencoder and minimizes the MMD between generated and data representations. LSR-GAN is the first VAE-GAN hybrid model to apply probability distance in the loss function. LSR-GAN is a VAE-GAN hybrid model that utilizes probability distance in the loss function. Experimental data in Table 1 compares performance of VAEs and LSR-GAN for different \u03b2 values. The hyper-parameter \u03bb in LSR-GAN balances image quality and latent space similarity to VAE. Changing \u03bb affects classification accuracy as shown in Figure 6. Increasing the hyper-parameter \u03bb in LSR-GAN improves classification performance and reduces reconstruction error and variance in predictions. The encoder in LSR-GAN acts as a regularizer, ensuring similar images are mapped to nearby points in latent space. Graphs in Figure 6 show the classification performance of images generated with different \u03bb values. The appendix describes the architecture of the VAE and LSR-GAN used, including the encoder, decoder, generator, and discriminator networks based on a ResNet structure. The models were optimized using Adam with specific learning rates. Sample images generated by LSR-GAN from a random seed are shown for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. The code implementation is available at a specified GitHub link. LSR-GAN trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generates surreal objects due to the dataset's variability. In contrast, LSR-GAN trained on MNIST and Celeb-A produces identifiable samples."
