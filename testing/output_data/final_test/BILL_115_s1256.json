Congress finds that the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company were top-secret units of the US Army that served in Europe during WWII, engaging in deceptive activities integral to Allied victories and reduced casualties. During World War II, the Ghost Army soldiers, recruited from various creative and technical professions, had a significant impact on major military campaigns. The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, engaged in secret deception operations in France, with casualties suffered during false beach landing sites creation on D-Day. Task Force Mason, led by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, played a crucial role in these operations starting on June 14, 1944. Operation Elephant, conducted by Task Force Mason led by Lieutenant Bernard Mason, took place from July 1 to 4, 1944, as part of the Normandy Campaign. This operation was a tactical deception involving the use of inflatable tanks, artillery, airplanes, and radio trickery to create the illusion of a larger American force and draw the enemy away from Allied troops. During World War II, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops in Fort Drum, New York, used sonic deception tactics to impersonate larger Army units, creating fake patches, markings, and headquarters to mislead Axis spies. In the Battle of the Bulge, they produced counterfeit radio traffic to deceive the enemy about General George S. Patton's Third Army movements towards Bastogne. During World War II, the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops conducted Operation Viersen in March 1945 to deceive German units and assist the Ninth Army in crossing the Rhine into Germany. They impersonated 40,000 men using fabricated radio networks, soundtracks, and inflatable vehicles, aiding in misleading the enemy. The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company conducted operations to deceive the enemy during World War II. The 3133d Signal Service Company used sonic deception to misrepresent troop locations along the Gothic Line in Italy. The activities of these units remained highly classified. The 3133d Signal Service Company's achievements during World War II remained classified for over 40 years. Their innovative tactics saved lives and contributed significantly to defeating the Axis powers, deserving belated official recognition. The 3133d Signal Service Company's achievements during World War II remained classified for over 40 years, deserving belated official recognition with a Congressional Gold Medal. The President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives will arrange for a gold medal to be awarded to the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal Services Company for their distinguished service in World War II. The Secretary of the Treasury will design and strike the medal, which will then be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. The Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal available for display at other locations associated with the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, and the 3133d Signal Services Company. The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates of the gold medal in bronze under regulations to cover costs. The gold medal struck under this Act is a national medal and considered numismatic items under United States Code."
