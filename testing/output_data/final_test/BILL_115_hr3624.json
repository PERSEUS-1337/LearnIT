    "content": "The Rural Economic Vitalization Act, also known as the \"Rural Economic Vitalization Act,\" includes sections on short title, findings, definitions, rural vitalization program, and the effect of waiving grazing permits or leases. Congress finds that the use of Federal lands for commercial livestock grazing is increasingly difficult due to conflicts with other land uses and mandated goals of wildlife protection. Factors such as sustained drought and industry changes have made grazing permits stranded investments for many permittees. Resolving conflicts often requires extensive range developments and intensive herd management. The Federal grazing program on public lands is costly and unsustainable, with conflicts arising from wildlife protection goals and industry changes. Some grazing allotments may become unsuitable for livestock production. Many permittees are willing to stop grazing in exchange for compensation for their investments. Compensating permittees and lessees who relinquish their grazing permit or lease would help revitalize rural America by providing economic options for restructuring ranch operations, starting new businesses, or retiring securely. Paying reasonable compensation for relinquishment can prevent the need to sell or subdivide private lands. The text chunk discusses the definitions related to the topic. The Act defines terms related to commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands, including commercial livestock grazing, grazing allotment, grazing permit or lease, and permittee or lessee. The Act defines terms related to commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands, including grazing permit or lease, range developments, Secretaries, and Secretary. The Rural Vitalization Program is outlined in Section 4 of the Act. The Secretary shall accept any grazing permit or lease waived by a permittee or lessee, terminate the acquired permit or lease, and ensure no new permit or lease is issued for the grazing allotment, leading to a permanent end to livestock grazing. The Secretary will reduce commercial livestock grazing levels on waived grazing allotments and limit new grazing permits to 100 per year on a first come, first served basis. Effect of waiver of grazing permit or lease. (a) Effect on Range Developments.--A permittee or lessee who waives a grazing permit or lease to the Secretary under section 4 shall be deemed to have waived any claim to all range developments on the associated grazing allotment. (b) Securing Retired Allotments Against Unauthorized Use.--The Secretary shall ensure that grazing allotments retired from grazing under this Act are rendered reasonably secure from trespass grazing by domestic livestock. (c) Relation to Other Authority.--Nothing in this Act shall affect the Secretary's authority to modify or terminate grazing permits or leases in accordance with other law. (d) Relation to Valid Existing Rights.--Nothing in this Act affects the allocation, ownership, interest, or control of any water, water right, or any other valid existing right held by the United States or Indian tribe. The curr_chunk states that nothing in the Act affects any valid existing rights held by the United States, Indian tribe, State, county, municipality, or private entity."
