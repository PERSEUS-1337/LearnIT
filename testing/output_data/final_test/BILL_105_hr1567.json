The \"Eastern Wilderness Act of 1998\" aims to increase and expand wilderness areas in the eastern United States to preserve their natural condition for the use and enjoyment of the American people. This Act is necessary to protect these areas, preserve their wilderness character, and gather information on their use as wilderness. The \"Eastern Wilderness Act of 1998\" aims to designate additional qualifying lands as wilderness in the eastern United States. The Act specifies that designated areas shall continue to be managed by the relevant department or agency unless otherwise provided by Congress. Wilderness areas are defined as places where the earth and its community of life are unaltered by human presence. A wilderness area is defined as undeveloped land with its natural conditions preserved, primarily affected by natural forces, offering solitude and recreational opportunities. It must be east of the 100th meridian, have at least 500 acres of land, and may contain ecological, geological, or historical features. The Wilderness Act defines natural reclamation as the process of land restoration through ecological succession with minimal human interference. The Act applies only to lands east of the 100th meridian and excludes any areas already designated as part of the national wilderness preservation system before its enactment. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior are directed to study and inventory Federal lands over 500 acres east of the 100th meridian that qualify as wilderness. Within 10 years of this Act's approval, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will review areas with wilderness characteristics and report to the President on their suitability for preservation. Prior to making recommendations, public notice will be given through the Federal Register and local newspapers. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will hold public hearings in areas affected by land preservation decisions. Notices will be published in the Federal Register and local newspapers, with at least one hearing in each state where the land is located. Governors and county governing boards will be advised at least 30 days before the hearings. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior will hold public hearings in areas affected by land preservation decisions. Notices will be published in the Federal Register and local newspapers, with at least one hearing in each state where the land is located. Governors and county governing boards will be advised at least 30 days before the hearings. The President shall advise Congress and the Senate of his recommendations for wilderness designation of each area within 2 years. The President must provide recommendations for wilderness designation within 2 years of receiving reports from the Secretaries. Designation as wilderness requires approval by an Act of Congress. The Secretary will manage study areas to preserve their suitability for wilderness until Congress decides otherwise, taking actions to prevent degradation and ensure environmental protection. Once an area is designated as wilderness, this Act's provisions apply to its administration and use. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT OF WILDERNESS AREAS. Each agency managing designated wilderness areas must preserve their wilderness character for recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, conservation, and historical use. Commercial enterprises, permanent roads, and structures are generally prohibited in these areas, except for necessary administration purposes. The Wilderness Act prohibits the use of motor vehicles, aircraft, motorboats, and structures in designated wilderness areas, with exceptions for established aircraft and motorboat use with restrictions. Measures for fire, insect, and disease control are allowed under certain conditions. The Wilderness Act allows activities like prospecting for mineral resources in designated wilderness areas if done in a way that preserves the environment. The Geological Survey conducts surveys to determine mineral values, with results made public and submitted to the President and Congress. Within designated wilderness areas, the President can authorize activities like prospecting for water resources, building reservoirs, power projects, and grazing livestock if it serves the public interest. Commercial services may be performed within designated wilderness areas subject to regulations by the Secretary of Agriculture. This Act does not affect State water laws or the jurisdiction of States over wildlife and fish on public lands. SEC. 6. PRIVATE PROPERTY. Private Property - State or private land surrounded by public lands in designated wilderness areas must have adequate access rights granted or be exchanged for federally owned land of equal value.

The appropriate Secretary can permit access to surrounded areas within designated wilderness areas, acquire State or privately owned land for wilderness establishment, with owner consent and congressional authorization, and provide compensation for land taken under this Act. Under this Act, Congress may take land which will require compensation to the owner at fair market value under the fifth amendment. SEC. 7. ACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS. The appropriate Secretary may accept gifts or bequests of land within designated wilderness areas for preservation. Land adjacent to wilderness areas can also be accepted with advance notice. Accepted land becomes part of the wilderness area. Private contributions can be accepted by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior can accept private contributions and gifts to further the purposes of the Act. SEC. 8. REPORT.
