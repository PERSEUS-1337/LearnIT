    "content": "Congress is considering infrastructure funding decisions for the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway, including allocating funds to small and Great Lakes ports, debating the construction of a spare lock in Sault Ste. Marie, MI, and funding a new Coast Guard icebreaker vessel. These decisions come as the system's traffic base is declining. The GLSLS system's traffic base is eroding due to technological changes and globalization of production. Federal funds for harbor maintenance are mainly derived from cargo taxes paid by coastal ports, not Great Lakes ports. This report examines reasons for the cargo decline, prospects for attracting more cargo, and financing the system's capital needs. The GLSLS system spans 2,300 nautical miles from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Duluth, MN. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway system spans 2,300 nautical miles from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Duluth, MN. It takes six to seven days for a ship to sail from Montreal to Duluth or Chicago. There are two categories of vessel traffic: intra-lakes trade and transits between the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Lake Erie is shallower than the other Great Lakes, requiring periodic dredging to maintain a 27-foot depth in cargo ports. The top 10 U.S. ports handle 70% of U.S. cargo, with over 30 ports handling cargo and over 100 ports regularly dredged by the federal government. The St. Marys River is a vital connecting channel within the Great Lakes. Lake Huron connects to Lake Erie through the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River, with navigation passing through the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie. The locks are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and are closed from January 15 to March 25 for maintenance. The Poe Lock is the largest and most important for cargo ships, while two smaller U.S. locks may potentially be replaced by a parallel lock. The connecting channels and locks are maintained to a depth of 27 feet. The St. Lawrence Seaway extends from Montreal through the Welland Canal in Ontario, Canada, to Lake Erie. It consists of a 27-mile-long canal with eight locks allowing ships to bypass Niagara Falls. The seaway opened in 1959 and includes a 27-foot-deep dredged channel with seven locks operated by different entities. The Welland Canal is also operated and maintained by the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation. The Welland Canal, with a navigable depth of 14 feet, already existed before the St. Lawrence Seaway project. Canada increased the lock dimensions in 1932, which became the design standard for the new locks on the MLO section. The seaway construction increased the canal's depth by two feet, but the lock sizes remained the same. It takes 12 hours for a ship to transit the Welland Canal, which is closed in winter. Canada had been advocating for the seaway's construction since the early 1900s, while opposition from eastern ports and railroads in the US delayed approval due to the project's estimated cost. In the 1940s, concerns arose about depleting high-grade iron ore in the Mesabi Iron Range and Marquette Iron Range. Discussions considered relocating steel mills to access iron ore from South America, but a new iron ore deposit on the Labrador/Quebec border was discovered as a replacement. Construction of mining facilities began in 1950, with U.S. opposition to the project subdued by agreements with Canada. The United States and Canada reached agreements for the construction of the seaway. One agreement involved tolls to recoup costs, a departure from toll-free navigation policy. The other agreement had New York State funding the hydropower portion of the project, with plants at Niagara Falls and Massena. Eisenhower's administration opposed federally owned power facilities. The Eisenhower Administration supported the construction of the seaway to strengthen national security and promote international trade. New York's funding of hydropower plants at Niagara Falls and Massena resolved the issue of federally owned power facilities. Today, U.S. steel mills on the Great Lakes mostly obtain iron ore from the Mesabi deposit, reducing the need for transport through the seaway. The Mesabi deposit supplies more iron ore to Canadian steel mills on the Great Lakes than Labrador mines. Most iron ore from Labrador mines is exported overseas. Pelletization of low-grade iron ore from the Mesabi Range started in 1955, allowing it to be processed into high-grade iron ore pellets preferred by steel mills. Pellets can be shipped in freezing conditions as they contain no moisture. The container revolution began on April 26, 1956, with the first containership sailing from Newark, NJ, to Houston, TX, carrying truck trailers. This innovation dramatically lowered shipping costs and facilitated global trade by allowing easy transfer of containers between ships and land modes. The Interstate Highway System, authorized on June 29, 1956, further facilitated sea-to-land transfers, leading to the development of intermodal shipping. This system continues to benefit Canada, with 40% of domestic commerce and 16% of overseas traffic relying on it. The St. Lawrence Seaway accounts for 40% of total tonnage and 16% of overseas traffic. U.S. overseas trade through the seaway is equivalent to the 88th busiest port in the United States. However, it only represents less than 0.5% of U.S. overseas waterborne trade. Most of the tonnage consists of bulk commodities like wheat and coal, with iron and steel products being the highest-value commodity. About 85% of cargo on the Great Lakes ports is moving to or from other Great Lakes ports, bypassing the seaway. The St. Lawrence Seaway accounts for a small share of traffic, with exceptions at Port of Oswego, NY, and Port of Toledo, OH. Ports of Superior, WI, and Duluth, MN ship mostly iron ore through the seaway. Tonnage estimates were surpassed, peaking in the 1980s due to a spike in grain exports. Annual tonnage has since declined to between 35-40 million tons. Since the 1980s, annual tonnage on the St. Lawrence Seaway has decreased to 35-40 million tons, similar to levels in the 1960s. Demand for North American grain has shifted to Asia, impacting eastbound grain exports. Despite the decline, seaway tonnage has fallen less than on the Great Lakes. U.S. domestic cargo volume within the Great Lakes has also decreased significantly. The decline of domestic cargo on the Great Lakes is mainly due to changes in the steel industry, with steel manufacturing being the mainstay of shipping in the region. Changes in steelmaking have reduced the need to ship iron ore and coal on the Great Lakes and the seaway. The decline of domestic cargo on the Great Lakes is primarily due to changes in the steel industry. Steel production in mini-mills eliminates the need for coke and metallurgical coal, reducing demand for traditional integrated mills using iron ore. Auto manufacturing has shifted away from the region, decreasing the need for steel production in the Great Lakes area. Globalization has also increased steel imports. The globalization of steel manufacturing has led to increased steel imports through the seaway, while U.S. steel exports have also risen. Steel rolling mills and processing plants are being built on U.S. waterways, but none are located on the Great Lakes. The Jones Act, which requires U.S. vessels for domestic shipping on the Great Lakes, is a factor in this industry. The Jones Act aims to protect the domestic maritime industry, but critics argue it hinders price competitiveness compared to other modes of transport. U.S.-built ships are much more expensive than foreign-built ones, discouraging market entry and fleet renewal. The U.S. fleet of 1,000-foot freighters on the Great Lakes is aging, with the largest ships built between 1972 and 1981. Canada's fleet was similar in age until they repealed a tariff on foreign-built ships in 2010. The U.S. Great Lakes fleet has seen fleet renewal with 22 new ships built in foreign yards after the repeal of a 25% tariff on foreign-built ships. The fleet is exempt from stricter air emission standards, but development is hindered by winter closures, navigation challenges, and the preference for \"warm water\" ports to avoid ice. The advantages of a \"warm water\" port include avoiding ice, strong winds, and icy precipitation, which can disrupt navigation and cargo handling. Ship owners may need to consider shifting to rail transportation during the seaway's winter closure, but this may not be financially practical for rail carriers. To maintain steady cargo flow, rail carriers may negotiate rates to encourage shippers to use rail transportation year-round instead of seasonally. The decision to use the dimensions of the 1932 Welland Canal locks for the new seaway was criticized for making it obsolete before opening due to increasing ship sizes. The locks can only accommodate a small percentage of the world fleet of dry bulk vessels, tankers, and liquefied natural gas carriers. Shipping economics favor larger ships for longer voyages to achieve economies of scale. Ships achieve economies of scale at sea but face diseconomies in port. Larger ships reduce fuel and crew costs per unit of cargo, but longer loading and unloading times in port increase costs. The seaway was designed for short voyages in the Great Lakes and eastern Canada, not impeding trade. Overseas trade is primarily with Europe, Africa's West Coast, or South America's East Coast, which are relatively short voyages. The largest ships operate between northern Europe and Asia, across the Pacific Ocean, or around South Africa. The Poe Lock at Sault St. Marie, MI limits vessel size within the Great Lakes system. Minnesota iron ore for U.S. steel mills passes through the Soo Lock, expanded in 1968 for 70,000-ton vessels. Cliffs Natural Resources focuses on supplying ore from Minnesota to Great Lakes mills, benefiting from smaller locks in the seaway. Cliffs Natural Resources benefits from smaller locks in the seaway, making it well-protected from imported pellets. Strategies to attract more cargo include convincing shippers to use water transport and encouraging industrial sectors to locate plants on the Great Lakes. The St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation is pursuing these strategies under the \"Highway H\u2082O\" and \"Opportunity Belt\" initiatives. The 2015 annual report of a major carrier states limited growth opportunities on the GLSLS, prompting a focus on non-North American markets. The \"Highway H\u2082O\" strategy assumes shippers are unaware of the benefits of waterborne routes, but this is unlikely in a market economy where efficiency is key. Globalization has driven U.S. producers to seek cost-effective and reliable transportation methods since the 1980s. Since the 1980s, freight transportation has evolved into \"business logistics\" and \"supply-chain management,\" with the rise of Third-Party Logistics Providers (3PLs) specializing in reengineering transportation and inventory management to reduce costs. Computers enable logistics companies to design efficient material movement, leading to practices like \"just-in-time\" delivery and \"demand-pull\" logistics for lower inventory carrying costs. The job performance of logisticians, operations personnel, and supply chain managers within large companies is measured by their ability to bring about cost savings in the distribution network. Shippers are reducing the number of transportation carriers they hire and developing closer relationships with carriers to reduce empty vehicle miles and ensure equipment availability. Trucking firms call these relationships \"dedicated service,\" which may make shippers less willing to try other arrangements. The Great Lakes and seaway are overlooked as a better alternative for shipping significant volumes of goods. The Highway H\u2082O strategy focuses on marketing to shippers of containerized freight, but attracting container vessels to the seaway faces obstacles due to high costs and inefficiencies compared to truck or rail transport to coastal ports. Containerships operate most efficiently by calling at only a few ports with large cargo volumes. The Port of New York and New Jersey is a key stop for containerships servicing the U.S. Northeast, with import cargo often destined for the New York City region. Containers can reach the Great Lakes region quickly by truck or rail from New York, making it a strategic location for distribution networks. Moving containers by water from New York to Montreal and through the seaway would take over a week due to the distance. Container shipping lines have separate routes for New York and Canadian ports, with fewer calls at Montreal and Halifax. Feeder vessel services were attempted on the seaway, but both were terminated after about a year. No U.S. vessel operators have attempted a container feeder service on the seaway. Truck and rail competition between Northeast Atlantic ports and the Midwest is intense, with truckers able to pull \"turnpike doubles\" and railroads using double-stack railcars to haul more containers per train. The Port of New York is a busy intermodal rail corridor with 22 to 26 trains per day carrying 14,000 containers. Railroads in the Great Lakes region also transport truck trailers to ports like Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Norfolk for export. No car-carrying ships operate through the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Port of Cleveland is subsidizing service to Antwerp, Belgium, by chartering a multipurpose ship from a Dutch shipping line. The ship carries breakbulk, project cargoes, and some containers. The port has provided $11 million in subsidies and hopes the service will eventually operate without public funds. Generating additional revenue for the seaway's capital needs is a goal if containerized cargo can be captured. Tolls on containerships are likely to be higher due to the high-value cargo they carry. The challenges of using the seaway in winter limit it to shippers who can stockpile inventory for three months, mainly low-value raw material shippers. Domestic truck shipments face difficulties in diverting to the seaway due to tight delivery windows. Limited truck services cross the Detroit River and Lake Michigan, offering savings in miles for truckers. Other similar services are constrained by the location of large cities on the Great Lakes. The \"Opportunity Belt\" strategy aims to increase seaway traffic from industries favoring waterborne transportation due to high transport costs. These industries rely on individual shipments of low-value raw materials, making location decisions crucial based on proximity to transportation modes like airports, highways, railroads, and waterways. Large cities on the Great Lakes limit ferry crossings for truck drivers, impacting route decisions for firms. Manufacturers of steel, energy products, and chemicals often use waterborne transportation like ships and barges. Heavy industries exporting to northern Europe are a key target audience for the seaway. Efforts to attract businesses to the Great Lakes waterfront involve various agencies and the SLSDC's \"Opportunity Belt\" strategy. The SLSDC's Opportunity Belt strategy targets shippers benefiting from unit trains, which provide strong competition to tanker and dry bulk ships. Unit trains move a single product without stopping to add or remove cars, unloading and returning for another load. Alcoa utilized unit trains to supply bauxite to their aluminum plant in Massena, NY in 1959, leveraging their maritime expertise to retain customers. Alcoa's railroad responded to competition by deploying unit trains to supply bauxite to the Massena plant from South America through the Port of Mobile, AL. Today, the plant is still supplied by unit trains through the Port of Baltimore, with a total capacity equal to a seaway-sized ship. Unit trains also compete for shipping grain, coal, and steel products, potentially impacting seaway traffic. New waterborne routes for shipping crude oil from regions like North Dakota and Texas have emerged, including the intracoastal waterway in Texas and Louisiana. The U.S. and Canadian refineries receive crude oil by pipeline, with no crude oil shipped on the Great Lakes or the seaway. Petroleum products are shipped within the Great Lakes, while Canada exports and imports through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Despite the repeal of the ban on exporting crude oil, most export activity occurs at Texas ports, not affecting shipping volumes on the seaway. The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway are not used for shipping crude oil due to environmental concerns. Exporting natural gas by ship requires costly conversion to LNG, with former U.S. import terminals being converted to export terminals at a cost of $6-10 billion each. Most terminals are located on the Gulf of Mexico, with one already operational in Texas. The St. Lawrence Seaway is at a disadvantage for LNG exports due to existing pipeline networks in Texas and Louisiana. The drop in natural gas prices has led to increased investment in U.S. chemical and plastics manufacturing, with new plant investments mainly focused in Louisiana and Texas. The proximity of natural gas resources in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins to the Great Lakes region could benefit nearby chemical manufacturers. The Great Lakes region could benefit chemical manufacturers and induce chemical shipments on the seaway. A major producer and distributor of natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins shipped products by rail, pipeline, and truck, with exports to various continents via U.S. East Coast ports. Waterways are useful for shipping large equipment, while railroads have weight limits and cargo width restrictions. Companies in the Great Lakes region ship products like boilers and windmill blades by water. The Great Lakes region ships oversize/project cargo by water, but waterways are not price competitive for domestic shipments of oversized goods. Waterways are only used for mega-size loads that are too big for highway or railroad transport. Shippers on the GLSLS use waterways because they have no alternative, not because it is an attractive option. This poses a challenge for the Opportunity Belt strategy. The Opportunity Belt strategy faces challenges due to changes in U.S. manufacturing towards smaller, more flexible plants, reducing reliance on waterborne transport. Traditional large-scale manufacturing operations are becoming less common as companies seek cost minimization and adaptability to changing demands. The Great Lakes region is seeing a shift in waterfront development, with some communities focusing on industries not tied to waterborne shipping. For example, a food company in Rochester consolidated its operations at a Lake Ontario location for freshwater access, while data centers are attracted to the region for its climate benefits. Some harbor communities are debating between reindustrialization or focusing on recreation and residential construction for their future. The largest potential capital project on the GLSLS is the construction of a second lock parallel to the Poe Lock at Sault Ste. Marie for transporting Minnesota iron ore to steel mills within the Great Lakes. The need for a second lock is for redundancy in case of emergency repairs or sabotage. The estimated cost for the project is around $600 million, with plans studied since the early 1980s. Despite a forecasted tonnage of 134 million tons by 2010, actual tonnage was only 73 million tons. In 2009, cofferdams were built at smaller locks for draining as a first step. The construction of a second lock parallel to the Poe Lock at Sault Ste. Marie is a major capital project on the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System. In addition to this project, dredging of harbors and channels for depth maintenance and disposal of contaminated lake-bottom sediments are also significant funding needs. The current focus is on preservation and maintenance of the infrastructure rather than capacity expansion, as per a 2007 binational study. New disposal facilities are planned as existing ones reach capacity. The 1970s saw Congress funding demonstration projects to show the feasibility of winter operations in the Great Lakes, particularly for iron ore pellets which do not freeze like iron ore rock. This was in response to the economic and environmental concerns that had previously deterred efforts to keep the seaway open during winter months or expand the locks. Iron ore pellets could be sourced from Michigan's Upper Peninsula and shipped from Escanaba to avoid interruptions due to the annual closure of the Soo Locks. In the 1970s, Congress funded projects to extend navigation through winter on the Great Lakes using air hoses and icebreakers. However, the projects faced opposition from waterfront landowners due to issues like interference with intake pipes, shoreline erosion, and ecological disturbances. Concerns about fuel spills and cost-effectiveness led to the abandonment of the air bubbler system and icebreaking missions. In the early 2000s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers evaluated expanding the seaway and Great Lakes channels and ports. Congress requested the study in 1999, which suggested economic benefits but faced criticism for flawed freight forecasts and environmental concerns. Congress did not provide funds for a feasibility study to further evaluate the project. The 2007 binational study recommended against expanding the seaway system, with the Army Corps issuing a supplement in 2010 concurring with the recommendation. Currently, the SLSDC and SLSMC are implementing a 10-year, $186 million asset renewal program to maintain the locks and seaway infrastructure. The SLSDC and SLSMC are conducting a 10-year asset renewal program to maintain seaway infrastructure. SLSDC spent $15 million in FY2015, funded by Congress from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The SLSMC spent CAD$117 million on physical assets. The HMTF, funded by the Harbor Maintenance Tax, provides $35 million annually for SLSDC and $100-150 million for Corps of Engineers' dredging and maintenance. The Harbor Maintenance Tax (HMT) is collected at U.S. coastal ports and benefits the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway system. The low cargo value on the system results in minimal HMT revenue, with most funding likely coming from coastal ports. The Seaway Management Corporation charges tolls at locks, generating annual receipts of CAD$63-72 million. Tolls are planned to increase slightly each year as part of a strategy to improve the system. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation plans to increase tolls slightly each year to improve financial self-sufficiency. Tolls are based on vessel size and cargo type, with higher charges for higher-value commodities. Lockage fees range from CAD$1.70 to CAD$1.80 per ton, resulting in CAD$40,000 to CAD$60,000 in tolls for a one-way voyage through the entire seaway. The SLSDC implemented reduced tolling for new shippers on the seaway, originally charging tolls to recoup construction costs. Congress forgave the SLSDC's debt in 1970 and 1982 to prevent toll rate increases. In response to Canada's decision to forgive the debt of the Canadian Seaway Authority and reduce toll rates, Congress directed the SLSDC to use toll revenues to operate and maintain the seaway. The Harbor Maintenance Tax and Trust Fund replaced tolls as the means of funding the SLSDC's costs in 1994. In 2006, the George W. Bush Administration proposed reinstating tolls on the two U.S. locks to generate revenue. The George W. Bush Administration proposed reinstating tolls on the two U.S. locks to generate revenue, with toll revenue of $17 million per year. The Administration believed tolls would provide a stable source of funding for the SLSDC, functioning more like a private corporation. Congress showed no interest in this proposal, citing concerns that higher tolls might drive cargo off the seaway. The seaway is a concern due to minimal user charges on competing waterways. Barges on the Ohio and Mississippi River system have a fuel tax of 29 cents per gallon since 1978, generating $100 million annually. This tax covers 5% to 15% of the federal government's inland waterway system costs. The U.S. inland waterway system is no longer free but heavily supported by public funds. User fee charges on the seaway versus the U.S. inland waterway system influence route attractiveness. Financing the seaway with cargo fees faces a paradox. The paradox of financing the seaway with cargo fees lies in attracting higher-value cargoes that can fund the waterway but are difficult to attract due to transit time and inventory costs. Low-value cargo shippers are more likely to use the waterway, requiring a high volume, low margin strategy for the SLSDC. Raising more funds necessitates a greater volume of cargo through the seaway, making price competitiveness crucial. The possibility of revenue from those benefiting from waterway improvements is often debated in relation to inland river user fees. The debate over user fees for inland river projects often involves the question of who benefits, such as water quality improvements, recreation, and flood prevention. While barge shippers often raise this issue, Congress has not required fees from non-navigation beneficiaries at the federal level. In Florida, a property tax funds the management of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, generating $22 million in revenue in the most recent year. The Navigation District in Florida manages a waterway with a $72 million balance, using funds for dredging, marinas, and boat ramps. They plan to spend $40 million on maintenance and $15 million on infrastructure improvements this year. New York State's interest in financially supporting the seaway's development is questioned, as the U.S. portion is within its borders, originally for hydropower purposes. The New York Power Authority oversees hydropower facilities and dams at Massena, not the SLSDC. The SLSDC has no ability to generate revenues from hydropower facilities maintained by the NYPA. Revenues from these facilities may be used to maintain the New York State Canal System, which the NYPA is responsible for financing. The canal system can handle modern freight barges and has a maintenance budget of $55 million per year. If New York attracts shippers back to its canal system, toll rates could influence seaway toll rates. Congress has authorized numerous federal waterway projects, leading to delays in project execution due to insufficient funds. In response, the 2014 water projects authorization act included provisions for nonfederal entities to fund or initiate projects under the guidance of the Corps of Engineers. This pilot program allows for public-private partnerships to fund Corps projects, representing a departure from their usual methods. The Corps of Engineers has only initiated one project under the new provisions for public-private partnerships (P3s), leading to frustration from some Members of Congress. The House Appropriations Committee directed the corps to not start any additional P3 projects until comprehensive policy guidance is issued. P3s are seen as a potential funding source for dredging recreational harbors on the Great Lakes, and transferring operations to private operators could bring in private-sector capital and reduce costs, following Canada's example in 1998. In 1998, Canada transferred management of the seaway to a not-for-profit corporation controlled by Canadian shippers and carriers. The corporation has a 20-year contract with the ability to increase tolls by 2% annually. Private management reduced staff by more than half to increase efficiency and competitiveness. The goal is to offer a lower-cost alternative to attract shippers to the system. The GLSLS aims to provide a cost-effective option for shippers compared to competitors. Measures are being taken to enhance transit efficiency, such as automated vessel positioning in locks and real-time draft measurement for increased cargo capacity. Electronic navigation advancements could potentially replace physical markers with virtual ones using GPS and the Automatic Identification System. The SLSDC utilizes GPS, AIS, and electronic charts to maintain buoys and aids to navigation on the seaway, reducing costs. Foreign trading ships hire local pilots for navigation assistance in harbors. Hiring five pilots is necessary for a ship navigating from the St. Lawrence River mouth to Port of Duluth, MN. The Coast Guard increased pilotage rates for American pilots to $326,000 per year, causing controversy as it represents a 58% increase. Great Lakes ports argue that this cost exceeds a ship's daily operating cost, impacting the competitiveness of the Great Lakes navigation system. The Great Lakes ports are challenging the U.S. Coast Guard's pilotage rate methodology, arguing it violates the Administrative Procedure Act. The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation is seeking to eliminate the requirement for ships to hire pilots on certain segments of the river. Waterborne shipping in the Great Lakes competes with railroads, particularly in transporting Mesabi iron ore to steel mills. The Great Lakes ports have a long-term advantage over rail service due to their 24/7 operation, self-unloading ships with bow and stern thrusters, and no need for pilots. The vertical integration of shipping operations and the nature of the commodity contribute to this advantage. Great Lakes ports have an advantage over rail service with 24/7 operation, self-unloading ships, and no need for pilots. The vertical integration of shipping operations and the nature of the commodity contribute to this efficiency. Some iron mines are owned by steel companies that handle the entire shipping process, but GLSLS shipping could potentially compete with railroads and trucks by offering similar efficiencies."
