    "content": "The \"AMT and Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2001\" allows for the deduction of state and local income taxes against the alternative minimum tax. It also permits the deduction of state and local general sales taxes in place of state and local income taxes. The \"AMT and Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2001\" allows taxpayers to elect to deduct state and local general sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes for the taxable year. The \"AMT and Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2001\" allows taxpayers to deduct state and local general sales taxes imposed at one rate on a broad range of items, including food, clothing, medical supplies, and motor vehicles. The tax does not apply to some items, but this exclusion does not affect the tax's classification as a general sales tax. The tax deduction rules specify that items taxed at lower rates than the general rate are not considered when determining if the tax is imposed at one rate. No deduction is allowed for general sales tax imposed at a rate different from the general rate, except for items with a lower tax rate. Compensating use taxes are treated as general sales taxes. The term 'compensating use tax' refers to a tax imposed on the use, storage, or consumption of an item that is complementary to a general sales tax. A special rule applies to motor vehicles where the general rate of tax is used, disregarding any excess rate. Separately stated general sales taxes are also addressed. The IRS allows for separately stated general sales taxes to be treated as paid by the consumer, not in connection with their business. The deduction amount is determined by tables set by the Secretary. The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, reflecting average consumption by taxpayers on a State-by-State basis."
