A new method called instance-aware GAN (InstaGAN) addresses challenges in multi-instance translation tasks by incorporating instance information and maintaining permutation invariance. The proposed method includes a context preserving loss and a sequential mini-batch inference/training technique to improve performance. The proposed method in the current chunk enhances network generalization for multiple instances in image datasets. Cross-domain generation tasks in machine learning, such as image synthesis and text style transfer, have benefited from unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated in challenging cases, with code and results available on GitHub. The proposed method, called InstaGAN, aims to extend image-to-image translation to challenging tasks involving significant shape changes or multiple target instances.

Unlike previous methods, our approach allows for multi-instance transfiguration tasks, influencing future research in the field. The goal is to learn mappings across different image domains, transforming target scene elements while preserving original contexts through unsupervised translation using unpaired samples. Our approach, InstaGAN, enhances image-to-image translation by incorporating instance attributes to disentangle different instances in the image. This is achieved by learning joint-mappings between attribute-augmented spaces X \u00d7A and Y \u00d7B using generative adversarial networks (GANs). InstaGAN enhances image-to-image translation by incorporating instance attributes using generative adversarial networks (GANs). It involves training two coupled mappings G XY and G YX with cycle-consistency loss to achieve permutation equivariance and invariance. Training two mappings is not essential, and a single mapping can also be designed. The model architecture involves training two coupled generators, G, to encode and translate instance attributes for image generation. The attributes are aggregated into a permutation-invariant set feature for translation. The model architecture involves training two coupled generators, G, to encode and translate instance attributes for image generation. The image and attribute features are concatenated and fed to the generators. The discriminator encodes both x and a to determine if the pair is from the domain. The representation in the discriminator is permutation-invariant to the instances and is fed to an adversarial discriminator. The joint encoding of image x and instance attributes a is crucial for the network to learn their relation. Using separate encodings may mislead the generator. Our approach disentangles output instances while maintaining original layouts. Various neural networks can be used for sub-network architectures. Detailed architectures are described in the experiments. Our experiments focus on image-to-image translation models aiming to preserve original contexts while translating domains. We incorporate domain loss for style consistency and content loss for maintaining original content. Additionally, a new context preserving loss using segmentation information is proposed. The training loss is formally defined for optimization. The GAN loss, proposed for generative modeling, involves training a generator and discriminator to distinguish between real and fake data. Variants of the GAN loss exist, with the LSGAN scheme known for stable performance. Additional losses like cycle-consistency and identity mapping ensure original information is preserved during translation. A new context preserving loss enforces translation of instances while maintaining the background. InstaGAN introduces a context preserving loss for translating instances while preserving background details. The weight is adjusted based on the similarity of background pixels in original and translated images. This loss, along with other parameters, contributes to the total loss function of InstaGAN.

The sequential scheme involves translating image-mask pairs iteratively, aggregating translated mini-batches to produce a final output of translated images and instance masks. A sequential training algorithm is also proposed for this process. The proposed architecture in InstaGAN allows for multiple instances translation while preserving background details. To address GPU memory limitations, a sequential training technique is introduced, enabling training with many instances without increasing memory usage. This approach involves applying GAN loss to aggregated mini-batches of samples to align images and masks effectively. Sequential training improves generalization performance and translation quality, even with few instances, by utilizing data augmentation effects. In experiments, instances were divided into mini-batches based on spatial sizes, showing better performance in decreasing order. InstaGAN was compared with CycleGAN on various datasets, with InstaGAN using two networks for images and masks. Visualizations merged all instance masks for compactness. See Appendix B for detailed settings. Our method, InstaGAN, outperforms CycleGAN by generating reasonable shapes of target instances while preserving original contexts through a context preserving loss. For example, in the sheep\u2194giraffe translation, InstaGAN maintains the original layout and looking direction of instances. Additionally, our method allows for controlling the instances to translate by conditioning the input. More experimental results can be found in Appendix E and the code and results are available at https://github.com/sangwoomo/instagan. Our method, InstaGAN, surpasses CycleGAN by preserving original contexts and allowing control over the instances to translate. It reduces false positives/negatives and enables context preserving loss. The method also performs well with predicted segmentation, reducing the need for mask labels. Additionally, the translation performance is quantitatively evaluated using a pretrained classifier. Our method, InstaGAN, outperforms CycleGAN in classification experiments, achieving 23.2% accuracy for the pants\u2192shorts task compared to CycleGAN's 8.5%. The method consists of the InstaGAN architecture, context preserving loss L ctx, and sequential minibatch inference/training technique. Each component is added progressively to the baseline model, CycleGAN. Our architecture, unlike CycleGAN+Seg, preserves every instance and disentangles better. The context preserving loss improves background preservation and translation results. Sequential translation enhances generalization performance and translation results on few instances. The effectiveness of sequential translation in training and inference is shown in FIG0. The sequential translation method, denoted as \"Seq\", is more effective in both training and inference compared to the one-step approach, denoted as \"One\". The sequential training involves training two instances twice, resulting in images of four instances. On the other hand, the one-step training only considers two instances due to machine limitations. In terms of inference, the sequential algorithm translates two instances at each iteration, while the one-step approach translates the entire set at once. The sequential method shows better results in terms of generalization performance and avoids blurry outcomes caused by stacking noise during iterations. Our proposed method incorporates instance attributes for successful image-to-image translation, including challenging tasks like multi-instance transfiguration. The use of set-structured side information has potential for other cross-domain generation tasks. We utilized CycleGAN network architectures, specifically ResNet 9-blocks generator BID18 BID13 and PatchGAN discriminator. ResNet generator consists of downsampling and upsampling blocks, with a focus on downsampling and residual blocks. The proposed method incorporates instance attributes for image-to-image translation using CycleGAN network architectures. The ResNet generator includes downsampling and upsampling blocks, while the PatchGAN discriminator consists of 5 convolutional layers. Instance Normalization (IN) and Spectral Normalization (SN) were applied for improved performance. The study applied Spectral Normalization (SN) to improve performance in image-to-image translation using CycleGAN. SN was used for generators but did not show improvement in the setting. The experiments used specific parameters for loss and optimization, with training details such as batch size, GPUs, and learning rate schedules specified for different datasets. The study evaluated image-to-image translation using CycleGAN with Spectral Normalization (SN) for generators. Image and mask adaptation to target instances was tracked over epochs, showing smooth transitions. Classification scores were compared for CCP and COCO datasets, with COCO dataset facing false positive issues. Masked classification score was used to address this problem, showing comparable results between CycleGAN and the proposed method. Our method outperformed CycleGAN in masked classification score by reducing false positive issues. Qualitative results in high resolution images show the effectiveness of our instance-aware approach compared to CycleGAN+Seg. Our method avoids translation failures and shape distortion, producing better shape results. Our instance-aware method demonstrates superior shape results compared to nearest training neighbors, confirming generalization ability. Translation results show that our model learns a mapping that fits target instances well. In contrast, a simple crop & attach baseline fails to capture semantics and fit instances with original contexts. Our method demonstrates good reconstruction and translation results, preserving the original context well."
