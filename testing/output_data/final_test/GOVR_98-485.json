    "content": "Members of Congress were concerned about allegations that U.S. firms provided expertise to China for its ballistic missile and space programs. The Justice Department started a criminal investigation into Loral Space and Communications Ltd. and Hughes Electronics Corp. for violating export control laws by sharing findings with China on a rocket explosion in 1996. This sharing of expertise could improve China's ballistic missiles. Several classified government studies concluded that U.S. technical assistance to China improved the guidance systems on its ballistic missiles for the People's Liberation Army (PLA). President Clinton issued a waiver of sanctions in 1998, allowing the export of technology despite opposition from Justice. Political considerations influenced the decision, with Loral's chairman being a major donor to the Democratic Party. Congressional investigations and U.S. intelligence confirmed these allegations. The CRS Report discusses security concerns regarding China obtaining secret information on U.S. nuclear weapons and modernizing its ballistic missiles. Congressional concerns also include the U.S. space industry and satellite exports to China since 1988. Key questions involve Congress overseeing satellite exports and weighing the benefits and costs. The CRS Report raises questions about the benefits and costs of satellite exports to China for U.S. economic and security interests, including concerns about military applications and technology transfers. It also questions the policy of allowing exports of satellites to China since the Reagan Administration and the adequacy of controls and monitoring on exports of U.S.-origin satellites and technology. The CRS Report raises questions about U.S. policy on satellite exports to China, including concerns about military applications and technology transfers. It questions the adequacy of controls on exports of U.S.-origin satellites and technology to China, and whether commercial space cooperation should be used as leverage in U.S. policy on weapons nonproliferation. China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) has been China's commercial space launch company since 1986. China's defense-related aerospace industry is overseen by China Aerospace Corporation (CASC), which includes China Great Wall and CALT. CASC, established in 1993, has developed strategic and tactical ballistic missiles, space launch vehicles, and satellites. The PLA controls satellite launches, with China launching its first satellite in 1970 and 40 domestic satellites by 1997. China has launched 40 domestic satellites by the end of 1997, including reconnaissancesatellites, meteorological satellites, communications satellites, and experimental satellites. They have used satellites to enhance national defense, economy, and international prestige. China Great Wall launched a foreign satellite for the first time in 1990 and has since expanded its foreign business with U.S. firms. China seeks foreign capital and technology for domestic satellite research and development to reduce reliance on purchasing foreign satellites. The PRC's Dongfanghong satellites matched advanced satellites in capacities but lagged in navigation and stabilization technologies. China faced embarrassing failed satellite launches until 1996, including rocket stalls and explosions destroying satellites built by Hughes and Loral. Despite initial setbacks, China reported 27 consecutive successful space launches from 1996 to 2002. China's successful space launches from 1996 to 2002 raised questions about U.S. technology contributions. China's aerospace industry shifted to working with foreign companies to improve rockets and satellites, reassuring insurance companies and manufacturers. Security concerns arose regarding the use of satellite-launch technology for China's ballistic missiles. China's Long March rockets, derived from China's EastWind intercontinental ballistic missiles, have been used since 1970 to launch satellites, including foreign satellites since 1990. The Long March boosters are also deployed as China's CSS-3 and CSS-4 ICBMs. The rockets have been developed parallel to the modernization of both SLVs and ICBMs, with CSS-3 serving as the booster for LM-1 and CSS-4 for LM-2, LM-3, and LM-4 series of SLVs. Launch facilities are located at PLA bases, such as the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province. The LM-1 and LM-2 series of SLVs have been boosted by CSS-3 and CSS-4 ICBMs, respectively. China's agreements with the US regarding technology safeguards for satellite launches have been a point of concern. Some argued that launching satellites from China benefited U.S. satellite manufacturers, leading to a Department of Justice investigation into Loral's involvement in a satellite launch failure in 1996. The Department of State suspected a violation and referred the case for investigation. In 1997, China signed a $200 million contract to buy the Chinasat-8 satellite from Loral. Loral was confident that China Great Wall had addressed engineering issues to launch Chinasat-8. Loral denied allegations of providing missile guidance technology to China and stated they did not advise on fixing Long March rocket problems. China Aerospace Corporation and China Great Wall used foreign technology to improve their rockets. The Chinese conducted an independent investigation into a launch failure in February 1996, attributing it to a defective solder joint. Loral formed an \"Independent Review Committee\" to review the investigation, which agreed with the Chinese conclusion without conducting tests. Further testing by China was recommended for certainty. Loral's engineers discussed the committee's work with U.S. officials and stated that no sensitive information was shared with China. Wah L. Lim chaired the \"Independent Review Committee\" to study China's technical evaluation of a rocket accident. The first meeting was in Palo Alto, CA, and the second in Beijing, with PRC aerospace engineers present. The Independent Review Committee, chaired by Wah L. Lim, held meetings in Beijing, China with PRC aerospace engineers attending. They conducted technical interviews with over 100 engineers, generating data and analyses. Loral admitted to providing a report to China before consulting with US export licensing authorities, notifying the State and Defense Departments once the breach was discovered. In 1996, Loral notified the US government about its communications with China and stated that it did not believe any of its employees acted illegally or damaged national security. The company denied any personal involvement by its chairman in the matter and refuted any connection between a launch failure in 1996 and a Presidential waiver for another satellite in 1998. The export license for the latest launch (Chinasat-8) applied strict prohibitions on technology transfer. Loral emphasized compliance with export control laws. Clinton Administration officials stated that strict security measures prevented any assistance to China's launch facilities. Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch testified that effective export controls on dual-use technology protect US security interests. After the licensing jurisdiction was transferred to Commerce in November 1996, three export licenses for satellites to be launched from China were issued with the approval of all agencies. Classified studies raised concerns about US firms aiding China's ballistic missile program, with a report from the Defense Technology Security Administration stating that Loral and Hughes enhanced China's missile systems, harming US national security. The firms were also suspected of improving China's quality control and diagnostic techniques. The U.S. firms were suspected of assisting China in improving quality control and diagnostic techniques for aerospace engineers to detect problems in guidance systems for missiles. Concerns were raised in a classified report at the Air Force's National Air Intelligence Center in March 1997, supported by the State Department's Intelligence and Research Bureau. The Justice Department initiated a criminal investigation in September 1997, with additional concerns about a Presidential waiver for the Chinasat-8 satellite in February 1998. The investigation into Loral's case could be impacted by a waiver, with little public information on export licenses for technical assistance agreements. Two incidents occurred with the Clinton Administration, including a dinner in Beijing and an award for outstanding security performance to Loral. The Justice Department found no evidence of corrupt influence by Loral's chairman in approving a satellite export to China. Senator Specter highlighted a memo suggesting no investigation was warranted despite a large donation to the Democratic National Committee. In response to allegations of political favors involving the President, LaBella recommended an independent prosecutor be appointed, but Reno denied the request. The George W. Bush Administration negotiated civil settlements with Loral and Hughes to avoid criminal charges from the Justice Department. Loral reached a $20 million settlement, paying a $14 million civil fine to the State Department and investing $6 million in export control compliance. Loral strengthened its export control compliance program with $2 million spent, as the Justice Department ended its criminal investigation and declined to pursue further. Concerns arose about China launching U.S.-built satellites, potentially aiding its missile modernization. Technology used in satellite launches could also be applied to military programs, including ICBMs. U.S. intelligence gathered information on China's ICBM program from data on PRC space launch vehicles. China's space program has been developing alongside its missile capabilities, with concerns about the future deployment of ICBMs with MIRVs. The PLA could potentially deploy up to 100 ICBMs with 1,000 warheads by 2015. China has the technical capability to develop a MIRV system but has not deployed them yet. The US has raised concerns about China's acquisition of nuclear weapon secrets and its potential to develop advanced missile systems. China first decided to develop MIRVs for deployment in 1970, with research and development on MIRVs resuming in 1983 as part of the DF-5 modification program. China also planned to add a new solid-propellant third stage to introduce a new LM-2E/TS SLV capable of launching up to 12 satellites. Motorola's use of a PRC-developed multi-satellite dispenser on a variant of the LM-2C to launch two Iridium satellites at a time helped the PRC develop MIRV capability. A classified study by the Air Force's National Air Intelligence Center concluded that the \"smart dispenser\" could be modified to deploy multiple re-entry vehicles. However, there was no evidence that China was using the dispenser for warheads, and the PRC's multiple warhead system would be less accurate than U.S. and Russian systems. Motorola provided data to allow the PRC to attach satellites to the dispenser without U.S. help. The Cox Committee found that Motorola did not provide the PRC with information on how to design the Smart Dispenser, but the PRC built it to Motorola's specifications. Concerns were raised about PRC launches of satellites built by Hughes in 1995 and 1996 that were not monitored by the Defense Department. Jan Lodal testified that three launches were not monitored because they did not require State Department licenses. The Director of DTSA testified to the Senate on unmonitored satellite launches in China. Despite concerns, no evidence of technology transfer contributing to China's military capabilities was found. Hughes claimed security measures prevented unauthorized transfers, but a former Pentagon official noted employees' carelessness in discussing sensitive information. Some experts emphasized the importance of monitoring technical exchanges over launches. Senator Kyl highlighted lack of monitoring in pre-launch technical exchanges for certain satellite projects. Congress and the Justice Department investigated Hughes' review of a PRC launch failure. UnderSecretary of Commerce testified before Congress on security issues. In June 1998, UnderSecretary of Commerce William Reinsch acknowledged that Hughes provided launch failure analysis to China after the Apstar-2 launch failure in 1995. The analysis was conducted without the Chinese launch service provider's participation to satisfy insurance requirements. The Department of Commerce reviewed the analysis and found it contained only authorized information. The unclassified report was shared with Western insurance companies and later with the Chinese launch service provider. Director David Tarbell confirmed that the Department of Defense did not monitor the situation. The Department of Defense did not monitor the launch failure analysis provided by Hughes to China in 1995. The Commerce Department did not consult with State or DOD before releasing the report to China. The authority for additional licenses was later specified to be with the Department of State. DOD's DTSA and NAIC issued an initial assessment of the documents provided by Commerce in 1998. Commerce did not consult with DOD or State according to the unclassified report. The report concluded that Hughes' technical exchanges with China raised national security concerns regarding violating standards and potentially contributing to China's missile capabilities. The State Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls completed a report in December 1998, stating that Hughes provided technical lessons after a launch failure in January 1995. Hughes provided technical lessons to China after a launch failure in January 1995, including information on improving rocket reliability, mathematical models, launch operations, satellite designs, and diagnostics for rocket and satellite improvements. This raised national security concerns about potential contributions to China's missile capabilities. Hughes faced criticism for flaws in PRC modeling of aerodynamic loads on the rocket fairing. A task force led by former Senator Sam Nunn recommended best practices for export control compliance. Hughes began negotiations for a civil settlement after Loral reached a similar agreement with the State Department. The Department of State charged Hughes Electronics in December 2002. The State Department charged Hughes Electronics Corporation and Boeing Satellite Systems with 123 violations of export control laws related to technology transfers to China after satellite launch failures. The companies were criticized for not taking the violations seriously, unlike Loral, and failing to prevent future violations. The State Department charged Hughes Electronics Corporation and Boeing Satellite Systems with 123 violations of export control laws related to technology transfers to China after satellite launch failures. Hughes submitted a munitions export license application without disclosing the interpreter's connection to a PLA Lieutenant General. A settlement was reached with a civil penalty of $32 million, including past expenditures and future investments to strengthen export control compliance programs. Lockheed Martin was charged by the Department of State with 30 violations of the Arms Export Control Act, but they denied any wrongdoing. They acknowledged the seriousness of the offenses and expressed regret for not obtaining export licenses. In 1994, Lockheed Martin assessed a kick motor for the Asiasat-2 satellite, owned by Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company. The State Department accused Lockheed of sending the unedited technical assessment to Asiasat before the Defense Department reviewed it. China denied the charge, claiming they developed the kick motor independently. Lockheed Martin was accused of failing to inform the Pentagon about sending unedited copies of a report to Asiasat, violating export controls by sharing technical assistance with China Great Wall. The Department of State reached a settlement with Lockheed, imposing total penalties of $13 million, with $8 million to be paid over four years and $5 million for setting up a computer control system for improved oversight. The State Department settled with Lockheed Martin for violating export controls by sharing technical assistance with China. The information transferred was deemed inappropriate and had the potential for missile development. China's modernization of nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and space systems has raised concerns about military benefits. President Jiang Zemin declared in 1991 about the military applications of satellites. President Jiang Zemin declared in 1991 the need for a telecommunications system usable for both military and civil purposes in China. Officials in the Clinton Administration emphasized differences between PRC SLVs and ICBMs, with no authorized missile technology transfers to China. Testimony in 1998 stated that satellite launches did not benefit current generation PRC ICBMs, but potential improvements to new PRC ICBMs were not elaborated on publicly. Admiral Joseph Prueher stated that transfers of missile technology for launching U.S. satellites in China only slightly improved PRC ICBMs. John Pike highlighted differences between China's ballistic missiles and Long March SLVs, noting that the latter experienced more stress during ascent due to their longer length and larger nose cones for satellites. Deploying two satellites from one Long March was also noted as different from launching MIRVs. The comparison between China's ballistic missiles and Long March SLVs highlighted differences in stress during ascent and the deployment of multiple satellites. The CIA compared technology applicability in SLVs and ICBMs, showing similarities in categories with the main distinction being the presence of warheads in missiles. Henry Sokolski argued that satellite transfers have aided China in perfecting its technology. The Bush (I) Administration argued that satellite transfers helped China improve its military rocketry, including intangible technologies critical for satellite placement and missile launches. These technologies included load analysis, guidance data packages, rocket propellant certification, control design validation, and quality assurance. China used multi-satellite dispensers for launching satellites, which could be modified for multiple-warhead dispensers, aiding in MIRV capability development for ICBMs. Experts noted that components and expertise used in SLV research and development were crucial for China's advancements. The research and development of SLVs involved technology overlaps with ballistic missiles, including launching multiple satellites and delivering multiple warheads. Similar technology included upper stage control systems, satellite dispensers, load analysis, solid-fuel engines, and kick motors. However, the capability to launch multiple satellites did not equate to the ability to deliver MIRVs, as it was more challenging to deliver multiple reentry vehicles into planned trajectories. Launching multiple satellites is different from delivering multiple warheads with MIRV capability. Reentry vehicles for MIRVs require rocket motors that can stop and restart. The State Department warned that assisting China in space launch could enhance its missile development. China's organizations have faced U.S. sanctions for the Tiananmen crackdown and missile proliferation. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1990 and FY1991 (P.L. 101-246) required suspensions in various programs related to exports, including satellites for launch by China. Presidential waivers were allowed for these suspensions if it was deemed to be in the national interest. Sanctions related to missile proliferation were imposed by the George H.W. Bush Administration on China for transferring technology to Pakistan. Bush imposed sanctions on China for transferring technology to Pakistan related to the M-11 missile, enforcing the MTCR. The sanctions affected high-speed computers, satellites, and missile technology. President Bush lifted the sanctions in 1992 after China agreed to follow MTCR guidelines. The Clinton Administration later imposed similar sanctions. The Clinton Administration imposed category II sanctions on China in 1993 for transferring M-11 related equipment to Pakistan. Despite lobbying efforts from the U.S. aerospace industry, the sanctions were waived in 1994 after China agreed not to export certain missiles. Questions about PRC missile proliferation persisted until 2000. The Clinton Administration imposed sanctions on China in 1993 for missile proliferation to Pakistan. In 1998, they proposed supporting China in missile nonproliferation in exchange for cooperation. In 2000, an agreement on missile nonproliferation was announced between the US and China. China has no intention of assisting any country in developing ballistic missiles for nuclear weapons. The US imposed sanctions on PRC entities for contributing to missile proliferation in Pakistan and Iran, while agreeing to resume processing. The United States agreed to resume processing licenses for exporting satellites to China and to discuss extending the 1995 U.S.-China Agreement Regarding International Trade in Commercial Launch Services. Secretary of State Powell confirmed outstanding issues with China's fulfillment of a missile nonproliferation agreement and expert talks were held to address this. Additional work was deemed necessary to clarify China's position. On September 1, 2001, the State Department imposed sanctions on a PRC company, China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation (CMEC), for proliferating missile technology to Pakistan. The sanctions, imposed under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and Export Administration Act, also applied to Pakistan's National Development Complex, denying licenses for exporting satellites to China for use or launch by its aerospace entities. The State Department imposed sanctions on a PRC defense industrial entity (NORINCO) for missile proliferation, effectively banning satellite exports to China for 2 more years. China has had no commercial satellite launches since 2000. Presidents Bush and Clinton issued waivers for satellite projects based on \"national interest.\" The US has issued waivers for satellite projects to be exported to China based on national interest, allowing the export of US-origin satellites or components subject to export controls. The policy is tied to missile proliferation concerns, with waivers being granted for satellites used by China. The Clinton Administration granted waivers for satellite exports to China despite missile proliferation concerns, including for Australian and Swedish satellites. Congress passed the Defense Authorization Act for FY1999 with provisions restricting blanket waivers for post-Tiananmen sanctions on satellite exports to China. The Clinton Administration granted waivers for satellite exports to China despite missile proliferation concerns. Congress passed the Defense Authorization Act for FY1999 with provisions restricting blanket waivers for post-Tiananmen sanctions on satellite exports to China. Sanctions for exports of satellites to be launched by China were required to be certified by the President to Congress at least 15 days before exporting missile equipment or technology. Presidential waivers of post-Tiananmen sanctions for exports of satellites or parts to China required a detailed justification based on national interest. Since the Reagan Administration's decision in September 1988 to allow U.S.-built satellites to be launched from China, concerns about national security implications have been periodically expressed by Members of Congress. In April 1998, press reports on Loral and Hughes led to hearings by the 105th Congress to examine allegations of corporate misconduct and weaknesses in U.S. policy. Various PRC state-owned companies invested in a cooperative satellite project between Daimler-Benz Aerospace and China Aerospace Corp. Several committees held hearings in 1998 regarding national security implications of U.S.-built satellites being launched from China, including the Joint Economic Committee, Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Senate Intelligence Committee, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House National Security/International Relations Committees, House Science Committee, and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. In 1998, multiple committees held hearings on national security implications of U.S.-built satellites launched from China. The Cox Committee, created by House Speaker Gingrich, investigated allegations related to the case. The committee, also known as the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China, had nine members from both parties. The Cox Committee, consisting of five Republicans and four Democrats, conducted a six-month investigation on national security implications of U.S.-built satellites launched from China. The bipartisan committee unanimously approved a 700-page classified report and extended its work with the Administration on a declassified version. Disagreements arose between the Select Committee and the White House on the recommendations. The House did not vote to release the report without the Administration's approval. On March 24, 1999, H.Res. 129 was passed to extend the Select Committee on China until April 30, 1999. Representatives Cox and Dicks briefed President Clinton on April 22, 1999, about the committee's findings. H.Res. 153 was agreed upon on April 29, 1999, to further extend the committee until May 14, 1999. On May 25, 1999, the Cox Committee released a declassified report on China's technology transfers, concluding that China has been acquiring advanced American technology for over 20 years, harming U.S. national security. The report recommended tightening export controls and security measures. The Cox Committee recommended tightening export controls and security at national labs to address concerns about China acquiring advanced American technology, particularly in nuclear weapons technology. The committee did not focus on political donations or request new investigations into companies like Loral and Hughes. The FBI investigated incidents involving China receiving data from U.S. labs, including the W-88 nuclear warhead case from Los Alamos National Lab in the mid-1980s. The Cox Committee's report highlighted a major counterintelligence failure at Los Alamos and other national labs regarding China's acquisition of nuclear weapon secrets. U.S. intelligence confirmed PRC's espionage activities in 1999 and concluded in 2000 that classified information on U.S. ballistic missiles and reentry vehicles had been obtained. The PRC's theft of U.S. missile and space technology was also noted, enhancing their military capabilities. After three failed satellite launches, U.S. satellite makers transferred missile design information to China without required export licenses, improving the reliability of PRC rockets for launching satellites with civilian and military purposes. The firms also aided in the design and reliability of future PRC ballistic missiles, violating U.S. export control laws. Specifically, Hughes recommended improvements to the fairing in 1993 and 1995, while Loral and Hughes helped improve rocket guidance in 1996 without the legally required license. The committee's report revealed that Hughes engaged in technical discussions with China without U.S. government monitors, leading to significant improvements in China's spacelift program and missile technology. Additionally, Loral and Hughes aided in improving rocket guidance in 1996, violating export control laws. The improvements to China's missile program, including increased production efficiency and improved reliability, were recommended by an Independent Review Committee. The Long March 3B rocket's guidance system was deemed adaptable for use in China's planned intercontinental ballistic missiles. Concerns arose after a 1996 explosion destroyed a Loral-built satellite, with fears that classified U.S. encryption boards were lost to China. The committee confirmed that two encryption boards were not recovered from the crash site. The two FAC-3R encryption boards were not recovered from the crash site by Loral and were likely destroyed in the explosion. Even if the PRC recovered the boards, it would be difficult for them to determine the cryptographic algorithm. The National Security Agency believes there is no risk to other satellite systems from not recovering the boards. Motorola did not provide the PRC with information on how to design the Smart Dispenser. The Cox report agreed with the Administration's assessments. The Cox report confirmed that China had deployed approximately 20 CSS-4 ICBMs targeted at the United States, despite a detargeting agreement. It also warned of China's potential to deploy up to 100 ICBMs within 15 years and 1,000 warheads by 2015 if MIRVs were developed. Additionally, the report highlighted issues with China's SLBM force, noting the development of the JL-1 SLBM but its non-deployment. In June 1999, Loral Space and Communications responded to the Cox report, stating that their employees did not violate export control regulations or harm national security, but acknowledged that mistakes were made. The report mentioned sensitive information that was inadvertently shared with the Chinese during the review process. The Cox Committee recommended aggressive implementation of Satellite Export Control provisions. The executive branch will implement Satellite Export Control provisions of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for FY1999. The Department of State must ensure timely processing of satellite export licenses and inform exporters about application progress. Adequate personnel and resources should be allocated for processing export license applications. Congressional committees should ensure satellite manufacturers are not disadvantaged in collateral areas. Legislation recommends that DOD prioritize obligations under the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act, including monitoring launches and technology control plans. It suggests contracting security personnel for foreign satellite launches, with reimbursement by the satellite export licensee. DOD should ensure adequate training for space launch monitors. The legislation recommends sufficient training and adequate monitoring for space launch campaigns, including maintaining logs of authorized information transmission. It also calls for strict application of export control laws to communications among satellite industry stakeholders. Additionally, it suggests congressional action to boost domestic space launch capacity and competition. The Clinton Administration has expressed concerns about the implications of these recommendations. The Clinton Administration expressed concerns about the implications of the Cox Committee's recommendations for U.S. exports, particularly in high-tech industries. Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch criticized Congress for not understanding recent political and economic transformations and trying to revert to a Cold War mentality towards China. The National Security Council issued a response to the House Select Committee's recommendations before the report was declassified, addressing issues such as security at national labs, export control, satellite launches, and high-performance computers. The White House responded to recommendations from the NSC on security risks in U.S.-PRC lab exchanges, high-performance computer exports, and export control procedures. They agreed with some recommendations but opposed others, including the need for intelligence experts to conduct assessments and not denying exports based on end-use verification deadlines. The White House responded to NSC recommendations on security risks in U.S.-PRC lab exchanges, high-performance computer exports, and export control procedures. They agreed with some recommendations but opposed others, including new legislation beyond the Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. Legislation amending the Defense Production Act of 1950 to require mandatory notifications to CFIUS by U.S. national security-related businesses could deter foreign investment. The Department of Justice deemed legislation unnecessary for promptly sharing national security information. The Senate established a Task Force to oversee investigations on satellite technology transfers to China. Majority Leader Lott and Democratic Leader Daschle each formed their own Task Forces with specific Senators. Senator Lott reported on interim findings regarding inadequate export controls on satellites and technology transfers benefiting China's military. Export controls on satellites were inadequate; sensitive technology was transferred to China, benefiting their military. The Administration ignored information on PRC proliferation and aimed to protect China and U.S. satellite companies from sanctions. New details emerged about China's influence on the U.S. political process. Senator Shelby and the Intelligence Committee did not reach a conclusion on the matter. The Pentagon stated that safeguards were in place to prevent inappropriate technology transfers to China. The Senate Intelligence Committee investigated U.S. export control policies regarding PRC satellite launches and political donations in 1996. A 45-page report was released in May 1999 with findings and recommendations. Senator Graham dissented due to concerns about the review process. Senator Levin ensured that sections on missile technology transfers and political influence were kept separate. The Senate Intelligence Committee's report in 1999 found that U.S. technology transfers did not directly impact China's current ICBM force, but assistance from non-U.S. sources was significant. However, technical information from satellite launches enabled China to enhance its missile capabilities, posing a threat to U.S. national security and military forces in Asia. The Senate Intelligence Committee's 1999 report highlighted concerns about China's proliferation of missile systems improved by U.S. technology and advancements in space launch capabilities. Despite government assurances, security violations and weaknesses in satellite export policies have created tensions between U.S. national security and commercial interests. The Committee made 10 recommendations to strengthen controls over satellite exports. The Senate Intelligence Committee's 1999 report raised concerns about China's misuse of U.S. technology in missile systems and space launch capabilities. To address this, recommendations were made to enhance controls over satellite exports, including monitoring by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, annual reports to Congress, strict timetables for license reviews, intelligence assessments, and efforts to ensure compliance with export regulations. The Clinton Administration responded to these concerns by considering a reappraisal of satellite exports to China. The Clinton Administration responded to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on China's misuse of U.S. technology in missile systems and space launch capabilities. They acknowledged concerns about unauthorized assistance and transfers of technology, particularly in space launch vehicle and satellite technology, which could aid China in developing future ballistic missiles. The Administration agreed with most of the committee's recommendations but disagreed with the policy of permitting the launch of U.S. commercial satellites by China. The Clinton Administration acknowledged concerns about China's misuse of U.S. technology in missile systems and space launch capabilities. They disagreed with the policy of permitting the launch of U.S. commercial satellites by China, citing concerns about unauthorized technology transfers. Congressional investigations also raised concerns about the alleged politicization of export control and intelligence in the Clinton Administration. Export control specialists criticized the liberalization of controls on dual-use technology transfers to China, citing evidence of U.S. firms assisting China's military. Michael Maloof, a manager in DTSA, raised concerns about export control cases and shared information with the House Select Committee, Department of Justice, and Customs Service. In August 1998, criticisms were raised about alleged ties between Tarbell and Hughes, with Tarbell denying favoritism. The Pentagon dismissed the charges as \"ideological differences\" on U.S. policy towards China. A criminal investigation was initiated by the Justice Department into whether the CIA obstructed justice by warning Hughes about the Senate Intelligence Committee's interest in its employees. CIA officials agreed to testify before a grand jury in December 1998 regarding Hughes potentially improving China's missile capabilities. In September 1998, Pandolfi briefed the committee on Hughes' involvement in improving China's missile capabilities, but the CIA did not approve the briefing. Administration officials denied hindering the committee's investigation and advised Hughes to cooperate. The committee questioned if the Clinton Administration's engagement policy with China influenced intelligence assessments. Senator Shelby requested a criminal investigation into the CIA's contact with Hughes. In September 2000, Senator Shelby requested a criminal investigation into an unnamed CIA official for obstructing a Senate investigation. The CIA's inspector general investigated the failure to provide a classified cable on Hughes and Loral to the Justice Department. The cable reported on consultant Bansang Lee's illegal payments and receipts from PRC aerospace executives while working for Hughes and Loral on satellite sales to China. Lee's lawyer stated that Lee \"has.\" In October 1999, Senator Specter began holding hearings in his investigation into the Justice Department's handling of the PRC's suspected acquisition of missile technology and nuclear weapon secrets, campaign finance, Waco, and other issues. The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act for FY1999 included amendments that sought to express the sense of Congress that the United States should not enter into new agreements with China involving space or missile-related technology. The curr_chunk discusses agreements with China related to space and missile technology, restrictions on U.S. participation in investigations of PRC launch failures, and prohibitions on transfers of missile equipment and technology to China. It also mentions an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act for FY1999 regarding Presidential waivers of post-Tiananmen sanctions. Senator Hutchinson filed Amendment 3250 to transfer satellite export control back to the State Department and require detailed justifications for Presidential waivers of post-Tiananmen sanctions. Senator Kyl proposed Amendment 3398 to limit funds until the establishment of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Technology Security Policy. The Senate Task Force did not include restrictions on satellite exports in the Defense Authorization Act for FY1999. The Senate Task Force, led by Majority Leader Lott and proposed by Senator Helms, favored transferring licensing authority over satellites back to the State Department. House and Senate conferees agreed to this transfer at a conference committee meeting on September 17, 1998, in an effort to strengthen export controls. There was no agreement to ban further satellite exports to China, with some calling for a reassessment of the policy regarding China launching U.S.-origin satellites. Discussions also included distinguishing between exports of satellites for PRC launch only and satellites for PRC use, with concerns raised about preventing the PLA from using commercial satellites owned by China. Congress was urged to assess U.S. dual-use export controls by passing a law to replace the Export Administration Act. Congress passed a law (P.L. 105-261) to strengthen U.S. dual-use export controls. The law included provisions such as prohibiting blanket waivers of post-Tiananmen sanctions for satellite exports to China, requiring certification before exporting missile technology to China, and transferring control of satellites from the Commerce Department to the State Department. The law also mandated a report on the implementation and improvement of the license review process. The law (P.L. 105-261) strengthened U.S. dual-use export controls by mandating additional requirements for national security controls over satellite exports, including mandatory licenses for launch failure investigations and intelligence review of license applications. It also required a detailed justification for the President's waiver of post-Tiananmen sanctions for satellite exports to China and the establishment of a Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Technology Security Policy. President Clinton signed the Act on October 17, 1998, but expressed strong opposition to transferring licensing authority back to the State Department. Despite concerns in Congress, the National Security Adviser urged a veto. The White House's National Security Council drafted an executive order to maintain the Commerce Department's role in licensing satellite exports. The White House's National Security Council drafted an executive order to maintain the Commerce Department's role in licensing satellite exports, despite concerns in Congress about transferring licensing authority back to the State Department. President Clinton signed the Act on October 17, 1998, but expressed strong opposition to the transfer. In response, six House and Senate committees warned against the President's actions, leading to the Secretary of State submitting a plan to Congress on regaining licensing authority over commercial satellites as Munitions List items. The Defense Department's new Space Launch Monitoring Division of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was hiring staff to review licenses for satellite exports and monitor foreign launches. Congress passed legislation appropriating funds for the Department of Commerce in FY1999, requiring notification before processing licenses for satellite exports to China. In the 106th Congress, Rep. Sweeney introduced a bill to prohibit the export of satellites and related equipment to China. In 1999, Rep. Rohrabacher sponsored an amendment to the NASA authorization bill to ensure that any cooperative agreement with China would not enhance their ballistic missile or space launch capabilities. The NASA Authorization Act for FYs 2000, 2001, and 2002 included this requirement. Additionally, an amendment was introduced to give preferential treatment in licensing for export of satellites to NATO allies and major non-NATO allies. The approved section 210 of H.R. 1211 did not have references to China and other countries not subject to preferential treatment. Rohrabacher's amendment also directed the Secretary of State to obligate $2 million to expedite the review of satellite export licenses. Senator Lott's amendment sought to improve the monitoring of satellite exports. The amendment to the Act for FY2000 aimed to enhance monitoring of satellite exports and strengthen security at DOE facilities. Representative Cox introduced a 27-section amendment to H.R. 1401, addressing 21 of the Cox Committee's recommendations. The House approved the amendment by 428-0 and passed the bill in June 1999. Congress later approved the conference report on S. 1059, which was signed into law as P.L. 106-65 in October 1999. The text discusses export controls related to missile technology, satellites, and high-performance computers. It mentions a review of the policy of exporting satellites to China and a bill introduced to transfer export controls over satellites back to the Secretary of Commerce. The Satellite Industry Association (SIA) argued that California's satellite industry suffered losses due to export controls on satellites, resulting in decreased U.S. market share. A report suggested transferring jurisdiction to Commerce for communications satellites to address the issue. The worldwide market for satellites experienced a decline in demand after 2000, leading to over-capacity in the launch and satellite industry by 2002. Satellite launch companies from various countries continued to sell services, with no commercial launch business going to China since 2000. Some argued for keeping satellite export controls under the State Department for fair processing of license applications. Supporters lobbied for license authority to remain with the Commerce Department due to the sensitive technology involved in satellite engineering. The State Department's licensing authority, combined with the Defense Department's approval and monitoring, ensures security. Some in Congress support keeping satellites on the Munitions List for security reasons. Representative Howard Berman introduced H.R. 1707 (the Satellite Trade and Security Act of 2001) to address these concerns. The Satellite Trade and Security Act of 2001, introduced by Representative Howard Berman, aimed to shift jurisdiction over satellite exports back to the Department of Commerce. An amendment was added to the House version of the Export Administration Act, H.R. 2581, to exempt satellites going to China for launch from State Department oversight. This amendment was approved by the House International Relations Committee, keeping satellite exports for PRC launch subject to the Arms Export Control Act. The House Armed Services Committee disagreed with the proposal to return jurisdiction of satellite exports to the Commerce Department. Congress passed appropriations legislation for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to require advance notification for exporting U.S.-origin satellites to China. Legislation for State Department appropriations in FY 2004 would continue this requirement. Congress passed legislation requiring notification for satellite exports to China in FY1999. The Commerce Department processed five export license applications for satellite projects, subject to congressional review. The Arms Export Control Act requires Congress to be notified of proposed licenses for the export of defense equipment or services to China. Approval for export licenses to China also requires a presidential waiver of post-Tiananmen sanctions. Senators urged President George W. Bush to deny waivers for proposed satellite exports to China. Senators urged President George W. Bush to deny waivers for proposed satellite exports to China due to concerns about weapons nonproliferation and human rights violations. They specifically highlighted China's transfer of missile equipment and technology in violation of international agreements. Senator Helms called for a re-evaluation of policy towards China and supported denying China the opportunity to launch US satellites for profit. Senator Helms criticized China for not honoring their nonproliferation pledges and violations, including an assurance made in November 2000. NASA Administrator and Deputy Secretary of State were reviewing whether the US should allow China to cooperate in space despite their military running the manned space program. The Bush Administration decided to review defense trade controls, including the Munitions List, covering policy, processes, technology, and organizational structure. The White House stated the policy review would be completed in six months. The State Department has strict controls over exports to China's space programs to prevent military benefits. A license for the APMT satellite project was suspended due to controversy over military applications involving a PLA lieutenant general's son. The Administration re-examined the APMT project from 1985 to 1998, with concerns about its military ties and sensitive technologies, including a 40-ft.-wide antenna and on-board digital processor. There were worries that the satellite could be used by the PLA for command and control purposes. The Clinton Administration denied approval to Hughes for exporting the APMT satellite due to concerns about its potential use by the PLA. Hughes was dropped as the satellite supplier by the APMT consortium in April 1999. There were worries about the PLA using U.S.-made satellites for military purposes. China is utilizing satellites like Asiasat and Apstar for encrypted C4I purposes. The lack of communication satellites could lead to reliance on foreign services in wartime. China launched its military communications satellite, Chinasat-22, for a new battle management system. China is developing a new battle management system called the Qu Dian C 4I system, similar to the U.S. JTIDS network. They plan to deploy three major satellite systems for remote sensing, navigation, and communications. China's military has used satellites for reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, including during the U.S. war in Iraq. Loral faced delays in exporting the Chinasat-8 satellite to China due to approval issues from the Department of State. The satellite was touted as the most powerful China had purchased, with a scheduled launch in May 1999. The buyer was the China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corporation, under the Ministry of Information Industry. The Ministry was part of a defense industrial sector formed in 1998 through a merger. Bernard Schwartz, Loral's chairman, criticized the government's delay in granting a technical assistance agreement. Schwartz criticized the government's delay in granting a technical assistance agreement for Chinasat-8, risking the commercial viability of the U.S. satellite manufacturing industry in Asia. SpaceNews alleged that the State Department was delaying approval to punish Loral, and protested against using the export licensing process as a substitute for the judicial system. The Department of State returned the license without action in January 2001. Other satellite projects have also been subject to U.S. export controls, Presidential waivers, and congressional review. In 1999, President Clinton certified the export of satellite fuels and separation systems for the Iridium satellite project, ensuring it wouldn't harm the U.S. space launch industry or improve PRC missile capabilities. In 2000, AsiaSat ordered AsiaSat-4 from Hughes Space and Communications, scheduled for launch in 2002 from Cape Canaveral on an Atlas 3 rocket. In 2003, AsiaSat-4 was launched from Cape Canaveral on an Atlas 3B rocket. APT Satellite Co. ordered the Apstar-5 satellite from Loral, planning to launch it from China on a Long March 3B rocket in 2003. Loral purchased 50% ownership of Apstar-5 for $115 million from APT Satellite Company in September 2002. In 2003, Loral purchased 50% ownership of Apstar-5 for $115 million from APT Satellite Company and arranged a launch by Sea Launch in Long Beach, CA. This was due to the lack of a U.S. license to launch the satellite from China. With Loral's ownership of Apstar-5, they may not need to obtain an export license or a Presidential waiver of post-Tiananmen sanctions. China Aerospace Corporation, People's Bank of China, and Shanghai Development Bank plan to launch Sinosat-2 in 2005 using a new DFH-4 satellite built by China Academy of Space Technology. The DFH-4 satellite is a result of cooperation between China Aerospace Corporation and Alcatel Space of France, with a memorandum signed for Alcatel to provide parts for the satellite designed to have a 15-year lifespan."
