The \"Effective Care for the Armed Forces and Veterans Act of 2007\" prohibits competitive sourcing of services at military medical facilities to ensure the health and recovery of wounded members of the Armed Forces is not compromised. The Department of Defense's attempt to implement competitive sourcing despite no improvement in efficiency or effectiveness is deemed unacceptable. During a major military conflict, the Secretary of Defense is prohibited from initiating competitive sourcing activities at medical facilities of the Department of Defense. This includes subjecting work performed by employees or contractors to public-private competition or converting employees to private contractor performance. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from initiating competitive sourcing activities at medical facilities of the Department of Defense during a major military conflict. This includes subjecting work performed by employees or contractors to public-private competition or converting employees to private contractor performance. An exception is made if not initiating such action would negatively impact the provision of services at a military medical facility. The efficiency and advisability of these activities are to be assessed by the Comptroller General of the United States. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited from subjecting work performed by employees or contractors to public-private competition or converting employees to private contractor performance under certain circumstances. SEC. 3. Minimum budget for medical services of the Armed Forces during major military conflict. Congress finds that budget cuts for medical services at the Department of Defense have caused issues at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. It is deemed inappropriate to reduce funding for medical services for Armed Forces and veterans in need of treatment. If the Armed Forces are engaged in a major conflict, the President must not decrease the budget for medical services, unless specified otherwise. The President can reduce the budget for medical services for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs only if it is in the national interest and a report is submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for the reduction. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER. The final recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission in 2005 include closing Walter Reed Army Medical Center and transferring medical services to National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Fort Belvoir. However, the recommendations do not adequately address housing for families of wounded members of the Armed Forces receiving treatment at the new facilities. The closure of Walter Reed Army Medical Center has hindered the Secretary of Defense's ability to attract necessary personnel for medical services. The Secretary is prohibited from implementing recommendations to transfer medical services to National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Fort Belvoir for a specified period. The Secretary must submit a plan within one year of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense must submit a plan to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act. The plan should assess the feasibility of guaranteeing employment for Walter Reed Army Medical Center employees in the Washington, DC, area for more than two years after the center's closure. It should also include detailed construction plans for new medical facilities and housing at National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Fort Belvoir to accommodate the transfer of medical services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The construction planned for the transfer of medical services from Walter Reed Army Medical Center to the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda and Fort Belvoir must be completed before any patients are transferred as a result of the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. SEC. 5. IMPROVING CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES. Congress finds that case managers play a crucial role in scheduling appointments and ensuring recovering servicemembers receive necessary care. Many case managers are overwhelmed by the high number of wounded Armed Forces members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Regular contact between healthcare providers and returning servicemembers is vital for diagnosing post-traumatic stress disorder. Requiring proof of service or injury with a photo or medal from deployment is deemed inappropriate. Case managers are well-equipped to support recovery efforts. The Secretary of Defense assigns case managers to assist recovering servicemembers with disability evaluation and discharge procedures. Each case manager must contact their assigned servicemembers at least once per week and be trained in the Department of Defense's systems. Recovering servicemembers receive assistance from case managers to complete necessary forms. A recovering servicemember is defined as a member of the Armed Forces undergoing medical treatment for an injury or illness incurred while on active duty. SEC. 6. SCREENING FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. The Secretary of Defense is required to screen all returning members of the Armed Forces from deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan for traumatic brain injury. This is in response to the high number of brain injuries among deployed personnel, many of which go undiagnosed due to lack of external symptoms. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs screens combat veterans for brain injuries, but the Secretary of Defense does not. Additionally, there will be studies on treating traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition for disability compensation. The Secretary of Defense is required to conduct a study on the feasibility of treating traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition for disability compensation for members of the Armed Forces who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will also conduct a similar study. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a study on the feasibility of treating traumatic brain injury as a presumptive condition for veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. The Director of the National Institutes of Health will also conduct a study on traumatic brain injury. The National Institutes of Health will conduct a study on traumatic brain injury, focusing on detection, measurement, and severity classification. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 7. REQUIRING MEDICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MEDICAL RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. Congress finds that electronic transfer of medical records between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs is necessary. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that the medical records management systems are capable of transmitting and receiving records within two years of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense must electronically transfer medical records to and from the Department of Veterans Affairs within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. Department of Veterans Affairs assessment of long-term care needs of veterans. Congress finds that the Department of Veterans Affairs will add many new veterans with complex medical needs to its records in the next five years. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to assess and determine actions needed to meet the long-term care needs of veterans over a 50-year period. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must submit a report to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act, detailing the assessment and determination of actions needed to meet the long-term care needs of veterans."
