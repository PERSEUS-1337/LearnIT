Without insurance, obtaining needed care becomes difficult and can lead to financial distress. Some may be eligible for Medicaid, while others may struggle to afford COBRA premiums. The ACA aims to improve access to health insurance coverage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aims to improve access to health insurance coverage, but unemployed individuals may face challenges in obtaining immediate coverage. Certain provisions of the ACA have been implemented for specific populations, such as those with preexisting conditions, while broader provisions like health insurance exchanges will not be fully implemented until 2014. This gap in coverage options is a concern, especially during times of high unemployment rates. The underemployment rate reached 15.2%, impacting about 23.4 million individuals. The Congressional Budget Office expects unemployment to remain above 8.0% through 2014, affecting health insurance coverage. The report aims to inform congressional debate on addressing these issues and includes analysis on the diversity of the unemployed population, the relationship between unemployment and loss of health insurance, and federal programs that can help some unemployed individuals. The curr_chunk discusses the diversity of the unemployed population in terms of age, gender, and income, highlighting how these factors impact their health care needs and ability to pay for insurance. It mentions that older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions and higher health care costs, with a significant portion of lifetime health care expenditures occurring after age 65. The older unemployed are likely to have higher health care expenditures compared to younger unemployed individuals. Age can also impact financial resources, with younger individuals having less savings but potentially more family support. Unemployment rates have increased across all age groups since 2007, with the highest rates among those aged 16 to 24. The unemployment rates increased the most between 2007 and 2011 among individuals aged 25 and older, with nearly doubled rates across all age categories. The distribution of the unemployed shifted towards older individuals, with a decline in the share of unemployed aged 16 to 24 and an increase in those aged 25 and older. Among those aged 25 and older, the largest percentage point increase in the share of unemployed was among those aged 55 and older. Single men made up the majority of the unemployed population in December 2011. Marital status influences access to health insurance for the unemployed. Married individuals may rely on their spouse's coverage if they lose their own, while others may be the main provider of insurance for their family. In 2010, half of those with employer-sponsored coverage received it as dependents. Unemployed individuals at risk of losing employer-sponsored coverage for family, may be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. Research shows prolonged unemployment leads to delays in seeking medical treatment, impacting health status. The health status of the unemployed can be affected by factors such as health insurance coverage, demographic composition, and duration of unemployment. Research suggests that older individuals, who make up a significant portion of the unemployed population, may have poorer health compared to younger individuals. Data shows that individuals aged 45 to 64 are more likely to report fair or poor health compared to younger age groups. Individuals aged 45 to 64 are more likely to report fair or poor health compared to younger age groups. Unemployed individuals may delay necessary medical treatment due to longer periods of unemployment. Over 70.0% of adults with gaps in health care coverage forgo needed care due to cost. Uninsured adults are less likely to receive essential tests like blood pressure and cancer screening. Eligibility for unemployment compensation (UC) varies by state and is based on wages for covered work. Unemployment compensation (UC) benefits are determined by each state and are based on wages for covered work. The average regular UC benefit duration is 17.5 weeks, with an average weekly benefit of $291. However, this may not be enough to cover health insurance or healthcare costs, especially for those purchasing insurance in the individual market where premiums can be prohibitive. The average monthly cost of premiums for self-only coverage in the individual market was $301 in 2010, consuming 23.9% of the average monthly unemployment benefit. For family coverage, the cost was $592, consuming 46.9% of the benefit. Data from the IRS in 2009 shows that individuals with household income of $15,000 to $20,000 are most likely to receive UC benefits. About 44% of UC recipients had household income below $25,000. In 2010, 44% of UC recipients had household income below $25,000, while nearly 30% had income of $50,000 or more. Unemployed individuals may need to use savings to cover expenses, including health insurance. Employer-sponsored health insurance is the primary source of coverage for workers and their dependents. The likelihood of individuals having employer-sponsored coverage is affected by being permanently or temporarily laid off. Nearly 6.4 million unemployed individuals have been permanently laid off, comprising 48.3% of the 13.1 million unemployed workers. Another 1.4 million individuals have been temporarily laid off, while 900,000 left their jobs voluntarily. Industry characteristics of the unemployed provide insight into their health insurance status prior to becoming unemployed. Workers who had coverage before becoming unemployed may have an easier time maintaining or obtaining health insurance while jobless. Table 4 displays the percentage of workers with health insurance in different industries in 2010, along with the number of unemployed workers and unemployment rates by industry as of December 2011. Employees laid off in mining and manufacturing were most likely to have health insurance from their previous employer, while those in wholesale and retail trade, construction, and leisure and hospitality were least likely. The industries with the highest numbers of unemployed individuals are professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, construction, and leisure and hospitality, accounting for about 46.0% of all unemployed individuals. About 35.4% of unemployed individuals are entering or re-entering the labor force, including family caregivers, retirees, and those recovering from illness. Some may have health coverage through spouses, parents, retiree benefits, COBRA, or be uninsured. Returning to work may not guarantee health insurance for those without coverage. In 2011, 72% of newly insured employees faced a 2.2 month waiting period for coverage. Unemployment analysis is complicated by at-risk groups like involuntary part-time workers and discouraged workers. Legislative proposals for health insurance focus on actively job-seeking individuals, but other at-risk groups may also lack coverage. In 2011, the number of involuntary part-time workers decreased from 8.9 million to 8.1 million. Part-time workers are 1.5 times more likely to be uninsured compared to full-time workers. Only 16.0% of employers offering health benefits provide them to part-time workers. Discouraged workers, not actively seeking jobs, also face a risk of being uninsured. The number of involuntary part-time workers decreased in 2011. Part-time workers are more likely to be uninsured compared to full-time workers. Some programs and tax treatments may help unemployed individuals with health insurance, such as COBRA, Health Coverage Tax Credit, Medicaid, Itemized Deduction for Medical Expenses, Health Savings Accounts, and Title X of COBRA. The COBRA program allows unemployed individuals to continue their employer's group health plan for up to 18 or 36 months after involuntary dismissal. While this provides continuity of care with preferred providers, the cost can be high as individuals must pay 102% of the full premium. This can be a significant financial burden, especially for those with family coverage. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is a refundable and advanceable individual income tax credit that can be applied to premiums for various types of health insurance, including COBRA. Eligible taxpayers must be receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) provides premium credit regardless of income for individuals receiving Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) benefits. Eligibility restrictions include not being enrolled in certain insurance programs or entitled to certain benefits. Limitations for the unemployed include restricted eligibility categories and short eligibility periods for some TAA beneficiaries. Medicaid is a federal-state entitlement program for low-income individuals, covering health and long-term care services primarily for the elderly, disabled, families with dependent children, pregnant women, and children. Participants must meet income and resource tests set by states. Medicaid can pay for necessary treatments with small deductibles or copayments, making it attractive for the unemployed. Medicaid is a federal-state program for low-income individuals, covering health services with small deductibles or copayments. Unemployed individuals may not meet income and asset tests, and some may not be categorically eligible. Taxpayers can deduct certain medical expenses, including insurance premiums and direct payments to providers, providing additional tax savings. One attraction of the itemized deduction for the unemployed is that it has no employment-related eligibility tests; individuals who have lost full-time jobs but are not defined as unemployed could still use it. However, a limitation is that one must itemize deductions to use it, and the 7.5% adjusted gross income floor further limits its use. Deductions result in little tax savings for lower-income taxpayers due to their low marginal tax rates. Additionally, the deduction is not advanceable, requiring individuals to pay for medical expenses upfront. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are tax-advantaged accounts that individuals can use to pay for unreimbursed qualified medical expenses. Contributions are either excluded from taxes (if made by employers) or deductible (if made by individuals) and can only be made when individuals have qualifying high-deductible health insurance. Annual contribution limits in 2012 are $3,100 for self-only coverage and $6,250 for family coverage. Unused amounts can be rolled over to the next year. Withdrawals used for health insurance premiums are usually taxable, except for those receiving unemployment benefits or within certain circumstances. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are tax-advantaged accounts that can be used as a rainy-day health care fund. They are portable and not tied to a specific employer. To contribute to an HSA, individuals must have high-deductible insurance. Some individuals are hesitant due to the high deductible risk, even though premiums are lower. This can result in low HSA contributions and balances for the unemployed. The ACA creates the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) to provide coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions or who have been denied coverage. The PCIP does not offer financial assistance but operates in every state until 2014 when individuals can access coverage through health insurance exchanges. As of November 2011, 44,852 individuals were enrolled in the program. The ACA provision allows individuals under 26 to obtain or retain health insurance through dependent coverage. Since September 2010, the percentage of adults aged 19-25 with private insurance has increased from 64% to 73%. In 2014, the ACA will provide premium tax credits. The ACA will provide premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies for eligible individuals in the health insurance market, including some unemployed individuals. The premium tax credit is advanceable and refundable, and those who qualify may also receive assistance with cost-sharing for health services. Medicaid access will be expanded to individuals under 65 with modified adjusted gross income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The ACA expands Medicaid eligibility to low-income childless adults and raises income eligibility levels up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Unemployed individuals may lack assistance in obtaining health insurance coverage until 2014, with the national unemployment rate expected to remain above 8.0% through that year. The national unemployment rate is projected to stay above 8.0% through 2014, leading to challenges in obtaining affordable health insurance for the unemployed. Different groups, including those who lose employer-sponsored coverage or are involuntary part-time workers, face varying levels of insurance access. Policy questions arise about whether the federal government should provide assistance to these groups and the implications of prioritizing certain groups for assistance. Several issues arise regarding providing assistance to different groups affected by the lack of health insurance. There is a trade-off between cost and equity in deciding who should receive assistance. Prioritizing those who recently lost employer-sponsored coverage may prevent an increase in the number of uninsured individuals. The form of coverage for those without employer-sponsored insurance is also a key consideration, whether through public programs like Medicaid or private insurance options. Comprehensive health care reform has been enacted, but immediate coverage for currently unemployed individuals is not guaranteed. Legislative proposals in the 112th Congress aim to provide temporary coverage until the ACA is fully implemented in 2014. This includes extending COBRA benefits and eligibility for subsidies. The COBRA subsidy provided a 65% premium subsidy for eligible workers who became unemployed before May 31, 2010, but has since expired. Expanding eligibility for COBRA subsidies may benefit some unemployed individuals, but it is limited and does not cover those entering or re-entering the workforce. Extending COBRA subsidies could help individuals in a prolonged recession find jobs with health insurance. Unemployed individuals may struggle to afford the 102% COBRA premium without employer subsidies. Extending COBRA subsidies could assist older unemployed individuals in accessing health insurance, especially those with serious health issues. This could potentially raise costs for others in the plan. Some suggest allowing older unemployed individuals to buy into Medicare early by paying premiums. One approach to allow individuals aged 62 to 64 to voluntarily enroll in Medicare by paying premiums. Premiums would cover program costs plus a 5% administrative fee. CBO estimated the annual premium for single coverage at $7,600 in 2011, potentially increasing Social Security spending by encouraging early retirement. This concept is similar to extending COBRA eligibility. A Medicare buy-in is similar to extending COBRA eligibility, requiring full coverage cost payment. COBRA is advantageous for all unemployed with former employer insurance, while Medicare buy-in benefits older workers re-entering the workforce. COBRA premiums may be lower due to diverse age groups, while Medicare buy-in covers older workers returning to work."
