    "title": "SB 781",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10123.147 of the Insurance Code is amended to require insurers to reimburse complete health insurance claims within 30 working days, with the option to contest or deny a claim in writing within the same timeframe. Insurers must identify contested or denied portions of a claim by revenue code and provide specific information or reasons for denial within 30 working days. If denial is based on facts or law, insurer must state the basis for denial. The insurer must provide a notice to insured individuals and healthcare providers regarding contested or denied claims, including information on how to seek review by the department. The notice should also inform providers of their right to enter into the dispute resolution process. An insurer may delay payment of an uncontested portion of a complete claim for reconsideration of a contested portion, as long as specified charges are paid. If a complete claim, not contested or denied, is not reimbursed within 30 working days, the insurer must pay $25 per year or 10% interest. This amount should be automatically included in the payment to the claimant. For a claim to be reasonably contested, the insurer must not have received the completed claim. A paper claim is complete with a legible emergency department report and UB 92 form submitted within 30 working days. An electronic claim is complete with the electronic equivalent of the UB 92 form submitted within the same timeframe. If the insurer requests the emergency department report within 30 working days of receiving the electronic claim from the provider, they can also ask for additional relevant information within 30 working days of receiving the report. A claim from a professional provider is complete when a completed HCFA 1500 form or its electronic equivalent is submitted, along with any additional information requested by the insurer within 30 working days of receiving the claim. The provider must provide requested information within 15 working days of a clear and specific written request from the insurer. If, after reviewing relevant information, the insurer needs more details, they have 15 working days to request it. This section does not apply to fraudulent claims, eligibility determinations, or when the insurer hasn't been given access to necessary information. The insurer must specify any exceptions within 30 working days of receiving the claim. If a claim is contested due to lack of necessary information, the insurer has 30 working days to reconsider. If the claim is not reimbursed within this time, the insurer must pay $15 or $25 per year in interest. This amount will be automatically included in the payment to the claimant without needing a request. An insurer must not delay payment on a claim from a healthcare provider without providing a valid reason and monthly updates. Providers cannot be asked to waive their rights. This section applies to claims for emergency services after September 1, 1999, and does not affect other rights or obligations. This section does not affect a provider's written agreement to submit bills within a specified time period."
