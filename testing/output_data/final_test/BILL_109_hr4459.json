    "content": "The \"Service for School Act of 2005\" provides Federal tuition assistance to undergraduate students in exchange for national service commitment. The \"Service for School Act of 2005\" authorizes tuition assistance for undergraduate students attending eligible institutions, with payments made according to regulations set by the Secretary. Applicants must meet eligibility requirements to receive assistance. SEC. 4. APPLICATION; ELIGIBILITY. The Secretary sets application dates for tuition assistance. Eligible individuals must file an application with necessary information. To be eligible, individuals must be enrolled in an educational program at an eligible institution and enter into a Service for School agreement with the Secretary. Each academic year, the Secretary selects Service for School participants based on applications from eligible individuals, giving priority to those with the greatest financial need. The Service for School agreement mandates completion of National service based on tuition assistance received under the Act, varying from one calendar year of full-time service to two calendar years of part-time service per academic year. The agreement requires participants to start National service within 12 months of graduation, complete it within 10 years, and not be considered to have permanently left an institution. The participant can transfer to another institution or postpone enrollment for up to 12 months. They can appeal for an extension of time requirements and the Secretary may waive them for exceptional circumstances. If the participant fails to fulfill the agreement, they must repay any Federal tuition assistance received. The Service for School agreement is renewable annually for one academic year of tuition assistance, with the option to revise the amount requested. The agreement becomes null if the individual is not selected by the Secretary as a participant for the academic year. SEC. 7. TUITION ASSISTANCE. For each academic year, a Service for School participant can receive tuition assistance up to the average total tuition and fees for full-time students at public colleges or their cost of attendance. Participants can choose to receive less assistance in exchange for reduced national service requirements. The assistance is provided in the form of tuition support. The tuition assistance for Service for School participants can be in the form of grants, expense remissions, or other forms as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to collect amounts owed by Service for School participants and may use collection authorities from the Higher Education Act. Amounts collected will be available for tuition assistance payments. The Secretary can waive requirements for exceptional circumstances like illness or death. The Secretary can issue regulations to implement the Act, including verifying participants' completion of the Service for School agreement. Definitions are provided in section 10. The Act defines \"National service\" as service in various programs including the Armed Forces, Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, Citizen Corps, and USA Freedom Corps. An \"eligible institution\" is defined as an institution of higher education. The Higher Education Act of 1965 defines full-time national service as 40 hours per week, including active duty in the Armed Forces, and part-time national service as less than 40 hours per week but not less than 40 hours per month, including service in the National Guard and reserve components of the Armed Forces.
