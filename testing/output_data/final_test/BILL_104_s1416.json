    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Genetic Privacy and Nondiscrimination Act of 1995\". Congress finds that genetic information is uniquely private and should not be disclosed without authorization, as it can lead to harm such as stigmatization and discrimination. Current legal protections for genetic information are inadequate and require further attention. Laws are needed to protect genetic privacy and regulate the collection, storage, and use of DNA samples and genetic information. The purpose of this Act is to define individuals' rights regarding genetic information disclosure, establish circumstances for disclosure, and prevent discrimination based on genetic information by insurers or employers. The Act aims to define individuals' rights regarding genetic information disclosure and prevent discrimination based on genetic information by insurers or employers. The Act defines key terms related to genetic information, such as DNA, DNA sample, employer, genetic information, and genetic test. These definitions aim to protect individuals from discrimination based on genetic information by insurers or employers. The Act defines key terms related to genetic information, such as DNA, RNA, mitochondrial DNA, chromosomes, and proteins for diagnosing genetic characteristics. Insurer refers to various entities regulated under State insurance laws, including self-funded health plans. Secretary refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF GENETIC INFORMATION. Prohibition on disclosing genetic information without authorization, except in specific authorized circumstances. Disclosure of individual information may be allowed under certain circumstances such as for criminal investigations, court orders, establishing paternity, or providing genetic information for medical diagnosis to blood relatives of a deceased person. The prohibitions of this section apply to any redisclosure of genetic information by any entity after it has been disclosed. SEC. 5 prohibits employers from discriminating based on genetic information of employees or prospective employees. It also outlines enforcement procedures similar to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. SEC. 6 imposes requirements on insurers. Insurers are prohibited from using genetic information to affect health insurance coverage or induce the purchase of insurance. If a genetic test is requested for insurance purposes, the results must be disclosed to the applicant with their written authorization. This regulation applies to insurance policies issued after the enactment of this Act. The Act prohibits insurers from using genetic information for insurance coverage and requires disclosure of genetic test results to applicants. This applies to policies issued before or after the Act's enactment date. The National Bioethics Advisory Commission is required to submit a report to Congress by August 31, 1996, with recommendations on protecting DNA samples and genetic information. This includes developing standards for acquisition and retention of genetic information in all settings."
