    "content": "Genetic engineering involves introducing new traits to an organism, creating tolerance to herbicides, resistance to viruses, increased yields, and altered acidic content. Genetically engineered foods (GE foods), also known as genetically modified foods (GMO foods), are derived from these methods. Common GE plants include corn, canola, soybean, and cotton, used in various food products. The FDA and World Health Organization have found GE foods to be nutritious and safe. The World Health Organization has stated that genetically engineered (GE) foods currently on the market are safe. While federal law does not require specific labeling for GE foods, some states have enacted laws mandating disclosure of GE ingredients on food labels. The FDA believes that general labeling provisions are sufficient to protect consumers regarding GE foods. The FDA highlights federal statutory requirements relevant to labeling GE foods, along with informal policy statements and state laws addressing the issue. Sections 403 and 201 of the FFDCA may impact GE food labeling, enabling the FDA to require specific information on labels to prevent misbranding and help consumers make informed choices. Section 403 of the FFDCA requires accurate labeling of foods to help consumers make informed choices. It states that misbranded foods include those with false or misleading labels, and ingredients must be listed with their common names. If a genetically engineered (GE) food differs significantly from its traditional counterpart, the label should reflect this difference to avoid misleading consumers. Additionally, Section 201(n) prohibits misleading labels that fail to disclose material facts related to the food's use. The FDA's interpretation of \"material\" in this context remains unclear. The FDA's interpretation of \"material\" in labeling GE foods remains unclear, as it does not require explicit disclosure unless there is a significant difference from traditional counterparts. The presence of GE ingredients/methods is not considered material information unless it poses health risks, misleads consumers, or differs in characteristics from other foods. The FDA requires disclosure on GE food labels only if there is a significant difference from traditional counterparts, such as the presence of unexpected allergens. The use of \"natural\" on GE food labels can be misleading, as the term is not clearly defined by the FDA. The FDA does not have a formal definition for \"natural\" on food labels, but it means no artificial or synthetic ingredients. The FDA has issued nonbinding guidance on labeling GE foods, regulating them within existing frameworks. The FDA supports regulating genetically engineered (GE) foods under the existing framework of the [FFDCA], emphasizing that the regulatory status depends on objective characteristics and intended use, not the method of development. In 2001, the FDA issued draft guidance stating that GE foods do not require special labeling, but encouraged voluntary labeling to provide more information to consumers. Several states have passed laws imposing specific labeling requirements on genetically engineered (GE) food. Connecticut's Act Concerning the Labeling of Genetically-Engineered Food requires certain food items to be labeled as \"Produced with Genetic Engineering.\" Maine's Act to Protect Maine Food Consumers' Right to Know about Genetically Engineered Food and Seed Stock also mandates labeling of GE food as \"Produced with Genetic Engineering,\" with exemptions for restaurants, alcoholic beverages, and medical food. Non-compliance with these labeling requirements may result in sanctions for misbranding. Vermont's Act requires labeling of food produced with genetic engineering, with phrases like \"partially produced with genetic engineering.\" Exemptions include alcoholic beverages, processed food with GE materials under 0.9% weight, medical food, and restaurant food. Enforcement begins on July 1, 2016. The state will not enforce labeling requirements until other states pass similar legislation, raising legal issues like First Amendment rights, federal preemption, and interstate commerce burdens. Trade organizations have challenged Vermont's labeling law's constitutionality. Consumer litigation on GE food focuses on deceptive labels, with defendants citing FDA expertise under the primary jurisdiction doctrine. Courts have not consistently interpreted the primary jurisdiction doctrine in the context of GE labeling, leading to ambiguity on when to defer to the FDA's expertise. Consumers bring legal claims under state laws, not the FFDCA, due to restrictions on private litigants. The section explains the primary jurisdiction doctrine and its role in cases of misleading labeling claims by consumers. The primary jurisdiction doctrine is invoked in cases of misleading labeling claims by consumers against the use of the term \"natural\" on GE foods labels. Courts defer to regulatory agencies for expertise and uniformity in rulings, weighing four factors to determine its application. The primary jurisdiction doctrine is invoked in cases of misleading labeling claims by consumers against the use of the term \"natural\" on GE foods labels. Courts may refer the issue to the relevant agency for an administrative ruling, as there is no formal transfer mechanism between the court and the agency. Lawsuits focus on the alleged misleading use of \"natural\" on labels of GE foods, claiming it violates state unfair competition laws. The primary jurisdiction doctrine is inconsistently applied in cases involving misleading claims about the use of \"natural\" on labels of GE foods. Courts have at times deferred to the FDA, while in other cases they have found that the doctrine does not apply to these claims. This is because the courts consider misleading claims to be legal questions within their jurisdiction, and the FDA has previously declined court referrals on this issue. The primary jurisdiction doctrine is typically invoked when an issue is best handled by the agency with expertise in that area. Courts have generally maintained that questions of deceptive labeling belong in the courts, not the FDA, as they involve legal considerations. In Bohac v. General Mills, Inc., the court rejected the argument that the FDA has primary jurisdiction over the term \"natural,\" stating that defining \"natural\" is a legal issue for the courts to decide. The court emphasized that determining if a term is misleading falls within the court's jurisdiction. Courts have the authority to determine if a term is false or misleading, not the FDA. Previous court cases have shown that the FDA's definition of \"natural\" may not necessarily help in assessing consumer deception. The FDA's position on food labels is considered in analyzing deception, but it is not the only factor. Referrals to the FDA for misleading claims have been discouraged in the past, as seen in cases like R e Frito-Lay North America, Inc. In R e Frito-Lay North America, Inc., the plaintiff alleged deceptive labeling of \"All Natural\" products containing GE ingredients. Frito-Lay argued for dismissal or FDA referral under primary jurisdiction doctrine, but the court rejected this citing FDA delays. Ault v. J.J. Smucker Co. further rejected primary jurisdiction due to FDA's past refusals. In Cox v. Gruma Corp., a class action suit over labeling was brought, showing courts deferring to agency authority in such cases. In v. Gruma Corp., a class action suit alleged false labeling of food as \"natural\" when it contained GE corn. The court dismissed the case citing FDA's regulatory authority over food labeling. Despite recognizing a regulatory gap, the court deferred to FDA's expertise. The defendants in Rojas v. General Mills and Cox also argued for primary jurisdiction doctrine in food labeling cases. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Ninth Circuit decision in Pom Wonderful v. Coca-Cola, stating that FDA regulation on juice labeling does not prevent competitors from bringing unfair competition claims. The impact of this ruling on GE food labeling and lower court deference to the FDA remains uncertain. Bills in the 114th Congress address GE food labeling, including the Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act. The Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act aims to classify GE foods as misbranded unless clearly disclosed. It exempts certain foods and defines \"genetically engineered\" as organisms produced intentionally through GE. The Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015 establishes certification programs and labeling requirements overseen by the FDA. The bill directs the FDA to continue premarket consultation for food from new plant varieties, including GE plants. It may require labeling to inform consumers of any differences between GE and non-GE foods for public health protection. Additionally, a notification program would be created under the Plant Protection Act for introducing GE plants into interstate commerce for food use. The bill requires notification to the Secretary of HHS for introducing GE plants into interstate commerce for food use. It establishes a voluntary GE food certification program within the USDA for labeling claims. It deems food misbranded if labeled as \"natural\" without FDA-defined terms. The bill also impacts state regulation of GE food labeling. In 2016, Senator Pat Roberts introduced bill S. 2609 for a national voluntary bioengineered food labeling standard overseen by the USDA. The bill outlines regulations for labeling bioengineered foods and prohibits safety claims based solely on bioengineering. It also addresses preempting state laws on GE food labeling in interstate commerce. Senator Merkley introduced S. 2621, the \"Biotechnology Food Labeling Uniformity Act,\" which amends the FFDCA. The Food Labeling Uniformity Act would require GE foods to bear a label stating they are genetically engineered. The label must include specific wording or symbols to disclose the presence of GE ingredients. Exceptions apply for processed foods with minimal GE ingredients, those exposed to a GE vaccine, or produced using a GE processing aid. The Food Labeling Uniformity Act would require GE foods to bear a label stating they are genetically engineered, with specific wording or symbols. The act includes a federal preemption provision to preempt state GE labeling requirements, clarifying that other food labeling laws or common law remedies would not be preempted."
