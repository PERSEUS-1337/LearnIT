    "content": "Congress has the authority to determine classes of aliens for admission and grounds for removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Aliens can enter the US as legal permanent residents, nonimmigrants, or refugees, each with specific requirements. Aliens must meet specific requirements for admission into the United States under different categories. For example, nonimmigrant students must prove they are enrolled in an approved school. Even if they meet these requirements, aliens can still be denied admission if they are deemed inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Once admitted, aliens can face deportation if they are found to be deportable under the Act, which includes grounds related to criminal activity. This report focuses on the immigration consequences of criminal behavior, which generally refers to actions for which an alien has been convicted or pleaded guilty in court. Consequences may arise from violations of federal, state, or foreign criminal law, but not all violations of immigration law are crimes. Being in the US without legal permission is not a crime, although it may lead to removal. The Attorney General historically had authority over interpreting and enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act. Following the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) was abolished and its functions were transferred to DHS. The DHS Secretary is now responsible for the administration and enforcement of immigration laws, while the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) retains adjudicative authority over immigration matters. The Attorney General retains authority over immigration matters, but the extent of their authority over other immigration issues is unclear due to lack of specific amendments in the INA. Regulations by DHS and EOIR often overlap. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred immigration functions to DHS, allowing immigration officials to exercise all authorities under other laws for performing their functions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred immigration functions to DHS, giving them primary authority over immigration matters. The Attorney General and EOIR maintain adjudicatory authority over immigration issues and questions of immigration law. The Immigration and Nationality Act lists criminal grounds for designating an alien as inadmissible or deportable, including crimes involving moral turpitude and aggravated felonies. Certain criminal conduct can prevent an alien from obtaining relief or becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The criminal classes of crimes involving moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, and crimes precluding good moral character are not coextensive. Crimes of moral turpitude are determined by case law, aggravated felonies are listed in statute, and crimes precluding good moral character are determined by a combination of case law and statutory law. These criminal categories are further modified for specific INA provisions. The term \"moral turpitude\" has been used in immigration law since 1891 and is determined by judicial and administrative case law. Since 1988, Congress has designated specific offenses as aggravated felonies for immigration purposes, prioritizing the removal of aliens convicted of such crimes through streamlined procedures. Aggravated felonies initially included murder, drug trafficking, and illegal trafficking in firearms or destructive devices. The definition of \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes includes crimes such as murder, drug trafficking, illegal trafficking in firearms, and specific criminal categories listed in the INA. The definition of \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes includes various federal offenses such as murder, rape, drug trafficking, firearms trafficking, money laundering, child pornography, racketeering, and prostitution. The curr_chunk discusses various federal offenses including slavery, espionage, fraud, alien smuggling, illegal entry of deported aliens, passport forgery, failure to appear for sentence service, and trafficking in vehicles with altered identification numbers. The curr_chunk discusses aggravated felonies, including offenses related to obstruction of justice, perjury, bribery of a witness, failure to appear in court for a felony charge, and attempts or conspiracies to commit these offenses. Good moral character is a requirement for naturalization and immigration relief eligibility. The INA lists certain criminal activities that can prevent a finding of good moral character for immigration relief eligibility. These activities are not exhaustive, and engaging in illegal behavior not specifically designated by the INA can still be considered. Prostitution or involvement in commercialized vice during the character establishment period can also bar an alien from having good moral character. The INA lists criminal activities that can prevent good moral character for immigration relief eligibility, including involvement in prostitution or commercialized vice, encouraging illegal entry, committing crimes of moral turpitude, violating drug laws, and multiple offenses resulting in at least five years of imprisonment. Giving false information is also prohibited. Certain criminal activities can prevent an alien from establishing good moral character for immigration benefits, such as involvement in illegal gambling, multiple gambling offenses, criminal confinement, and aggravated felony convictions. The list of disqualifying conduct is not exhaustive, and other behaviors like deliberate non-support of family or adultery can also impact eligibility. Prior criminal conduct before the \"good moral character\" period may also be considered. Certain criminal conduct can impact an alien's ability to enter or stay in the United States, affect immigration relief options, and citizenship eligibility. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) designates certain aliens as inadmissible for committing crimes involving moral turpitude. This includes aliens convicted of such crimes, except for those committed under the age of 18. The Immigration and Nationality Act designates certain aliens as inadmissible for committing crimes involving moral turpitude, including crimes related to controlled substances or illicit trafficking. This applies to aliens convicted of such crimes, except for those committed under the age of 18. The Immigration and Nationality Act designates certain aliens as inadmissible for various reasons, including obtaining financial benefits from illicit activities, multiple convictions with a total sentence of at least five years, engaging in prostitution or unlawful vice, committing serious crimes with claimed immunity, involvement in human trafficking, or being related to a trafficker. Based on the knowledge or reasonable belief of a consular officer or immigration officer, individuals may be deemed inadmissible if they have benefitted from illicit activity, are involved in money laundering or espionage, or have engaged in terrorist activities or alien smuggling. Criminal grounds for inadmissibility include immigration document fraud, illegal entry, unlawful voting, child abduction, genocide participation, and religious freedom violations. Exceptions exist for certain offenses, and waivers can be granted for crimes involving moral turpitude, minor drug possession, and certain convictions. INA \u00a7 212(h)(1) allows for discretionary waivers of inadmissibility for certain criminal activities, including prostitution, serious criminal offenses, and unlawful commercial vices, if specific requirements are met. These requirements include seeking admission as a lawful permanent resident, the conduct occurred more than 15 years prior to the application, admission would not harm national welfare, safety, or security, and the alien has been rehabilitated. Additional waivers are available for immediate family members under INA \u00a7 212(h)(1)(B). Waivers under INA \u00a7 212(h)(1)(B) are available for immediate family members seeking admission as lawful permanent residents if denial would cause extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent, son, or daughter. Waivers are also available for alien spouses or children of U.S. citizens or LPRs who have been subjected to extreme cruelty. Certain aliens, such as those convicted of murder or criminal acts involving torture, are not eligible for these waivers. Additionally, aliens previously admitted as LPRs are not eligible for a waiver under this provision. Criminal grounds for deportation can lead to removal of aliens who have committed aggravated felonies or have not resided continuously in the US for at least seven years. Waivers may be available for certain aliens seeking temporary admission or cancellation of removal for permanent residents. Deportable offenses include crimes involving moral turpitude punishable by at least one year of imprisonment. An alien can be deported if convicted of certain crimes within five years of admission, including crimes involving moral turpitude, aggravated felonies, failure to register as a sex offender, drug offenses, firearm offenses, espionage, sabotage, treason, or sedition. An alien can be deported if convicted of offenses punishable by imprisonment of five years or more, offenses under specific acts, threatening the President or other officials, crimes related to violence or harassment, or human trafficking offenses. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for discretionary relief, such as cancellation of removal and waivers of inadmissibility, in deportation cases. Immigration authorities have the power to grant asylum, cancel removal proceedings, permit voluntary departure, or adjust status under registry provisions, but these remedies are limited for certain criminal aliens. Asylum is not available for aliens convicted of a particularly serious crime. Aliens convicted of a particularly serious crime, including aggravated felonies or offenses designated as particularly serious by the Attorney General, are ineligible for asylum. Additionally, individuals involved in recruiting child soldiers, specified terrorist activities, posing a danger to national security, or engaging in persecution based on various factors are also ineligible for asylum. Withholding of removal is a separate remedy from asylum, requiring a higher standard of proof and limited relief to the claimant only. It does not allow for adjustment to LPR status and is mandatory for qualifying aliens. Relief is barred for those with criminal grounds, but not all aggravated felonies automatically disqualify for withholding of removal. Cancellation of removal is a remedy available for long-term alien residents, combining previous forms of relief like \u00a7 212(c) relief and suspension of deportation. It allows for the cancellation of removal for certain non-LPRs who have been in the US for at least 10 years and would face exceptional hardship if removed. Certain criminal activity can make an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal, despite their established roots in the United States. Disqualifying criminal activity includes convictions that prevent a finding of good moral character and crimes falling within grounds for inadmissibility or deportation. Civil immigration document fraud also prevents relief. Continuous residence stops upon committing an offense that would render the alien inadmissible. The Attorney General may cancel removal for an alien who has been an LPR for at least five years, resided in the US continuously for at least seven years, and has not been convicted of an aggravated offense. Voluntary departure allows deportable aliens to leave the United States without the consequences of a removal order. There are two standards for voluntary departure, depending on when it is requested. Criminal disqualifications include aggravated felonies and terrorist activities. If voluntary departure is sought after removal proceedings, the alien must not have been convicted of an aggravated felony and must have good moral character for at least five years. To qualify for asylum or withholding of removal, the alien must show they would personally face persecution. Temporary haven is permitted for nationals of countries experiencing widespread upheaval. Relief is granted on an individual basis, but protection is denied for certain criminal grounds. Aliens disqualified from temporary protected status include those convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors in the US, or who would be ineligible for asylum due to criminal conduct. Certain aliens with nonimmigrant status may adjust to LPR status, as well as those without legal status under specific circumstances. However, inadmissible aliens, including those with criminal grounds, are barred from adjustment. The registry provision in the INA allows for the adjustment of aliens who have lived in the US for an extended period. The registry provision in the INA allows for the adjustment of aliens who have lived in the US since before 1972. However, aliens inadmissible on criminal grounds or lacking good moral character are ineligible for adjustment. Good moral character is a requirement for naturalization, with a minimum of five years of residency in the US before applying. Certain criminal acts may disqualify an alien from possessing good moral character. Certain criminal acts may disqualify an alien from possessing good moral character, as outlined in INA \u00a7 101(f). The listing of disqualifying conduct is not exhaustive, and crimes occurring before the statutory period can also impact the assessment. Recent legislative measures have aimed to modify immigration consequences for criminal activity, such as providing relief to certain individuals like members of the African National Congress. Recent legislative measures have aimed to modify immigration consequences for criminal activity, including making gang-related activity a ground for inadmissibility, deportation, and ineligibility for certain forms of relief from removal. Proposed changes may include adding document-fraud offenses to the list of criminal activities making aliens inadmissible or deportable, making DUI offenses a ground for inadmissibility or deportation, and specifying that an aggravated felony conviction is a ground for inadmissibility."
