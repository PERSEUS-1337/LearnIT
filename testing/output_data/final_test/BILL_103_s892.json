    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public Health and Safety Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the significant increase in privately owned handguns, which now exceed 70,000,000, with an additional 2,000,000 being added each year. Handguns are disproportionately involved in violent crimes and deaths compared to rifles and shotguns, with handgun homicides setting new records annually since 1987. Incidents involving handguns in schools have also seen a sharp rise. The increased presence of handguns in schools is causing concern among parents and children, leading to the diversion of school funds for security equipment. Handgun violence strains the national healthcare system, costing at least $4 billion annually. Handguns in homes may not be as effective for defense as commonly believed and can increase the risk of danger. The presence of handguns in homes is more likely to increase the danger of fatality or injury than enhance personal safety. Handgun violence burdens interstate commerce, threatens domestic tranquility, and current Federal firearms policy is inadequate to address the societal costs. Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to create two subchapters: \"Firearms In General\" and \"Handguns.\" The amendment aims to address the societal costs and dangers associated with handgun violence. The subchapter on \"Handguns\" in Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, includes definitions for terms like \"Handgun\" and \"Handgun ammunition.\" These definitions clarify the types of firearms and ammunition covered under this subchapter. The subchapter on \"Handguns\" in Chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, defines terms like \"Handgun club,\" \"Licensed handgun club,\" \"Registered security guard service,\" and \"Security guard service.\" It is unlawful for a person to manufacture, sell, possess, or use a handgun or handgun ammunition, with exceptions for military branches. The Secretary may approve transactions related to handguns and ammunition for specific entities like law enforcement agencies, security guard services, and handgun clubs. Additionally, the Secretary can issue licenses to handgun clubs as per regulations. The Secretary may issue a license to a handgun club if members comply with laws, are not prohibited from firearms transportation, have not violated regulations, and the club is founded for target shooting. The handgun club must have permanent premises, maintain control of members' handguns, secure storage facilities, meet safety requirements, and comply with regulations set by the Secretary for target shooting. The Secretary may approve the registration of a security guard service if it meets specific requirements for handgun storage and control. The licensed handgun club must pay a $25 annual license fee and will have its license revoked if it fails to meet the regulations. The security guard service must meet specific requirements for handgun storage and control, obtain necessary licenses, and comply with operational regulations set by the Secretary. Failure to meet these requirements will result in registration revocation. Additionally, a $50 annual registration fee is required. Licensed handgun clubs and security guard services must maintain records of handgun sales and transfers as per regulations set by the Secretary. They are also required to report any loss or theft of handguns within thirty days of discovery. Theft or loss of handguns must be reported within thirty days of discovery, with specific information required by regulations. Handguns can be voluntarily delivered to designated law enforcement agencies for transfer, destruction, or other disposition. The Secretary will reimburse individuals who deliver handguns within 180 days of enactment with either $25 or the gun's fair market value. Appropriations are authorized for these payments. Violating Section 942 can result in a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Delivery of handguns after 180 days may lead to penalties. Individuals who fail to report a loss or theft of a handgun as required by section 945(b) may face civil penalties determined by the Secretary, not exceeding $1,000 for negligent failures and up to $5,000 for intentional failures. Additionally, officers designated under specific sections may face imprisonment. Under section 943(a)(6)(C)(i) or 944(a)(1)(A), individuals may face imprisonment for up to five years or a fine, or both. If a person sells a handgun to a licensed club or member and it is delivered to an unauthorized place, they may be subject to civil penalties up to $1,000 for negligent delivery and fines up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both for intentional delivery. Additionally, making false statements or representations can result in penalties. A person who makes a false statement or representation regarding required information for licensed entities under this subchapter may face penalties. For negligent false statements, a civil penalty up to $1,000 is imposed by the Secretary, while intentional false statements result in fines. Failure to maintain records or permit inspection can result in penalties such as fines up to $5,000 and imprisonment for up to five years for intentional violations. Additionally, forfeiture of handguns or ammunition involved in violations may occur. The subchapter allows for seizure and forfeiture of firearms used in violations. The Secretary can create necessary regulations. Handgun regulation under this subchapter is in addition to other laws. If any provision is invalid, the rest remains. \"If any provision is held invalid, the rest of the subchapter and its application to others not similarly situated shall not be affected.\" SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not modify provisions of the National Firearms Act, the Mutual Security Act of 1954, or section 1715 of title 18, United States Code. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act and its amendments take effect upon enactment, with certain sections delayed by 180 days."
