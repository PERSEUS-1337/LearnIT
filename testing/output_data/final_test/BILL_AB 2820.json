    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 396 of the Penal Code in California is amended. The Legislature aims to prevent price gouging on essential goods and services during emergencies to protect consumers from unfair practices. During emergencies, the state can declare a state of emergency or local emergency to ensure vital goods and services for consumer health, safety, and welfare. The Legislature intends for this section to be broadly interpreted to serve its beneficial purposes. During a state of emergency declared by the President, Governor, or local official, it is illegal to sell essential goods and services for more than 10% above their original price for 30 days. During a state of emergency, price increases are allowed if directly linked to additional costs from suppliers or labor/materials, as long as the price does not exceed 10% above the seller's cost plus markup prior to the emergency. During a state of emergency, contractors are prohibited from selling repair or reconstruction services at a price more than 10% above their pre-emergency rates. Exceptions are allowed if the price increase is directly linked to additional costs from suppliers or labor/materials. During a state of emergency, contractors cannot charge more than 10% above their usual rates for repair or reconstruction services, unless the price increase is due to additional costs from suppliers or labor/materials. During a state of emergency declared by the President, Governor, or local official, hotel and motel owners cannot raise rates by more than 10% for 30 days, unless the increase is justified by additional costs or seasonal adjustments. During a state of emergency, rates at hotels and motels cannot be raised by more than 10% for 30 days, with possible extensions if necessary to protect citizens. Violating this rule is a misdemeanor with fines and imprisonment, and is considered an unlawful business practice. The terms \"State of emergency\" and \"Local emergency\" are defined as natural or manmade disasters declared by the President or Governor, and by local authorities, respectively. \"Consumer food item\" refers to articles used for food or drink by people or animals. (4) \"Repair or reconstruction services\" are performed by licensed contractors for repairs to properties damaged in disasters. (5) \"Emergency supplies\" include water, flashlights, radios, batteries, blankets, toiletries, and more. (6) \"Medical supplies\" consist of medications, bandages, alcohol, and antibacterial products. (7) \"Building materials\" encompass lumber, tools, windows, and items for property construction. (8) \"Gasoline\" refers to fuel for vehicles or power tools. (9) \"Transportation, freight, and storage services\" refers to companies that move, store, or transport personal or business property, including towing services. (10) \"Housing\" pertains to rental housing with a lease term of one year or less. (11) \"Goods\" is defined as in the Civil Code. The section does not override local ordinances with stricter penalties. Businesses can use regular prices for items sold before an emergency to calculate prices during the emergency. No reimbursement is required by this act as it creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes penalties, within the meaning of the Government Code and California Constitution."
