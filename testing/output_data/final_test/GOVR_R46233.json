    "content": "When Congress considers legislation, it takes into account the proposal's potential budgetary effects to determine compliance with budgetary rules. The House and Senate Budget Committees rely on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to assess the budgetary impact of legislation. Cost estimates provided by CBO and JCT are guided by requirements set by Congress, but also incorporate practices and conventions to create accurate estimates. The CBO and JCT provide cost estimates for proposed policies, incorporating individual behavioral responses but not macroeconomic effects. Dynamic estimates, which include macroeconomic effects, are sometimes required by Congress. Currently, there are no explicit congressional rules mandating dynamic estimates. This report discusses the need for dynamic scoring rules in Congress and provides general considerations for dynamic estimates. Congressional rules do not explicitly require dynamic estimates, and there is a discussion on potential rules changes in this area. The Congressional Budget Act mandates cost estimates by CBO and JCT for all bills, with specific requirements for revenue legislation and cost projections over a five-year period. When estimating the budgetary effect of a legislative proposal, CBO and JCT consider projections of revenue and spending levels under current law. The baseline assumptions impact how policies are estimated. CBO makes technical and economic assumptions when calculating the baseline, but must assume that spending and revenue policies continue or expire as currently slated in statute. For example, temporary tax cuts are assumed to expire in the baseline, leading to an increase in expected revenue after their expiration. This affects how related policies are estimated. When estimating the budgetary effect of a legislative proposal, CBO and JCT consider projections of revenue and spending levels under current law. The tax cut provisions expire in law, so a proposal to continue them would increase the deficit. Some programs slated to expire are assumed to continue in the baseline if they have outlays over $50 million. CBO follows scorekeeping guidelines to determine budgetary effects of legislation. The scorekeeping guidelines are used by the House and Senate Budget Committees, CBO, and OMB to ensure consistent practices. These guidelines include principles like counting mandatory spending provisions in appropriations bills against spending allocations. Changes to the guidelines are approved by all scorekeepers. Congress can direct cost estimates creation through rules and budget resolutions. House rules have required CBO and JCT to include information on a policy proposal's projected macroeconomic feedback in cost estimates. Congress can direct cost estimates creation through rules and budget resolutions, including provisions on how a policy should be estimated and what can be counted as new spending. Congressional committees, particularly the House and Senate Budget Committees, have jurisdiction over the CBO and play a role in shaping cost estimates. The CBO's primary duty is to assist the budget committees in oversight and the creation of cost estimates. Oversight of CBO and JCT estimates is under the jurisdiction of House and Senate Budget Committees. Estimates include budgetary effects of policy changes and behavioral responses, but not macroeconomic effects like changes in GDP. When estimating the effects of using more debt, conventional estimates consider the loss of revenue due to the tax advantage of debt over equity. This loss offsets the revenue gain from changing the tax rate on corporate income. However, these estimates do not account for lost revenue from reduced investment if the rate increase leads to lower production. Dynamic scoring aims to include macroeconomic effects by adjusting for changes in aggregate demand and supply to boost output in an underemployed economy. Dynamic scoring aims to include macroeconomic effects by adjusting for changes in aggregate demand and supply to boost output in an underemployed economy. This can involve fiscal stimulus effects that increase aggregate demand and supply-side effects that alter potential output through changes in investment or savings. Congressional interest in dynamic estimating has increased recently. Congressional interest in dynamic estimating has increased in recent decades due to the rise in House and Senate rules restricting budgetary legislation. Recent advancements in economic analysis and modeling have made estimating macroeconomic feedback effects possible. Proponents and opponents of dynamic scoring aim for accuracy and consistency, with some suggesting its usefulness under certain circumstances for a more accurate assessment of budgetary impact than conventional scoring. Dynamic scoring is argued to have a greater impact on legislative proposals compared to conventional scoring methods. It is believed to provide a more accurate projection of revenue impact by considering macroeconomic feedback effects. Advocates claim that including these effects can enhance Congress's ability to compare policy proposals and ensure consistency in estimating the budgetary impact of large legislative packages. This approach emphasizes the importance of economic assumptions in assessing the impact of certain legislative proposals. Advocates for dynamic scoring argue that economic assumptions should be considered in legislative proposals. They believe that using a dynamic approach to measure policy changes can encourage productive economic activity and provide a more accurate estimation of budgetary outcomes. Dynamic scoring is seen as necessary to avoid bias against proposals that aim to stimulate economic growth, such as cuts in marginal tax rates. Technical advances have made it possible to produce quality dynamic estimates. The production of quality dynamic estimates is now possible due to technical advances in modeling and analysis, and an increase in evidence showing public responses to policy changes. Both CBO and JCT are capable of producing dynamic estimates, with concerns about accuracy and consistency raised against dynamic estimates. Critics argue that projected macroeconomic feedback effects are too uncertain to rely on for accurate budgetary projections. Dynamic scoring results are controversial due to uncertainty in behavioral assumptions and model parameters. Critics argue that assuming constant GDP for all legislative proposals is more consistent. However, dynamic estimates face increased uncertainty, especially with taxpayer responses to tax changes. Dynamic scoring results are controversial due to uncertainty in behavioral assumptions and model parameters. Critics argue that assuming constant GDP for all legislative proposals is more consistent. However, dynamic estimates face increased uncertainty, especially with taxpayer responses to tax changes. Some argue that dynamic estimates should be provided by CBO and JCT only for \"major proposals\" with significant budgetary impacts. Dynamic estimates should be conducted for spending and revenue proposals, including discretionary and direct/mandatory spending, when deemed necessary by committee and chamber leadership. CBO and JCT face limitations in estimating macroeconomic effects for every proposal, leading to the suggestion that dynamic scoring should be done only when time and resources allow for a thorough analysis. The rules for dynamic estimates have varied over the years, with no current explicit congressional rules requiring dynamic estimates for spending legislation. Committees and Members can still request dynamic estimates for certain policies, but there are no specific requirements for their preparation or use. The dynamic scoring rule, in effect through 2002, required a projection based on assumptions about macroeconomic feedback effects. In January 1997, a symposium was held to explore the feasibility of using these results to enhance the budgeting process. In January 2003, the House replaced its previous dynamic scoring rule with a new one. In January 2003, the House replaced its previous dynamic scoring rule with a more extensive rule that required a \"macroeconomic impact analysis\" for any bill reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means proposing to amend the Internal Revenue Code. The new rule no longer used the term \"dynamic estimate\" and required the estimate to identify critical assumptions. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) released a report in 2003 outlining their efforts to model the macroeconomic effects of proposed tax legislation. The analyses provided information on expected macroeconomic effects, general conclusions, and potential budgetary effects using different models and assumptions. The analyses did not include specific dollar amounts but detailed effects on various aspects of the economy. The JCT used four different types of models to analyze the macroeconomic effects of proposed tax legislation. These models incorporated supply-side effects and some also included demand-side effects. The models included MEG, OLG, and GI, each with different characteristics and assumptions. The JCT used various models to analyze tax legislation, including MEG, GI, and DSGE. Different behavioral responses were considered, and multiple macroeconomic estimates were prepared for legislative proposals. The JCT utilized various models like MEG, GI, and DSGE to analyze tax legislation. The DSGE model replaced the GI model in 2006, but was not used in published analyses. Dynamic estimates were required for major legislation, and in 2015, a new House rule replaced the previous one. The House Rule XIII, clause 8 replaced the previous rule in 2018, expanding dynamic estimates to include revenue and mandatory spending proposals for major legislation. This required dynamic estimates from both CBO and JCT for legislation with significant budgetary effects. Dynamic estimates now included specific dollar amounts instead of a range of outcomes. The House Rule XIII, clause 8 in 2018 expanded dynamic estimates to include revenue and mandatory spending proposals for major legislation, requiring specific dollar amounts instead of a range of outcomes. Congress directed CBO and JCT to provide dynamic estimates for fiscal years 2016 and 2018, incorporating budgetary effects of changes in economic variables. The House rule expanded dynamic estimates to include revenue and mandatory spending legislation for major legislation, with specific dollar thresholds. Major legislation was defined as having a significant budgetary impact, including treaties with a $15 billion impact and designated mandatory or revenue legislation. The JCT required dynamic estimates for major legislation, including budgetary effects on economic variables. Estimates needed to include long-term effects, critical assumptions, and data sources. Senate provision for the 115th Congress required distributional effects across income categories. Dynamic estimates provided a specific dollar amount rather than a range of outcomes. The Senate Budget Committee communicated that dynamic estimates would be used for informational purposes only, with macroeconomic effects included for a 10-year period. The JCT uses three models: MEG, OLG, and DSGE, with the introduction of the DSGE model in 2017. Discussions in 2018 suggested the DSGE model now allows for unemployment, while CBO has two models assuming full employment. CBO has two models that assume full employment: the Solow growth model and the life cycle model. The Solow model has stronger and weaker labor supply responses, while the OLG model has alternative assumptions about interest rates. JCT combines short-term and long-term effects in its models. Beginning in 2015, JCT reported a single estimate. In 2015, JCT reported a single estimate that was a weighted average of various models' point estimates. Different models were used with varying labor response assumptions. For the 2017 tax revision, MEG was weighted at 40%, OLG at 40%, and DSGE at 20%. Sensitivity analysis was not reported within the models. CBO and JCT estimated the effects of bills related to the Affordable Care Act repeal. JCT used the MEG model, while CBO used its Solow model and short-term model. CBO reported results from multiple models and assumptions in their macroeconomic analyses of the President's budget. The analysis in 2015 and 2016 included estimates of immigration's impact on productivity, with sensitivity analysis leading to 16 different estimated effects on GDP over 10 years. No subsequent macroeconomic analyses of the President's budget have been prepared by CBO. Currently, no House or Senate rules explicitly require dynamic estimates for macroeconomic analyses of the President's budget. Congress may consider reinstating explicit rules for dynamic estimates, which could be included in chamber rules, budget resolutions, or statutes. If Congress decides to implement such rules, various aspects will need to be considered. When considering dynamic estimates for macroeconomic analyses of the President's budget, Congress may need to determine thresholds for major proposals and whether rules should apply to both spending and revenue proposals. The impact on GDP could be measured by individual provisions or groups of provisions that meet a certain threshold, potentially affecting revenue-neutral legislation. When considering dynamic estimates for macroeconomic analyses of the President's budget, Congress may need to determine thresholds for major proposals and whether rules should apply to both spending and revenue proposals. The JCT has provided insight into the sensitivity of results to model and parameter choices, as well as information on behavioral responses. Questions arise on the application of dynamic estimates to determine compliance with budgetary rules and whether additional resources should be allocated to CBO and JCT. Should additional resources be provided to CBO and JCT for developing greater capacity in providing dynamic estimates?"
