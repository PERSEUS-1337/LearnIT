    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Environmentally Efficient Building Materials Act of 1993\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"Administrator,\" \"agency,\" \"environmentally efficient materials,\" \"environmentally efficient building materials,\" and \"solid waste.\" The term \"solid waste\" includes various discarded materials from industrial, commercial, mining, agricultural, and community activities, but excludes certain materials like domestic sewage and industrial discharges subject to permits. The term \"construction\" is also defined in relation to projects. The term \"construction\" under this Act refers to the building of new structures, acquisition of lands, remodeling, and installation of equipment necessary for facility operation. It also includes preliminary planning for economic feasibility and public health and safety. The term \"construction\" under this Act includes engineering feasibility, public health and safety aspects, architectural, legal, fiscal, and economic investigations, surveys, designs, plans, drawings, specifications, and project supervision. Federal acquisition and use of environmentally efficient building materials. The Administrator will establish a 3-year pilot program to promote research and development of environmentally efficient building materials for Federal facilities. Selection criteria include maximizing conservation of natural resources and ensuring quality. The Administrator will establish a 3-year pilot program to promote research and development of environmentally efficient building materials for Federal facilities. Criteria for selecting materials include quality, cost competitiveness, environmental standards, safety standards, and energy efficiency. Preference will be given to materials that best satisfy the criteria for maximizing conservation of natural resources. The Administrator will submit a report to Congress within 30 days of completing the pilot program on environmentally efficient building materials. The report will include details on the materials used, their cost and performance compared to conventional materials, potential expansion beyond the pilot program, how well they meet criteria, and the impact on research and development. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board is established. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board (referred to as the \"Board\") consists of 11 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency, General Services Administration, Army Corps of Engineers, environmental community, construction industry, and manufacturing companies producing environmentally efficient materials. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board consists of 11 members appointed by the Administrator, including representatives from various sectors. The Board's duties include providing advice on the pilot program, advising on research and development of environmentally efficient materials, and making recommendations for further facilitation of such materials in Federal construction. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board, chaired by the Administrator, meets quarterly to discuss minimizing solid waste in Federal construction. The Board holds hearings, appoints members, and gathers information from Federal agencies to fulfill its purpose. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board, chaired by the Administrator, meets quarterly to discuss minimizing solid waste in Federal construction. The Board may obtain necessary information from Federal agencies, use postal services, accept gifts, and compensate non-government members. The Environmentally Efficient Building Material Advisory Board, chaired by the Administrator, meets quarterly to discuss minimizing solid waste in Federal construction. Board members are compensated according to the Executive Schedule and are allowed travel expenses while performing duties. The Chairman can appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws. The Board, chaired by the Administrator, can appoint an executive director and staff without following civil service laws. The Chairman may set their compensation without restrictions, and federal employees can be detailed to the Board without reimbursement. The Board, chaired by the Administrator, has the privilege to procure temporary and intermittent services at specific rates. A report must be submitted to Congress and the Administrator with recommendations on environmentally efficient materials and minimizing solid waste in Federal construction. The Board, chaired by the Administrator, must submit a report to Congress within 90 days after completing the pilot program. The Board will cease to exist within 1 year after submitting the report. The Administrator must promulgate regulations with guidelines for Federal agencies on reducing solid waste and using environmentally efficient building materials in Federal construction contracts. This includes requiring bids to include plans for waste reduction and efficient materials use, along with standards for acceptable plans."
