    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines terms such as \"advanced fission reactor,\" \"Department,\" \"fast neutron,\" and \"National laboratory.\" The term \"National Laboratory\" is defined as specified in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with limitations for specific laboratories. \"Neutron flux\" refers to the intensity of neutron radiation, while \"neutron source\" is a research machine providing neutron irradiation services. The curr_chunk describes a research machine that provides neutron irradiation services for research on materials sciences, nuclear physics, testing of advanced materials, nuclear fuels, and related components for reactor systems. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The curr_chunk states the mission of the research machine providing neutron irradiation services for various research purposes. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include programs for civilian nuclear research, development, and commercial application with objectives including promoting scientific progress and enabling scientific discoveries in nuclear, chemical, and materials science engineering. Maintaining nuclear energy research programs at National Laboratories and higher education institutions is also emphasized. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include programs for civilian nuclear research, development, and commercial application with objectives such as reducing nuclear weapons proliferation, ensuring public safety, and supporting technology transfer from National Laboratories to the private sector. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include programs for civilian nuclear research and development, emphasizing the importance of nuclear energy for national security, scientific progress, electricity generation, and space exploration. Congress recommends focusing on research programs that enable private sector and educational institutions to conduct experiments and enhance practical knowledge of nuclear engineering. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include programs for civilian nuclear research and development, emphasizing the importance of nuclear energy for national security, scientific progress, electricity generation, and space exploration. Congress recommends focusing on research programs that enable private sector and educational institutions to conduct experiments and enhance practical knowledge of nuclear engineering. High-performance computation and supportive research are emphasized. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a program for modeling and simulation to enhance the development of new reactor technologies through high-performance computation techniques. The Secretary must coordinate with relevant Federal agencies and consider objectives from the private sector and institutions of higher education. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to include a program for developing computational software and capabilities for advanced fission reactor systems, nuclear fusion systems, and reactor systems for space exploration. This includes simulating and predicting nuclear phenomena, increasing research infrastructure utility, and leveraging experience from the Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation. The Secretary will support research activities to enhance the Department's research facilities, including studying physical processes for material degradation simulation and fuel behavior, as well as validating computational tools. The Secretary will support research activities to enhance the Department's research facilities, including studying physical processes for material degradation simulation and fuel behavior, as well as validating computational tools. Additionally, there is a focus on developing a versatile neutron source. The Secretary will determine the mission need for a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source by consulting with various stakeholders. Once the mission need is established, a plan for the establishment of the user facility will be submitted to the relevant committees. The Secretary will submit a detailed plan to establish a user facility with fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability and capacity for upgrades by December 31, 2025. The facility will also consider capabilities for experimental high-temperature testing. The plan for the user facility includes providing a source of fast neutrons at a high flux level, maximizing irradiation flexibility and volume, capabilities for lower energy neutron irradiation, multiple loops for testing in different coolants, and additional examination capabilities. The Secretary will leverage best practices from the Office of Science for managing national user facilities and must explain any delays in implementing this section in the annual budget request. SEC. 7. ENABLING NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION. Establishment of National Nuclear Innovation Center to test and demonstrate reactor concepts funded by the private sector, operate a database for sharing nuclear science data, and develop reactor integration systems. The Secretary will consult with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on safety issues. The National Nuclear Innovation Center will consult with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on safety issues and allow their staff to observe technology development. The objectives include validating fusion and advanced fission reactors, resolving technical uncertainties, and conducting research to improve novel reactor technologies. The Secretary will leverage federal technical expertise in operating the Center. The Secretary will utilize federal technical expertise to expedite the implementation of subsection (c) and ensure safety at National Laboratories. A report assessing capabilities must be submitted within 180 days of the Act's enactment to relevant Senate and House committees. The House of Representatives will assess the Department's capabilities to oversee privately funded reactors. The report will cover safety review, potential hosting sites, and contractual mechanisms for partnerships with the private sector and other federal agencies. The report will also address potential intellectual property concerns, cost structures for security and project expenses, and other challenges identified by the Secretary. SEC. 8. BUDGET PLAN. The Secretary must submit 3 alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development to specific committees within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Plans include constant funding at 2016 levels and 2 percent annual increases. The Secretary must submit 3 alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development to specific committees within 1 year of the Act's enactment. Plans include constant funding at 2016 levels, 2 percent annual increases, and an unconstrained budget. Each plan must prioritize programs, projects, and activities supporting advanced nuclear energy technologies, provide realistic budget requirements for specific sections, and justify the continuation or termination of existing research programs. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must submit a report as required by Section 9. The Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must submit a report by December 31, 2016, to Senate and House committees detailing the Commission's ability to license advanced reactor designs within a 4-year period and any barriers to overcome for licensing. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must license advanced reactor designs developed under this Act within a 4-year period."
