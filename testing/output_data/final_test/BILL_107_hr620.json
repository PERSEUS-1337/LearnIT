    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Student Dropout Prevention and Recovery Act of 2001\". It includes findings related to student dropout prevention. Congress finds that lowering the student dropout rate is a significant challenge for educators due to the lack of focus at the Federal level and limited resources for dropout prevention. Local and community efforts are crucial for improving schools and increasing graduation rates. Efforts to increase graduation rates should focus on successful strategies such as systemic renewal, community collaboration, professional development, family involvement, early childhood education, reading and writing programs, individualized instruction, instructional technologies, mentoring and tutoring, service learning, learning styles, violence prevention, conflict resolution, career education, and workforce readiness. The National Dropout Prevention Network has found that strategies for dropout prevention have been successful in all school levels and settings. Developing model programs based on effective strategies is crucial for comprehensive dropout prevention efforts nationwide. A nationwide dropout prevention program should be based on successful model programs proven to lower dropout rates, and disseminated to school and community leaders for implementation. SEC. 3.
