The Windfall Profits Rebate Act of 2005 imposes an excise tax on integrated oil companies for windfall profits from taxable crude oil removed from properties, with provisions for fractional barrels and tax payment by producers. The Windfall Profits Rebate Act of 2005 defines windfall profit as the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price. The removal price is determined by the amount for which the oil is sold, with specific rules for sales between related persons and oil removed from property before sale. The Windfall Profits Rebate Act of 2005 defines windfall profit as the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price, which is $40 for each barrel of crude oil plus an additional amount. If crude oil is refined on the property before removal, the removal price is considered the constructive sales price for income determination. The Windfall Profits Rebate Act of 2005 defines windfall profit as the excess of the removal price of taxable crude oil over the adjusted base price, which is $40 for each barrel of crude oil plus an additional amount determined by an inflation adjustment formula.
