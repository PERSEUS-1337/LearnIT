    "content": "The Act is titled \"Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007\" and includes procedures for considering claims of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure. The \"Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007\" added a new section to Chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code, regarding claims of constitutionally based privilege against disclosure. This section outlines the process for making Presidential records available to the public, including providing notice to the former and incumbent Presidents and making the notice public. The notice must be in writing and include information as prescribed by regulations. Upon the expiration of the 20-day period, the Archivist shall make the record public unless a claim of constitutionally based privilege is made by a former or incumbent President. The President can extend the period once for an additional 20 days for review. The Archivist shall not publicly release a Presidential record subject to a privilege claim asserted by a former or incumbent President. The claim of constitutionally based privilege must be personally asserted by the President, who must notify relevant committees on the same day. The Archivist must wait 20 days after being notified of a privilege claim by a former President before making the record public, unless directed otherwise by a court order. The Archivist cannot release a Presidential record subject to a privilege claim by the incumbent President unless the claim is withdrawn or a final court order mandates its release. The Archivist must adjust time periods to comply with congressional or judicial subpoenas. Restrictions are placed on access to presidential records, prohibiting individuals convicted of crimes related to record handling from accessing original records. Conforming amendments are made to ensure consistency in the code. The Archivist must adjust time periods to comply with congressional or judicial subpoenas.
