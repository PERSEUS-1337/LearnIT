    "content": "Since HIV/AIDS was discovered in 1981, over 20 million people have died from the virus. Currently, nearly 40 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, including around 2.2 million children under 15 years old. The majority of those affected reside in developing countries, with sub-Saharan Africa being the most impacted continent. A study by USAID, UNICEF, and UNAIDS in 2003 found that 15 million children had lost one or both parents to AIDS, with 12.3 million in sub-Saharan Africa. The number of children orphaned by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa increased from less than 1 million to over 12 million between 1990 and 2003. Experts predict a further increase due to the 10-year time lag between HIV infection and death. Experts predict that without anti-retroviral medications, orphan populations will continue to grow for at least two decades after a country reaches its peak HIV infection rate. In Uganda, despite a decline in the epidemic, the number of orphans under 15 continued to rise for 10 years after the infection rate peaked. The number of orphans is now expected to decline in Uganda, from 14.6% in 2001 to a projected 9.6% in 2010. Similarly, Thailand, known for reducing its HIV/AIDS rate, is still seeing an increase in children orphaned by AIDS, with an estimated 380,000 expected to lose their parents to AIDS in 2005. The term \"AIDS orphans\" is used in this report to highlight the issue of children affected by HIV/AIDS. However, other terms like \"orphans and vulnerable children\" and \"AIDS-affected children\" are preferred to avoid further stigmatization. The global population of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS is a growing concern, with 43 million children orphaned in sub-Saharan Africa by the end of 2003, 32% of which were due to AIDS. Asia also had a significant number of children orphaned by AIDS in 2001. Asia had a larger overall orphan population than sub-Saharan Africa in 2001, with 65 million orphans. Despite a lower number of children orphaned by AIDS, Asia still faced significant challenges with HIV/AIDS, such as India having 5.1 million people living with the virus in 2003. This has impacted education in high seroprevalence areas, with HIV-infected teachers losing working time and countries like Kenya facing a shortage of trained teachers due to the virus. Heavily affected countries like Kenya and the Central African Republic are experiencing a significant loss of teachers due to HIV/AIDS, leading to school closures and staff shortages. This has resulted in lower crop yields, reduced land use, and a decline in child survival gains over the past decade. The impact of HIV/AIDS in heavily affected countries like Kenya has led to a decline in child survival gains. Many children orphaned by HIV/AIDS are living with extended family or on the streets, facing challenges such as school fees and basic needs. Efforts to support these children are crucial in strengthening families and communities. Efforts to support children affected by HIV/AIDS, including those orphaned or made vulnerable by the virus, are gaining attention. Proponents advocate for cost-effective grassroots initiatives, additional resources for programs, and congressional support through legislation like P.L. 108-25. Streamlining activities and allocating funds efficiently are key points of debate in addressing the needs of these children. In the 108th and 109th sessions of Congress, efforts were made to support children affected by HIV/AIDS, with a focus on orphans and vulnerable children. H.R. 1409, Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005, was enacted on November 8, 2005, authorizing spending for orphan-related programs and establishing a monitoring system for effectiveness. The Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children Act of 2005 authorized spending for orphan-related programs and established a monitoring system for effectiveness. The increase in international HIV rates is devastating for governments heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, impacting their most productive populations and putting the future of these countries and their children at risk. Children orphaned and made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS often turn to the streets for refuge and to supplement lost wages, exposing them to various forms of exploitation including child prostitution. Reports estimate around 100 million children worldwide living on the streets, with some as young as nine engaged in sex work. Reports from heavily affected nations show a significant increase in street children over the past decade. Blantyre, Malawi has seen a 150% rise since 2002, with 40 new children on the streets monthly. Tegucigalpa, Honduras, has had an eightfold increase in street children in the last ten years. Kenya is known for its growing population of street children who resort to petty crimes for survival. Most of these children have families and homes but spend about 12 hours on the streets begging or working before returning home to sleep. Children as young as two years old are sent out by their parents to beg for food and money, raising concerns about their vulnerability to crime, terrorism, and HIV infection. Experts worry that orphaned and street children are at risk of being recruited for criminal activities, military warlords, and terrorist organizations, with some as young as seven years old already involved in wars worldwide. Children affected by HIV/AIDS, especially orphans, are vulnerable to exploitation and recruitment by warring factions. Studies in Zambia, Ethiopia, and Uganda have shown that orphans are at higher risk of being involved in sex work, domestic work, and experiencing sexual abuse. The Director of the White House Office of AIDS Policy has expressed concerns about the lack of adult supervision for AIDS orphans, posing a security risk. The lack of adult supervision for AIDS orphans poses a security risk, making them vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists. Some social scientists dispute the link between social breakdown and increased orphanhood, citing lack of evidence and strong family networks in southern Africa. Critics argue that prematurely labeling orphaned children as delinquents or criminals due to increased crime or insecurity further stigmatizes them. Concerns also arise about the impact of HIV/AIDS on skilled laborers, potentially destabilizing the national economy and society due to a decline in human capital. The inefficient transfer of skills and scholarship can lead to a decline in human capital, affecting economic growth and security. A 2003 World Bank report warned that the spread of AIDS could slow economic growth and even cause collapse. This weakened knowledge transmission process impacts future productivity as poorly educated children become less productive adults. In developing countries, reliance on land for food and income contrasts with professionals like engineers and lawyers who depend on education for income. Children affected by HIV/AIDS face challenges in education and skills training, leading to a higher risk of poverty and engaging in high-risk behavior. This perpetuates the cycle of HIV transmission and hinders economic development in affected countries. The economic challenges for these children begin when they realize their parent has AIDS, leading to fears about their future and potential withdrawal from school to care for sick family members. Children affected by HIV/AIDS often face challenges in education and skills training due to being pulled out of school to care for sick family members. This leads to financial struggles as household income is spent on the sick, making school fees unaffordable. As a result, children may become heads of households at a young age, responsible for supporting siblings with little to no education or employable skills. This situation perpetuates the cycle of poverty and hinders economic development in affected countries. Children affected by HIV/AIDS often face challenges in education and skills training as they are pulled out of school to care for sick family members. This leads to financial struggles as household income is spent on the sick, making school fees unaffordable. Orphaned children often drop out of school to work in households, fields, or on the street, engaging in activities like shining shoes, begging, bartending, and selling food. This vulnerability makes them susceptible to abuse and exploitation, increasing their risk of contracting HIV. Stories of children going hungry due to HIV-infected parents too weak to work are increasingly reported across Africa. In Africa, women play a crucial role in agriculture, with 80% of subsistence farmers being women. They possess knowledge of wild grains and roots to survive during famines and pass on farming skills to their children. However, HIV/AIDS affects women of childbearing age, hindering the transfer of these skills. As a result, families affected by HIV often struggle with low crop yields, leading to financial strain on education and healthcare. The economic impact of HIV/AIDS on Africa's agricultural system is significant, particularly in Southern Africa. The region, with the highest HIV/AIDS rates, is experiencing a decline in productivity and purchasing power, leading to a shift towards less labor-intensive crops. This has resulted in a decrease in access to nutritious foods, affecting the agricultural sector which accounts for a significant portion of Africa's GDP, foreign exchange earnings, and employment. Experts predict that AIDS will have killed a significant portion of agricultural workers in southern Africa by 2020, leading to a decline in productive yields. In the early 1990s, countries in the region exported surplus grain production but faced hunger and starvation in 2002. Some countries rely on the World Food Program to feed millions. The Southern Africa Development Community projected a cereal deficit in 2002 and required assistance in 2003 and 2004 for countries like Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Swaziland, and Malawi. Lesotho, Malawi, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe still needed assistance in 2004, with a significant portion of the population at risk of hunger or starvation. In Lesotho and Swaziland, 25% of the population is at risk of hunger until the next harvest in March 2005. Malawi needs assistance for 1.7 million people, mainly in the south. Zimbabwe faces a food crisis with 4.7 million people needing help due to reduced maize production and high food prices. The World Food Program has received minimal response to their appeal for $404 million, only getting 2.5% so far. The region's household crop supply is strained as families take in children orphaned by AIDS, impacting the future generation's farming knowledge. Some experts are concerned about the long-term impact of AIDS on African communities, as children are losing their parents to the disease and not learning essential life skills like farming. The World Food Program is now a cosponsor of UNAIDS to address the nutrition and food security issues caused by AIDS. Stigma and discrimination towards those affected by HIV/AIDS, including children, are still prevalent, leading to rejection and isolation. Harsh cases of discrimination against HIV-infected children have been reported in countries like India and Trinidad and Tobago. A UNAIDS study in India revealed high levels of HIV-related stigma, with a significant percentage of people expressing negative attitudes towards HIV-positive individuals. In one instance, two HIV-positive children in India were initially barred from schools due to fears of infection, leading to their schoolmates being withdrawn by their parents. In Trinidad and Tobago, children faced discrimination and were denied entry into schools due to HIV fears. Even non-infected children may experience rejection and isolation, leading to feelings of anger and hopelessness. Orphaned children often lack support outside their families, exacerbating their sense of loneliness. Separation from siblings can further increase feelings of isolation. Orphaned children face challenges in school due to the loss of parents, isolation from friends, and additional responsibilities. Teachers often observe orphaned children daydreaming, arriving late and unprepared, or being non-responsive in the classroom. Orphaned children can face challenges at school, including unsympathetic teachers and discrimination within new households. Some teachers may yell at or make fun of orphaned children, while others provide support. Exploitation, such as receiving less food or being denied school fees, is also a concern. Additionally, reports of sexual abuse, especially among girls, have been noted. The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in many countries is fueled by gender inequities, with girls facing challenges such as lower education rates and engaging in survival sex. AUNAIDS survey in India found that a significant percentage of female sex workers were under 18, facing sexual exploitation in various forms including rape by peers and coercion by teachers. Young girls working as vendors or domestic servants are also vulnerable to sexual abuse. A study in Fiji revealed that 8 in 10 young domestic workers experienced sexual abuse by their employers. Young girls in impoverished areas often engage in domestic work for basic necessities. There is a widespread belief that virgins can cure HIV/AIDS, leading to a rise in rape cases among young girls. Shocking incidents like the rape of a five-month-old baby in South Africa have occurred. Recent data shows that girls are particularly vulnerable to contracting HIV, with two-thirds of newly infected 15-19 year olds in sub-Saharan Africa being female. In Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, there is a gender disparity in HIV rates among 15-19 year olds, with more girls infected than boys. Factors contributing to this include girls turning to older men for financial support and protection, increasing their risk of contracting HIV. Programs empowering girls and young women aim to address this issue. (58) Various programs empower girls and young women to prevent HIV/AIDS. Children affected by HIV/AIDS require support in economic, material, emotional, and legal aspects. Local communities are crucial in providing assistance to these children, with USAID survey showing relatives and friends as primary sources of support. (60) The United States and international community implement initiatives to help children affected by AIDS, facing challenges in providing necessary support. USAID backs programs offering material and other aid to orphans. USAID supports programs for orphans and vulnerable children through its Child Survival and Health Fund. These programs use an integrated approach, combining funding sources to support school feeding programs that address hunger, malnutrition, and disease while promoting basic education. Similar initiatives are also carried out by organizations like the World Food Program and UNICEF. Some advocate for direct support to families and communities caring for orphans and vulnerable children, including issuing stipends or financial assistance. Critics of providing direct stipends to families caring for orphans and vulnerable children have expressed concerns about exploitation, as seen in Botswana. Empowering community groups to monitor care can help prevent abuse. School feeding programs and microfinance services are effective strategies to support vulnerable children and their caretakers. Attaining basic education and employable skills is crucial in preventing HIV/AIDS and poverty. Education has positive impacts, such as higher income, lower HIV contraction rates, and delayed childbearing. HIV prevention messages are being integrated into school curricula to raise awareness among youth, who face high mortality rates. Awareness of HIV/AIDS remains low among young people in Mozambique and sub-Saharan Africa. Organizations in sub-Saharan Africa are implementing various approaches to increase education access for orphans and vulnerable children, including community schools with flexible hours and local teachers. These schools offer traditional and non-traditional responses, such as vocational training and interactive radio education. However, there are concerns about the quality of education compared to government schools. Community schools in sub-Saharan Africa face challenges such as lower quality education, potential closure due to lack of funding, and reliance on volunteer teachers. Vocational skills training, especially in farming, is crucial for children orphaned by AIDS to combat famine. UNICEF has launched a program in Swaziland to provide farming training to these children, aiming to help them generate income and address food insecurity in the region. Experts argue that vocational skills training programs can have additional benefits for girls, hoping to reduce reliance on sex work for income. Property grabbing poses a serious problem for widows and child-headed households, as traditional laws prevent women and children from inheriting property, leading to negative consequences such as sexual abuse and exploitation. Property grabbing is a concern for widows and child-headed households, increasing the risk of HIV contraction. USAID supports initiatives to help HIV-infected parents plan for their children's future through will-writing and succession-planning. Legislative issues in AIDS-affected countries can hinder the effectiveness of these programs. In developing countries, inheritance rights issues are complex and interlinked, requiring governments to ensure birth certificates for all children, strengthen child services departments, and revise property laws. Traditional cultural practices may not adequately protect orphans and widows, especially in the wake of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Children left without close family members may rely on distant relatives or grandmothers with limited legal power. UNAIDS reported that many countries with high HIV rates lack national policies for orphans and vulnerable children. Legislation enforcing inheritance rights could help reduce street children and prevent HIV. Some suggest increasing orphanages due to communities struggling to care for AIDS orphans. Advocates argue that orphanages provide essential care for children orphaned by AIDS, offering education, food, shelter, and nurturing. However, caution is advised in increasing the use of orphanages, as poverty is often the primary reason parents place their children in institutions. Research shows that only 25% of children in institutional care have no known relatives. Supporters of community-based care believe orphanages hinder children's self-sufficiency as adults by lacking life skills and community connections. Ethiopia is transitioning from orphanages to a country-wide reintegration program due to the high cost and negative impact on children's social development. Community-based support is seen as more effective in helping orphaned children by strengthening networks and initiatives. This approach enables children to remain in their communities and allows donors to support more children at a lower cost. The psychological impact of HIV/AIDS on children in heavily affected areas is often overlooked. Many children face the death of family members and struggle with coping with trauma. There is a lack of emphasis on helping children deal with witnessing these deaths, leading to unanswered questions about mortality and future. This impact is often misunderstood, especially in the classroom, where affected children may struggle with attendance, concentration, and school-related expenses. Children affected by HIV/AIDS often struggle with school attendance, concentration, and school-related expenses. Teachers are being trained to identify grief-related behavior in these children, leading to a better understanding of their challenges. Programs are being developed to provide these children with opportunities for play, as they often take on adult responsibilities at a young age. Stigmatization is also a common issue faced by these children. Children affected by HIV/AIDS often face challenges such as school attendance, concentration, and expenses. Teachers are being trained to identify grief-related behavior in these children. Programs are being developed to provide opportunities for play as they often take on adult responsibilities at a young age. Stigmatization is a common issue. Orphans and vulnerable children receive psychosocial support through peer groups, recreational activities, and counseling. However, caretakers, especially grandmothers, are often overlooked for support despite caring for multiple children with little income. This leads to exhaustion and overwork, impacting the education and nutrition of the children under their care. Support programs are being developed for caretakers, including forming groups to rotate supervision of children. Some caretakers of children affected by HIV/AIDS are forming support groups to discuss and find solutions to their problems. Non-governmental organizations offer stipends and training to caretakers to talk to children about their grief. Foreign aid programs are important but often overlook other issues impacting efforts to help children affected by HIV/AIDS, such as defining \"AIDS orphans\" and implementing aid programs. Stigma associated with HIV/AIDS still hinders efforts to support these children. Due to stigma, development community avoids term \"AIDS orphans.\" Early programs focused on children whose parents died of AIDS, missing other vulnerable children. Struggling health care infrastructures make it difficult to identify those affected by HIV/AIDS. Assistance networks like UNICEF, UNAIDS, and USAID develop programs to support communities affected by HIV/AIDS. USAID, UNICEF, and UNAIDS develop programs to assist vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, including orphans. USAID's approach of not exclusively serving HIV/AIDS orphans poses challenges for Congress. Instead, they provide various interventions like educational and psychosocial support. This complicates monitoring spending on programs. P.L. 108-25 mandated 10% of international HIV/AIDS funds for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. USAID struggles to track spending due to integrated program approach. Services not limited to children with HIV/AIDS-diagnosed parents to reach all vulnerable children. Combining funds from different accounts is common practice for USAID. USAID combines funds from various accounts to support orphans and vulnerable children, including HIV/AIDS, food assistance, and education programs. While HIV/AIDS funding has increased, other health, education, and poverty programs have either remained stagnant or decreased. Critics argue that this approach hinders the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS initiatives, as these issues are interconnected. USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios has expressed concerns about the reduction in vital programs like agriculture, which are essential in combating poverty and supporting health initiatives. Over the past decade, international education aid has decreased by 30%, leading to millions of children, especially in Africa, being unable to attend school. Lack of collaboration among aid organizations is hindering the effectiveness of programs for orphans and vulnerable children. USAID recognizes the complexity of the needs of orphans and vulnerable children and integrates various aspects of its development programs to meet those needs. There is increasing collaboration on the international level with organizations like UNICEF, UNAIDS, and WHO. The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS developed a Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, with a commitment to develop national policies by 2003 and implement them by 2005 to support children affected by HIV/AIDS. At the regional and global levels, meetings have been held to address the needs of children affected by HIV/AIDS. In October 2003, international organizations agreed on a strategic framework for the care of orphans and vulnerable children. However, critics note that collaboration efforts at the national and local levels are lacking. Non-governmental organizations operating locally require more support and involvement in planning. NGOs at the local level need more support and involvement in planning. Advocates for children affected by HIV/AIDS suggest increasing resources for their needs. Suggestions include appointing a Czar for orphans and vulnerable children, creating a senior position within the AIDS Coordinator Office, and strengthening and coordinating programs for children. Integration of care, support, and treatment of HIV-infected children into existing programs is emphasized. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria facilitates cooperation in addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis by involving representatives from public and private sectors at all levels. The Country Coordinating Mechanism develops project proposals at the national level. The Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM) includes representatives from various sectors to develop project proposals, increasing effectiveness and avoiding duplication. The Global Fund faced challenges in spending $87.8 million of the U.S. contribution in FY2004 due to insufficient matching funds. Legislation limited U.S. contributions to 33% of total funds for fiscal years 2004-2008. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations provided $437.8 million to the Global Fund, with the U.S. contribution exceeding $1.5 billion by the end of FY2005. The United States has contributed over $1.5 billion to the Global Fund by the end of FY2005, exceeding the Administration's request. The 33% limitation on U.S. contributions has sparked debates, with some arguing for more funding to the Fund while others believe it encourages other nations to contribute. Critics question the absorptive capacity of the Global Fund and whether the U.S. should be the primary contributor. The Global Fund's absorptive capacity has been questioned by U.S. contributions, as only $860 million of the $3.3 billion paid had been disbursed by December 2004. Advocates emphasize the need for greater access to anti-retroviral medication to reduce the number of new orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries. Only 12% of those immediately needing AIDS treatment have access, with a significant portion in sub-Saharan Africa. Preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission is crucial in reducing the number of orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries. Access to nevirapine, a drug that reduces HIV transmission from mother to child, is limited in developing countries. Only Botswana has widespread availability. In Africa, 5% of pregnant women had access to prevention drugs in 2003, leading to 1,900 children born with HIV daily in Africa alone. In Botswana, nevirapine and ARVs face barriers like stigma and capacity challenges. By the end of 2002, 34% of pregnant women had access to nevirapine and 10,000 people were using ARVs. Capacity challenges, including a shortage of healthcare workers, hinder widespread ARV distribution. Critics argue that high costs and resource constraints also impede distribution, suggesting the need to strengthen healthcare infrastructure before scaling up ARV distribution. South Africa faced criticism for not having an effective national ARV distribution plan, but announced in August 2003 the development of a program to establish service points in each district within a year. The country had previously offered nevirapine to pregnant women and emergency AIDS medication to rape survivors. The plan announced in South Africa aimed to establish service points in each district within a year and provide anti-retroviral medication to all residents at the municipal level within five years. Uganda also launched a program with USAID to distribute anti-retroviral medication nationwide. Despite Uganda's success in reducing its national seroprevalence rate, there are still over 500,000 people living with HIV/AIDS and nearly one million children orphaned due to the disease. The U.S. government expanded its HIV/AIDS programs with the \"U.S. Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act.\" The \"U.S. Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003\" authorized the U.S. government to offer ARV to 500,000 individuals by 2004 and up to 2,000,000 by 2006. Critics say the implementation is slow, with 155,000 people supported by September 2004. Congress is working to increase access to treatment with H.R. 155 in 2005, providing additional funding for MTCT-plus programs. The program implemented through the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health provides treatment to the entire family, with $75 million appropriated in FY2005. Child advocates are calling for more children to receive anti-retroviral therapy, as only a small percentage currently have access to treatment. Pediatric ARV drugs are limited and more expensive than adult versions. Pediatric ARV drug formulations cost 50-90% more than adult versions, posing challenges in treating infants and young children who require liquid forms due to swallowing difficulties. Dosing adjustments based on weight and formulation strength are needed, requiring additional resources and trained doctors. Liquid treatments may not be available for all ARVs, leading to difficulties in ensuring proper dosage. The shortage of health care practitioners in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, poses challenges in treating adults and children with HIV. Insufficient HIV testing kits and expensive pediatric diagnostic equipment contribute to high infant mortality rates. UNAIDS reported that 90,000 infants are exposed to HIV annually, with 46,000 infected and 60% dying before age two. Debt relief is crucial for developing countries affected by HIV/AIDS, as it hinders their ability to combat the virus effectively. Many countries spend more on debt payments than on social services, which could be used for programs like education and healthcare. Oxfam estimates that half of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries are still spending a significant portion of government revenues on debt repayments, making it harder to address the HIV/AIDS crisis. Congressional action is needed to address this issue. In the 107th and 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to expand debt relief efforts for countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS. Concerns exist about potential abuse and corruption undermining debt reduction strategies. Critics argue that the lack of strong revenue sources, not debt repayments, is sinking these countries deeper into poverty. In an effort to limit corruption and improve debt relief effectiveness, international institutions like the World Bank and UNAIDS are collaborating with countries to integrate HIV/AIDS efforts into debt reduction strategies. Countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS require increased revenue to support health and education infrastructures, provide treatment, and implement comprehensive programs. Some argue that agricultural subsidies hinder economic growth in these countries, impacting their ability to combat the epidemic. Agricultural subsidies in developing countries hinder farmers from exporting products globally due to below-market prices. The World Bank reported that industrialized countries spend $311 billion annually on subsidies, with sugar subsidies alone nearly equaling all exports from developing nations. Eliminating these subsidies could increase rural income by $60 billion and boost agricultural exports by 24%. Critics argue that these subsidies also undermine foreign aid efforts. The report highlights that agricultural subsidies in industrialized countries hinder global exports by keeping prices below market value. Critics argue that these subsidies, totaling $311 billion annually, undermine foreign aid efforts. Additionally, U.S. subsidies to cotton growers in 2003 were three times higher than foreign aid to Africa, leading to increased reliance on aid in agriculture-based economies. In response, the World Trade Organization agreed to lower trade barriers in an effort to promote fair agricultural trade. The WTO Ministerial Conference in Canc\u00fan, Mexico aimed to revise trade laws but talks collapsed due to disagreements between developing and industrialized nations. Agricultural tariffs and subsidies remain, with the United States committed to gradually eliminating them."
