    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Red Cliffs Desert Reserve Completion Act\". In the early 1980s, James Doyle began assembling land for a real estate development in St. George, Utah, including 9 golf courses and luxury homes. He acquired 2,440 acres and had rights to an additional 11,000 acres. Doyle invested in water rights, engineering studies, and transportation corridor designs for the development. In the early 1980s, James Doyle acquired land for a real estate development in St. George, Utah, including 9 golf courses and luxury homes. He invested in water rights, engineering studies, and transportation corridors. By 1989, planning was complete, and ground was ready to be broken. In 1990, the Mojave population of the desert tortoise was listed as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act. On February 8, 1994, James Doyle's land was designated as critical habitat for the Mojave population of the desert tortoise, making land development unlawful without a permit. James Doyle worked with others to create a Habitat Conservation Plan allowing development of a portion of his land. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service rejected the initial land development plan due to insufficient land set aside to protect the tortoise. James Doyle and the Steering Committee then prepared a revised Habitat Conservation Plan, approved on February 23, 1996, allowing development of 350,000 acres while setting aside 61,022 acres, including all of Doyle's land, as protected tortoise habitat reserve. The plan prohibited incidental take permits for desert tortoises on reserve lands. The United States promised to acquire private land for a tortoise reserve, but only obtained 400 acres from James Doyle, leaving the rest unused. This led to financial difficulties for Doyle, who couldn't develop or sell the remaining land. James Doyle, who invested millions in land, sought bankruptcy protection in 2010. He had to transfer most of his land to creditors, keeping only 274 acres undeveloped. In 2015, he sued for compensation for land used as a tortoise reserve since 1996, but his claim was dismissed by the court. He was told to seek a permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service, even though development is prohibited in the area. The Red Cliffs Desert Reserve prohibits development, and obtaining a permit would be a lengthy and futile process. The Secretary of the Treasury will pay James Doyle a sum of money determined by the court for the government's taking of his land in Utah for the Red Cliffs Desert Reserve. This payment will settle all of Doyle's claims against the United States."
