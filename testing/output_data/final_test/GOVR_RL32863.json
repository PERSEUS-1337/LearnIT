    "content": "The FY2006 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-90) was signed into law on October 18, 2005, with a net appropriation of $31.9 billion for DHS, representing a 4% increase from the previous year. The House and Senate approved the conference report without amendments, and the total amount allocated was $1.3 billion higher than the FY2005 enacted level. The Senate passed H.R. 2360 with a net appropriation of $31.9 billion for DHS in FY2006, representing a 4% increase from the previous year. This amount includes $30.8 billion in discretionary budget authority, an increase of $1.3 billion compared to FY2005 enacted level. The President's budget request for FY2006 included a $1.2 billion increase compared to FY2005, with $30.6 billion in net budget authority requested. This represents no increase over the FY2005 enacted amount. The FY2006 budget request of $30.6 billion in net budget authority shows no increase over the FY2005 enacted amount. Data sources for DHS appropriations include the President's Budget Documents, Congressional Budget Justifications, Budget in Brief, and House Appropriations Committee Homeland Security tables. The report uses amounts from the House-passed version of H.R. 2360 and the Senate-passed legislation. The report describes the President's FY2006 request for funding for DHS programs and activities, including changes enacted by P.L. 109-148. The tables in the report may not match amounts listed in P.L. 109-90, and do not reflect the 1% across-the-board rescission enacted by P.L. 109-148. The report compares enacted FY2005 funding to the FY2006 request for DHS programs. It tracks legislative action on the DHS appropriations bill, focusing on discretionary funding. The report does not cover mandatory funding issues or legislation related to DHS program authorization. Congressional budget process determines maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, with Congress setting spending totals in the annual budget resolution. The 302(a) allocations are discretionary funds available to House and Senate Appropriations Committees for annual appropriations bills. These funds are then allocated to subcommittees through 302(b) allocations, which must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made as appropriations bills progress. The Senate and House passed budget resolutions in 2005, with $848.8 billion and $843 billion in discretionary spending respectively. The final budget authority for FY2006 was set at $843 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees allocated $30.8 billion each for homeland security. The discretionary budget authority for DHS is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite when Congress provides \"such sums as may be necessary.\" It can be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations for personnel, contracts, services, and transactions in a fiscal year. Outlays represent actual spending during the year, which may not always align with the budget authority enacted. Multi-year and no-year budget authority can be obligated over several years, leading to spending in future fiscal years. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary agencies and programs are funded each year in appropriations acts, with gross budget authority consisting of discretionary and mandatory spending. In FY2006, 83% of the $41 billion gross budget authority for DHS is discretionary spending, while 17% is mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated yearly by Congress, while mandatory spending is direct and not subject to annual appropriations. The curr_chunk discusses mandatory spending within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including examples like Coast Guard retirement pay. It also mentions offsetting funds collected by the government, which are not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS's net discretionary budget authority is calculated by subtracting fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset discretionary spending at the agency level, subtracting from the agency's budget authority. Other collections offset mandatory spending and are typically entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes entitlement programs for individuals, businesses, or government units that meet qualifications for certain payments. The Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay accounts are mandatory entitlement programs. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while the Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the DHS budget contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the President's budget for calculating gross budget authority. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS is organized into four directorates: Border and Transportation Security (BTS), Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR), Science and Technology (S&T), and Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP). BTS includes Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Transportation Security Administration (TSA). EPR consists of the former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), while IAIP houses the Homeland Security Operations Center (HSOC), Information Analysis (IA), and Infrastructure Protection (IP) offices. S&T includes the Office of National Laboratories. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is organized into four directorates: Border and Transportation Security (BTS), Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR), Science and Technology (S&T), and Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP). DHS also includes stand-alone agencies like U.S. Citizenship and Immigration (USCIS), the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Secret Service. Appropriations for DHS are divided into four titles: Departmental Management and Operations, Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, Preparedness and Recovery, and Research and Development, Training, Assessments, and Services. Title II of the Department of Homeland Security appropriations includes funding for various agencies such as CBP, ICE, TSA, Coast Guard, Secret Service, and the proposed Office of Screening Operations. Title III covers EPR and the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. Title IV includes appropriations for USCIS, IAIP, S&T, and FLETC. Secretary Michael Chertoff announced proposed changes based on the Second Stage Review to enhance overall preparedness, transportation security, and border security. The Administration proposed changes to enhance DHS operations, including improving border security, immigration processes, information sharing, financial management, and organizational realignment. These changes were reflected in the revised budget request for DHS in 2005. The amendments to the FY2006 budget request for DHS were addressed during the conference on H.R. 2360, with most changes complying with the Administration's restructuring request. P.L. 109-90 adopted the recommended changes, including abolishing the Office of the Undersecretary for Border. P.L. 109-90 adopts changes in DHS operations, including abolishing the Office of the Undersecretary for Border and redistributing functions, splitting the Directorate of Information Analysis, transferring the Federal Air Marshals program, and expanding the role of the Office of Policy. The Administration requested $30.6 billion for FY2006, compared to $40.2 billion in FY2005. The FY2006 budget for DHS was $31.9 billion, with no increase from FY2005 excluding Bioshield. The budget included general administrative expenses and various entities under the Office of the Secretary. The FY2006 budget for DHS was $31.9 billion, with no increase from FY2005 excluding Bioshield. The budget included general administrative expenses and various entities under the Office of the Secretary, such as OS&EM, USM, OCIO, OCFO, and OIG. The FY2006 requests for these entities showed varying changes in appropriations compared to FY2005 enacted levels. Title I is $748 million, a 28% increase over FY2005. House appropriators cut $62.6 million from the OS&EM request due to concerns about the Department's slow response to Congressional direction and financial audit results. The Office of Security and Operation Integration Staff were among the entities affected by the budget cut. The Senate approved $124.6 million for the Office of Security and Emergency Management (OS&EM), reducing the amount by $71.2 million from the original request. Significant cuts were made to various entities within OS&EM, including the Office of Security, Executive Secretary, Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs, Office of Public Affairs, and Operation Integration Staff. The Regions Initiative also saw a reduction of $49.8 million due to a lack of required consolidation and collocation plan. The Senate approved $124.6 million for the Office of Security and Emergency Management (OS&EM), reducing the amount by $71.2 million from the original request. Significant cuts were made to various entities within OS&EM, including the Office of Security, Executive Secretary, Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs, Office of Public Affairs, and Operation Integration Staff. The Regions Initiative also saw a reduction of $49.8 million due to a lack of required consolidation and collocation plan. P.L. 109-90 provides $79 million for OS&EM instead of the $113 million approved by the House and the $125 million approved by the Senate. Compared with the President's budget request, the OS&EM account receiving major reduction was the unfunded Regions area (-$50 million), followed by the Office of Policy (-$4 million), the Executive Secretary (-$1 million), Office of Public Affairs (-$1 million), and Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (-$1 million). The Office of Policy is a modified version of OPPIA. It is one of several new or modified entities resulting from the Secretary's 2SR reorganization of DHS. Acting on a July 21, 2005, DHS budget amendment requesting the department's appropriations structure be modified for FY2006, appropriations conferees endorsed much of the 2SR reorganization plan. The House approved $8.7 million for the new Office of Policy and Planning in the OS&EM account, part of the DHS reorganization plan. The OPPIA was to be headed by an Assistant Secretary and include staff from various existing entities. Senate appropriators reduced the OPPIA allotment and expected it to take on the role of the Operation Integration Staff. This restructuring was discussed in a Senate oversight hearing in January 2005. The Heritage Foundation report recommended eliminating the DHS management directorate and USM, relocating chief management officers, and establishing an Under Secretary for Policy with a unified policy planning staff. These reforms were expected to be considered for inclusion in legislation reauthorizing DHS programs. The House Committee on Homeland Security reported bill H.R. 1817 without mentioning suggested reforms. A new provision was added to ensure the DHS Privacy Officer reports privacy abuses to Congress and has access to necessary information. Additionally, personnel issues related to human resources management are of interest to Congress during the current appropriations cycle. The DHS oversees human resources management functions through three components: Human Capital Innovation, responsible for implementing the Max-HR system; Human Capital Policy and Programs, in charge of establishing HR policies and programs; and Human Capital Operations, which manages HR operations and services. The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) oversees human resources services for all headquarters organizations within DHS, managing shared human capital services. The CHCO received an appropriation of $43.2 million in FY2005, with $7.2 million funding HR operations and $36 million for the development of Max-HR. The President's FY2006 budget proposed a similar appropriation. The President's FY2006 budget proposed an appropriation of $61.996 million and 50 FTEs for the Office of the CHCO, with a notable increase of $18.796 million and one FTE from FY2005. Funding requests included $593,000 for the CHCO office and $53 million for Max-HR. The $593,000 increase was allocated for workforce strategies, including one new FTE for analyzing occupational gaps and developing human capital plans. Additionally, $413,000 was requested for employee survey and analysis as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004. An appropriation of $53 million is requested for the department's new HRM system, an increase of $17 million over the FY2005 funding. The Office of the CHCO serves as the \"command center\" for Max-HR with 12 FTEs staffing it. The Appropriations Committee tables show an appropriation of $61.951 million for the Office of the CHCO, with $8.951 million for salaries and expenses and $53 million for Max-HR. Amendments agreed to by the House would have reduced funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $96.1 million. The committee opposed full year funding for a new FTE in the Office of the CHCO requested by the President, assuming the new staff would start in the second quarter of FY2006. Opposition to changes in funding for Max-HR came from the Office of Management and Budget, DHS, and Senator George Voinovich, citing concerns about managerial and supervisory training. The National Treasury Employees Union supported a reduction in funding, suggesting that $18 million could go towards contractors for performance management design and $6 million for internal labor relations boards at DHS. The Senate-passed bill provided funding for personnel security investigations and the Office of the CHCO, with $53 million allocated for Max-HR. DHS is required to report on implementation progress and projected costs. P.L. 109-90 allocated $38.9 million for the Office of the CHCO, $23 million less than the President's budget proposal. The conference agreement includes funding for background investigations for DHS employees, with a provision to disband the IAIP Directorate and transfer its functions to other entities as part of Secretary Chertoff's restructuring program. The IAIP Directorate is being disbanded and its functions transferred to new entities within the DHS, including the Preparedness Directorate, Office of Intelligence and Analysis, and Office of Operations Coordination. Information analysis and operations coordination activities will be funded through a new Analysis and Operations bureau. Under Secretary Chertoff's restructuring plan, the former Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Analysis position will be reorganized. The DHS proposed replacing the former Assistant Secretary for Intelligence Analysis position with a Chief Intelligence Officer reporting directly to the Secretary. The Office of Intelligence and Analysis will consist of analysts from the Information Analysis Directorate and other DHS components. The IAIP Directorate had two accounts - Management and Administration (M&A) and Assessments and Evaluations (A&E) before the restructuring. The President's FY2006 budget request was $204 million for M&A and A&E. The President's FY2006 budget request for M&A was $204 million and for A&E it was $669.2 million, totaling $872.2 million for IAIP. Budget amendments were proposed for the Department of Homeland Security in July 2005, with $311.2 million requested for the new Analysis and Operations bureau. $255.5 million would remain available until September 30, 2007 for information analysis and operations coordination activities. The budget for the Analysis and Operations bureau under Title I of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was reduced by $55.7 million or 17.9% from the requested amount. The Secretary is required to submit a report on staffing and resource requirements for the Department's intelligence mission responsibilities. Title II funds Security, Enforcement, and Investigations, with a focus on the Directorate of Border. The largest component of Title II was the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security (BTS), which included CBP, ICE, and TSA. The Administration proposed the creation of SCO within BTS to coordinate passenger and cargo screening operations. The U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Secret Service were also included in Title II. With the passage of P.L. 109-90, the Office of the Undersecretary for BTS was eliminated, and agencies report directly to the Office of the Secretary. The Administration requested $20.6 billion for Title II in FY2006. The FY2006 budget for Title II was $20.6 billion, a slight decrease from the previous year. The requested increase in funding was offset by an increase in offsetting collections, particularly from TSA fees. The House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended a higher appropriation of nearly $22 billion, representing a 7% increase over the President's request. The House-passed H.R. 2360 provided $22 billion for Title II, a 7% increase over the President's request. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 allocated $22.2 billion for Title II, a 4% increase over the FY2005 enacted amount. P.L. 109-90 ultimately provided $22.4 billion for Title II activities in FY2006. In FY2006, the DHS budget authority was $22.4 billion, with slight increases compared to FY2005, the FY2006 request, House-passed version of H.R. 2360, and Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360. A new SCO was proposed to coordinate screening efforts for people entering the country, including programs like US-VISIT, FAST, NEXUS/SENTRI, Secure Flight, TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT background checks, and Alien Flight School background checks. The Administration requested $846 million in gross budget authority for the Screening Coordination Office (SCO) for FY2006, including funding for programs like US-VISIT, Secure Flight, FAST, NEXUS/SENTRI, and Credentialing Coordination Office. SCO would oversee fee-funded activities such as TWIC, Registered Traveler, HAZMAT checks, and Alien Flight School background checks, with a net requested appropriation of $525 million. The Committee denied the requested appropriation of $525 million for the Screening Coordination Office (SCO) and recommended establishing a new Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing within TSA instead. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 also denied the creation of SCO and left funding for certain programs within CBP. Both the House and Senate-passed versions of the bill maintained funding for TSA programs. The P.L. 109-90 provides $4 million for an Office of Screening Coordination and Management under Departmental Operations and Management. However, it does not transfer the requested programs to this office. CBP's main mission since 9/11 is to prevent terrorists and contraband from entering the United States at ports-of-entry. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency enforces over 400 laws and regulations at the border for various government agencies. The Administration requested a budget increase of 4% for CBP in FY2006, totaling $6,717 million in gross budget authority. This includes funding for weapons of mass destruction detection technology, Border Patrol staff, and long-range radar. The House Appropriators added $210 million to both the gross and net budget authorities for CBP to cover various programs, including WMD detection technology, Border Patrol staff, long-range radar, aircraft replacement, and other initiatives. The House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended a net appropriation of $5.785 billion for CBP, an 8% increase over FY2005 and a 4% increase over the President's FY2006 request. The House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended fully funding requested increases for CBP, with an additional $150 million for Border Patrol staffing. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 proposed a net appropriation of $5,998 million for CBP, an increase of $213 million compared to the House's amount, $423 million over the FY2006 request, and $627 million over the FY2005 enacted level. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 proposed a net appropriation of $5,998 million for CBP, an increase of $213 million compared to the House's amount, $423 million over the FY2006 request, and $627 million over the FY2005 enacted level. P.L. 109-90 provides a net appropriation of $5,952 million for CBP, which is $46 million or approximately 1% less than provided in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360, $167 or nearly 3% more than provided by the House-passed version of H.R. 2360, $377 million or nearly 7% more than requested for CBP in FY2006, and $581 million or nearly 11% more than enacted in FY2005. P.L. 109-90 provides no funding for radiation portal monitors under this account, and adopts the House recommendation that these be funded under S&T. P.L. 109-90 does not transfer the FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI programs to the proposed SCO, instead fully funding FAST at $7 million and NEXUS/SENTRI at $14 million for FY2006. Additionally, an extra $241 million is provided for 1,500 Border Patrol agents. $10 million is withheld until CBP submits a detailed five-year plan on air and marine operations. CBP issues for Congress include cargo security, border patrol agents, and various programs like CSI and C-TPAT. The CSI and C-TPAT programs are significant initiatives for cargo security. The FY2006 budget includes additional funding for CSI to expand activities in new ports. The House recommended fully funding the increase, but requested a report on spending projections. The Senate also recommended full funding for CSI, emphasizing the need for host-country cooperation. The FY2006 budget fully funds the requested $139 million for CSI and directs CBP to submit reports on CSI and radiation technology efforts by February 10, 2006. C-TPAT is a public-private partnership for securing the supply chain into the United States. The FY2006 budget fully funds the requested $139 million for CSI and C-TPAT, a public-private partnership for securing the supply chain into the United States. The budget includes an increase of $8.2 million for C-TPAT for travel, equipment, and supplies for Supply Chain Specialists. Both the House and Senate recommended fully funding C-TPAT. P.L. 109-90 fully funds the $54 million request for C-TPAT for FY2006. Additionally, the FY2006 Administration request for CBP includes an increase of $125 million for technology to detect WMD, including $77 million for radiation portal monitors. The House and Senate recommended fully funding C-TPAT in the FY2006 budget. P.L. 109-90 fully funds the $54 million request for C-TPAT for FY2006. The budget also includes an increase of $125 million for technology to detect WMD, including $77 million for radiation portal monitors. House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended fully funding the $188 million request for cargo inspection technology. Senate-passed H.R. 2360 recommended fully funding the requested increase of $125 million for RPMs. P.L. 109-90 fully funds the $125 million request for RPMs. The House and Senate recommended fully funding C-TPAT in the FY2006 budget, including an increase of $125 million for technology to detect WMD. House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended fully funding the request for AMO and providing an additional $60 million above the request for various purposes. The Senate concurs with placing the funding for RPMs within the S&T Directorate. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 would have fully funded the requested increase for AMO, providing an additional $33 million in total for AMO. The conferees agreed to provide $400 million for AMO operations, maintenance, and procurement for FY2006, including funding for various purposes such as staff, equipment, airwing bases, sensor packages, surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The conferees agreed to provide $19 million for the operation and maintenance of legacy BP aircraft and vessels, $2 million for an airwing in North Dakota, and withheld $10 million from CBP's salaries and expenses account until a five-year strategic plan is submitted. The FY2006 request for CBP proposed adding 210 agents to the USBP workforce to backfill positions vacated along the Southwest border due to transfers to the Northern border. The House Appropriators added $150 million to address the shortfall in agent numbers authorized by previous acts. The House and Senate added $150 million to the President's request to increase Border Patrol agents by 1,500 by FY2006. Integration of IDENT and IAFIS systems is progressing, addressing concerns raised in FY2005. The president's FY2005 request included a $3 million increase for the biometric system, with BTS taking over the integration project. Integration of biometric databases has improved identification of criminal aliens by 8.5%, but USBP lacks access to the Terrorist Watchlist. Congress is concerned about potential infiltration by Al-Qaeda through the Southwest border. House Appropriators are frustrated with CBP for not delivering a requested report on the integration project and directed DHS to submit it by July 1, 2005. The Senate Appropriation Committee funded the President's request for the integration project in FY2005. In response to high apprehension levels in the Tucson sector, the Arizona Border Control (ABC) initiative was launched to coordinate federal, state, and local authorities to control the Arizona border and stop smuggling operations. Additional border patrol agents were assigned to the Tucson sector in 2004. In 2004, additional border patrol agents were assigned to the Tucson sector as part of the Arizona Border Control (ABC) initiative. Apprehension of unauthorized aliens increased by 56% compared to the previous year. CBP proposed a $1 million increase for the program in FY2006, with most funding coming from ICE. House Appropriators supported the multi-agency approach to border protection and directed CBP to collaborate with the Tohono O'odham Nation. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded the President's request. CBP also proposed a $19.8 million increase for the program. The Committee fully funded the President's request for the America Shield Initiative (ASI), allocating $19.8 million for surveillance assets deployment in high-priority areas on the southwest and northern borders. House Appropriators supported the funding but requested a report on contracting problems identified in the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee fully funded the President's request for the America Shield Initiative (ASI) and encouraged program managers to explore off-the-shelf solutions. The President requested $93 million for the construction of tactical infrastructure to impede illegal entry, including lights, fences, and vehicle barriers. The House Appropriations Committee also fully funded the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee increased the President's request by $218 million for border security, including funds for additional USBP agents, fence construction in San Diego, and tactical infrastructure expansion in Tucson. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws in the US, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations such as alien smuggling. ICE is responsible for enforcing immigration and customs laws, locating and removing aliens who have overstayed their visas or entered illegally, combating terrorist financing and money laundering, and enforcing export laws. They also oversee building security activities and requested a budget of $4,364 million in FY2006. ICE requested a $4,364 million appropriation in FY2006, a 4% increase from FY2005. The request included program increases for various activities such as investigations, custody management, and detention bedspace. ICE requested a $4,364 million appropriation in FY2006, a 4% increase from FY2005, including funding for Fugitive Operations, Institutional Removal Program, Alternatives to Detention, Visa Security, and legal resources. House-passed H.R. 2360 provided $3,830 million for ICE, with allocations for various programs and a requirement for an immigration enforcement strategy to reduce unauthorized aliens in the US. The House-passed H.R. 2360 provided $3,830 million for ICE in FY2006, with allocations for various programs including Fugitive Operations, Institutional Removal Program, Alternatives to Detention, and Visa Security. Additionally, H.Rept. 109-79 recommended fully funding the President's requests and additional funding for various positions and programs within ICE. The funding for ICE in P.L. 109-90 includes $3,175 million, with allocations for various programs such as Fugitive Operations, Institutional Removal Program, Alternatives to Detention, and immigration investigations. Additionally, there is an increase of $213 million compared to the President's FY2006 request and $324 million above FY2005 enacted. The FY2006 request in P.L. 109-90 includes $324 million, with allocations for various programs such as Fugitive Operations, Institutional Removal Program, and immigration investigations. Not less than $5 million is designated for implementing \u00a7287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and $11.2 million is for funding or reimbursing federal agencies for the care and repatriation of smuggled aliens. Additionally, there are recommendations for increased funding for bed space capacity, criminal investigator positions, and annualizing new positions and programs funded in P.L. 109-13. The FY2006 request in P.L. 109-90 includes funding for various programs such as Fugitive Operations, Institutional Removal Program, and immigration investigations. Recommendations include increased funding for bed space capacity, criminal investigator positions, and annualizing new positions and programs funded in P.L. 109-13. Additionally, there are allocations for new Immigration Enforcement Agents, fugitive operations team positions, expanding the Institutional Removal Program, broadening the Alternatives to Detention program, improving immigration enforcement information in the NCIC database, and funding for the Cyber Crimes Center. ICE's financial management problems include inadequate accounting records and turnover among staff, leading to delays in basic accounting functions. The agency also provided accounting services for other DHS agencies, causing further challenges. ICE experienced budget shortfalls due to tardy reimbursements from other agencies, leading to a freeze on hiring and non-essential expenditures. Auditors recommended addressing financial management issues, with ICE requesting a $500 million reprogramming for funding shortfalls. House Appropriators expressed concern over the agency's financial troubles and directed DHS to provide monthly reports on ICE's financial condition. The Office of Investigations (OI) in ICE focuses on criminal and civil violations affecting national security, including illegal arms exports, financial crimes, human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, and immigration fraud. ICE special agents also protect critical infrastructure industries vulnerable to sabotage. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred investigative functions to ICE from the INS and Customs Service. Combining these agencies allows for more efficient investigations, but concerns have been raised about insufficient focus on civil violations of immigration laws. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 authorized the addition of 800 new investigators to focus on civil violations of immigration law. The President's budget requested $1,496 million for the Office of Investigations, including funding for the Visa Security Unit and Temporary Worker Worksite Enforcement. An additional $18 million was requested for temporary worker worksite enforcement to investigate and prosecute violations under existing immigration law. The President's budget requested an increase of $5 million for the Visa Security Unit (VSU), adding five new officers, opening a new overseas location, and expanding training programs. H.Rept. 109-79 recommended $19 million to expand the VSU, while S. Rept.109-83 recommended an additional $4.8 million for nine positions. H.Rept. 109-241 did not include an increase for the VSU. Additionally, H.Rept. 109-79 recommended $18 million for 200 new Immigration Enforcement Agents (IEAs) and $19 million for 150 criminal investigators, while S.Rept. 109-83 recommended $37 million for 300 new immigration investigations positions and $18 million for 200 IEAs. The conference report, H.Rept. 109-241, recommended an additional $42 million. The conference report, H.Rept. 109-241, recommends an additional $42 million for criminal investigator positions and $9 million for 100 new Immigration Enforcement Agents (IEAs). Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) in ICE manage aliens in removal proceedings and ensure their departure from the United States. Many believe DRO lacks enough detention space. A study by DOJ's Inspector General found that almost 94% of those detained with final removal orders were deported. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 authorized an increase in DRO bed space. Concerns have been raised about the decision-making process for releasing detained aliens. H.Rept. 109-241 proposes an increase in funding for new beds and positions for Custody Management. The House proposes an increase in funding for new bedspace and support positions for Custody Management. A provision in H.Rept. 109-241 withholds $5 million until a report is submitted by the Secretary of DHS. ICE started the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program in 2004 for low-risk offenders. The White House announced an agreement with Mexico to pilot the Interior Repatriation Program, aiming to reduce the number of aliens crossing back into the US. The program requires voluntary return to Mexico certified by Mexican consular officers. The Administration requested $39.3 million to continue the program in FY2006. The Administration requested $39.3 million in FY2006 for the Interior Repatriation Program, with $25 million for Custody Management and $14.3 million for Transportation and Removal. This marked a $25 million increase from the previous year. The program aims to reduce the number of aliens crossing back into the US through voluntary return to Mexico certified by Mexican consular officers. The INA provides limited avenues for state enforcement of its provisions, with INA \u00a7287(g) granting authority for state and local immigration enforcement activities. The debate over the role of state and local law enforcement officials in enforcing federal immigration laws has raised concerns about training, resources, civil rights violations, and community impact. Some localities provide sanctuary for illegal aliens, while others argue that state and local entities should assist due to limited federal resources. H.Rept. 109-241 would appropriate $5 million for immigration enforcement. The TSA, created by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, is responsible for protecting U.S. transportation systems. It was transferred to DHS in 2002 and is tasked with aviation security against terrorist threats. TSA also has responsibilities for marine and land transportation, serving as a liaison for transportation security to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA is responsible for protecting U.S. transportation systems and improving security technologies. The President requested a budget increase for TSA in FY2006, including transfers of research and development functions to other departments. The TSA requested a budget increase of $415 million in FY2006, with key initiatives focused on aviation security. This included funding for developing checkpoint explosives technologies, maintaining a workforce of 45,000 full-time equivalents, deploying high-speed Internet connections at screening checkpoints, and providing training for flight and cabin crews. The TSA proposed an increase in passenger security fees to improve aviation security funding, aiming for full cost recovery. The fee would have been raised to $5.50 per flight segment, with a maximum of $8.00 per one-way trip, to increase fee collections from $2.652 billion in FY2005 to $4.1 billion in FY2006, offsetting 82% of the proposed $4.985 billion budget for aviation security. The President requested $32 million for surface transportation security, including $8 million for hiring 100 rail and transit inspectors. House-passed H.R. 2360 would have provided $5,683 million for the TSA, including $264.3 million for Transportation Vetting and Credentialing. Initial House-passed version of H.R. 2360 would have provided $143.2 million less than the President's request for aviation security activities. The House Committee on Appropriations found that the full request for aviation security funding was not justified, citing concerns over private screening contracts, aviation regulation, law enforcement, and staffing levels in airport management and support. They recommended trimming TSA staffing levels and initially agreed to a funding level $9.8 million below the President's request. The House initially agreed to fund technology and support for TSA at $108.2 million below the President's request. They did not agree with increased funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, allocating $25 million instead. The House provided $60 million for air cargo security, including funds for hiring new inspectors and enhancing security measures. The House passed provisions for enhanced screening of cargo on aircraft by March 1, 2006, and allocated additional funding for in-line explosives detection systems. They also agreed to keep screener staffing at or below the 45,000 full-time-equivalent cap. The House agreed to allocate additional funding for EDS and ETD equipment, directing TSA to use recovered funds exclusively for EDS procurement. They also approved $36 million for surface transportation security, $4 million more than the President's request. The House approved additional funding for federal rail security inspectors and a hazardous materials truck tracking program, exceeding the President's request. The Senate initially agreed to a total of $5,055 million for the TSA, including $255 million for Transportation Vetting and Credentialing. They also allocated $4,452 million for aviation security, $129 million more than the FY2005 appropriation. Unlike the House bill, the Senate did not include a specific cap on the number of screeners. The Senate bill aimed to increase funding for screening technologies and shift away from a workforce-intensive approach. It allowed flexibility for TSA to transfer funds for equipment procurement, providing $180 million for EDS and ETD procurement, with $50 million designated for next-generation EDS equipment. The bill made modest reductions in airport management, staff, and IT budget, recommending $748 million for these functions. Increased funding for information technology is crucial for real-time intelligence and operational efficiency. The Senate allocated $50 million for air cargo security, $10 million more than the budget request, with $7 million for hiring inspectors and $3 million for increased inspections. The bill also emphasized coordination of security programs and screening 100% of cargo on passenger planes. In terms of surface transportation security, the Senate bill aligned with the House-passed amount and fund usage. The Senate bill aligned with the House-passed plan for transportation vetting and funding but allocated $9 million less for credentialing activities. Three amendments to increase security funding for U.S. transit systems were defeated. P.L. 109-90 provided $6,094 million for TSA operations and $686 million for Federal Air Marshals. The Aviation Security Capital Fund receives $15 million above the House-passed amount and $155 above the Senate-passed amount, totaling $6,344 million for TSA appropriation. The funding for aviation security is $128 million below the President's request, with $283 million more than the FY2005 enacted level. The cap on full-time equivalent screeners remains at 45,000. Privatized screening funding is set at $139 million, with the option for TSA to adjust funding between TSA screening operations and private screening. A provision in the Act provides liability protections for airports opting out of TSA federal oversight. The Aviation Security Capital Fund receives increased funding for TSA appropriation, with a provision offering liability protections for airports choosing private screening contracts managed by the TSA. San Francisco International Airport reversed its decision to end its private screener pilot program due to the inclusion of these protections. Lawmakers hope this will encourage more airports to opt for private screening. Additionally, $55 million is allocated for air cargo security measures in P.L. 109-90, exceeding the FY2005 enacted levels and the President's FY2006 request. The funding level for TSA appropriation is $15 million above FY2005 enacted levels and the President's FY2006 request. It includes $10 million for hiring 100 regulatory inspectors and $5 million for improving databases of freight forwarders and known shippers. $57 million is allocated for Secure Flight, with concerns raised about the TSA's failure to justify cost estimates and delays in system deployment. A provision prohibits deployment of the system on other than a test basis until further evaluation. The FY2006 Act includes a provision prohibiting the deployment of the system on other than a test basis until GAO certifies privacy protections, data security, and redress elements. It also prevents TSA from using commercial data in the system. P.L. 109-90 provides $36 million for surface transportation security, $12 million less than FY2005 levels but $4 million above the President's request. The President's proposal to increase airline passenger security fees faced criticism during the appropriations debate. Financially strapped airlines argued against the fee increases, stating they may have to reduce ticket prices. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns that the fee hike could impact rural airline customers more. The Administration argued that the increased fees could help offset expenditures for aviation security. The Administration proposed increasing airline passenger security fees to offset aviation security costs, aligning with transportation infrastructure policy. Opponents argue that aviation security is a national security responsibility and should be funded by all taxpayers. The House Committee on Appropriations did not include the proposed fee increases in its bill. The House Committee on Appropriations did not include proposed fee increases in its bill for aviation security. The TSA has been collecting less than the recommended amount of $448 million annually from aviation security infrastructure fees, leading to a projected shortfall of over $400 million. Another key issue was the proposed creation of SCO during the FY2006 appropriations process. The proposed creation of the SCO raised coordination issues with the TSA on passenger and worker vetting programs. P.L. 109-90 integrates these programs under a new Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing within the TSA, with a funding level of $75 million for FY2006. Additional funding of $180 million is expected for credentialing. The office is expected to handle an additional $180 million in credentialing accounts offset by user fees. Coordination issues between TSA and S&T arise from the transfer of TSA's research to S&T. Concerns exist about prioritizing aviation security research over other homeland security initiatives. The TSA's transfer of research to the S&T Directorate raises concerns about maintaining a focus on aviation security. Congress is interested in how coordination between TSA and S&T will ensure aviation security research needs are met. The House report highlights frustration over slow progress in air cargo security research and calls for the TSA to develop protocols for new screening technologies. The TSA is required to develop protocols and standards for new technologies to screen cargo, addressing past deployment delays due to coordination issues. There is a debate about the federal government's role, particularly the TSA's role, in securing non-aviation modes of transportation. Some argue for a more prominent federal role and increased funding for surface transportation security, while others believe the federal role should align with its current financing role. The federal government's role in securing surface modes should align with its current financing role, with funding in partnership with state and local governments or the private sector. Freight railways and mass transit should pay for their security needs, with the Coast Guard leading maritime homeland security efforts. The Coast Guard is the lead agency responsible for maritime security in U.S. ports and waterways. It performs missions like search and rescue, environmental protection, and aids to navigation. Transferred to DHS in 2003, it operates independently within the department and works closely with the BTS directorate. The President requested $7,961 million for the Coast Guard in FY2006, a 5.21% increase from FY2005. The President requested a 5.21% increase in the Coast Guard's budget for FY2006, totaling $7,961 million. The budget is divided into seven categories, with increases in three categories and decreases in four. The largest increase is in acquisition, construction, and improvements at 23.08%. Zero funds were requested for the bridge alteration program and Coast Guard research and development. The President's FY2006 budget for the Coast Guard includes reductions in funding for environmental compliance, restoration, and retired pay. The House-passed H.R. 2360 provides less funding than the President's request, particularly for acquisitions, construction, and improvements. The Deepwater program is a major factor in the funding differences. The House bill provided $47 million less than the President's request for various purposes, including bridges and environmental compliance. The House also agreed to transfer Coast Guard research funds to DHS S&T Directorate. The Senate's H.R. 2360 provided $7,780 million, $322 million more than the House, with a significant difference in funding for acquisitions and construction. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed frustration with the Coast Guard's handling of Congressional direction. The Senate's H.R. 2360 provides $5,459 million for operating expenses, $41 million less than the House. It does not agree with transferring Coast Guard's R&D funds to DHS S&T Directorate, allocating $19 million for R&D. P.L. 109-90 allocates $7,797 million for the Coast Guard for FY2006, a decrease of $165 million from the request, an increase of $339 million from the House-passed version, and an increase of $17 million from the Senate-passed version. Operating expenses are set at $5,492 million, $55 million less than the House. P.L. 109-90 provides funding for Coast Guard operations and acquisitions, with some amounts lower than the President's request. Congress is concerned about the agency's response to increased duties in maritime homeland security. The Deepwater program is a multi-billion dollar project to replace or modernize aging Coast Guard ships and aircraft. The President requested $966 million for the program in FY2006, but the House bill provided only $500 million. Senate-passed H.R. 2360 allocated $906 million for Deepwater. Congress is concerned about the Coast Guard's response to increased duties in maritime homeland security. The Senate-passed H.R. 2360 provided $906 million for the Deepwater program, with the conference agreement allocating $933 million, $33 million less than the President's request. Congress directs the Coast Guard to update the Deepwater plan and submit information about the program and overall capital plan with future budget submissions. The Deepwater program aims to help the Coast Guard achieve its missions, including maritime security. The President's FY2006 request includes $2,219.4 million for port waterways and coastal security, an increase of $127.9 million. The President's FY2006 request includes $2,219.4 million for port waterways and coastal security, with a focus on Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) to track ship movements using Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) technology. Congress increased funding in FY2005 to achieve nationwide coverage of AIS signals. The President's FY2006 request includes $11 million for additional boat crews and screening personnel at U.S. LNG shoreside facilities to enhance maritime security. The United States Secret Service plays a crucial role in homeland security through criminal investigations and protection missions. The Secret Service's protection mission focuses on the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for those offices, the White House, Vice President's residence, foreign missions, designated individuals, and National Special Security Events. The FY2006 budget requested $1,204 million for protection and criminal investigation missions, including funding for counterfeit investigations and forensic activities. The budget for the Secret Service in FY2006 included funding for counterfeit investigations, forensic activities, and activities related to missing and exploited children. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an appropriation of nearly $1,233 million, an increase of almost $29 million above the President's request. Additional amounts were allocated for National Special Security Events and protective operations. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 recommended $1,192 million for the Secret Service, a decrease of $41 million compared to the House-passed amounts. The Senate Committee did not provide the requested $5 million for the NSSE fund due to unobligated balances. P.L. 109-90 provides $1,212 million for the Secret Service, representing an increase of $8 million. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 2360 recommended $1,212 million for the Secret Service, an increase of $8 million from the President's request. The conferees expressed concern about Secret Service Agents' workloads and directed the agency to submit a workload rebalancing report. The Secret Service's roles and responsibilities have expanded and become more complex since the 2001 terrorist attacks, posing challenges for Congress and the executive in terms of resource sufficiency and interagency cooperation. The Secret Service's responsibilities have expanded since 2001, requiring coordination with various entities. This includes reimbursing subnational governments for expenses related to protective operations. The agency also faces challenges in maintaining its traditional role in financial crime enforcement amidst competing priorities like anti-terrorism. Title III Preparedness and Recovery provides funding for the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP) and the Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR) Directorate. The FY2006 requested appropriation for Title III is $6,710 million, a 4% decrease from FY2005. The House-passed version of H.R. 2360 recommended $6,688 million for Title III, a less than 1% decrease from the President's request. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2360 recommended $6,336 million for Title III activities, a decrease of $374 million or nearly 6% compared to the FY2006 request. P.L. 109-90 provides $6,666 million for Title III activities, including $625 million for Infrastructure Protection and Information Security (IPIS) activities. The SLGCP serves as the main contact point within DHS for state and local programs, providing information on best practices and federal homeland security activities. The Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administers federal homeland security assistance programs for states and localities, including formula and discretionary grants and training programs. The FY2006 budget proposed funding for various programs such as Emergency Management Performance Grants, Citizen Corps Programs, State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program, and Assistance to Firefighters Program. The House passed different funding amounts for these programs. The Senate and P.L. 109-90 allocated funding for various homeland security assistance programs, including Emergency Management Performance Grants, Citizen Corps Programs, State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, Assistance to Firefighters Program, Metropolitan Medical Response System, and Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention. The budget request for State and Local Homeland Security Assistance Programs proposes a reduction in overall funding, with a total of $3.57 billion for FY2006, down $420 million from FY2005. The Administration's proposal includes changes to grant allocation formulas and no line item funding for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program. The Administration's budget proposal for State and Local Homeland Security Assistance Programs in FY2006 includes a reduction in overall funding, with a total of $3.67 billion allocated. This represents a decrease of $420 million from FY2005, with a proposed reduction of $320 million for SLGCP and federal homeland security assistance. The proposal also suggests directing states and localities to allocate no less than 20% of SHSGP and UASI funding for LETPP activities, which could further reduce federal homeland security assistance funding. The Administration's budget proposal for FY2006 includes a $500 million request for FIRE, a 23% cut from FY2005. Priority would be given to grant applications enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities. Separate funding would be allocated for fire prevention and firefighter safety grants. The Administration is not requesting funding for SAFER grants in FY2006. House-passed H.R. 2360 included $650 million for firefighter assistance, with disagreement on shifting priorities to terrorism. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $615 million for firefighter assistance, with $550 million for fire grants and $65 million for SAFER Act grants. The proposed reduction in funding for SLGCP and federal homeland security-assistance includes $350 million less for SHSGP than in FY2005. Congress appropriated $150 million each for port security and rail security in FY2005. The Administration's FY2006 budget request proposes the establishment of priorities for grant applications enhancing counter-terrorism capabilities. The Administration's FY2006 budget proposes a new state and local homeland security assistance program called TIPP, requesting $600 million for security enhancements in ports and transit systems. However, the allocation for port and rail security remains unspecified. The House and Senate passed H.R. 2360 with differing opinions on establishing a separate grant program for these security activities. The Senate passed H.R. 2360 recommending $365 million for port, rail, and infrastructure security grants to be administered separately from UASI. The conference report proposed $390 million for these grants, $75 million more than FY2005. The Administration proposed changing the formula for ODP's SHSGP to allocate $1.02 billion based on risks and capabilities. No formula change was proposed for UASI, CCP, EMPG, or FIRE, but FIRE applications for terrorism response enhancements were prioritized. The proposed formula change for SHSGP did not fully support the 9/11 Commission's recommendation of providing federal homeland security assistance strictly based on threat and risk. The House report accompanying H.R. 2360 directs ODP to assess each state's threat, risk, and need to determine their minimum essential preparedness capability levels. The Senate passed H.R. 2360 recommending $425 million to be allocated to states based on risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and cooperation in preparing domestic preparedness plans. The Collins-Lieberman Amendment allows states to choose between two funding options to receive the highest level of funding. The conference report on H.R. 2360 recommended $3.34 billion for state and local homeland security grant programs, $270 million less than the previous year. The funding formula for SHSGP and LETPP remains unchanged, with states, DC, and Puerto Rico receiving 0.75% of total appropriations. The conference report on H.R. 2360 recommends $3.34 billion for state and local homeland security grant programs, with states, DC, and Puerto Rico receiving 0.75% of total appropriations. States must update their State Homeland Security Strategies to be eligible for federal assistance. The report also requires a review of threat factors used in grant allocations and addresses public health and medical preparedness for disasters. Existing programs like MMRS contracts in SLGCP and NDMS in FEMA are in place. A new Chief Medical Officer position was proposed by DHS Secretary Chertoff in July 2005, with initial funding in the Homeland Security appropriations conference report for FY2006. Community EMS services can receive funding through various state and local grant programs, including MMRS. Some activities in the Biosurveillance Initiative have been transferred to a new IPIS program in Title III. Funding issues for these programs are discussed. Proposed FY2006 funding levels can be found in Table 8. The Response System (MMRS) is a program for emergency planning in major cities, facing elimination in the FY2006 budget proposal. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $40 million in funding, the Senate recommended $10 million, and conferees settled on $30 million. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers are considered first responders but lack funding priority in homeland security grants. A few small grant programs are available through NHTSA, not specifically for homeland security. EMS providers are eligible for preparedness funds through DHS first responder grants and the hospital preparedness program at HHS. Despite being one-third of traditional first responders, EMS providers have received only a small percentage of available funds. The House Committee on Appropriations directs that at least 10% of SHSGP and UASI funds be provided to EMS responders. The Senate Committee on Appropriations encourages including EMS representatives in planning efforts. The conferees direct ODP to require state and local governments to include EMS representatives in planning committees and evaluate grant funding allocation to EMS providers. Congress provided $60 billion in additional funding to EPR for disaster relief, with $10 billion in P.L. 109-61 and $50 billion in P.L. 109-62. DHS uses DRF funds to assist individuals, families, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations. The FY2006 budget justification for the EPR accounts proposed few changes, with disaster relief funding remaining consistent with previous years. The proposal included increased funding for hazard mitigation programs, such as $50 million for pre-disaster mitigation grants and $8 million for flood mitigation assistance. However, post-disaster mitigation grants would continue to be funded at a lower level. The House approved legislation (H.R. 2360) with some differences from the Administration's request. The House approved legislation (H.R. 2360) with differences from the Administration's request. This included a reduction in funding for the Office of the Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response, increased funding for the national preparedness system, a report on disaster relief overpayments, and higher mitigation assistance. The Senate-passed version had its own provisions, providing funding for the Under Secretary's office, rescinding unobligated funds, but not addressing disaster relief overpayments. The Senate report recommended an increase of $23 million for Urban Search and Rescue teams and support for the National Dam Safety Program. Both chambers recommended $2 billion for the disaster relief fund, with the Senate approving a reduction of $10 million to increase funding for Emergency Management Performance Grants. The FY2006 appropriations statute supported the Second Stage Review reorganization plan proposed by Secretary Chertoff, providing $16.079 million for management and administration of the Preparedness Directorate. P.L. 109-90 requires the Preparedness Directorate to work with FEMA on all-hazard preparation, response, and recovery. It provides $40 million less than the House approved for PMRR funding, with allocations for catastrophic planning, NIMS implementation, urban search and rescue teams, and reusable structures. The DRF receives $1.770 billion, lower than proposed due to supplemental funding after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The statute increases funding for disaster mitigation by providing $40 million for activities involving repetitively flooded property and the National Flood Mitigation Fund. It also includes funding for the Preparedness Directorate and addresses the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA faces increased reporting requirements for expenditures over $50 million to Congress. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) receives appropriations from Congress to provide federal assistance for severe disasters. DHS allocates DRF funds for aid to individuals, families, and governments as authorized by the Stafford Act. Federal assistance is available after a presidential declaration of need to supplement state and local resources overwhelmed by catastrophes. Since 1990, federal disaster relief expenditures have significantly increased due to a greater number and magnitude of disasters, expanded eligibility for assistance, and interpretation of laws and regulations. Some argue that political considerations also play a role in the rising costs of disaster relief. The allocation of disaster declarations is influenced by electoral motivations, with actual need being the primary factor. A study by the GAO found no evidence that party affiliation affects major disaster declaration decisions. The President considers various factors when evaluating a gubernatorial request for disaster relief. The Stafford Act and implementing regulations do not involve Congress in the disaster declaration process. The Disaster Relief Fund's expenditures vary based on the number of declarations, extent of destruction, and uninsured losses. Congress debates balancing federal costs with the needs of disaster-stricken areas during escalating relief costs. Members of Congress may consider options to address these concerns. Members may need to evaluate options to balance disaster relief needs with budget constraints. Options include amending the Stafford Act criteria and modifying how Congress and the President budget for emergencies. These changes could result in cost savings but may also increase financial burdens on individuals and communities in distress. Some propose reforms to address concerns about budgeting for emergencies, such as establishing a reserve fund for disaster assistance. This would help predict and incorporate expected disaster spending into the overall budget. The proposed legislation (S. 24) aims to establish a reserve fund in the Treasury to cover expected disaster assistance spending. Proponents suggest setting criteria for emergency spending to ensure it meets specific requirements outside of regular budget constraints. Past budget resolutions have required emergency spending to be sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary, posing a threat to life, property, or national security. The proposed legislation aims to establish a reserve fund in the Treasury to cover expected disaster assistance spending. Proponents suggest setting criteria for emergency spending to ensure it meets specific requirements. Activities funded by Title IV include USCIS, IAIP, FLETC, and S&T. The Administration requested an appropriation of $4,320 million in gross budget authority for Title IV in FY2006, representing an 8% increase over the enacted FY2005 level. In FY2006, the DHS budget breakdown is as follows: USCIS less than 1%, IAIP 3%, S&T 5%, FLETC less than 1%, and all Title IV combined 8% of the requested net appropriated budget authority. House-passed H.R. 2360 recommended $2,522 million for Title IV, a 5% increase from FY2005 and 1% decrease from the FY2006 request. The Senate-passed version proposed $2,686 million, a 5% increase from the FY2006 request and 12% from FY2005. P.L. 109-90 allocated $1,899 million for Title IV activities, excluding IAIP funding. The USCIS budget for Title IV activities is $1,899 million, excluding IAIP funding. USCIS focuses on adjudicating immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. Funding for processing these benefits comes mainly from fees charged to applicants. In FY2004 and FY2005, USCIS received funding from the Examinations Fee Account, with 86% of funding in FY2004 and a budget authority of $1.571 billion in FY2005. Congress provided a direct appropriation of $160 million in FY2005 to reduce application backlogs and aim for a six-month processing standard by FY2006. Additionally, a fraud prevention and detection fee of $500 was imposed on H-1B and L petitioners under Title IV of P.L. 108-447. The Administration is seeking an increase of $79 million for USCIS in FY2006, with a total request of $1,854 million, mainly funded by increased fees from individuals and businesses filing petitions. USCIS expects to receive $1,774 million in FY2006, with the majority coming from the Examinations Fee Account. The USCIS FY2006 budget request includes funds from various accounts, with the Examinations Fee Account alone comprising 93% of the total budget. The Administration plans to use funds generated from new fees on H-1B and L petitions to expand its Fraud Detection and National Security Office. The direct appropriations request is $80 million, a decrease from previous years. The USCIS FY2006 budget includes $80 million in direct appropriations, $40 million less than House-passed H.R. 2360. P.L. 109-90 provides $1,889 million for USCIS, with 94% from fees. $115 million is a direct appropriation, including $80 million for backlog reduction and $35 million for IT transformation. FY2006 appropriations are 28% lower than FY2005, but a 10% increase in fee revenue offsets the decrease. Congress is concerned about processing delays and has enacted requirements for backlog elimination. The USCIS has been working on backlog elimination for several years, with a 21.5% decrease in pending immigration and naturalization petitions from FY2003 to FY2004. However, there is still a 25.7% increase compared to FY2000. USCIS aims to achieve a six-month petition processing time by FY2006. Concerns have been raised about coordination between USCIS and ICE in fraud and national security investigations. The USCIS has established the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security to handle national security and criminal issues related to aliens. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides training for various law enforcement entities to develop necessary skills and knowledge for law enforcement functions. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) provides training for law enforcement functions with a workforce of over 900 employees. In FY2006, FLETC requested $224 million, including an increase for Simulation Training Technology to enhance decision-making skills during critical situations. The House-passed H.R. 2360 allocated $259 million for FLETC in FY2006, surpassing the President's request and the agency's FY2005 appropriation. The President's request for FLETC in FY2006 was $32 million, 14% more than the agency's FY2005 appropriation, to cover increased training needs for new Border Patrol agents and ICE investigators. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $282 million, $58 million more than the President's request, with a focus on construction to expand training facilities. P.L. 109-90 provided $282 million for FLETC, including $88 million for construction to accommodate the hiring of additional Border Patrol agents and ICE investigators. The DHS IAIP's historical mission was to integrate and analyze terrorist threat information, map threats against critical infrastructure, and recommend actions to protect national security. The IAIP appropriation was divided into Management and Administration, and Assessments and Evaluations accounts. Management and Administration includes budgets for the Office of the Under Secretary, while Assessments and Evaluations support the directorate's activities through 12 programs with various projects. The Directorate's budget justification document breaks down funding to the program level. The President's FY2006 IAIP request was $873 million, a decrease of 2.3% from FY2005. The House approved $853 million, $20 million below the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $871 million. The President's FY2006 request for the M&A account was $204 million, an increase of $72 million, with $69.1 million for programmatic changes. The House approved changes to the IAIP budget, including $11.7 million for staffing increases, $38 million for facility upgrades, and $19.4 million for a Homeland Secure Data Network. The House also cut $13.8 million from the requested amount and requested a review of IAIP's mission and function. The Senate approved less funding for the M&A account, denying funds for extra FTE positions and recommending funding for the Homeland Secure Data Network through the Chief Information Officer's budget. The President's request for FY2006 in the A&E account was $669 million, a decrease of $92.4 million from FY2005. The IAIP Directorate proposes transferring activities to other DHS components, including support for state and local assistance to create Buffer Zone Protection Plans and the National Control Systems Test Center to the S&T Directorate. These adjustments bring the FY2006 base A&E account to $624 million, with requested enhancements totaling $49 million. The largest increase is for the Homeland Security Operations Center (HSOC) at $26 million. The Homeland Security Operations Center (HSOC) is receiving major programmatic increases, including $13.4 million for extending the Homeland Security Information Network and $12.9 million for improving information and communications capabilities. Other increases include $5 million for the United States Computer Emergency Response Team, $5.5 million for contractor support of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information project, and $3.0 million for Critical Infrastructure Outreach and Partnerships. The IAIP budget justification provides less detail about the programmatic decreases in FY2006, totaling approximately $146 million. This includes a $35 million reduction in the Critical Infrastructure Outreach and Partnerships program due to no longer hosting some departmental applications as directed by the department's CIO. Some activities were transferred between programs, such as Threat Determination and Assessment activities. The budget request includes $3.0 million in savings from management and technology efficiencies. The Protective Actions program received the highest adjustment of $100 million, with reductions in Buffer Zone Protection Plans and Emerging Pilot Projects. The House approved $663 million for the A&E account within DHS S&T, with modifications to specific programs. Funding was reduced for various programs due to missing reports, while the Critical Infrastructure Identification and Evaluation program received a $5 million increase. The House commended IAIP on its Review of the nuclear reactor and fuel storage facilities and expressed interest in similar Reviews for the chemical and liquified natural gas sectors. The Senate approved $702 million for the A&E account, making modifications to specific programs. They nearly doubled the Critical Infrastructure Outreach and Partnerships program to $126.6 million and increased funds for other programs such as the National Center for Critical Information Processing and Storage. The Senate also recommended reducing the Critical Infrastructure Identification and Evaluation program request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing funding for the Homeland Security Operations Center by $21.1 million and denied funding for the new Information Sharing and Collaboration program. The Chertoff reorganization split the IA/IP Directorate, with the IA part forming part of the Analysis and Operations group and the IP part merging with elements from the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate to form a new Preparedness Directorate. The conferees agreed to reorganize the IA/IP Directorate into a new Preparedness Directorate, with funding for Analysis and Operations account reduced to $255.5 million from the amended request of $311 million. The reduction was due to vacant positions. The amended request also included $577 million for Preparedness Operations, but the conferees provided a total of $642 million, including $16 million for Management and Administration. The FY2006 budget for IAIP was reorganized into Infrastructure Protection and Information Security programs, with $625 million allocated, $69 million more than requested. The Science and Technology (S&T) budget was also mentioned in the context. The FY2006 budget for Science and Technology (S&T) was $1,368 million, a 23% increase from FY2005. The House provided $1,290 million, the Senate recommended $1,453 million, and P.L. 109-90 allocated $1,502.1 million. R&D programs from TSA and Coast Guard were consolidated into the S&T Directorate under the proposed budget. The FY2006 budget proposed consolidating the Coast Guard R&D program, which was controversial in FY2005 but accepted in FY2006. The TSA R&D program was also consolidated for the first time. The budget included $227 million for the newly created Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), which reports directly to the Secretary. The DNDO, now a freestanding office reporting directly to the Secretary, faced funding challenges with the House and Senate recommending $100 million less than requested. The Senate committee expressed concerns about the handling of the initiative and recommended restricting most of the funds until further details are provided. DNDO activities were previously funded by the S&T Directorate's program, with differing allocations between the House and Senate for radiological and nuclear countermeasures. The conference agreement provided an increase to $226 million, including $125 million for testing, development, and deployment of radiation portal monitors at ports of entry. $318 million was provided for DNDO, with $135 million allocated for radiation portal monitors and restrictions on the obligation of another $145 million pending approval of an expenditure plan. $19 million was allocated for radiological and nuclear countermeasures, with most funding for this activity transferred into DNDO. The FY2006 request made substantial changes in existing programs, including chemical countermeasures and efforts to counter the threat from MANPADs. Funding for rapid prototyping and R&D activities at TSA were reduced, while efforts to counter the threat from MANPADs were doubled. The House, Senate committees, and conference agreement accepted these proposals with modifications, including increased funding for explosives countermeasures. Substantial reprogramming was shown in the FY2006 budget justification for the S&T Directorate. The FY2004 data revealed significant reprogramming in funding for biological countermeasures and the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasure Center. Questions were raised about how the S&T Directorate prioritizes programs and handles changes in priorities after funding decisions. Section 546 of P.L. 109-90 rescinds $20 million in unobligated funding for the S&T Directorate. The P.L. 109-148 includes provisions impacting DHS budget accounts, such as transferring funds to the Coast Guard from the Iraq Freedom Fund for operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. It also includes an across-the-board rescission of 1% affecting DHS accounts. Title III, Chapter 8 of P.L. 109-148 includes a 1% across-the-board rescission for all discretionary FY2006 appropriations, excluding emergency appropriations and Department of Veterans Affairs funds. Application of the rescission to DHS discretionary accounts was unclear at the time of the report. The rescission applied across DHS discretionary accounts was unclear. $17.1 billion was reallocated to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to respond to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Wilma, and other disasters. Funding for repair and replacement of DHS equipment and facilities was provided, including $24.1 million for CBP's Salaries and Expenses account and $10.4 million for CBP's Construction. The funding allocated in P.L. 109-148 includes $24.1 million for CBP's Salaries and Expenses, $10.4 million for CBP's Construction, $13 million for ICE's Salaries and Expenses, $132 million for the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses, $74.5 million for the Coast Guard's Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements, $3.6 million for the Secret Service's Salaries and Expenses, $10.3 million for ODP's State and Local Programs, and $17.2 million for FEMA's Administrative and Regional Operations. Additionally, $1.5 million was transferred from FEMA's Disaster Relief Account to the Disaster Assistance Direct Loan Program Account for the direct loan program. All funds provided to DHS accounts are designated as emergency funds. Division B of P.L. 109-148 includes rescissions affecting DHS accounts, such as $23.4 billion from FEMA's Disaster Relief account and $260.5 million from the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account. An additional $47.3 million is provided for the DHS Office of the Secretary and Executive Management account for preparing for a potential outbreak of highly pathogenic influenza. Division C and D were inserted into the conference report for H.R. 2863, with Division C allowing oil well drilling in Alaska's National Wildlife. The ANWR drilling provisions in Division D of the bill were removed after a contentious debate. In response to Hurricane Katrina, the 109th Congress passed two emergency supplemental bills providing $62.3 billion for response and recovery efforts. The 109th Congress passed two emergency supplemental bills providing $60 billion for FEMA's ongoing efforts in response to disasters, $1.9 billion for the Department of Defense, and $400 million for the Army Corps of Engineers to aid Gulf states. Additional funding may be requested as assessments of Hurricane Rita's damage are completed. On March 11, 2005, S.Con.Res. 18 was passed by the Senate, providing $848.8 billion in discretionary spending. H.Con.Res. 95, introduced on the same day, proposed $843 billion in discretionary budget authority and was passed by the House on March 17, 2005. The conference committee reported on April 28, 2005, with both the House and Senate passing H.Rept. 109-62, providing $843 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2006. Additionally, on February 14, 2005, the President submitted an $81.9 billion request for supplemental FY2005 funding for military operations, international affairs, intelligence, and homeland security activities, including $161 million for the Coast Guard for operations in Iraq. The request includes funding for Coast Guard operations, port security, law enforcement capabilities, and retrofitting patrol boats. It also includes funding for the Department of Energy's Megaports Initiative to deploy radiation detection technology in foreign ports. H.R. 1268 was introduced in March 2005 and passed both the House and Senate. In 2005, H.R. 1268 was signed into law as P.L. 109-13, providing additional funding for various agencies within DHS, including CBP, ICE, Coast Guard, and FLETC. The bill also included the REAL ID Act of 2005. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been a growing interest in funding for homeland security efforts. The Office of Management and Budget has been publishing annual reports to Congress on combating terrorism since FY1998, with homeland security funding analysis included since June 24, 2002. The analysis has become more refined over the years, with a focus on distinguishing between homeland and non-homeland security activities. It's important to note that DHS funding does not cover all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for FY2006 accounts for 54% of total federal funding for homeland security, with the Department of Defense at 19%, Department of Health and Human Services at 8.8%, Department of Justice at 6.2%, and Department of Energy at 3.3% following. These top five agencies collectively make up nearly 95% of all federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security related, as legacy agencies within DHS also conduct other activities. The FY2006 budget requests $27.3 billion for homeland security out of a total gross budget authority of $41.1 billion for DHS and other agencies."
