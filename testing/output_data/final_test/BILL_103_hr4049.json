    "content": "The Act titled \"National Center for Excellence in Research and Development Act of 1994\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that due to the end of the Cold War, the United States has not recently conducted underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site and does not plan to do so in the future. It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain military strength and nuclear capabilities. The Nevada Test Site must be kept ready to ensure the effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and is strategically located for research and development of emerging technologies important for the country in the 21st century. The Nevada Test Site is crucial for the United States in the 21st century, supporting technology development for both private-sector and military projects. It can aid in nuclear weapons stewardship, nonproliferation efforts, and technological competitiveness by facilitating test and demonstration experiments for government, industry, and academia. Additionally, the site can support industrial and civilian tests for environmentally demanding projects and programs, as well as the testing of environmental clean-up technologies. The Nevada Test Site supports testing of alternative energy sources, disarmament activities, non-proliferation experiments, and treaty-compliant experiments for stockpile stewardship purposes. The Nevada Test Site is well-suited for various military activities due to its size and remoteness. The purpose of this Act is to ensure operational readiness of the underground nuclear testing facilities at the Nevada Test Site, maintain appropriate funding levels, establish a National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence for various purposes, and allow private-sector industries to utilize the site for research and development. SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF READINESS CAPABILITY OF NEVADA TEST SITE. Authorization of appropriations for maintaining operational readiness of underground nuclear testing facilities and infrastructure at Nevada Test Site for fiscal year 1995 and beyond. Staffing levels to be maintained at sufficient levels by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy will conduct infrastructure assessments and activities at the Nevada Test Site to support new projects and initiatives. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence will be established. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence (referred to as the \"Center\") is established within the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site. The purpose of the Center is to promote disarmament, demilitarization, alternative and renewable energy sources, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, sensor development, and environmentally sensitive technologies. Activities related to alternative and renewable energy sources include testing and demonstration of solar and geothermal resources, as well as the development of alternative energy sources. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence, established within the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site, aims to promote disarmament, demilitarization, alternative and renewable energy sources, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, sensor development, and environmentally sensitive technologies. Activities include testing and demonstrating solar and geothermal resources, developing alternative energy sources, and completing two 100-megawatt solar power plants by 2000. Additionally, the Center conducts a National Alternative-Fueled Vehicles Program to demonstrate the regional use of natural gas, electricity, and hydrogen as vehicle fuels. Testing and demonstration activities related to changes in the US military post-Cold War involve demilitarization of rocket motors and conventional ordnance, assisting in disarmament and demilitarization, and testing nonmilitary applications of technologies and resources. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence, established within the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site, focuses on promoting disarmament, demilitarization, alternative energy sources, and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Activities include testing solar and geothermal resources, developing alternative energy sources, and conducting programs for nuclear weapons design and effects. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Nevada Test Site conducts experiments related to disarmament, demilitarization, alternative energy sources, and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. This includes testing environmental technologies for remediation of toxic chemicals and carrying out the stockpile stewardship program. The National Test and Demonstration Center of Excellence at the Nevada Test Site conducts experiments related to disarmament, demilitarization, alternative energy sources, and nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. This includes testing environmental technologies for remediation of toxic and hazardous chemicals, conducting training activities for emergency response to hazardous accidents, and demonstrating other appropriate technologies as determined by the Secretary of Energy. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS: Authorization for the Secretary of Energy to receive necessary funds for fiscal year 1995 to carry out the Act."
