    "content": "Exclusion from gross income for distributions from controlled foreign corporations invested in certain US property or used to hire new employees in the US. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include new section 137 regarding such distributions. The gross income of a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation does not include qualified distributions received during the taxable year. If the taxpayer fails to meet investment or job creation requirements by the end of the reinvestment period, their tax will be increased by a recapture amount with respect to the distribution. The recapture amount, for excluding a distribution from gross income, includes the shortfall percentage and interest. The shortfall percentage is based on the investment in property or job creation shortfall percentage. The investment in property shortfall percentage is defined as the excess of 50 percent of the distribution over the amount of qualified investment made during the reinvestment period. The job creation shortfall percentage is the excess of 12.5 percent of the distribution involved. The investment in property requirement states that a taxpayer must invest at least 50 percent of the distribution in qualified investment during the reinvestment period. The investment requirement mandates that a taxpayer invest in new and used qualified property, with rules similar to those in effect before 1990 applying. Qualified property includes section 38 property and real property. The term 'qualified property' includes section 38 property and real property used as part of a manufacturing facility. If the taxpayer is the lessor of the property, it is not considered qualified property. If qualified property is disposed of before the recapture period ends, the taxpayer's tax for that year will be increased. The recapture period for qualified property is the first full year after it is placed in service and the 2 succeeding full years. The recapture amount is determined by the sum of the recapture percentage of the property's share of the tax benefit and the interest on that amount. The recapture period for qualified property ranges from 2 to 9 succeeding full years, depending on the type of property. The recapture percentage is determined by section 50(a)(1)(B), with specific percentages for different types of property. The recapture percentage for qualified property varies depending on the type of property, with specific percentages outlined in section 50(a)(1)(B). For certain types of property, the percentage can range from 66% to 100% in the first year, decreasing by 10 percentage points each subsequent year during the recapture period. The property's share of tax benefit is determined based on the ratio of the reduction in the taxpayer's liability for tax to the unadjusted basis of the property compared to all qualified property placed in service during the reinvestment period. The taxpayer must meet a job creation requirement where new employee wages paid during the last taxable year of the reinvestment period must be at least 12.5 percent of the distribution amount. New employee wages refer to wages paid to employees hired after the distribution date, leading to an increase in the taxpayer's total U.S. workforce. The taxpayer must maintain increased employment for 4 years, with penalties for failing to meet new employee wage requirements. The adjusted recapture amount is the sum of the job creation shortfall percentage and the excess of the reduction in taxpayer's tax liability from excluding a distribution from gross income, along with any prior tax increases and interest. The curr_chunk discusses the calculation of interest on excess amounts and defines the employment maintenance period. It also defines qualified distribution and reinvestment period for tax purposes. The curr_chunk defines terms related to tax calculations, such as reinvestment period, United States shareholder, and controlled foreign corporation. The curr_chunk explains the calculation of tax increases using applicable rates and methods, with a focus on the due date for the taxable year. It also clarifies that any increase in tax due to this section is treated as interest. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of interest paid on the due date for a taxable year, and the basis adjustment for qualified property placed in service. It also mentions that taxpayers in controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer. The curr_chunk discusses basis adjustments for property under section 137(f) for a taxable year. It includes technical and clerical amendments to the tax code. The curr_chunk discusses distributions from controlled foreign corporations and cross-references to other Acts. The amendments made by this section apply to distributions received after the enactment date in taxable years ending after that date."
