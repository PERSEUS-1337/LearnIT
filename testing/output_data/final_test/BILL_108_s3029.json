    "content": "The \"Retirement Security for Life Act of 2004\" may be cited as the Act. It includes an exclusion for lifetime annuity payments. The \"Retirement Security for Life Act of 2004\" includes an exclusion for lifetime annuity payments under annuity contracts. Gross income shall not include 50 percent of the portion of lifetime annuity payments, not exceeding $20,000 per year. For taxable years after December 31, 2005, the $20,000 exclusion for lifetime annuity payments will be adjusted for inflation based on the cost-of-living adjustment. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $500, it will be rounded down. This exclusion does not apply to certain circumstances. For taxable years after December 31, 2005, the exclusion for lifetime annuity payments will be adjusted for inflation. This exclusion does not apply to certain circumstances, such as amounts received under eligible deferred compensation or qualified retirement plans, or amounts paid under an annuity contract to a beneficiary after the annuitant's death. For taxable years after December 31, 2005, the exclusion for lifetime annuity payments will be adjusted for inflation. The exclusion does not apply to certain circumstances, such as payments to a beneficiary after the annuitant's death, unless the beneficiary is the surviving spouse. The exclusion for lifetime annuity payments will be adjusted for inflation after December 31, 2005. Lifetime annuity payment is defined as any amount received as an annuity under an annuity contract, with specific conditions for the recipient. The exclusion for lifetime annuity payments is applicable if the amount is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life of the annuitant or joint annuitant. The exclusion for lifetime annuity payments applies to annuitants with a minimum period or amount required, or joint annuitants with a minimum period or amount if the annuitant is the spouse or within 15 years in age difference. Exceptions to the exclusion for lifetime annuity payments include variations in payment amounts based on investment experience, reallocations, actuarial gains or losses, cost of living adjustments, constant percentage changes, or similar criteria. Additionally, changes in the duration of the annuity do not disqualify it from being part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments. The annuity contract allows for modifications in payment duration, lump sum withdrawals, and changes in payment intervals as long as they do not exceed one year. An annuity contract is defined as a commercial annuity excluding endowment or life insurance contracts. The term 'minimum period of payments' refers to a guaranteed term of payments not exceeding 10 years or the annuitant's life expectancy at the annuity starting date. Life expectancy is calculated based on specific tables. The minimum period of payments is determined based on specific tables provided by the Secretary. The minimum amount that must be paid to the designated beneficiary under an annuity contract is defined as a refund amount not exceeding the lifetime annuity payments or the available withdrawal amount at the date of death. The IRS has provisions for recapture tax on modifications to lifetime annuity payments under annuity contracts. If future payments are no longer lifetime annuity payments or if a lump sum is received after the first lifetime annuity payment, recapture tax may apply. The annuitant may receive a lump sum initially and then reduced annuity payments under the contract. Subsequent annuity payments may be reduced without a lump sum if certain conditions are met. If a modification or reduction occurs in subsection (c)(5)(D), gross income for the first taxable year will increase by the recapture amount. The recapture amount is determined by the Secretary and includes the amount that would have been included in gross income without the modification, plus interest for the deferral period. The term 'deferral period' refers to the period from the taxable year when the payment would have been included in gross income to the year of modification. Exceptions to recapture tax include modifications due to death, disability, chronic illness, or hardship. Section 101(d) discusses lifetime distributions of life insurance death benefits. Section 101(d) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude lifetime annuity payments from gross income, with specific rules and limitations outlined. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to apply rules similar to section 72 for life insurance contracts, with a special effective date provision for amounts received after the enactment of the Act. Special rule for existing contracts: Any modifications made to contracts in force on the date of the Act to satisfy new requirements will not trigger recognition of gain or loss, inclusion in gross income, or additional tax, if completed within 2 years of the Act's enactment."
