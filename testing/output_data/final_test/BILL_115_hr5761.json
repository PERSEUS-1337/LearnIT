    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ending Maternal Mortality Act of 2018\". The Congress finds that the United States has a high maternal mortality rate, ranking 47th globally, with 700 women dying annually during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum. Common causes of maternal mortality include obstetric hemorrhage, hypertension, sepsis, and substance use disorder. More than half of these deaths are preventable. Additionally, 65,000 American women experience severe maternal morbidity each year. The adverse effects of psychological conditions during pregnancy disproportionately impact Black women, who are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to White women. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section for a plan to reduce maternal mortality. The Secretary must develop a national plan to reduce preventable maternal mortality, aiming to cut the rate in half within 10 years and eliminate preventable deaths within 20 years of enactment. Each biennial plan must include objectives and a strategy for implementation across relevant agencies. The Secretary's biennial plan addresses increasing public understanding of maternal mortality, improving root cause understanding, enhancing data collection, identifying at-risk populations, and supporting maternal mortality review. The biennial plan aims to support maternal mortality review committees, assess hospital safety culture in maternity care, improve health services for expectant mothers with substance use and mental health disorders, study local responses to maternal death, and identify ways to enhance Federal programs to reduce maternal mortality. The Secretary will publicly post each plan submitted to Congress, consult with various organizations in developing biennial plans, and define terms related to maternal mortality and morbidity. The term 'severe maternal morbidity' includes unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant consequences to a woman's health, potentially leading to maternal death."
