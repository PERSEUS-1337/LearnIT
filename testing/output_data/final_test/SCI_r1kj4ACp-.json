    "content": "Deep learning's generalization capability is attributed to its overwhelming number of model parameters. This paper explores an alternative understanding of generalization through the lens of maximum entropy. It establishes a connection between deep neural networks (DNN) and maximum entropy, showing how DNN approximates maximum entropy through multilayer feature learning. This connection explains why design choices like shortcuts and regularization improve model generalization and provides insights for future model development. Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks with over 100 hidden layers, such as ResNet BID2 and DenseNet BID3, exhibit good generalization capabilities despite having a large number of model parameters. This challenges classical statistical learning theories like VC dimension and Rademacher complexity, which evaluate generalization based on function complexity. The generalization ability of deep learning models remains poorly explained by statistical learning theory. Maximum Entropy (ME) is a key principle in designing machine learning models, focusing on making the least biased estimate possible with minimal assumptions beyond the given data. The selection of appropriate feature functions plays a crucial role in determining the model's generalization capability. Different choices of feature functions result in various instantiations of maximum entropy models, with softmax regression being a well-known example. However, softmax regression does not guarantee generalization, highlighting the importance of selecting suitable feature functions and data assumptions. The paper aims to improve the theory behind applying the Maximum Entropy (ME) principle to understand deep learning generalization. It explores how to select feature functions to fulfill ME principle and ensure generalization capability in ME models. Deep neural networks (DNN) are seen as a recursive solution to approximate feature conditions and maximize ME principle fulfillment for better generalization. Models that fulfill ME principle require minimal data hypothesis for good generalization capability. The paper discusses the importance of feature function selection in fulfilling the Maximum Entropy (ME) principle for better generalization in models. It introduces two feature conditions to make softmax regression equivalent to the ME model, emphasizing the role of feature learning. Additionally, it explores how deep neural networks (DNN) can be used to meet these feature conditions and connect with the ME principle. The DNN hidden layers in regression learn features to meet conditions, optimized recursively. Standard DNN uses non-linear functions for decomposition and back propagation for optimization. Section 5 explains generalization in DNN using ME interpretation, connecting deep learning with Information Bottleneck. Theoretical explanations on generalization design of DNN are provided, summarizing contributions in three-fold. The contributions include deriving feature conditions for softmax regression based on the maximum entropy principle, introducing a recursive decomposition solution for applying the principle in DNN, and providing explanations for the information bottleneck phenomenon in DNN and designs for generalization improvement. The ME principle is used as a criterion for learning machine learning models, focusing on generalization, overfitting, and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model fits the training data well but not the testing data, underfitting occurs when the model fits neither well. Generalization refers to a model's ability to generalize beyond the training data. The ME principle emphasizes model generalization by minimizing extra data hypotheses, preventing overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model fits training data well but not testing data, while underfitting fits neither well. Generalization is a model's ability to extend beyond training data. The ME principle aims to minimize extra data hypotheses for better generalization. Most ME models introduce extra data hypotheses, violating the principle and degrading the model. To address this, a solution is proposed to transfer data hypotheses to model features, allowing for the application of the ME principle without imposing hypotheses on the original data. The ME principle aims to minimize extra data hypotheses for better generalization by transferring data hypotheses to model features. The model defined on feature T is ideally a simple ME model like softmax regression, which, when combined with feature constraints, achieves good generalization capability. The goal of feature learning is to realize the feature constraints between data and features. The problem lies in identifying equivalent feature constraints and simple models when applying the ME principle to make softmax regression equivalent to the original ME model. The original ME model defines constraints for joint distribution equality, while the feature-based softmax model focuses on maximizing conditional entropy. The optimization problem can be solved using the lagrangian multiplier method. The solution to the optimization problem can be found using the lagrangian multiplier method, with functions \u03bb i (y) and b(y) representing weight and bias terms in softmax regression. The original ME problem is challenging due to the inability to traverse all status of (X, Y), leading to the need for special predicate functions. The generalization capability of the derived ME model can be undermined by imposing the extra data hypothesis on (X, Y). An alternative solution is to design the predicate function by imposing constraints on intermediate feature T instead of directly on input data. Two necessary and sufficient feature conditions are derived to make feature-based softmax regression strictly equivalent to the original ME model. The proof to the theorem is given in Section A in the Appendix. The Maximum Entropy Equivalence Theorem ensures that a feature-based ME model is equivalent to the original ME model, denoted as equivalent condition. It also makes the feature-based ME model solvable as a feature-based softmax regression problem, denoted as solvable condition. This theorem provides operable feature constraints for improving model generalization. The original ME model is equivalent to a feature-based softmax model with two feature constraints, guiding feature learning in DNNs for approaching these constraints. The section discusses how DNNs use recursive decomposition to address feature constraints, decomposing difficult problems into smaller ones. It explains that DNN with sigmoid-activated hidden layers and softmax output layer is a solution to the original ME model. The original ME problem is decomposable and equivalent to a manageable problem with additional constraints. The text discusses solving problem P with additional constraints by decomposing it into smaller, more manageable subproblems. By iteratively solving these subproblems, the original problem can be addressed effectively. The text introduces the concept of recursive decomposition to solve problem P with constraints. By breaking down P into smaller subproblems and iteratively optimizing them, the original problem can be effectively addressed. This method is explained as a recursive decomposition solution towards maximum entropy, with the back propagation algorithm optimizing parameters in the model. The text introduces recursive decomposition to solve problem P with constraints, optimizing parameters in the model. The original ME model is equivalent to softmax model with feature constraints, leading to a decomposable problem. Feature constraints are relaxed to smaller problems using Feature Constraint Relaxation Theorem, optimizing feature T = T1, T2, ..., Tn. The text discusses the recursive decomposition of optimization problems with feature constraints, leading to manageable subproblems through relaxation. The original Maximum Entropy (ME) model is approximated by logistic regression models at different recursion depths, ultimately simplifying the problem. DNN is a recursive decomposition solution towards maximum entropy, with the depth of recursion corresponding to the network hidden layer. The generalization capability is guaranteed under the ME principle, explaining why DNN is designed as a composition of multilayer non-linear functions. The backpropagation learning technique follows the same optimization process in recursive decomposition for DNN parameter optimization. In this section, the ME theory is used to explain generalization-related phenomena in DNN and provide interpretations on DNN structure design. It explains the existence of Information Bottleneck in DNN and how certain DNN structure designs can improve generalization. The output of the constraint problem in the ME model satisfies the Information Bottleneck theory, showing that a basic DNN model with softmax output fulfills the IB theory. The proof of the corollary in Section C of the Appendix shows that the output of the maximum entropy problem is a sufficient condition for the Information Bottleneck optimization problem in DNN. This explains why DNN tends to increase I(T ; Y ) while reducing I(X; T ). Generalization designs like shortcut and regularization can improve model capability by making information flow more convenient in CNN frameworks. Shortcut in CNN contributes to better performance by using part of the input X at each layer to construct the model. The CNN model uses different size receptive fields to capture more information from the input X. Regularization in DNN, such as sgd and dropout, minimizes mutual information I(X; T). The depth of the network plays a role in generalization performance, with more layers leading to closer approximation to Maximum Entropy. The optimization process involves relaxed constraints, and having too many layers in a simple DNN can impact performance. Increasing network depth in CNNs with good architecture can lead to richer receptive fields and improved generalization. This paper views DNN as a way to decompose the maximum entropy problem recursively, attributing the generalization capability to introducing the least extra data hypothesis. Future work aims to connect with other generalization theories, explain DNN observations, and enhance traditional model development.

Lemmas are used to support the proof, showing the relationship between random variables and mutual information.

Condition 2 assumes conditional independence among features, leading to specific predicate functions.

The softmax regression model is explained, highlighting the role of bias terms and the ability to adjust \u03bb and b for translation and scaling.
