    "content": "The \"Flexible Refinancing for American Families Act of 2012\" allows for affordable 50-year refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are required to carry out a program for refinancing qualified mortgages on single-family housing through a 50-year term mortgage. The program also includes the purchase and securitization of these refinancing mortgages. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will establish policies and procedures for this program. A qualified mortgage is defined as a mortgage, regardless of the mortgagor's payment status, that meets certain criteria. The current section outlines the requirements for a refinancing mortgage, which must be an existing first mortgage on a one to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor as their principal residence. The mortgage must be owned or guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and originated before the enactment of the Act. The refinancing mortgage must have a 50-year term with a 30-year call option, fully amortizing over the term. The property subject to the mortgage must be the same as the qualified mortgage being refinanced. The mortgagee can require full payment after 30 years with written notice to the mortgagor. The mortgage must bear a fixed interest rate for the entire term, based on the premium received on the qualified mortgage being refinanced. The rate may be adjusted to cover fees, insurance, and administrative costs. The mortgagor must be given written notice of any acceleration of indebtedness at least 90 days in advance. The Director may allocate administrative costs to the mortgage. Prepayment penalties and borrower fees are waived for refinancing. Title insurance fees must be reasonable. The Director may allocate administrative costs to the mortgage, waive prepayment penalties and borrower fees for refinancing, and require reasonable title insurance fees. For qualified mortgages refinanced through a refinancing mortgage, the enterprise shall pay the servicer a fee not exceeding $1,000. Appraisals are not required for refinancing. The requirement for enterprises to refinance qualified mortgages does not apply after one year from the enactment of this Act. Definitions include the Director as the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Director will issue regulations for the program under this section, defining \"enterprise\" as the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation."
