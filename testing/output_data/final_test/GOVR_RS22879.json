    "content": "Haiti has a history of poverty, political instability, and underdevelopment, leading to the lowest standard of living in the Western Hemisphere. The country is working with international aid to improve security, economic growth, investment, employment, and access to social services. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val aims to rebuild democratic institutions and attract private investment for job creation. Success depends on enhancing security and sustainable development. President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val's success in improving Haiti's security and socioeconomic conditions is crucial, as 76% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. While security has improved, living conditions have worsened due to global food price increases and hurricanes. Unemployment is high, with many workers unable to afford more than one meal a day. Congress and the Bush Administration have taken action to address Haiti's immediate food needs and promote long-term development. In April 2008, the House passed an amendment recommending cancellation of Haiti's debts. The Farm Bill of 2008 included the HOPE Act, giving trade preferences to Haitian apparel. Congress also amended the M\u00c3\u00a9rida Initiative to include counternarcotics funds for Haiti. Some Members urged temporary protected status for Haitian immigrants in the US. In response to rising food prices in Haiti, protests turned violent in April 2008, leading to six deaths. The Prime Minister resigned amid accusations of mishandling the crisis. President Pr\u00e9val announced a plan to subsidize rice costs. The Haitian Parliament rejected two nominees for Prime Minister before ratifying Michele Pierre-Louis. The parliament, with 19 political parties, remains divided, posing a governance challenge. Observers warn of potential support for ousted President Aristide's return. To address the crisis, President Pr\u00e9val must strengthen his coalition and gain international support. The World Bank is providing $10 million in grant funding. The World Bank and IDB are providing grant funding to Haiti, with emergency assistance increasing from individual donor countries. The WFP has received significant support for its efforts in Haiti, with the Bush Administration redirecting funds to support President Pr\u00e9val's plan. Haiti had already been allocated $234 million in U.S. assistance in FY2008. In FY2008, Haiti received $234 million in U.S. assistance, including $34 million in food aid. President Bush directed $200 million from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust for global emergency food needs. USAID provided $20 million in emergency food aid to Haiti and pledged an additional $25 million to support WFP's programs. Congress later appropriated $1.2 billion in funding. In late June 2008, Congress allocated $1.2 billion for P.L. 480 food aid in Haiti. Members requested $60 million in emergency food assistance for Haiti to support government programs and WFP initiatives. Haiti may need to compete for aid with other countries like Afghanistan and Sudan. Advocates suggest funding agricultural development in Haiti for long-term food security solutions. The 109th Congress passed the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement in December 2006 (HOPE I) to assist Haiti in rebuilding its economy by encouraging investment and job creation in the apparel sector. The act provided duty-free treatment for select apparel imports from Haiti, with eligibility criteria related to labor, human rights, and anti-poverty policies. The 110th Congress expanded the provisions of HOPE I in June 2008 with the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, including the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (HOPE II). Duty preferences support Haitian apparel exports to the U.S., crucial for Haiti's economy, as apparel constitutes a significant portion of the country's exports and provides potential for employment growth. The HOPE Acts provide duty preferences for Haitian apparel exports to the U.S., supporting employment growth in the textile sector. Haitian firms benefit from duty-free treatment for apparel imports assembled in Haiti with inputs from third-party countries, giving them a competitive advantage. HOPE I provided tariff preferences for apparel imports from Haiti, allowing duty-free treatment for articles meeting value-added content rules and a single transformation rule of origin. This aims to boost investment in Haiti's apparel assembly industry, leading to increased output, employment, and exports. HOPE I aimed to boost Haiti's apparel industry by providing duty-free treatment for garments made in Haiti or the US. However, limited time frame and complex rules hindered growth. US textile producers raised concerns about job displacement and vague rules of origin. They suggested preferences only for goods no longer produced in the Western Hemisphere. The HOPE II Act enhances tariff preferences for Haiti by extending them for 10 years, simplifying rules, and expanding duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports assembled in Haiti. This is seen as a constructive response to Haiti's development needs, with proponents arguing that the benefits outweigh potential costs. The HOPE II Act extends tariff preferences for Haiti, simplifies rules, and expands duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports assembled in Haiti. Key provisions include maintaining the value-added rule, increasing caps for select apparel imports, introducing an uncapped \"3 for 1\" earned import allowance, and expanding the single transformation rule to include various apparel articles. The HOPE II Act extends tariff preferences for Haiti, simplifies rules, and expands duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports assembled in Haiti. It allows for direct shipment of apparel articles from Haiti to the Dominican Republic for finishing, reducing transportation costs. Haiti must create a new apparel sector monitoring program to ensure compliance with labor standards and some Members of Congress pushed for immediate debt relief to address the food crisis. Haiti's foreign public debt totals roughly $1.7 billion, owed to multilateral institutions. The IMF projects Haiti's debt service payments in 2008 to be $71.7 million. The Jubilee Act amendment recommends canceling Haiti's debts to international financial institutions. A companion bill is in the Senate, aiming to change lending practices and cancel debt for low-income countries. Critics argue that immediate debt cancellation may be unnecessary as Haiti is already in the HIPC debt relief process. The Haitian government published a Poverty Reduction Strategy in line with IMF and World Bank recommendations. Observers predicted Haiti could meet the \"completion point\" for debt relief by late 2008 or early 2009, but the current crisis may delay this. Proponents urge immediate cancellation of Haiti's foreign debt to address the food crisis and accelerate debt relief under the HIPC program. Haiti may not meet conditions for debt relief soon under the HIPC program."
