The Federal Trade Commission must amend its rules to establish a no-call list for telemarketing purposes, allowing consumers to opt out of receiving such calls. The list will be made public, and making telemarketing calls to numbers on the list will be prohibited as a deceptive or abusive practice. Other federal agencies will also be required to follow similar rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other federal agencies must amend their rules in a similar manner to establish regulations for telemarketing and consumer protection. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, National Credit Union Administration Board, and Federal Communications Commission must amend their rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit deceptive telemarketing acts within 90 days of the effective date of rules set by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Communications Commission may not need to create rules against deceptive telemarketing if existing rules provide similar protection as those set by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Communications Commission will publish its determination in the Federal Register with reasons if an exception applies.
