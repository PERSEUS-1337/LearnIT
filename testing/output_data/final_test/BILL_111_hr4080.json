    "content": "The \"Criminal Justice Reinvestment Act of 2009\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to criminal justice. Congress finds that there are 2.2 million American adults incarcerated in State and local prisons and jails, with State spending on corrections increasing significantly over the last 20 years. Jail populations have also been on the rise, with approximately 785,000 inmates in 2008. Additionally, there are 3,300 jails nationwide processing around 13.5 million inmates each year. The number of persons on probation and parole in State correctional systems has been increasing significantly, with approximately 5,000,000 Americans, or 1 out of every 45 adults, on probation or parole, showing a nearly 300 percent increase since 1980. Policymakers lack detailed data-driven explanations about crime trends, while some states like Texas, Kansas, Rhode Island, and Vermont have implemented data-driven criminal justice strategies to enhance public safety, accountability for offenders, and manage correctional costs. The Act aims to provide grants for criminal justice reinvestment strategies, which involve analyzing trends in the criminal justice system to manage prison and jail populations effectively. It also focuses on increasing public safety, improving accountability, and measuring the impact of policy changes. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for public safety performance grants to implement these strategies. The Attorney General may provide Phase 1 grants to eligible entities to analyze and improve the cost-effectiveness of State and local spending on prisons, jails, and community corrections by conducting a comprehensive analysis of criminal justice data and evaluating relevant policies and spending. The Attorney General provides Phase 1 grants to analyze and improve cost-effectiveness of State and local spending on corrections. The analysis includes crime data, felony conviction rates, and prison admission data to develop data-driven policy options for public safety and offender accountability. The curr_chunk discusses analyzing probation and parole data to identify offenders violating supervision conditions and being revoked to prison or jail. It also includes evaluating crime prevention programs like drug treatment, mental health, and job training to reduce recidivism among offenders on community supervision. Consultation with criminal justice stakeholders is also mentioned. The curr_chunk focuses on analyzing criminal justice policies, expenditures, and developing policy options to increase public safety, improve offender accountability, reduce recidivism, and manage spending on corrections. The curr_chunk discusses the application process for receiving grants under the criminal justice system, with a priority given to entities showing commitment from various officials to work together. The curr_chunk outlines the need for a collaborative bipartisan approach to analyze data and develop criminal justice policy options. It also emphasizes the establishment of a multibranch, bipartisan task force to address criminal justice challenges and the importance of access to data from various parts of the criminal justice system for analysis. Additionally, it mentions the need to identify capacity for data analysis and simulation modeling for prison or jail population projections. The Attorney General may make grants for analysis, evaluation, and policy development to address prison population projections and capacity issues. Grants for implementation of policies to manage corrections spending and enhance public safety are also available. Grants must be completed within 12 months unless an extension is granted. Phase 2 grants aim to fund programs that enhance public safety by strengthening the criminal justice system, reinvesting saved prison costs, and measuring the performance of enacted policies and programs. The Phase 2 grants fund programs to strengthen the criminal justice system, provide training and technical assistance for reducing recidivism, implementing risk assessment tools, and validating evidence-based policies in corrections agencies. The Phase 2 grants aim to establish risk-reduction programs in corrections agencies, including substance abuse or mental health treatment, education, job training, job placement, intermediate sanction programs, and supportive housing. The goal is to reduce rearrests, reconvictions, and revocations of individuals on probation and parole while increasing successful completions. The Phase 2 grants aim to establish risk-reduction programs in corrections agencies to reduce rearrests, reconvictions, and revocations of individuals on probation and parole. Performance measures will track key criminal justice trends to measure the impact of these programs. The Phase 2 grants focus on reducing rearrests, reconvictions, and revocations for individuals on probation and parole. Eligible entities must submit applications outlining how the grant will meet the required objectives. Priority consideration is given to applications demonstrating effectiveness in achieving these goals. The Phase 2 grants aim to improve public safety and accountability in the criminal justice system by incarcerating violent offenders, supervising nonviolent offenders effectively, and integrating diversion and reentry programs. The Attorney General will report annually to Congress on the development and implementation of grants under this section, including information on grantees, progress in program development, and recipients of analyses and program development grants. The Attorney General will report annually to Congress on the progress of grantees in implementing criminal justice reinvestment strategies, including data on reductions in rearrests, reconvictions, and prison populations, as well as increases in successful completions of probation and parole. The Attorney General will establish an information clearinghouse for data and best practices from eligible grantees. Applications for grants will be considered on a rolling basis to assist policymakers. $35,000,000 is authorized for this section annually. The Attorney General will establish an information clearinghouse for data and best practices from eligible grantees, with $35,000,000 appropriated annually for fiscal years 2010 through 2014."
