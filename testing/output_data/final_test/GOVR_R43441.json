    "content": "On January 9, 2014, officials in West Virginia discovered a significant chemical leak of 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) and glycol ethers from a storage tank owned by Freedom Industries. The leak contaminated the Elk River, leading to a \"do not use\" order for over 300,000 customers in nine counties. Officials responded to a chemical leak in West Virginia by sampling and testing for the chemical, providing water supply to affected citizens, and following CDC recommendations to lift the ban on tap water. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board investigated the incident to prevent future occurrences, sparking public and congressional interest. Several concerns emerged from oversight hearings by House and Senate committees following a chemical leak incident in West Virginia. Calls for more robust inspections and controls at chemical storage facilities were made, along with efforts to enhance spill containment, leak detection, and training requirements for personnel. Federal regulations for aboveground storage tanks were found to be lacking, with requirements for prevention and preparedness only applying to tanks containing oil. The chemical leak incident in West Virginia raised questions about the enforcement of regulatory requirements for tanks storing hazardous substances. Concerns were also raised about the lack of information on the toxicity of leaked chemicals and the adequacy of chemical testing requirements. Facilities storing hazardous chemicals are required by federal law to report releases exceeding established quantities. Many have called for more effective accident prevention for chemical storage tanks, including inspections to prevent structural failure. Recommendations include greater attention to protecting water sources from pollution. Two bills have been introduced in response to the chemical spill: S. 1961, the Chemical Safety and Preparedness Act, and H.R. 4024, the Ensuring Access to Clean Water Act of 2014. The Water Act of 2014, introduced by Representative Capito on February 10, describes and analyzes S. 1961 and H.R. 4024. Both bills aim to create a new chemical release prevention and response program following the West Virginia spill, with S. 1961 amending the Safe Drinking Water Act and H.R. 4024 amending the Clean Water Act. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported S. 1961 on July 31, 2014, with new terms, definitions, and added details. S. 1961 would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to establish a chemical storage tank surface water protection program, requiring states or the EPA to oversee and inspect chemical storage tanks to prevent releases into public water systems. States have two years to implement the program, with the option for EPA to step in if needed. S. 1961 would establish a chemical storage tank surface water protection program, requiring states or EPA to oversee and inspect tanks to prevent releases into public water systems. States have two years to implement the program, with EPA stepping in if necessary. The bill outlines minimum requirements for tank programs and assistance from EPA, but does not provide funding for state administration. S. 1961 focuses on chemical storage tanks, defining \"chemical\" as hazardous substances under various environmental acts. The bill shifts focus from facilities to tanks, including aboveground bulk containers posing a risk to public water systems. The bill S. 1961 focuses on regulating chemical storage tanks, specifically those that pose a risk to public water systems. It defines \"chemical\" as hazardous substances and includes requirements for design, construction, and maintenance of covered tanks. States or the EPA have the authority to adopt additional exclusions based on federal or state laws or if a tank is determined not to pose a risk to public water systems. The bill S. 1961 focuses on regulating chemical storage tanks, specifically those that pose a risk to public water systems. It covers requirements for design, construction, and maintenance standards, leak detection, spill and overfill control, inventory control, emergency response plan, training, tank integrity inspections, corrosion protection, and financial responsibility. Inspections are required annually for high hazard tanks, once every three years for tanks in a source water assessment area, and every five years for other tanks. The bill also requires CSTSWP programs to be implemented and enforced in accordance with SDWA. The bill S. 1961 focuses on regulating chemical storage tanks, specifically those that pose a risk to public water systems. It covers requirements for design, construction, and maintenance standards, leak detection, spill and overfill control, inventory control, emergency response plan, training, tank integrity inspections, corrosion protection, and financial responsibility. The bill also requires CSTSWP programs to be implemented and enforced in accordance with SDWA, subject to federal enforcement authorities, monitoring, recordkeeping requirements, judicial review, citizens' civil actions, and other provisions. The Senate bill would authorize EPA or a state to issue corrective action orders and make facility owners or operators liable for costs incurred by EPA or a state for response actions taken under the new regulations. Proposed Section 1745 of the bill would require an inspection and necessary measures before transferring a facility. Section 1476 mandates states or EPA to provide public water systems with information on emergency response plans and chemical inventories for storage tanks in the same watershed. Additionally, information on the toxicity of stored chemicals and safeguards to limit impacts must be provided upon request. S. 1961 and H.R. 4024 would require submission of emergency response plans to EPA and DHS. Public water system owners could take legal action for endangerment. Both bills mandate a chemical storage facility source water protection program to safeguard domestic water sources. The bill aims to protect navigable waters designated for domestic water sources by requiring states or EPA to administer a chemical storage tank surface water protection program. Minimum requirements for state programs are similar in both S. 1961 and H.R. 4024, with the Senate bill calling for inspection of covered chemical storage tanks and the House bill for inspection of aboveground storage tanks. S. 1961 would require annual inspections for \"high hazard\" storage tanks, while the House bill lacks a similar provision. EPA could offer technical assistance to states under S. 1961, but neither bill mandates EPA to issue regulations or requires state program submission for approval. The bills require states or EPA to oversee a chemical storage facility source water protection program. Both bills allow for corrective action orders to be issued by EPA or states for non-compliance. Owners of covered facilities or public water systems can take legal action to address endangerment to water system users. Owners of chemical storage facilities are liable for response costs. The proposed new CWA Title VII holds owners of covered chemical storage facilities liable for response costs, but it is unclear what this provision refers to. Both bills include provisions for transfer of ownership and emergency response plans, with S. 1961 specifying criteria for inspections and immediate notice of releases to water systems. Both bills require immediate notice of releases to water systems and sharing of emergency response plans and chemical inventories. S. 1961 specifies criteria for inspections and allows states to adopt standards. Both bills allow states to adopt more stringent standards for chemical storage facilities. H.R. 4024 explicitly permits this, conforming to CWA Section 510, while S. 1961 specifies implementation in accordance with the SDWA. Despite similarities, H.R. 4024 has numerous differences. H.R. 4024 contains differences from the Senate bill, focusing on protecting navigable waters designated for domestic water sources. The bill applies to chemical releases posing risks to designated domestic water supplies, aligning with CWA jurisdictional reach. States set water quality standards, including designated uses and pollutant limits. The bill, H.R. 4024, focuses on protecting navigable waters designated for domestic water sources by setting limits on pollutants. It aligns with the Clean Water Act's jurisdictional reach and aims to address chemical releases that pose risks to designated domestic water supplies. States establish water quality standards, including designated uses and pollutant limits. The new chemical storage facility program will be carried out by states with primary authority to issue CWA discharge permits. Forty-six states are authorized by EPA to implement CWA responsibilities, while EPA retains core responsibilities in states like Idaho, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New Mexico. S. 1961 applies to states with primary enforcement authority for public water systems under the SDWA, directing EPA to implement programs in certain areas. H.R. 4024 does not include similar provisions. H.R. 4024 and S. 1961 differ in requirements for chemical storage tanks. H.R. 4024 defines aboveground storage tanks based on capacity and proximity to water sources, while S. 1961 leaves determinations to states or EPA. Both bills exclude tanks subject to spill prevention measures under CWA Section 311(j)(1). The House bill, H.R. 4024, and S. 1961 differ in defining chemical storage tanks. H.R. 4024 excludes tanks storing oil and mandates EPA to survey state programs. Civil penalties up to $15,000 per day are imposed for violations by owners or operators. The legislation imposes civil penalties not exceeding $15,000 per day for violations by owners or operators of covered chemical storage facilities. The bill's requirements would be subject to existing SDWA enforcement provisions, with civil penalties not exceeding $25,000 per day for each violation. The spill from chemical storage tanks in West Virginia has sparked debate over regulations at federal and state levels. Proposed bills suggest state-led oversight programs for these facilities, with S. 1961 requiring federal intervention if states do not act. No additional funds would be provided to states for program development. Neither bill proposes additional funds for states to support the oversight program for chemical storage facilities. Resource-limited states may struggle to meet requirements without extra funding. Options for funding state programs include grants and fees. S. 1961 does not address the resources EPA may need if many states do not implement the program. Both bills aim to close the gap of not having an existing inventory by requiring states to develop their own. The bills require each state to develop its own inventory of chemical storage facilities and tanks, giving states and the EPA flexibility to determine which facilities to include. Some argue that a federal legislative response to the Elk River chemical spill should wait for more information and gap assessments. An assessment of gaps in environmental laws and regulations has been conducted to address chemical storage facility incidents. Some stakeholders prefer states to lead in developing programs for this issue. The Administration's stance on legislation for chemical spills is currently unknown."
