After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to focus on these programs. The assistance programs aim to enhance state, local, and non-federal government entities' homeland security and emergency management capabilities. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has administered various assistance programs through different offices or agencies within the department due to congressional and departmental actions. Policy questions have been raised regarding homeland security assistance programs, including the purpose, funding distribution, and eligibility criteria. These questions have not been fully addressed despite Congress enacting legislation for homeland security assistance since 1997. Members of Congress, former President Bush's administration personnel, and President Barack Obama have all questioned various aspects of these programs. The federal government's role in providing homeland security assistance has raised policy questions regarding funding distribution and oversight. The House Homeland Security Committee prioritizes oversight of DHS grants for the 111th Congress to anticipate potential security crises and establish proactive policies. This report summarizes the development of assistance programs, current programs provided by DHS, and discusses key policy issues. The federal government began providing counter-terrorism assistance to states and localities after the 1993 World Trade Center and 1995 Alfred P. Murrah federal building bombings. Homeland security assistance expanded post-9/11 with the establishment of DHS in 2002. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program provided financial aid to over 150 U.S. cities. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program (NLD) provided financial assistance to 157 major U.S. cities, focusing on helping first responders prepare for terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. The Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to administer assistance programs enhancing state and local emergency response capabilities. Cities received funding, training, and equipment for personal protection, decontamination, and detection. The Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) administered training and exercises for cities based on state assessments, ending in 2001. ODP was transferred to DHS in 2002 under the Homeland Security Act. Programs were initially under the Border and Transportation Security Directorate, then moved to FEMA in 2004 due to criticism. After Hurricane Katrina, programs were transferred to the National Preparedness Directorate, now managed by the Grants Program Directorate (GPD) within FEMA. The Grants Program Directorate (GPD) within FEMA is now the primary entity responsible for managing DHS assistance to states and localities for preparing, responding to, and recovering from disasters. Legislative actions like P.L. 110-53 have authorized and mandated allocation methodologies for DHS grants. DHS has expanded assistance programs from 8 in FY2003 to 15 in FY2010. The Administration requested funding for these programs in the FY2011 budget. The Administration requested funding for 15 programs in FY2010, but in the FY2011 budget request, funding was requested for only eight programs. The Department of Homeland Security administers 14 programs and activities, with no information available on the Center for Counterterrorism and Cyber Crime Program. The report uses DHS and congressional documents to summarize the programs, which are not categorized as terrorism preparedness or all-hazards preparedness. The classification is based on examination of DHS grant guidance documents. The grant program categorization is based on eligible activities or DHS goals. Seven out of 15 programs could be seen as terrorism preparedness. The State Homeland Security Grant Program aids in preparing for terrorist attacks, requiring an approved homeland security strategy for funding. Eligible activities include equipment purchase, training, and exercises. The State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) provide funding for specialized equipment, training, and exercises to protect critical infrastructure. All states, DC, and Puerto Rico are guaranteed a minimum allocation of 0.36% of total appropriations for SHSGP and UASI, while U.S. insular areas are guaranteed 0.08%. DHS conducts a risk assessment to determine grant recipient allocations before distribution. UASI funds can be used by designated urban areas for homeland security equipment, exercises, and first responder overtime costs. The Transportation Security Grant Program (TSGP) provides funding to high-threat and high-risk urban areas to enhance security measures, including first responder overtime costs, training, and equipment. DHS conducts vulnerability and threat assessments to categorize metropolitan areas into Tier I and Tier II based on risk levels, with Tier I areas receiving more funding. Funding allocations are determined by risk analysis and anticipated effectiveness. The Transportation Security Grant Program (TSGP) provides funding to high-threat urban areas for bus, rail, and ferry security. States can apply for funding, which must be used for transit systems. DHS assesses risk to determine eligible agencies. TSGP includes funding for Freight Rail Security and Intercity Passenger Rail. The Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) funds port protection from terrorism, enhancing risk management, awareness, training, and counter-terrorism capabilities. Eligible applicants are owners and operators of federally regulated terminals and facilities. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides funding through various grant programs for security measures in high-threat urban areas, including bus, rail, ferry, and port security. Eligible applicants for these grants include owners and operators of federally regulated terminals, facilities, and passenger vessels, as well as port authorities and state and local agencies. Risk and vulnerability assessments are conducted to determine funding eligibility, with ports categorized into Tier I, Tier II, Tier III, or \"All Other Port Areas.\" Intercity Bus Security Grant Program (IBSGP) funds security activities for intercity bus systems, including planning, security enhancements, and vehicle and driver protection. The Buffer Zone Protection Program (BZPP) provides funding and assistance to enhance security capabilities of critical infrastructure like chemical facilities, financial institutions, and stadiums. States with pre-designated BZPP sites are eligible applicants. DHS determines BZPP sites based on risk assessments. The Driver's License Security Grant Program (DLSGP) also offers funding for security measures. The Driver's License Security Grant Program (DLSGP) provides funding to prevent terrorism, reduce fraud, and improve the reliability of state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards. Eight of the 15 programs administered by GPD focus on all-hazards preparedness, including the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program which also addresses terrorism preparedness. The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) provides funding and federal assistance to 124 highly populated jurisdictions for all-hazard response capabilities. This includes planning, training, exercises, and acquiring pharmaceuticals and protective equipment. The DHS Secretary determines jurisdictions based on population and evenly divides the annual MMRS appropriation. Increased capability to respond to WMD events also enhances response to epidemic outbreaks and natural disasters. The FIRE program awards grants to fire departments to enhance their abilities in responding to fires and fire-related hazards. It supports departments lacking necessary tools and resources for public and firefighter safety, providing funds for firefighter safety, fire prevention, emergency medical services, and firefighting vehicle acquisition. Award decisions are based on application merits and community needs, with no set formula for distribution. Eligible departments can apply for grants through a multi-level review process. The Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPGP) provides funding to enhance catastrophic incident preparedness in high-risk urban areas receiving UASI funding. The program supports regional all-hazard planning for catastrophic events, with funding allocated based on assessed risk and anticipated effectiveness. Funding decisions are made by the DHS Secretary, with 11 urban areas designated to receive funding in FY2010. The Citizen Corps Program (CCP) coordinates volunteer organizations to make communities safe and prepared for emergencies. It includes Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and other volunteer services. States, DC, and Puerto Rico receive a minimum of 0.75% of CCP funding, while insular areas get 0.25%. The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program (EMPG) helps improve state and local emergency management capabilities. It supports measurable results in key areas. The EMPG funding supports emergency management activities such as personnel costs, training, and supplies. States, DC, and Puerto Rico are guaranteed a minimum of 0.75% of funding, while insular areas receive 0.25%. The PSIC Grant Program provides assistance for improving interoperable communications during emergencies. The Emergency Operations Center Grant Program (EOC) provides funding and assistance to states and localities for developing and enhancing their emergency operations centers and improving their unified command capabilities. Funding may be used for equipping, upgrading, and constructing EOCs. The Grant Programs Directorate (GPD), within FEMA, conducts research and development through its Equipment Acquisition and Support Program within SHSGP. The Equipment Acquisition and Support Program offers assistance to federal, state, and local entities on equipment issues like testing, standards, and identifying new equipment needs. Technical support is aimed at state and local agencies to improve their ability in terrorism and disaster preparedness. GPD administers and funds various programs including training, exercises, risk assessments, and homeland security strategies. The table provides legal citations for grant programs related to homeland security assistance for states and localities. Debate continues on policy questions, with some addressed in legislation like P.L. 110-53. Congressional committees have conducted hearings on this issue, and there may be a need for further oversight by the 111th Congress. The 111th Congress plans to conduct oversight hearings and legislate on policy issues related to DHS assistance to states and localities. Key issues include the purpose and number of assistance programs, funding allocation, and program distribution methodology. Some argue that the current programs may not adequately address all hazards and coordination challenges, prompting discussions on program consolidation for improved domestic security. An all-hazards assistance program like EMPG allows funding for preparing, responding to, and recovering from various emergencies, including man-made and natural disasters. The NGA advocates for preserving an all-hazards approach to preparedness. Terrorism preparedness programs like SHSGP focus on funding activities for terrorist incidents. Despite natural disasters being more common, most homeland security funding is allocated to terrorism preparedness programs. Security assistance funding for states and localities is primarily allocated to programs preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks. In FY2010, $4.16 billion was appropriated, with $2.55 billion (60%) targeted for terrorism-focused programs. Despite concerns post-9/11, DHS provides separate natural disaster assistance programs like FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the differences between preparing for natural disasters and terrorist attacks. While emergency response capabilities for both types of disasters are similar in terms of response and recovery activities, they differ in preparedness. Preparing for a natural disaster involves functions like planning evacuations and stockpiling supplies, while preparing for a terrorist attack includes activities like installing security barriers and conducting counter-intelligence. Legislation and presidential directives address these distinct preparedness needs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the emphasis on terrorism preparedness in legislation and presidential directives following the September 2001 attacks. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) prioritized terrorism preparedness in distributing funding to states and localities in FY2009. DHS uses terrorism risk as a primary factor in assessments and considers terrorism preparedness a core mission. The 111th Congress may need to address the increase in state and local assistance programs administered by DHS, which grew from 8 programs in FY2002 to 15 in FY2010. Total funding for homeland security assistance programs has averaged $3.8 billion annually over the past seven years. The funding for homeland security assistance programs has averaged $3.8 billion annually over the past seven years. In FY2009, the largest funding amount was $4.92 billion for 17 programs. Congress appropriated $4.16 billion for 15 assistance programs in FY2010. The increase in grant programs from FY2002 may be due to targeting funds for future homeland security threats. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted in September 2003 that DHS's grant system was fragmented, hindering coordination and integration at state and local levels. The expansion of terrorism preparedness programs in homeland security grant programs reflects the federal government's priority, while states and localities may prioritize natural and accidental disasters. The DHS Inspector General found FEMA grants to be redundant and inefficiently coordinated. The administration's discretion in adding programs may focus homeland security efforts on specific national needs, with an emphasis on terrorism preparedness programs. The DHS and administration did not request the development of all new grant programs, such as the bus security program. Congress appropriated funding for the bus security program in FY2005, despite no request from the Administration. Administration officials have requested the consolidation of grant programs, like the Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program (TIPP) in FY2007. TIPP was meant to consolidate six infrastructure security grant programs, but Congress did not appropriate the programs through TIPP. Congress may want to consider continuing funding for the current number of terrorism preparedness programs. Increasing funding for all-hazards programs like the Emergency Management Performance Grant program and the Metropolitan Medical Response System could address state and local criticism of fragmented and uncoordinated disaster response. This could be achieved by reallocating funds from terrorism preparedness programs. If program funding is decreased, states and localities may struggle to meet their terrorism preparedness needs. Congress could consider allowing terrorism preparedness programs to be used for all-hazards preparedness, response, and recovery, providing more flexibility in addressing homeland security needs. Additionally, establishing block grant programs could streamline administration and funding for various programs. The curr_chunk suggests the development of an all-hazards and terrorism preparedness block grant program administered by GPD to prioritize homeland security needs. This would provide greater flexibility in grant funding usage and address grant coordination issues. Congress may also need to evaluate the effectiveness of DHS's assistance to states and localities. DHS has not completed an evaluation of how states and localities have spent past homeland security program allocations. Prior to establishing preparedness benchmarks for future funding, an evaluation of current funding usage is necessary. Grant recipients submit implementation plans for annual homeland security grant allocations, but it is unclear if the funding has effectively enhanced national security. FEMA reports on national planning and state integration have been directed by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano. In early 2009, GPD conducted an evaluation called Cost-to-Capability (C2C) to measure grant recipients' disaster response abilities. The evaluation aimed to help GPD administer DHS grant programs effectively, but GAO raised concerns about the validity of input data based on state and local self-assessments. The GAO criticized the C2C evaluation as a limited national capability assessment tool due to analysts' limited skills and experience. DHS's monitoring of homeland security grant spending was deemed inadequate for measuring program outcomes. FEMA's Deputy Administrator stated that C2C data provided limited information on investment in preparedness activities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) conducted a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) in 2008 for some of DHS's grants to states and localities, rating them as adequate overall. However, independent evaluations questioned the effectiveness of the programs in enhancing homeland security capabilities. States and localities have increased homeland security equipment, planning, and training post-9/11. Critics view the PART as political, shifting power to the President and lacking stakeholder consultation. Observers debate the effectiveness of the PART tool in assessing program effectiveness. DHS's OIG identified areas for improvement in state and urban area management of homeland security grant programs. The DHS's OIG identified areas for improvement in state and urban area management of homeland security grant programs, including questioned costs, monitoring, oversight, program goals, and needs assessment. FEMA was reported to have issues with consistent execution of financial and program monitoring activities. Legislative barriers to FEMA grant coordination were also highlighted, such as similar grant goals, disparate objectives, and congressional earmarks. Congress may require DHS to refine the assessment process with less emphasis on state and local self-assessments. The DHS OIG identified areas for improvement in state and urban area management of homeland security grant programs, including questioned costs, monitoring, oversight, program goals, and needs assessment. Congress may require DHS to establish individual grant recipient benchmarks for homeland security grant funding instead of national benchmarks. If the current assessment tool is found inadequate, Congress could mandate DHS to develop a new tool that relies less on state and locality self-assessments and more on collaboration with grant recipients. DHS may collaborate with grant recipients to develop a more accurate preparedness assessment tool, potentially delaying the establishment of a national baseline and benchmarks. The tool could include a risk assessment for all states and territories, evaluating terrorism, natural, and man-made disaster risks, as well as the ability to meet Target Capabilities List. Congress may consider this option for improving homeland security grant programs. The evaluation of the TCL is an option for Congress to consider if the C2C is deemed inadequate in measuring state and local preparedness. A policy issue related to homeland grant programs is the eligibility of entities and jurisdictions for federal homeland security assistance. There are 11 grant programs in FY2010 with different eligible recipients and determination processes, with seven using risk assessment for recipient eligibility. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses different risk assessment processes for various grant programs, potentially causing confusion and duplication of effort for jurisdictions eligible for multiple grants. Critics argue that these methods do not adequately assess risk, vulnerability, and consequences, leading to some jurisdictions with genuine homeland security needs being ineligible for funding. Congress may need to address how DHS determines grant recipients to ensure fair distribution of funds. Congress may need to address how DHS determines grant recipients to ensure fair distribution of funds and consider the continuity of federal support for homeland security programs in light of limited financial resources. In the past eight years, Congress has allocated $34 billion for state and local homeland security assistance, with funding ranging from $1.43 billion to $4.9 billion annually. Despite some programs receiving increased funding in FY2010, there are debates on whether Congress should reduce or eliminate funding for these programs. Some argue for reducing funding for new homeland security projects, suggesting states and localities should take on more responsibility. However, maintaining current funding levels is important due to evolving terrorism threats and natural disasters. If DHS cannot assess state and local capabilities, cutting funding prematurely may lead to unmet security needs. Some argue for increasing funding for homeland security due to rising natural disasters and evolving threats. Congress is focused on distributing grant program funding to ensure state and local homeland security, with attention on SHSGP and UASI allocations based on risk assessment. The debate over homeland security funding allocation focuses on the use of population as a key factor in grant distribution methodologies. Critics, including the 9/11 Commission, recommend allocating all assistance based solely on risk. While P.L. 110-53 guarantees a minimum amount of funding to states, some argue it does not fully meet the 9/11 Commission's recommendation. Others argue that the allocation of SHSGP and UASI funds based on risk aligns with the Commission's goals. The 9/11 Commission recommended that homeland security assistance should be based solely on risk, not population. President Obama also supported this approach. Congress may need to reconsider how DHS allocates funding, moving towards a risk-based allocation system, which could result in some jurisdictions receiving limited or no funding. The 9/11 Commission and President Obama recommended that homeland security assistance should be based on risk rather than population. Congress may need to reconsider DHS funding allocation to move towards a risk-based system, potentially resulting in some jurisdictions receiving limited or no funding. The 111th Congress should consider policy issues such as the purpose of assistance programs, evaluation of grant funding use, determination of eligible recipients, funding amounts, and distribution methodologies. This report highlights the need for ongoing debate and potential legislation on these issues. The 111th Congress may need to continue debating and considering legislation on federal homeland security assistance for states and localities, focusing on how funding is allocated. The House Homeland Security Committee intends to oversee and legislate on these issues, with a need to anticipate and react to future disasters. Congress should pay attention to potential issues that are significant enough to merit their attention."
