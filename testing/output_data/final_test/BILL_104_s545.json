    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of 1995\". The Congress finds that out-of-State firms often do not collect and remit State and local sales taxes, leading to consumers unknowingly incurring tax liabilities. Congress aims to protect consumers from misrepresentations of tax obligations. Small businesses face unfair competition when out-of-State firms do not collect and remit State and local sales taxes, depriving governments of needed revenue and leading to tax increases on taxpayers. The Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota that State governments can impose tax obligations on out-of-State firms that solicit sales from residents. The Federal Government has a duty to assist State and local governments in collecting sales taxes from out-of-State firms. SEC. 3. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX. A State can require a person to collect and remit State and local sales taxes on tangible personal property if the property is destined for the State, the person meets certain sales thresholds, and the State administers all local sales taxes. States must collect both State and local sales taxes on tangible personal property if the final destination is within the State or local jurisdiction. Aggregation rules apply to treat related persons as one entity for tax purposes. SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES. Local sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions of a State will be considered uniform and collected under this Act if they are imposed at the same rate and on identical transactions statewide. Additionally, if these local sales taxes on out-of-State sales are collected and administered by the State, they will be deemed uniform. Border jurisdiction tax rates adjustments will not affect a State's compliance with these requirements. Local sales taxes can be adjusted to match bordering State rates or exempt transactions that are tax-exempt in the bordering State. Nonuniform local sales taxes must be collected under specific options. Any person collecting nonuniform local sales taxes must choose to collect all applicable taxes in the State. The in-lieu fee option allows for a uniform fee in place of nonuniform local sales taxes in the State. The fee rate is determined based on the ratio of total nonuniform local sales tax revenues to total State sales tax revenues, multiplied by the State sales tax rate. Local sales taxes are distributed to local jurisdictions based on uniform or nonuniform taxes collected. Nonuniform local sales taxes are those that do not meet certain requirements. Uniform local sales taxes are distributed based on the proportion each jurisdiction receives, while in-lieu fees are determined by the ratio of total nonuniform local sales tax revenues to total State sales tax revenues. The fee rate is then multiplied by the State sales tax rate. The Act outlines the distribution of local sales taxes based on uniform or nonuniform taxes collected. Nonuniform taxes are determined by the ratio of each jurisdiction's nonuniform local sales tax receipts to the total in the State. The geographical location of the transaction is also considered. Amounts are calculated based on the most recent State fiscal year data and distributed according to State timetables. The Act specifies the distribution of local sales taxes based on State timetables, with amounts distributed according to State law. A transition rule applies to States with existing laws on tax distribution until the 91st day after the adjournment of the next legislative session. Taxes collected before this rule applies will be distributed as per State law. The Act specifies the distribution of local sales taxes based on State timetables, with amounts distributed according to State law. If a State law allows local sales taxes to be collected by elected State officers, then the State can collect and remit only State sales taxes and the uniform portion of local sales taxes under this Act. Local sales taxes collected under this Act can be distributed according to State law. SEC. 5 of the Act outlines return and remittance requirements, stating that a person subject to the Act must file a return and remit tax receipts no more frequently than once per calendar quarter. The initial return and remittance must be made within 90 days of the person's first taxable transaction. Additionally, subsection (a) applies to those required to collect local sales tax or in-lieu fees under the Act. SEC. 6. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\nStates must grant all exemptions or exceptions to persons subject to this Act that are allowed to those within the State or local jurisdiction.\n\nSEC. 7. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW. SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\nPersons required to collect State or local sales tax must follow state laws, with limitations. This Act does not allow states to license or regulate individuals, require qualifications for intrastate business, or impose unrelated state taxes. The Act does not preempt state or local jurisdiction powers, except as specified. SEC. 8. TOLL-FREE INFORMATION SERVICE.\n\nStates cannot mandate collection of sales tax without providing toll-free phone service for tax information. Information must include tax rates, addresses, deadlines, penalties, forms, and instructions. The phone number must be displayed prominently. Service can be shared among states.\n\nSEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms such as compensating use tax, local sales tax, and person. The term \"person\" includes various entities such as individuals, trusts, partnerships, and corporations. Sales tax is a tax imposed on tangible personal property based on its sales price or value. The term \"State\" refers to states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth. The term \"person\" includes individuals, trusts, partnerships, and corporations. Sales tax is imposed on tangible personal property based on its sales price. The United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any US territory or possession are included.
