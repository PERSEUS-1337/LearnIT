    "content": "Violence in the home, dating back to the Roman Empire, has not changed in incidence but in visibility. Recent focus is on children witnessing domestic violence, which has harmful effects on their emotional and behavioral development. Childhood exposure to such violence is linked to behavioral and psychiatric problems. Childhood exposure to domestic violence can impact children's cognitive functioning, personality style, and impulse control. Research shows that 60-75% of families with domestic violence also have physically abused children. The 109th Congress addressed this issue with the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, focusing on assisting children and youth exposed to domestic violence. Several federal programs and initiatives have been established since 1999 to address concerns related to children who witness domestic violence. These programs include the Safe Start Program, Safe Havens for Children Program, Safe and Bright Futures for Children Initiative, and Demonstration of Enhanced Services to Children and Youth Exposed to Domestic Violence. Some of these programs are funded through the Stop Family Violence postage stamp created by the Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2001. The Stamp Out Domestic Violence Act of 2001 directed the U.S. Postal Service to issue a semi-postal stamp to fund domestic violence initiatives. The stamp was released for sale on October 8, 2003, generating $3.03 million in proceeds. The Greenbook Initiative implements guidelines for responding to domestic violence and child maltreatment. The Safe Start Program is part of federal assistance programs addressing these issues. The Safe Start Program, authorized by the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, was created in response to high levels of violence in 1998 affecting children. President Bill Clinton initiated the Children Exposed to Violence Initiative, sponsored by the DOJ and directed by Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder. A National Summit on Children Exposed to Violence was held on June 22, 1999, with 150 practitioners and policymakers in attendance to establish a national blueprint for action. $10 million of the $283 million Violence Against Women Act appropriation provided to the DOJ in FY1999 was designated for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency. The Safe Start Program, funded with $10 million from the DOJ, aimed to prevent family and community violence impact on young children and their families. Eligible applicants had to be collaborative groups of public and private organizations working together to address the issue. The Safe Start Program, funded by the DOJ, aimed to prevent the impact of violence on young children. Collaborative groups worked together to create services for children exposed to violence, develop effective procedures, and expand community partnerships. The goal was to establish a service delivery system to improve access and quality of services for at-risk children. The Safe Start Demonstration Project focused on addressing issues such as mental health, early childhood education, child welfare, substance abuse prevention, and domestic violence crisis interventions. It involved 11 sites, including urban, rural, and tribal communities, to help young children exposed to violence. The Safe Start Demonstration Project aimed to help children exposed to violence, with a focus on infants to 18-year-olds. Phase II, called Safe Start Promising Approaches, targets children at the greatest risk of harm from violence, particularly infants to six-year-olds and their families. The Safe Start Promising Approaches grants, funded by DOJ in 2005 with $6.2 million, aimed to support children exposed to various forms of violence. 15 community sites were awarded grants to provide services for children who experienced domestic violence, violent crime, assault, and child abuse until 2009. The Safe Start Promising Approaches program aims to reduce the harmful effects of intimate partner violence on children in various cities across the US. OJJDP awarded $996,721 to the Rand Corporation for a national evaluation of the program to identify best practices for helping children exposed to violence. Congress allocated $10 million for the Safe Start Program from FY1999 to FY2006. The Safe Start Program received $10 million in funding from FY1999 to FY2006. The program was not proposed for FY2007 as it was considered to have achieved its goals. Funding for Safe Start was included in the STOP grant program in FY2006. The Safe Start Program, funded from FY1999 to FY2006, received $10 million. The program was not proposed for FY2007 as it was deemed successful. Funding for Safe Start was integrated into the STOP grant program in FY2006. The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 was amended in 2000 to establish the Safe Havens for Children Pilot Program, providing supervised visitation for children in situations of domestic violence and child abuse. The Safe Havens for Children Program, also known as the Supervised Visitation Program, was reauthorized under the Violence Against Women Act in 2006. It aims to protect children and parents from domestic violence during visitation exchanges. The Safe Havens for Children Program, administered by DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women, aims to support supervised visits and safe exchanges for children in situations involving domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and stalking. Grants are available to states, tribal governments, and local units of government to carry out the program's provisions. The law requires the Attorney General to set aside funds for tribal governments and organizations, with a portion allocated for evaluation and monitoring. The Safe Havens for Children Program, administered by DOJ's Office on Violence Against Women, provides grants for supervised visits and safe exchanges for children in situations involving domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, and stalking. Grantees can use up to 3% of funds for administrative costs and up to 8% for technical assistance and training. Training must be provided by nationally recognized groups. Funding for the program does not require a match, but grantees are encouraged to contribute supplemental contributions. Congress initially authorized $15 million for this program in FY2001. The Safe Havens program, funded by Congress, provides grants for supervised visits and safe exchanges for children in domestic violence situations. Funding history shows appropriations from FY2002 to FY2007, with a requirement to reserve funds for Indian tribes and organizations. The program operates under a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. The Safe and Bright Futures for Children Initiative (SBFC) was established in 2004 by HHS to assist children and youth who witness domestic violence. Administered by the HHS Office of Public Health and Science, the program aims to reduce the harmful impact of violence on children and end the cycle of domestic violence. The SBFC Initiative, established by HHS in 2004, aims to create a coordinated system of services for children exposed to domestic violence. Funding for the program comes from Stop Family Violence postage stamp proceeds, with two phases planned for implementation. Phase I involves strategic planning to develop a service system for children and youth affected by domestic violence. The SBFC Initiative, funded by Stop Family Violence postage stamp proceeds, awarded competitive grants to 22 communities for strategic planning to support children exposed to domestic violence. Phase two was canceled due to lower revenue than expected. Grantees were to evaluate their programs at the end of the two-year grant period. Applicants for grants had to be public or private nonprofit entities serving children. The SBFC Initiative awarded grants to communities to support children exposed to domestic violence. Grantees had to establish a system to care for these children and prove their connection to a DOJ-sponsored Family Justice Center. The Family Justice Center Initiative aimed to provide comprehensive services to domestic violence victims in one location. The President's Family Justice Center Initiative was created to offer comprehensive services for domestic violence victims in one location, including medical care, counseling, social services, law enforcement, housing, and employment assistance. The DOJ led a $20 million program to support 12 communities across the nation in developing the initiative. Family Justice Centers now operate in various cities nationwide, providing enhanced services for children and youth exposed to domestic violence to help them lead healthy, nonviolent, and safe lives. The Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) authorizes grants to create opportunities for children exposed to domestic violence to lead healthy, nonviolent, and safe lives as adults. Grants are awarded for demonstration programs providing interventions and services for these children when funds exceed $130 million in a fiscal year. FVP grants have not exceeded $130 million, with funding levels for FY2004 at $125,648,000, FY2005 at $125,630,000, and FY2006 at $124,731,000. Funding for children exposed to domestic violence through FVPSA has been limited. However, a funding opportunity arose through the Stop Family Violence postage stamp. Eligible applicants for grants include state governments, federally recognized tribal governments, and nonprofits, excluding higher education institutions. Faith-based and community-based groups can also apply for grants. Collaboration among eligible applicants is required for the demonstration program. Eligible applicants for grants must collaborate with state domestic violence coalitions and organizations managing family violence programs. Collaboration may involve child welfare agencies or Indian tribal groups. Other nonprofit groups or public agencies can participate if they have experience with domestic violence impact on children. Demonstration grantees and service programs must address issues like ensuring no stigma for participants and not defining exposure to domestic violence as child abuse. The program and services aim to provide linguistically and culturally competent support for children exposed to domestic violence. Funding of $1.1 million was received for 11 projects awarded in September 2005. In September 2005, 11 projects were awarded grants of about $130,000 each for a three-year period. The program received $2.3 million from postage stamp proceeds, with $700,000 remaining to be spent. Applicants must participate in program evaluation efforts. The Greenbook provides recommendations for effective intervention in domestic violence and child maltreatment cases. The Greenbook is a list of recommendations developed by an expert committee to assist in serving families experiencing violence. It aims to hold batterers accountable and protect non-abusing parents. The guidelines were published in 1999 and serve as a structure for the federal demonstration initiative called the Greenbook Initiative, funded by components of the DOJ. Since FY2001, six communities have been funded through the federal Greenbook Demonstration Initiative: Santa Clara County, California; San Francisco, California; Lane County, Oregon; El Paso County, Colorado; St. Louis County, Missouri; and Grafton County, New Hampshire. Funding is provided for the sites, a national evaluation, and technical assistance by various components of DOJ and HHS. The Greenbook Demonstration Initiative funded six communities with $1.05 million each over five years for implementing guidelines. An interim evaluation report showed progress in moving from planning to implementation phase, with the next phase aiming to provide measurable evidence of changes in dependency courts, child welfare, and domestic violence service agencies. The Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 reauthorized the Safe Havens for Children program and created new programs for youth victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Grants are awarded to eligible entities to assist youth victims, including nonprofit groups, community-based organizations, and tribal organizations.
