    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Whirling Disease Response Act of 1995\". Congress acknowledges the decline of rainbow trout populations in the Madison River due to whirling disease, a parasite causing deformities in trout. This has led to a significant decrease in fish numbers, impacting the stability of wild trout populations. Recognizing the economic and recreational importance of cold water sport fisheries, resources are needed to mitigate and control the spread of whirling disease. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service is the Federal agency with expertise to collaborate with Montana in studying and addressing whirling disease in trout populations. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana, is the appropriate office to assist the State in testing fish affected by whirling disease. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana is the appropriate office for testing fish affected by whirling disease. SEC. 3. WHIRLING DISEASE REPORT. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will submit a preliminary report to Congress within 180 days of this Act, summarizing federal efforts on whirling disease and other fish parasites, identifying gaps in scientific information, and recommending management initiatives to curb the spread of these diseases in rivers. The Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service will submit a final report to Congress within 3 years, identifying causes for the spread of whirling disease and fish parasites in the western US, and recommending initiatives to minimize their impacts. The US Fish and Wildlife Service will provide scientific design initiatives to help Montana and other states combat the spread of whirling disease and fish parasites in rivers, minimizing their impacts. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service will provide funds to the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana for research and testing to mitigate and control whirling disease in rivers. They will also fund the construction of a containment facility for studying fish parasites and pathogens without contaminating watersheds. SEC. 6. WHIRLING DISEASE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\nFunds will be provided for cooperative research on whirling disease and fish parasites at the Fish Technology Center in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nSEC. 7. ENNIS FISH HATCHERY.\n\nFunds will be allocated for modifications at the Ennis, Montana fish hatchery to prevent the spread of whirling disease and other fishborne diseases in the Madison River.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations will be authorized as necessary to implement this Act."
