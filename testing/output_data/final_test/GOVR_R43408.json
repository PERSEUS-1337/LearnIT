    "content": "Droughts present challenges for Congress in measuring, predicting, and responding to drought, impacting water supplies for various sectors. Federal assistance may be sought for non-agricultural water supplies during droughts, with various programs created by Congress to aid communities, households, and wildlife habitats. These programs are managed by multiple agencies and congressional committees, with funding and usage varying widely. Current drought conditions, particularly in western states, are severe, with exceptional and extreme drought in parts of several states. The effectiveness of federal drought response programs may be tested by severe drought conditions in western states, such as California. States are primarily responsible for preparing for droughts, with some implementing water banks and transfer mechanisms. Since the 1980s, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has been leading the response to agricultural disasters, including drought-related ones. The Secretary of Agriculture declares agricultural disaster areas triggering assistance programs like FSA and SBA. Federal programs for non-agricultural water emergencies are separate and implemented by agencies like USDA Rural Utilities Service. In FY2014, grant programs allocated $1.3 billion in loans and $374 million in grants for rural water and waste systems, with priority given to systems and households affected by drought. Various agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provide emergency drought relief assistance, with additional funds potentially available through reprogramming or supplemental appropriations. Some authorized drought assistance programs are underutilized, while others operate annually, such as Reclamation's direct assistance with well construction. The Corps' drought emergency water assistance is used in limited circumstances, primarily for tribes, due to high thresholds and nonfederal funding requirements. RUS provides grants and loans for rural community and household water, tailored for emergency situations or drought-related declines in water quantity or quality. Numerous federal programs assist in reducing long-term water use in various sectors. RUS programs offer grants and loans for rural community water systems, with a focus on addressing drought-related issues. Priority may be given to projects in communities affected by droughts. Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants are also available for rural water systems facing emergencies. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) provides grants for rural water systems facing emergencies due to declining water quantity or quality. They also offer grants for refurbishing household water well systems in rural areas for individuals with low or moderate incomes. Reclamation's authorities for emergency water supplies and conservation primarily come from the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief (RSEDR) Program. The RSEDR program offers various authorities for emergency water assistance, including loans, temporary measures, water purchases, contracts, grants, and technical assistance. Assistance is available to water users, private entities, tribes, and states in the 17 western states and Hawaii. Emergency actions are provided by Reclamation at federal expense and prioritized based on need and congressional direction. Reclamation's RSEDR funding for FY2014 was $0.5 million, with some authorized activities not yet implemented. The authority for Reclamation to provide loans for nonfederal water entities to reduce drought losses has never been used. Additionally, Reclamation received $0.5 million for its drought relief program in FY2014. Other authorities exist to address hydrology variability, such as promoting water resources management preparedness through WaterSMART efforts. WaterSMART grants focus on water conservation, efficiency projects, and advanced water treatment. These grants cover a portion of project costs and are not designed for emergency response programs. The Corps (USACE) can provide emergency water supplies when state resources are overwhelmed. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) can assist with emergency water supplies when state resources are exceeded, primarily helping tribes with drinking water supplies. Funding for these activities usually comes from agency fund reprogramming. The President can also issue disaster declarations under the Stafford Act to provide federal aid in cases of drought emergencies. The infrequency of presidential domestic drought declarations increases uncertainty about when such a declaration may be made. Emergency assistance for non-agricultural water supplies during droughts is primarily provided by USDA's Rural Utilities Service, Bureau of Reclamation's Emergency Drought Relief Program, and in limited cases, the US Army Corps of Engineers. FEMA has deferred to USDA on drought declarations for the past three decades, with no specific Stafford Act sections or regulations addressing prolonged drought events. On February 14, 2014, the President announced actions to address drought conditions in California, including reprogramming funds for water conservation. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adjust operations of water resources facilities in response to droughts. Federal dams in the West provide multi-year storage for variations in precipitation but are vulnerable to sustained hydrological drought. Hydrological drought impacts federally managed water infrastructure, with limited operational changes due to multiple project purposes and legal requirements. Recent legislation expanded Reclamation's authority for drought-related operations, including participation in nonfederal groundwater banking in California and expediting environmental compliance for water transfers in the Central Valley Project. The federal government, through legislation like the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Act of 2006, works to improve drought monitoring and forecasting abilities. NIDIS coordinates drought information used by stakeholders to plan actions and investments. The U.S. Geological Survey provides drought-related water information for communities and states to plan water use and anticipate environmental impacts. The National Disaster Response Framework was used during the 2012-2013 drought, leading to the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership in 2013 to align federal drought policies. The National Drought Resilience Partnership was created in 2013 to align federal drought policies and facilitate access to drought assistance. It plays a coordinating role in federal drought response, aiming to mitigate the economic and social consequences of water supply emergencies through early actions such as water conservation measures. The partnership addresses the recurrent policy issue of effectively mitigating drought's water supply impacts. The policy issue is how to mitigate drought's water supply impacts across local, state, and federal agencies. Current programs effectiveness in preventing drought emergencies and disasters is questioned, along with concerns about duplication and waste due to fragmented authorizations. The struggle is transitioning from drought assistance to risk reduction. Rural Utilities Service administers grants and loans for rural community water systems, including those affected by drought. The program provides assistance for rural community water systems, with priority given to those affected by drought. Eligible areas must have a population of less than 10,000 residents and demonstrate a need to meet health or sanitary standards. Applicants must show inability to obtain credit at reasonable rates, and grants are given to reduce user charges based on median household income. Direct loans have interest rates of 5% or less and applications are made through state Rural Development offices. The Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 authorizes funding for rural development offices to provide assistance for rural community water and waste systems. In FY2014, $345.5 million was allocated for water and waste disposal grants, with priority given to systems affected by drought. Loan authorization levels for direct loans are $1.2 billion, loan guarantees are $50 million, and loan subsidy levels for guarantees are $355,000. Funding may also be provided through reprogramming and emergency supplemental funding. RUS administers emergency and imminent community water assistance grants for eligible communities facing a decline in water quantity or quality. Grants can be made in rural areas or small towns with specific income criteria. Eligible entities include public bodies, nonprofit corporations, and federally recognized Tribes. Grants may cover 100% of project costs, with limits on funding amounts based on project type and timeline. The program for repairs and replacement of facilities on existing systems has a funding limit of $150,000. Grants are only given to communities facing actual or imminent drinking water shortages. Applications are evaluated nationally, and the Secretary of Agriculture will act on them within 60 days. Funding must benefit rural communities with populations less than 3,000, and the program is authorized for appropriations of $35 million annually. The program for repairs and replacement of facilities on existing systems has a funding limit of $150,000. Grants are given to communities facing drinking water shortages. In February 2014, $3 million in reprogrammed funds were allocated for California's rural communities with populations less than 10,000 and median household income less than $62,883. Additional funds may become available through reprogramming and supplemental appropriations. Rural Utilities Service provides grants for lending programs to refurbish household water well systems in rural areas for individuals with low or moderate incomes. Eligibility is based on household income levels compared to the state or territory median income. Loans made with grant funds for water well systems must not exceed $11,000 with a 1% interest rate. Facilities financed must align with local development plans. Nonprofit organizations must show expertise in well-water systems to receive grants determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Assistance is provided under specific legislative authorities with an appropriation of $993,000 for FY2014. The Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief (RSEDR) Act authorizes construction activities to mitigate losses from drought, with costs covered by the federal government. Eligible entities include water users, tribes, and local entities in Reclamation states and Hawaii. Approval from the Secretary of the Interior is required to apply for assistance. The Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief (RSEDR) Act authorizes construction activities to mitigate drought losses, with costs covered by the federal government. Eligible entities can request assistance if approved by the Secretary of the Interior or if they have an approved drought contingency plan. Requests are prioritized by Regional Office Drought Coordinators, and approval is based on congressional direction, funding availability, need, and compliance with environmental laws. Assistance is provided by the Regional Director in compliance with state and federal law.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can provide emergency drinking water during drought conditions by constructing wells and transporting water, with non-reimbursable transport expenses and reimbursable water purchase and storage costs. Assistance for water facilities is limited to drought-distressed political subdivisions, farmers, and ranchers, with required approvals from the Army Corps of Engineers. The USACE Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies Account provides funding under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974. The Corps can reprogram civil works funds to assist tribes with emergency drinking water issues."
