The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, signed into law on February 8, 2006, included welfare reform reauthorization, extending funding for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and increasing work requirements. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193) was a significant social legislation that ended cash welfare entitlement for needy families with children, created the TANF block grant, set a five-year time limit on aid, required more work from welfare recipients, restructured child care programs, modified the Child Support Enforcement program, restricted eligibility for noncitizens in welfare programs, made changes to the Food Stamp program, and aimed to reduce welfare dependency through work, job preparation, and marriage. The TANF program allows states flexibility in designing their welfare programs, leading to varied approaches. States implemented stricter work rules and penalties for noncompliance, but also liberalized eligibility for families transitioning to work. Child care spending increased, and indicators show a decrease in cash welfare caseload and child poverty post-welfare reform. The period following welfare reform saw a significant decrease in cash welfare caseload and child poverty rates, with a notable increase in employment of single mothers. Progress was seen in declining teenage birth rates, although the increase in children born out of wedlock continued at a slower rate. The progress mainly occurred between 1995 and 2000, with national caseloads remaining steady from 2001 to 2004. Employment of single mothers decreased from its peak in 2000 but remained higher than in 1995. Child poverty rates increased from 2000 to 2004 despite a decline in welfare dependency. Cash welfare now reaches a smaller share of the poor post-welfare reform. Out-of-wedlock births and single parenthood remain high despite the decrease in cash welfare caseload. Funding for TANF, child care, and abstinence education expired in 2002. The 1996 welfare law expired in 2002, and President Bush proposed reauthorization in 2002. Congress debated welfare legislation from 2002 to 2005 without final action. A scaled-back version of welfare reauthorization was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The 1996 welfare law expired in 2002, and President Bush proposed reauthorization in 2002. Congress debated welfare legislation from 2002 to 2005 without final action. A scaled-back version of welfare reauthorization was included in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. In the process, the Senate and House had different approaches to including welfare reauthorization provisions in reconciliation legislation. The Senate-passed version of S. 1932 had no welfare-related provisions initially, while the House included select reauthorization proposals in its initial budget reconciliation bill. The Senate Finance Committee approved a welfare reauthorization measure (S. 667) early in the 109th Congress. The 1996 welfare law consolidated federal-state matching grant programs into TANF and child care block grants, with most TANF funding provided in a fixed annual grant of $16.5 billion. TANF funding is a fixed annual grant of $16.5 billion, not adjusted for inflation. Child care block grant has discretionary and mandatory funding. Total child care funding has been flat since FY2002. A comparison of funding provisions in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 was made. The Senate did not include comparable provisions. The Senate Finance Committee did not include provisions for TANF supplemental grants in its reconciliation measure. The Deficit Reduction Act reduced funding for healthy marriage promotion to $100 million and allocated $50 million for responsible fatherhood initiatives. The Deficit Reduction Act reduced funding for healthy marriage promotion to $100 million and allocated $50 million for responsible fatherhood initiatives. Existing TANF bonuses were eliminated, including a High Performance Bonus and a bonus for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. The level of mandatory child care funding has been a contentious point of debate, with an estimated $4.8 billion needed to maintain current subsidies over the next five years. The Deficit Reduction Act includes a $1 billion increase in federal mandatory child care funding over five years, requiring state matching. This contrasts with the proposed $6 billion increase in the Senate Finance Committee's bill. The $1 billion increase in federal child care funds requires state matching, leveraging additional state dollars. If states use the full amount, approximately $0.8 billion in state funds will also be spent, totaling $1.8 billion in new federal and state spending for the child care block grant. However, this amount is estimated to be insufficient to maintain current caseloads and subsidies, and keep pace with inflation. The Deficit Reduction Act's TANF work provisions are likely to increase the demand for child care subsidies. States may need to find ways to address the increasing demand for child care subsidies due to stricter TANF work requirements. One option is to allocate more TANF funds to child care, but limitations such as frozen block grant levels and inflation may hinder this effort. Increasing the percentage of TANF families participating in work activities will raise TANF work and child care costs. Allocating more funding to child care may require cutting back on other TANF initiatives, like child welfare benefits. Targeting child care dollars to families on TANF assistance and restructuring subsidies to reduce costs are potential solutions. Restructure child care subsidies to reduce costs for TANF families. States can adjust subsidy levels and co-payments to lower the average subsidy per family. Mandatory work programs under TANF can help enforce the idea of recipients supporting their families through work and enhance their job market competitiveness. Most states have a \"work-first\" approach for welfare programs, focusing on rapid job entry. While these programs increase employment and reduce welfare receipt, they do not raise participant incomes significantly. TANF data shows that not all recipients are actively participating in work or job preparation activities. The 1996 TANF law sets work participation standards, with a 50% requirement for families with an adult and a 90% requirement for two-parent families. However, actual participation rates are often lower due to caseload reduction credits. Many states have seen significant declines in caseloads, leading to reduced effective participation standards. In FY2004, the national work participation rate was 32%, with some states having no effective standard after credits. The 2002 Bush Administration welfare reauthorization proposals aimed to raise the TANF work participation standard from 50% to 70%, with additional requirements for families to participate in work or workfare for a minimum of 24 hours per week. The House passed a modified version of the proposal multiple times between 2002 and 2005. The Deficit Reduction Act in 2005 did not overhaul TANF work participation standards but made changes to the caseload reduction credit, reducing work participation standards only for caseload reductions from FY2005 onwards. The Deficit Reduction Act in 2005 reduced TANF work participation standards for caseload reductions from FY2005 onwards. Starting in FY2007, states must include families in state-funded programs in the work participation rate calculation to prevent manipulation of participation rates. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reduced TANF work participation standards and required HHS to develop regulations defining work activities and standards for verifying participation. HHS issued regulations in 2006, defining 12 TANF work activities and exempting families caring for disabled members from work requirements. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 reduced TANF work participation standards and required HHS to develop regulations defining work activities and standards for verifying participation. The changes are likely to significantly increase required participation standards for states, with a focus on getting single mothers into the workforce to reduce poverty rates among children in single-mother households. The fifth and sixth annual TANF reports highlight the challenges faced by single mothers in achieving full-time employment and substantial wage growth. Despite welfare reform's success in getting many single mothers into the workforce, maintaining full-time employment remains a struggle. The average monthly earnings of employed TANF recipients in FY2002 were $678, emphasizing the importance of child support payments as a significant income source for single-parent families. Research shows that low-income fathers, like low-income mothers, face similar economic challenges in supporting their children. Research has shown that low-income fathers, like low-income mothers, often work intermittently in low-wage jobs, limiting their ability to support their children. Noncustodial fathers are viewed more sympathetically, with Congress considering funding for responsible fatherhood programs to help them meet financial and emotional responsibilities. Additionally, funding has been provided for preventing teenage and out-of-wedlock pregnancies. The 1996 welfare law focused on reducing teenage and out-of-wedlock pregnancies through funding for abstinence education. The 109th Congress debated the effectiveness of this approach. Welfare reform goals include reducing welfare dependency through work, job preparation, and marriage, but policy changes mainly focused on encouraging work rather than marriage goals. The Deficit Reduction Act includes funding for programs designed to address these issues. The Deficit Reduction Act includes funding for programs promoting marriage among low-income individuals to improve economic well-being and child development. The Child Support Enforcement program has also been undergoing changes since its inception in 1975 to collect child support from noncustodial parents of children on welfare. The Child Support Enforcement program has evolved from focusing on cost-recovery to service delivery. In FY2005, $23 billion was collected in child support, with 45% collected for families not on welfare. The $23 billion collected in FY2005 for child support nearly doubled pre-welfare reform collections. Child support constitutes 17% of family income on average and about 30% for poverty-level children. The 1996 welfare reform law established new enforcement mechanisms to obtain child support and pay more to families. The Deficit Reduction Act provides financial incentives to states to pass more child support collected on behalf of welfare families directly to the family. The federal government will cover a portion of the support passed-through as long as it does not reduce the family's welfare benefit. States can pay up to $100 per month per child to TANF families and are encouraged to send the full amount of child support collected on behalf of former welfare families. The Deficit Reduction Act includes provisions such as establishing a $25 annual user fee for individuals receiving child support enforcement services, reducing the federal matching rate for paternity establishment costs, and eliminating the federal match on incentive payments reinvested back into the program. Enforcement of child support orders is a key aspect of the Act. Government and organizations support responsible fatherhood programs to connect noncustodial parents with their children. These programs focus on improving financial and personal responsibility, including employment skills and social skills like parenting education and conflict resolution. Responsible fatherhood programs focus on decision-making, conflict resolution, stress management, and disciplinary practices. They also include peer support and media campaigns to emphasize the importance of fathers' connections to their children. Funding for these initiatives can come from sources like the TANF block grant and competitive grants from welfare reauthorization bills and the Deficit Reduction Act. Nonprofit organizations, including religious organizations, receive $1.5 million annually from the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement for Responsible Fatherhood demonstrations in eight states. Teenage pregnancy and nonmarital births were central issues in the 1996 welfare reform debate, with the US having the highest rates of teen pregnancy among industrialized countries. The 1996 welfare reform law provided $50 million per year for five years to address these issues. Since FY2003, the abstinence-only block grant has been funded through temporary extensions. States must request funds when applying for Maternal and Child Health block grants, matching federal funds with state funds. The Deficit Reduction Act only funded the program through December 31, 2006, despite proposals to extend funding through FY2010. P.L. 109-432 continues funding at $50 million annually. The Care Act of 2006 continues funding for the abstinence-only education block grant at $50 million annually until June 30, 2007. The law defines \"abstinence education\" as teaching the benefits of abstaining from sexual activity, promoting abstinence outside of marriage, and emphasizing the importance of monogamous relationships within marriage. Funding for abstinence-only education has been included in appropriation bills since FY2001, with funding provided through HHS for the community-based abstinence education program. Funding amounts have increased over the years, reaching $110 million in FY2006. The program aims to teach young people how to reject sexual advances, the risks of alcohol and drug use, and the importance of self-sufficiency before engaging in sex. The Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program provides funding for adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and parenting, with abstinence-only education receiving $9 million in FY2001, $10 million in FY2002-FY2004, and $13 million in FY2005 and FY2006. The debate over sex education includes whether teens should be taught abstinence only or a more comprehensive approach that includes information on safe sex practices. Advocates of comprehensive sex education argue that youth need information and decision-making skills to make informed choices about sexual activities. Advocates of abstinence education believe in providing young people with information to make informed decisions about abstinence, relationship limits, contraceptives, and STD prevention. They argue for a clear message that sex outside of marriage is harmful and empower youth to say no to sex. Supporting both abstinence and birth control is seen as hypocritical and weakens the abstinence-only message. Research shows that children in intact biological families have better outcomes in academics, teenage pregnancy, and delinquency. Children in intact biological families have better outcomes (e.g. lower teenage pregnancy, delinquency) than those in single-parent families, even when income levels are equivalent. However, these benefits are only seen when a child lives with both biological parents, not stepchildren. There are concerns about promoting marriage in violent relationships, and the correlation between family type and child outcomes does not imply causation. Research is being funded to investigate the impact of marriage on child well-being. The Administration is funding research to evaluate the impact of marriage promotion programs, with findings expected in the future. The Deficit Reduction Act provides funding for marriage promotion and responsible fatherhood programs. The curr_chunk discusses various reports on child care, child support enforcement, children in poverty, fatherhood initiatives, transitional medical assistance, welfare trends, and welfare reauthorization. The curr_chunk provides a comparison of current welfare laws and pending reauthorization proposals, along with references to various reports on welfare trends and programs. The curr_chunk discusses the need for consistent measurement of TANF work participation across states."
