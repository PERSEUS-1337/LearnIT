    "content": "Since 9/11, immigration has been linked to homeland security, leading to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 shifting immigration policy to the Department of Homeland Security. The REAL ID Act of 2005 aimed to enhance security through immigration and identification document provisions. Immigration enforcement remains a key issue in Congress. The issue of immigration enforcement remains a key focus in Congress, with various bills addressing border security, roles in enforcement, smuggling, detention, and prohibitions on employing unauthorized workers. Bills like H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 have been passed, with provisions similar to fencing and border tunnel security included in legislation. The House has passed enforcement-related measures like H.R. 6094, H.R. 6095, H.R. 6160, and H.R. 6162, along with provisions on temporary and permanent immigration, unauthorized aliens, and other issues in S. 2611. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved an S. 2611 predecessor proposal with provisions on border and interior enforcement, unlawful employment of aliens, guest workers, and legal permanent immigration reform. Senator Frist introduced a separate bill, S. 2454, addressing border security. The Senate rejected cloture motions on S. 2454, a bill addressing border security, with no provisions on guest workers or unauthorized aliens' future status in the US. Senator Specter proposed a substitute amendment, but it was not successful. The Senate rejected cloture motions on S. 2454, a bill addressing border security, and the Hagel-Martinez compromise was subsequently introduced as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611/S. 2612). Congress has enacted limited provisions on employment-based immigration and legislation concerning alien victims of domestic violence, trafficking, and refugees. This report discusses immigration-related issues of significant congressional interest. During the 108th Congress, immigration and identification-document security proposals were introduced, leading to the enactment of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The REAL ID Act (P.L. 109-13, Division B) includes provisions from the dropped legislation and new proposals, focusing on Titles I, II, and III. Titles IV and V, addressing nonimmigrant and immigrant workers, are covered in other sections of the report. The REAL ID Act brings changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act. The REAL ID Act introduces statutory guidelines for relief from removal cases, setting stricter standards in some areas. It eliminates annual caps on asylum grants and codifies existing regulations and case law. The REAL ID Act eliminates annual caps on asylum grants and limits federal habeas review for certain removal cases, while allowing appellate court review of constitutional claims and questions of law. The REAL ID Act expands terrorism-related grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportation, broadening the definition of terrorist activities and entities. It includes activities like espousing terrorist activity and receiving military training from terrorist organizations as grounds for exclusion and deportation. The Act also grants the Secretary of State and Homeland Security authority to waive certain terrorism-related provisions. The REAL ID Act grants the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive certain terrorism-related provisions to expedite construction of barriers and roads along U.S. land borders. It also includes measures to improve border infrastructure and technology integration, such as conducting a study on border security vulnerabilities and establishing a pilot program for ground surveillance technologies on the northern and southern borders. The REAL ID Act mandates improved border security measures, including a pilot program for ground surveillance technologies on the northern and southern borders. It also requires enhanced communication systems between federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. States must adhere to specific practices for verifying documents for driver's licenses and ID cards, with minimum issuance standards set for federal acceptance. Legal status verification is also mandatory before issuing licenses or ID cards. The REAL ID Act mandates improved border security measures, including a pilot program for ground surveillance technologies on the northern and southern borders. States must adhere to specific practices for verifying documents for driver's licenses and ID cards, with minimum issuance standards set for federal acceptance. Legal status verification is mandatory before issuing licenses or ID cards, and states are required to maintain a database with specified information accessible to all other states. Compliance deadline is three years after enactment. Border security provisions, including a pilot program for ground surveillance technologies, were mandated by the REAL ID Act. States must verify documents for driver's licenses and ID cards, with legal status verification required before issuance. Compliance deadline is three years after enactment, with the Secretary of Homeland Security authorized to extend for justified noncompliance. DHS is responsible for protecting borders from various threats, including illegal entries. The 109th Congress debates on DHS resources for border security, with bills proposing additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 include provisions for border security, enacted in FY2007 DHS Appropriations Act and Secure Fence Act of 2006. Other related measures like H.R. 4830, H.R. 6160, and H.R. 6162 have also been passed by the House, addressing crimes related to tunnels crossing the U.S. international border. The 109th Congress debates on DHS resources for border security, with bills proposing additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology. P.L. 109-295 imposes harsh penalties for international border crimes, including the use of tunnels for illegal entry or smuggling. It also requires the DHS Inspector General to review contracts worth over $20 million related to the Secure Border Initiative. Additionally, P.L. 109-295 allocates $1.2 billion for border fencing, infrastructure, and technology, leaving implementation decisions to DHS. The 109th Congress debates on DHS resources for border security, with bills proposing additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology. P.L. 109-367 directs DHS to construct border fencing along five different stretches of the southern border totaling roughly 850 miles. It also calls for a study on the feasibility of constructing border security infrastructure along the northern border. S. 2611 would direct DHS to replace current border fencing in the Border Patrol's Tucson and Yuma sectors and to construct additional border fencing totaling 370 miles and additional vehicle barriers totaling 700 miles. Both H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 contain other border-security related provisions, including requiring the Secretary of DHS to submit a National Strategy for Border Security outlining a comprehensive strategy for securing the border. Both bills propose enhancing border security by adding personnel, technology, and infrastructure resources at ports of entry. They also require expanding the US-VISIT Program to collect 10 fingerprints from aliens entering the country and improving connectivity with the FBI's database. Additionally, DHS must develop a plan for clear communication for agents working along the border. House-passed H.R. 4437 aims to improve coordination and communication among DHS component agencies through task forces and information sharing mechanisms. It also requires a border security exercise involving various government officials within a year of enactment and allows the use of homeland security grant funding for detecting and responding to unlawful entry of aliens. Additionally, H.R. 4437 would remove Air and Marine Operations from DHS's Customs and Border Protection. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a stand-alone Air and Marine Operations Office within DHS, the acquisition of surveillance assets for a \"virtual fence\" along the southwest border, and the establishment of criminal penalties for evading inspection at ports of entry. Additionally, H.R. 6160 provides recruitment and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents, while the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 requires a report on the potential use of military air assets to support DHS in border surveillance. The House-passed provision in H.R. 1815 and H.R. 5122 authorized the deployment of U.S. military personnel to assist DHS at the border, under the request of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Military personnel would need to complete a training course on border law enforcement and be accompanied by DHS law enforcement personnel. They would not be allowed to conduct searches, seizures, or arrests, and this provision would not override the Posse Comitatus Act. The House-passed provision in H.R. 1815 and H.R. 5122 authorized the deployment of U.S. military personnel to assist DHS at the border, under the request of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Military personnel would need to complete a training course on border law enforcement and be accompanied by DHS law enforcement personnel. This provision would not have superseded the Posse Comitatus Act. The conference report on H.R. 5122, signed into law as P.L. 109-364, does not include this provision. Additionally, S. 2611 includes language to direct DHS to work with DOD to enhance the use of military surveillance assets at the border, and would allow state governors to deploy the National Guard to the southwest border in a support capacity, with restrictions on their activities. Several bills in the 109th Congress would create civilian border patrolling organizations, including a pilot Volunteer Border Marshal Program proposed in S. 1823. H.R. 3704 and H.R. 3622 propose the creation of Border Patrol Auxiliary and Border Protection Corps (BPC) respectively, to assist in controlling illegal immigration and trafficking at the border. The auxiliaries and BPC would have powers similar to Border Patrol agents, with DHS responsible for reimbursing their expenses. Since the attacks of September 11, there have been calls for state and local law enforcement agencies to have a larger role in enforcing federal immigration laws. Questions arise about the authority of these officers to enforce both civil and criminal immigration laws. Historically, state and local law enforcement's authority has been limited to criminal provisions, while civil provisions have been seen as a federal responsibility. Some argue that states and localities, as sovereign entities, still have a role to play in immigration enforcement. Some argue that states and localities, as sovereign entities, have the authority to enforce civil and criminal violations of federal immigration law. Bills in Congress, such as H.R. 4437 and H.R. 6095, aim to enhance the role of state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement by reaffirming their inherent authority. The Security Authorization Act for FY2006 (H.R. 1817) and other bills reaffirm the authority of state and local law enforcement to apprehend, detain, or remove aliens in the US. H.R. 4437 requires the DHS Secretary to create a training manual for immigration-related enforcement duties. H.R. 4437 authorizes grants for state and local police agencies for immigration law enforcement equipment and facilities. It allows states to reimburse themselves for enforcing federal laws on preventing unlawful entry. Designated sheriffs near the southern border would be reimbursed for costs related to transferring detained aliens. S. 2611 in the Senate proposes a border relief grant program for law enforcement agencies near the border to address criminal activity. The Senate proposes a border relief grant program for law enforcement agencies near the border to address criminal activity. The program would authorize grants to agencies within 100 miles of the northern or southern border or in certified \"high impact areas.\" Funds would be allocated based on unauthorized alien apprehensions, with provisions for reimbursement of training, transportation, and equipment costs. The INA prohibits employers from hiring unauthorized aliens and requires participation in the I-9 employment eligibility verification system. Employers can also use an electronic verification system like the Basic Pilot program to verify new hires' work authorization. The INA prohibits employers from hiring unauthorized aliens and requires participation in the I-9 employment eligibility verification system, including authorization through SSA and DHS databases. Violations may result in civil and/or criminal penalties. Worksite enforcement is a key focus due to the large number of unauthorized aliens in the labor force, raising security concerns. President Bush has also addressed worksite enforcement in connection with guest worker proposals. President Bush has supported a new temporary worker program with increased worksite enforcement. Immigration reform bills in the 109th Congress include provisions for guest workers and worksite enforcement. H.R. 4437 would establish a mandatory employment eligibility verification system for all employers, with verification required before hiring or recruiting. H.R. 4437 and S. 2454 propose mandatory employment eligibility verification systems for all employers, with verification required before hiring or referral. Penalties for violations would increase, with potential reductions for smaller employers. Verification requirements would be phased in over time. Under S. 2454, employers in critical infrastructure or related to national security must verify identity and employment eligibility of previously hired workers within 180 days of enactment. The bill also increases penalties for violations and introduces a new penalty for employees who falsely represent work authorization on the I-9 form. Title III of S. 2611 mandates a new employment eligibility verification system for all employers. Under S. 2611, a new mandatory employment eligibility verification system would be implemented for all employers. Employers must participate in the system for all employees hired after a certain date and verify identity and employment eligibility after hiring. DHS could designate critical employers to participate based on security needs or violations of unauthorized employment. S. 2611 would establish a new mandatory employment eligibility verification system for all employers, with increased penalties for violations and compensation for wrongfully terminated employees. Other bills also propose similar verification systems. The proposed bills aim to enhance the employment eligibility verification system by potentially creating a new unified database, increasing penalties for employer violations, and requiring Social Security cards to include unique electronic identification strips for verification purposes. H.R. 98 and S. 1033 / H.R. 2330 propose enhancements to the employment eligibility verification system, including raising penalties for violations and establishing a new system for verifying new hires' identity and work authorization using machine-readable documents and an employment eligibility database. Additionally, a new H-5A temporary worker visa would be created for guest workers. H.R. 2330 and S. 1033 propose a new H-5A temporary worker visa and require verification of identity and work authorization through a new database. S. 1438 would make changes to verification requirements, including issuing machine-readable Social Security cards and mandating participation in the Basic Pilot program with sanctions for noncompliance. S. 1438 and S. 1917 propose changes to verification requirements, including renaming the Basic Pilot program, making participation mandatory, and increasing penalties for employer violations. The bills would require the use of specific documents for employment authorization and integrate all databases for verification purposes. H.R. 3333 also aims to rename the Basic Pilot program, mandate participation, and sanction noncompliant employers. H.R. 3333 proposes increased penalties for employer violations related to verifying employee authorization to work, along with provisions regarding Social Security accounts and cards. It also suggests renaming the Basic Pilot program, making participation mandatory, and implementing a new employment eligibility verification system based on an employment eligibility database established by DHS. H.R. 3938 proposes a new database for verifying identity and work authorization, along with increased penalties for employer violations. Alien smuggling is seen as a risk to national security, leading to various criminal activities. The main alien smuggling statute (INA \u00a7274) outlines penalties and evidentiary requirements for smuggling offenses. H.R. 2744, signed into law as P.L. 109-97, exempts religious organizations from criminal penalties related to alien smuggling under certain conditions. The bills H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 would broaden the definition of alien smuggling, with S. 2611 providing exemptions for humanitarian assistance to unauthorized aliens. H.R. 4437 does not include such exemptions and would remove current exemptions under P.L. 109-97. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 would establish mandatory minimum sentences for alien smuggling convictions and enhance penalties for firearms possession during smuggling offenses. Both proposals would also allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property used in alien smuggling. Other pending bills aim to increase penalties, personnel dedicated to combating alien smuggling, and grant S visas to aliens outside the United States. Under the INA, there is broad authority to detain aliens while awaiting a determination about whether they should be removed from the United States. Mandatory detention applies to certain categories of aliens, including those arriving without documentation, with fraudulent documentation, inadmissible or deportable on criminal or national security grounds, certified as terrorist suspects, or with final orders of deportation. Policy issues surrounding alien detention include concerns about priorities for detention and whether aliens should be detained, paroled, or released on bond. Policy issues surrounding the detention of aliens include concerns about the number of aliens subject to mandatory detention, the justness of mandatory detention for asylum seekers, the length of time spent in detention, and the availability of detention space. Several bills in the 109th Congress address provisions for the detention of aliens in the United States. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 propose regulations for post-removal order detention cases and mandatory detention for aliens attempting illegal entry. H.R. 4437 also includes provisions for contracting with private entities for transportation and mandatory detention for street gang members. S. 2611 directs DHS to acquire or construct 20 additional detention facilities for aliens. S. 2611 would direct DHS to acquire or construct 20 additional detention facilities for aliens with a combined capacity of at least 10,000 aliens at any time, and consider using military installations for this purpose. The Border Patrol would have exclusive control over assets for detention space. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 aim to tighten laws on illegal presence, entry, voluntary departure, removal, exclusion, and inadmissibility of aliens. Section 203 of H.R. 4437 and Section 206 of S. 2611 aim to increase penalties for illegal presence, entry, and reentry by making them felonies, especially for aliens with previous criminal convictions. S. 2611 does not criminalize unlawful presence or impose heightened penalties for it. The proposed legislation in H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 includes increased criminal penalties for unlawful reentry and presence after voluntary departure, mandatory minimum sentences for reentering the US after removal, and enhanced penalties for violent crimes and drug trafficking offenses committed by unlawfully present aliens. Additionally, the requirements for aliens to receive voluntary departure would be amended to ensure they leave the US. The proposed legislation includes changes to voluntary departure requirements, reducing the validity period to 60 days before removal proceedings and 45 days after. Failure to depart voluntarily would result in increased penalties and ineligibility for immigration benefits. Under the proposed bills, aliens facing removal orders who evade arrest or fail to comply with removal orders would face civil penalties and be ineligible for immigration benefits. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 would expand expedited removal, requiring the DHS Secretary to place certain aliens into expedited removal if apprehended within 100 miles of the border within 14 days of unauthorized entry, with exceptions for Canadians, Cubans, and Mexicans. Additionally, the Secretary of State must deny visas to nationals of countries that refuse to accept their citizens back. H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 propose measures to deny entry to nationals of countries that refuse to accept their citizens back, shifting the responsibility from visa issuance to alien admissions at U.S. ports of entry. This would allow the Secretary of DHS to deny admission to foreign nationals from uncooperative countries, even if they have visas. The INA requires U.S. citizens to have a valid passport when entering and leaving the country, with exceptions for travel within the Americas. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) mandates the use of passports or other approved documents for all travelers. The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) requires passports or approved documents for all travelers entering the United States. The deadline for implementing WHTI was extended to June 1, 2009. Additionally, bills introduced in Congress aim to expand grounds for inadmissibility and deportation for certain individuals. H.R. 4437 and H.R. 6094 focus on modifying immigration law related to aliens involved in criminal or terrorism-related activities, including prohibiting naturalization and restricting immigration benefits for such individuals. S. 2611 also covers similar provisions as H.R. 4437. The provisions in S. 2611 and H.R. 4437 focus on modifying immigration law related to aliens involved in criminal or terrorism-related activities. S. 2611 expands terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility to cover incitement or advocacy of terrorist activity. Both bills streamline administrative and judicial review procedures, with similar provisions in different titles. Proposed changes include increasing resources, establishing adjudication procedures statutorily, and making procedural clarifications in response to litigation. The House-passed bill H.R. 4437 and Senate bill S. 2454 propose amendments to immigration law, including a screening process with a certificate of reviewability by a federal appellate judge within 60 days. They also address federal appellate court decisions on immigration procedures, with S. 2454 suggesting the consolidation of immigration appeals in one circuit. S. 2454 proposes consolidating immigration appeals in one federal appellate court, while H.R. 4437 aims to restrict judicial review of denials of discretionary relief under immigration laws. S. 2611 aims to increase personnel in DHS, DOJ, and U.S. Courts for immigration litigation and adjudication. It also establishes guidelines for the Board of Immigration Appeals, appoints immigration judges, expands legal orientation programs, and limits injunctive relief in immigration-related civil actions against the federal government. The proposal aims to limit injunctive relief in immigration-related civil actions against the federal government, specifically concerning rights for El Salvadorans in deportation proceedings. The injunction is said to impede expedited removal procedures for El Salvadorans and has become part of standard operating procedures for all aliens. This proposal is included in H.R. 6095, titled \"Ending Catch and Release Act of 2006,\" and is also addressed in another House bill, H.R. 5541. H.R. 5541 would prohibit class action certification in immigration law cases filed after enactment. Nonimmigrants are admitted for specific purposes, including tourists, students, diplomats, and temporary workers like H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B visa holders. The H-2A and H-2B visa programs are the main programs for importing low-skilled workers to the United States. The 109th Congress revised the H-2B program for nonagricultural workers, capping the number of available slots at 33,000 during the first six months of a fiscal year. The 109th Congress revised the H-2B program for nonagricultural workers, capping slots at 33,000 in the first six months of a fiscal year. They require DHS to submit information to Congress regularly, impose a fraud-prevention fee on H-2B employers, and authorize penalties in certain circumstances. Provisions exempt \"returning workers\" counted towards the cap in the past three years. P.L. 109-364 extends the returning worker exemption through FY2007, while S. 2611 extends it through FY2009. Proposals to revise the H-2A program include bills like AgJOBS (S. 359/H.R. 884) to streamline importing H-2A workers and make changes to benefits, wages, and working conditions. The 109th Congress revised the H-2B program for nonagricultural workers, capping slots at 33,000 in the first six months of a fiscal year. They require DHS to submit information to Congress regularly, impose a fraud-prevention fee on H-2B employers, and authorize penalties in certain circumstances. Provisions exempt \"returning workers\" counted towards the cap in the past three years. P.L. 109-364 extends the returning worker exemption through FY2007, while S. 2611 extends it through FY2009. Title I of H.R. 3333 would eliminate current H visa subcategories, including H-2A and H-2B visas, replacing them with a single H visa for skilled or unskilled work. H visa holders could not change status or adjust to LPR status in the US until certain certifications are made by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Title IV of S. 2611 in the 109th Congress introduced a new H-2C guest worker visa for temporary labor in the US. The initial cap was set at 325,000 but was later reduced to 200,000 annually. H-2C workers could stay for three years initially, with the possibility of extension for another three years, and could adjust to LPR status. The H-2C guest worker visa introduced in the 109th Congress allowed for temporary labor in the US with an initial cap of 325,000, later reduced to 200,000 annually. Workers could stay for three years initially, with the possibility of extension for another three years and could adjust to LPR status. Other pending bills include S. 1033 / H.R. 2330 and S. 1438, which propose new temporary worker visas such as H-5A and H-5B visas. Title V of S. 1438 introduces a new W temporary worker visa for aliens coming to the US for temporary labor. Title VI authorizes DHS to grant Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status to certain aliens present in the US since July 20, 2004. S. 1438 does not provide a special pathway to LPR status for aliens in W or DMD status. The Appropriations Act for FY2005 imposes a $500 fraud prevention and detection fee on H-1B and L petitioners, divided equally among DHS, DOS, and DOL. H.R. 3648 introduces new requirements for the L nonimmigrant visa category, including a $1,500 fee for certain visa applications. Homeland Security charges $1,500 fees to employers for certain visa applications and nonimmigrant petitions for L visas. S. 2611 aims to address perceived abuses in the L visa provisions and includes a compromise to recapture up to 30,000 H-1B visas with an additional fee of $500. An extra fee of $750 would be charged for L-1 visas under this compromise. S. 2611 proposes raising the H-1B visa limit to 115,000 and adding an exemption for those with advanced degrees in STEM fields. It also extends practical training for foreign students and expands F and J visas for STEM graduates. The H-1C visa classification for nurses in health professional shortage areas was established by P.L. 106-95, with a limited filing period. H.R. 1285 aims to extend this period by three years without changing the program. Additionally, the INA allows for the admission of foreign nationals as LPRs based on family reunification, needed skills, refugee protection, and diversity of admissions by country of origin. Various measures have been introduced to revise permanent admissions, with only one enacted so far in the 109th Congress. Some measures, like visas for nurses, target specific aspects of the immigration system, while others aim to broadly change permanent admissions. An amendment was added during Senate floor consideration to make 50,000 permanent employment-based visas available for foreign nurses. Additionally, compromise language was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee to \"recapture\" up to 90,000 employment-based visas. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved compromise language to \"recapture\" up to 90,000 employment-based visas that were not issued in prior years. An additional fee of $500 would be charged to obtain these visas. The Security and Fairness Enhancement for America Act of 2005 (H.R. 1219) aims to eliminate the diversity visa lottery to encourage legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries. The House Immigration subcommittee approved H.R. 1219, which has been included in H.R. 4437. Senate bills like S. 1438 and S. 2377 also aim to eliminate the diversity visa. S. 1033 / H.R. 2330 proposes changes to the INA, including increasing family-based visas, lowering income requirements for sponsors, recapturing unused visas, and raising the limit on employment-based visas. Title X of S. 1438 proposes significant changes to immigration laws, including eliminating the diversity visa, reducing visas for highly skilled individuals, and increasing visas for unskilled workers. It also aims to raise the limit on employment-based visas from 140,000 to 290,000 and increase the per-country limit on LPR visas. Title I of H.R. 3700 would overhaul permanent admissions to the United States by reducing employment-based immigrants to 5,200 annually for persons with extraordinary abilities or advanced degrees. It would eliminate family preference and diversity visas. Title IV of S. 2454 would increase visas for LPRs by no longer deducting immediate relatives of U.S. citizens from the family-sponsored limit and not counting derivative family members of employment-based LPRs towards the numerical ceiling. S. 2454 proposes to increase the annual limit on employment-based LPR visa categories from 140,000 to 290,000 visas and raise the per-country limit on LPR visas from 7% to 10% of the total preference allocation. This would help oversubscribed countries like China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines by substantially increasing their share of the overall ceiling. S. 2454 proposes to reallocate family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas, shifting towards unskilled workers and increasing visa allocation. Title V of S. 2611 would substantially increase legal immigration and restructure visa allocation, removing numerical limits for certain special immigrants. The bill would also increase the annual number of employment-based LPRs and eliminate the deduction of immediate relatives from the family-sponsored numerical limit. S. 2611 proposes to increase the number of employment-based LPRs to 450,000 for FY2007 through FY2016, with a limit of 290,000 thereafter. It would establish a total cap of 650,000 employment-based LPRs and their families. The bill also aims to raise the per-country limit on LPR visas and eliminate exceptions to the per-country ceilings for certain family and employment-based LPRs. Some immigration reform bills in the 109th Congress aim to enable certain unauthorized aliens in the US to adjust to LPR status through different mechanisms. S. 2611 proposes a separate legalization process for unauthorized aliens, allowing the Secretary of DHS to adjust their status to LPR if specific requirements are met. This includes proving presence in the US before April 5, 2001. The United States on or before April 5, 2001; did not depart during the April 5, 2001-April 5, 2006 period except for brief departures; and was not legally present as a nonimmigrant on April 5, 2006. Among the other requirements, the alien would have to establish employment for at least three years during the April 5, 2001-April 5, 2006 period and for at least six years after enactment, and would have to establish payment of income taxes during that required employment period. Such adjustments of status would not be subject to numerical limits. Also under Title VI, Subtitle A of S. 2611, aliens who are unable to meet the presence and employment requirements for adjustment to LPR status but who have been present and employed in the United States since January 7, 2004, and meet other requirements, could apply to DHS for Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status. Eligible aliens would be granted DMD status for up to three years. Aliens granted Deferred Mandatory Departure (DMD) status could apply for immigrant or nonimmigrant status while in the United States, but would have to depart the country to be admitted under such status. They could exit and re-enter the United States at certain land points of entry. Additionally, aliens in DMD status who are admitted as H-2C aliens could apply to adjust to LPR status. Title VI, Subtitles B and C of S. 2611 provide provisions for certain unauthorized aliens to apply for LPR status, including a \"blue card\" program for agricultural workers. Subtitle C, known as the DREAM Act, allows aliens who entered the US before age 16 and meet certain requirements to apply for LPR status. No numerical limitations apply, and LPR status is granted on a conditional basis for six years. After that, aliens can apply to have the condition removed. Amendments to eliminate or modify legalization provisions were debated during Senate consideration of S. 2611. The bill debated various unsuccessful amendments related to legalization provisions for aliens in the United States since April 5, 2001, and for agricultural workers. House-passed H.R. 4437 does not include provisions to legalize the status of unauthorized aliens in the United States. The INA includes provisions to assist aliens who have been victims of illegal activities like domestic violence and trafficking. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (VTVPA; P.L. 106-386) and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-193) provide special provisions for aliens who have been abused by their U.S. citizen or LPR spouses or parents. These provisions include procedures for obtaining LPR status, adjusting status in the U.S., and relief from removal. P.L. 109-162 expands protections for battered immigrants, representing a compromise between House-passed H.R. 3402 and Senate-passed S. 1197. Battered spouses and children of citizens or LPRs who meet specific criteria are treated differently under current law. P.L. 109-162 expands protections for battered immigrants, allowing self-petitioning for battered parents of citizens, granting employment authorization for approved VAWA self-petitioners, and providing work authorization for battered spouses of certain nonimmigrants. It also imposes new requirements on the K visa and establishes rules for international marriage brokers. P.L. 109-271 makes technical changes to the INA's battered alien provisions.

Legislative proposals in the 109th Congress address U.S. citizenship restrictions, naturalization reform, and military-based naturalization to deter illegal immigration. Proposals to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States have been introduced to address concerns about illegal immigration and divided national loyalties. Various measures, such as S. 2117, H.J.Res. 41, H.J.Res. 46, H.R. 698, H.R. 3700, H.R. 3938, and H.R. 4313, aim to limit citizenship at birth to individuals with parents who are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or lawfully present in the country. These proposals were considered for inclusion in legislative bills but were not ultimately included. Legislation has been proposed to reform naturalization by restricting dual nationality, including codifying the oath of allegiance in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Bills like S. 1087, S. 1815/H.R. 4168, and H.R. 688 aim to inform foreign countries when a new U.S. citizen renounces allegiance to them.

Sections of H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 aim to reform the naturalization process by considering pending proceedings related to an applicant's inadmissibility or deportability. Additionally, no petition for immigrant status will be approved if there are pending proceedings that could lead to denaturalization or loss of lawful permanent resident status for the sponsor-petitioner. Section 643 of S. 2611 aims to provide resources and programs for naturalization and education, including reducing the required legal residency period for naturalization from five years to four years for lawful permanent residents who demonstrate fluency in English. Section 821 of S. 2611 would amend INA \u00a7320 to allow automatic citizenship for children born outside the U.S. to at least one U.S. citizen parent who meets certain requirements, eliminating the need for the child to be a lawful permanent resident in the U.S. to acquire citizenship. S. 2611, specifically \u00a7821, proposes changes to citizenship requirements for adopted children and members of the U.S. military, including waiving the fingerprint requirement for naturalization applications within 12 months of enlistment. The legislative proposals S. 2097, S. 2165, S. 3947, H.R. 661, H.R. 901, H.R. 3018, H.R. 3911, and H.R. 4533 require English and civics knowledge, good moral character, and oath of allegiance for citizenship.

International adoption involves compliance with foreign adoption rules, with no direct U.S. government involvement in the process. Prospective parents must meet U.S. legal requirements to bring an adopted child into the country. The United States has laws for petitioning to adopt an orphan from abroad, requiring determinations on the ability of prospective parents to care for the child and if the child meets the orphan definition. The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption was signed in 1993, leading to the International Adoption Act of 2000 to implement the Convention. The legislation designates the central adoption authority in the Department of State (DOS) and mandates the Secretary of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to file applications for prospective adoptive parents. Senate-passed S. 2611 includes changes to the international adoption process, such as establishing an Office of Intercountry Adoption within DOS. S. 2611 proposes establishing an Office of Intercountry Adoptions within the Department of State, headed by an Ambassador at Large for Intercountry Adoptions.

Automatic citizenship is granted to foreign-born children under 18 residing in the US as LPRs and in custody of a US citizen parent upon adoption finalization. S. 2611 would amend INA \u00a7320 to grant automatic U.S. citizenship to a child adopted abroad by at least one U.S. citizen who has resided in the U.S. for at least five years, two after age 14. The adoption must be full and final, and the child must be under 16. The bill also creates a new nonimmigrant W visa for adoptable children coming to the U.S. for adoption by a U.S. citizen approved by DOS, granting them rights and benefits of an LPR. The discussion around free trade agreements (FTAs) often includes debates on whether immigration provisions should be included, such as expanding immigration between countries or addressing illegal migration. The Australian FTA and P.L. 109-13 touch on the issue, with the latter adding visas for Australian nationals under a new E-3 temporary visa.

Legislation such as H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 aim to broaden penalties for document fraud offenses related to immigration and establish measures to identify fraudulent documents. Document fraud statutes aim to criminalize the distribution of fraudulent documents, increase penalties for fraud, establish a uniform statute of limitations, provide for forfeiture of property used in fraud offenses, criminalize attempts and conspiracies to commit fraud, and target schemes to defraud aliens. S. 2611 also includes exceptions for legitimate refugees and asylees and increases fraud detection enforcement agents for worksite enforcement. Additionally, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) provides reimbursement to state and local governments for costs associated with incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens. P.L. 109-162 authorizes these measures. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) authorizes appropriations for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens, with funds allocated for correctional purposes. S. 2611 includes changes requiring reimbursement for costs related to detaining and processing these individuals, covering expenses like indigent defense, criminal prosecution, autopsies, translators, and court costs. Appropriations for processing costs are set at $400 million annually from FY2007 through FY2012, with additional funds authorized for compensation under SCAAP for FY2007 through FY2009. The S visa program funding amounts for FY2007 to FY2012 are set at $750 million, $850 million, and $950 million respectively. S. 2611 expands the S visa eligibility to include aliens with critical information on weapons of mass destruction and increases the annual visa limit from 250 to 1,000. Additionally, DHS must report to Congress on the number of nonimmigrants admitted on S visas. S. 2611 expands the S visa program to include aliens with critical information on weapons of mass destruction and increases the annual visa limit to 1,000. DHS must report to Congress if the number of nonimmigrants admitted on S visas falls below 25% of the limit. S. 119 establishes procedures for unaccompanied alien children, including easier placement with family members, conditions for detention, and the requirement for legal counsel in immigration proceedings. H.R. 4997 and H.R. 2293 aim to extend waiver authority for foreign medical graduates on J visas to apply for immigrant visas or permanent residence.
