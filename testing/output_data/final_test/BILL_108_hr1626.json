The Congress findings highlight the importance of the newly created class A television service, established to provide valuable local and specialized programming to unserved and underserved audiences. The Community Broadcasters Protection Act of 1999 aimed to grant permanent broadcast licenses to stations offering such services, especially to low power television stations in urban and rural areas. This new television service was introduced seven years after the Cable Television Consumer Protection Act. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 does not fully recognize low power television stations as full-service commercial broadcast stations providing significant local programming to underserved communities. Thirteen of the top 25 Hispanic markets in the US receive Spanish language network programming through these stations. The Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 excludes low power television stations in the largest 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas from mandatory carriage on cable television, denying equitable carriage opportunities for these stations and other underserved urban communities. Congress believed in 1992 that mandatory carriage was necessary for local programming benefits, which are also important for qualified class A television stations today. Must-carry rights are often challenged on various issues. Must-carry rights for low power television stations are often challenged on signal quality issues. Cable operators should accept industry standard equipment provided by these stations as long as it does not impact cable system operations. SEC. 3. Cable television carriage requirements for Class A local television service. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 includes changes to cable television carriage requirements for Class A local television service, allowing for inclusion of qualified low power stations and qualified class A stations in certain subsections. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 updates cable television carriage requirements for Class A local television service. Cable operators must carry two qualified low power stations or qualified class A stations if they have more than 35 but fewer than 72 usable activated 6 mHz channels. For systems with 72 or more channels, three stations must be carried. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 updates cable television carriage requirements for Class A local television service. If there are three or fewer commercial full power stations in a designated market area that do not retransmit another station's signal, all qualified class A stations in the area shall be granted carriage rights. The number of class A stations a cable operator must carry should not exceed the national average number of broadcast stations in the US. The amendment updates cable TV carriage requirements for Class A local TV service, granting carriage rights to qualified Class A stations in areas with three or fewer commercial full power stations. The number of Class A stations carried by cable operators should not exceed the national average number of broadcast stations in the US. The amendment updates cable TV carriage requirements for Class A local TV service, granting carriage rights to qualified Class A stations in areas with three or fewer commercial full power stations. Qualified Class A station means a station operating in accordance with FCC regulations and broadcasting a minimum number of hours per week. The amendment requires Class A local TV stations to broadcast a minimum number of hours per week within their Grade B contour, with varying hours depending on the year after the date of enactment. The amendment mandates Class A local TV stations to air a minimum number of hours per week within their Grade B contour, following all obligations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. The amendment requires Class A local TV stations to broadcast a minimum number of hours per week within their Grade B contour, following all obligations under part 73 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. The stations must also address election issues, controversial topics, programming for children, equal employment opportunity, and maintain an amber alert system. The main studio of a qualified class A station should be located within the grade B contour or within 15 miles of the city of license. The market of a qualified class A station is determined by the grade B contour or 35 miles from the cable system's headend, with further adjustments for cable carriage rights in specific cases. The amendments to section 614 of the Communications Act of 1934 do not affect the requirements for Class A local TV stations. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, does not reduce the must-carry rights of any Class A or low-power TV station outside the top 160 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the US as of June 30, 1990. SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY BROADCASTERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1999. Regulations for Treatment of Low-Power Television Broadcast Stations as Class A Stations require the FCC to implement new class A television licenses within 12 months of the Act's enactment. Eligibility standards for low-power stations with valid licenses by December 29, 1999 must be considered to satisfy public interest, convenience, and necessity. The treatment of a low-power television station as a class A station must meet public interest, convenience, and necessity by advancing free over-the-air broadcast television benefits and promoting information dissemination from various sources. The FCC must promptly review and grant license applications for advanced television services within 60 days if the proposed facilities meet requirements."
