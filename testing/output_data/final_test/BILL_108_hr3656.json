    "content": "The \"Quality Nursing Care Act of 2004\" may be cited as such. The Congress finds that hospitals in the United States have inadequate staffing of registered nurses, leading to unsafe levels that compromise patient safety and create a public health crisis. This shortage of nurses affects the quality of healthcare and the work environment for registered nurses. The Federal Government has a compelling interest in promoting the safety of individuals entitled to benefits under the Medicare program by requiring hospitals to establish minimum safe staffing levels for registered nurses. Establishment of minimum staffing ratios by Medicare participating hospitals. Medicare participating hospitals must adopt and implement a staffing system that meets specific requirements, including records maintenance and data collection, as outlined in section 1898 of the Social Security Act. Medicare participating hospitals must comply with staffing system requirements, including data collection and submission, to ensure non-discrimination and retaliation prevention. \"Staffing requirements for Medicare participating hospitals include data collection and submission to ensure non-discrimination and retaliation prevention.\" Each participating hospital must establish a staffing system ensuring appropriate levels of registered nurses on each shift and unit based on patient numbers and care intensity. Input from direct care-giving nurses or their representatives is required for system development. Contextual factors affecting staffing must also be considered. The staffing system in hospitals must consider contextual issues like architecture, geography, and technology. It should also reflect the level of preparation and experience of caregivers, account for staffing deficiencies in various healthcare classifications, follow recommendations from nursing organizations, and allow for adjustable nurse-to-patient ratios based on patient acuity. Registered nurses should not be assigned excessive workloads. The staffing system in hospitals must ensure that registered nurses are qualified to provide care in specific units and be based on valid and reliable methods. It cannot set nurse levels below legal requirements or use minimum nurse-to-patient ratios as maximum limits. Participating hospitals must post daily staffing information for each shift. The hospital must post daily staffing information for each shift, make it available to the public upon request, and submit it to the Secretary.

The Secretary is responsible for making this information publicly available and auditing it for accuracy. Record-keeping, data collection, and evaluation are also required. The participating hospital must maintain records for at least 3 years to determine if they have implemented a staffing system. Data collection on patient acuity and nursing-sensitive outcomes is required to establish the link between the staffing system and patient care. The participating hospital must annually evaluate its staffing system and established minimum registered nurse staffing ratios to ensure reliability and validity. This includes monitoring patient outcomes like falls, adverse events, infections, and operational outcomes such as work-related injuries, turnover rates, and patient complaints related to staffing levels. The evaluation of staffing system and ratios in participating hospitals must be conducted annually by a committee with at least 50% registered nurses. The Secretary is responsible for enforcing the requirements and investigating complaints of violations. The Secretary investigates complaints and enforces violations in participating hospitals. If a violation is found, the hospital must create a corrective action plan and may face civil money penalties up to $10,000 per violation. The Secretary may impose civil money penalties exceeding $10,000 for violations in participating hospitals with a pattern of non-compliance. The names of these hospitals will be published on the Department of Health and Human Services website.

Penalties imposed on hospitals under previous ownership will not be disclosed after a 1-year period. Participating hospitals are prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against whistleblowers.

Employees who face discrimination can seek judicial action for reinstatement and reimbursement of lost wages and benefits. They are also entitled to attorney's fees and costs. Patients who have been discriminated or retaliated against can seek judicial action in a United States District Court. A prevailing patient is entitled to $5,000 in liquidated damages for a violation of this statute, along with attorney's fees and costs. Any action must be brought within 2 years of the discrimination or retaliation. In cases of discrimination or retaliation, adverse employment actions are considered as such, including failure to promote, adverse evaluations, and adverse personnel actions. The section clarifies that it does not exempt individuals from state laws and regulations, nor does it allow prohibited conduct under the National Labor Relations Act. The Secretary will establish necessary regulations, and definitions are provided for clarity within the section. The section defines key terms such as 'participating hospital', 'registered nurse', 'unit', and 'shift' for clarity within the regulations. The amendments made by this section will be effective on January 1, 2005."
