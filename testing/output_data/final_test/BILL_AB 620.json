    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the progress of the high-occupancy toll lanes on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). LACMTA has implemented a low-income assistance program to offset toll impacts, with room for improvement despite meeting objectives. LACMTA and the department should enhance HOT lane performance and increase awareness of the low-income assistance program through advertising and community outreach. Consider offering more incentives to encourage program participation. Section 149.9 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended. Section 149.9 of the Streets and Highways Code is amended to allow the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) to operate high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on State Highway Routes 10 and 110 in Los Angeles County, permitting single-occupant vehicles for a fee. The fee amount will be determined by LACMTA, and enforcement will require electronic transponders for high-occupancy vehicles. LACMTA will implement the HOT lanes program in cooperation with the California Highway Patrol, establishing performance measures to ensure optimal use by high-occupancy vehicles without impacting other traffic on state highways. Agreements between LACMTA, the department, and the California Highway Patrol will outline obligations, responsibilities, and enforcement procedures for the HOT lanes program. Reimbursement for costs incurred in program implementation will be provided from generated revenues or other funding sources. The curr_chunk is about the maintenance of state highway system facilities in connection with the program. The program generates revenue for high-occupancy vehicle facilities and transit improvements in the corridor, with LACMTA overseeing expenses. Single-occupant vehicles certified by LACMTA can use high-occupancy lanes without violating the Vehicle Code. In implementing the program, LACMTA will work with affected communities in the corridors and provide mitigation measures for low-income commuters, including reduced toll charges and toll credits for transit users who meet eligibility requirements for assistance programs under specific sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code. LACMTA will take additional steps to increase enrollment in the low-income assistance program by improving awareness through advertising and working with community groups. They may also offer greater incentives for participation. LACMTA and the department are required to report to the Legislature by January 31, 2015, on the HOT lane program, including user survey results, impact on carpoolers, revenues, transit service effects, toll-paying vehicles, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, California Highway Patrol comments, and mitigation measures for affected communities and commuters. This requirement will expire on January 31, 2019. The subdivision in the Government Code will be inoperative on January 31, 2019. LACMTA and the department must report to the Legislature's transportation committees by December 31, 2018, on efforts to enhance the low-income participation program and HOT lanes' performance in reducing congestion and helping low-income commuters. Toll paying commuters can buy toll equipment, prepay tolls, and renew payments with cash or credit card. LACMTA may issue bonds to finance costs for a value-pricing and transit development program, without entitlement to compensation for adverse effects on toll revenue from competing facilities."
