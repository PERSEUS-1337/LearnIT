    "content": "Since the 1980s, Guatemala has been transitioning towards representative government with the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1985. The country's 36-year civil war ended in 1996 with the signing of the Peace Accords between the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), a left-wing guerrilla group. The Peace Accords signed in Guatemala in 1996 ended the civil conflict and outlined significant political, economic, and social reforms. These reforms included reducing the military size and budget, investing in basic services for the rural and indigenous population, and restructuring state institutions to improve governance and the rule of law. Former President Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) took office in January 2000 after free and fair elections. Despite a past revelation of fatally shooting two men in Mexico in 1982, he won by a large margin in runoff elections. Portillo embraced the Peace Accords as state policy and promised to rule in favor of rural peasants and working-class Guatemalans. Former President Alfonso Portillo of the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG) faced criticism for inadequate implementation of the peace process, human rights violations, drug trafficking, and corruption during his administration. Transparency International ranked Guatemala as the 33rd most corrupt country in 2003. Economic growth slowed, unemployment rose, and deficit spending resumed. Oscar Berger of the Great National Alliance (GANA) was inaugurated as President in 2004, ending the dual-party dominance of the PAN and FRG. Oscar Berger was inaugurated as President in 2004, ending the dual-party dominance of the PAN and FRG. He prioritized fulfilling the Peace Accords, signing a free-trade agreement with the United States, and stimulating the economy through private investment. MINUGUA criticized the organized private sector for opposing efforts to increase taxes. Guatemala's organized private sector has been criticized for hindering tax increases, preventing the country from meeting the Peace Accords' tax base target. In the 2003 elections, Oscar Berger won the presidency with 54% of the vote, while Alvaro Colom of the UNE party lost with 46%. Berger, a pro-business figure, prioritized fulfilling the Peace Accords, signing a free-trade agreement with the US, and promoting private investment. In the 2003 elections, Oscar Berger won the presidency with 54% of the vote, while Alvaro Colom of the UNE party lost with 46%. Colom had moved towards more centrist politics with UNE. The new president was inaugurated in January 2004 for a four-year term. GANA won 49 seats in the Congressional elections, FRG won 42 seats, UNE won 33, and PAN won 16 seats. Berger formed a governing coalition with Colom's party and PAN, creating a 96-seat majority in the legislature. Retired General Efrain Rios Montt, of the FRG, did not run in the second round of the presidential election despite controversy surrounding his candidacy. Rios Montt, a former military dictator, founded the FRG and was named its presidential candidate, despite constitutional provisions banning participants in military coups from running for president. His candidacy raised concerns among the international community, Guatemalan society, and human rights organizations. The Supreme Court temporarily suspended Rios Montt's candidacy, but the Constitutional Court later allowed it, citing his coup before the Constitution was written. Despite being behind in polls, analysts feared electoral victory due to targeted spending, rural support, and potential fraud by the FRG government. President Portillo, Rios Montt's son-in-law, was accused of favoring his candidacy. Prior to the first-round elections, the electoral process in Guatemala was marred by manipulation, violence, and intimidation. Election-related violence led to the deaths of 21 candidates and activists, mostly from opposition parties. The electoral process leading up to the November elections was deemed the most violent since 1986. In 1986, a coalition of grassroots organizations formed a \"civic front for democracy\" to prevent fraud during the election process in Guatemala. Observers noted the second round elections were peaceful and free of fraud, despite concerns about Rios Montt being a destabilizing element. Rios Montt resigned from Congress to run for office, losing his immunity and facing possible prosecution for genocide and other offenses. Opposition to his prosecution may come from his supporters in the military, judiciary, and legislature. President Berger's stance on allowing genocide charges against former general Rios Montt remains unclear. Observers view the repudiation of Rios Montt in the November polls as a positive step for Guatemala's democracy and human rights efforts. Guatemala, with a population of 12 million, faces significant ethnic discrimination and income inequality, particularly affecting the indigenous population. Guatemala's income and wealth distribution is highly skewed, with the top 20% accounting for 54% of total consumption. Indigenous people, making up 50% of the population, only have 25% of total income and consumption. Past policies have excluded and impoverished the indigenous population, leading to economic disparities. Despite having a higher GDP than neighboring countries in the past, social indicators remain low in Guatemala today. Guatemala's per capita GDP is $3,630, with a total GDP of $20.5 billion, the largest in Central America. Despite this, poverty is higher in Guatemala compared to other Central American countries. Estimates vary, with reports indicating that 80% of Guatemalans live in poverty, with 75% in rural areas and 76% of indigenous people living in poverty. Poverty has slightly increased in 2001-2002, with 54% of the population living in poverty. Guatemala's GDP was $22 billion in 2001, with a growth rate of 3.3% in 2000, 2.1% in 2001, and 2.3% in 2002. Low coffee prices slowed growth, but traditional exports like coffee and sugar still drive the economy. Non-traditional exports such as clothing and tourism have also seen growth. Challenges to growth include illiteracy, crime, and limited capital market. The 36-year civil war had significant social and economic costs, impacting growth rates in the 1980s. Guatemala's social indicators remain poor with high malnutrition rates and illiteracy. The country's infant mortality rate is 43 per 1,000 live births, and under-5 mortality rate is 58 per 1,000 children. The average schooling level is only 4.3 years, with women, indigenous people, and rural poor having the lowest levels. Severe malnutrition among the rural poor was triggered by a rural economic crisis in 2001. The Guatemalan government agreed to implement a more inclusive development strategy in 2001 as part of the Peace Accords, aiming to reduce poverty, improve living conditions, and increase access to education and health services. However, the implementation of these provisions for indigenous peoples and women has been slow. The Portillo Administration outlined a poverty reduction strategy in 2002 to address these issues. The 2002 poverty reduction strategy aimed to address social spending issues, with slight improvements reported in 2003. However, the amounts allocated to key social ministries were still deemed insufficient. The indigenous population and women faced limited opportunities and discrimination in the labor market, primarily in lower-paying agricultural jobs. The government must address obstacles such as higher malnutrition rates, lack of basic utility services, wage discrimination, and discriminatory treatment by public officials and service providers. Guatemala has been criticized for not meeting the minimum tax revenue target of 12% of GDP as agreed upon in the Peace Accords. International donors at a May 2003 meeting urged the government to increase tax revenue, reduce military spending, and boost social spending. The organized private sector was also blamed for opposing tax increases, limiting funding for social ministries and justice institutions. President Berger advocated for a free-trade agreement. President Berger, supported by coffee and sugar producers, aims to sign a free-trade agreement with the United States to boost the economy through private investment. Guatemala's history includes a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996 with the Peace Accords, which established a Truth Commission to investigate human rights violations. The Truth Commission investigated human rights violations and violence during Guatemala's armed conflict from 1960 to 1996. Over 200,000 people died or disappeared, with 80% being indigenous Mayans. The Commission concluded that the state, mainly the army, was responsible for 93% of the violations, amounting to genocide. The state's repressive response was disproportionate to the insurgency's military force. The response to the insurgency in Guatemala was deemed disproportionate, with the majority of victims being civilians. Following the Peace Accord in 1994, Guatemala requested a U.N. mission to verify human rights compliance. The United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) regularly issues reports and recommendations. In 2003, MINUGUA was extended and supported by a U.N. Human Rights Commission. An \"Investigating Committee on Illegal Security Corps and Clandestine Organizations\" was established in 2004, endorsed by then-President-elect Berger. Guatemala's commitment to human rights is emphasized. Guatemala's commitment to human rights is outlined in various laws and international agreements. The 1996 Peace Accords included the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights, which took effect in 1994. The government pledged to protect human rights, strengthen institutions, combat impunity, regulate security forces, and ensure the right to life, liberty, and justice according to the national constitution. Title II of Guatemala's laws covers \"Human Rights,\" establishing basic civil and political rights, including the right to life, liberty, equality, and due process of the law. International treaties and conventions ratified by Guatemala take precedence over municipal law in the area of human rights. The law of Amparo, Habeus Corpus, and Constitutionality ensures protection of human rights and the functioning of constitutional guarantees. Guatemala's obligations to respect human rights stem from the OAS Charter, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, and the American Convention on Human Rights, which Guatemala ratified in 1978. Guatemala accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court in 1987. Guatemala is a party to various regional human rights agreements and international obligations, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. While human rights conditions improved from 1994 to mid-1998, there has been a reported deterioration since then, especially leading up to the November 2003 elections. Despite this, the armed conflict has ended, and state policies of human rights abuses during the conflict have ceased. The armed conflict in Guatemala has ended, and state policies of human rights abuses during the conflict have been terminated. Sectors of society previously excluded from political processes have been able to participate, and institutional reforms have been initiated. However, there are concerns that civilian power over military forces is progressing slowly, security forces continue to commit human rights violations with impunity, and Civilian Defense Patrols responsible for violations have re-emerged. Presidents Arzu and Portillo acknowledged past human rights violations and committed to improving human rights conditions. President Portillo, upon taking office in January 2000, embraced the Peace Accords as state policy and acknowledged deficiencies in public security and the administration of justice. The Portillo Administration ratified international human rights instruments to address these issues. President Portillo's Administration ratified international human rights instruments, such as the Protocol of San Salvador, in October 2000. The Administration was praised for its positive approach in dealing with human rights cases, recognizing institutional responsibility for violations and committing to comply with recommendations. However, these initiatives were noted to have had little impact on the overall enjoyment of human rights in daily life. President Berger's administration, which began in January 2004, promised to adhere strictly to the Peace Accords. Key figures in his government, such as Vice-President Eduardo Stein and advisor General Otto Perez, have played significant roles in negotiating or promoting the Accords. Despite appointing Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu as a goodwill ambassador, concerns have been raised by international organizations about the government's limited efforts to improve human rights conditions in Guatemala. Human rights conditions in Guatemala initially improved after the Peace Accords, but have since worsened according to human rights organizations. Despite some progress, there has been polarization in the political debate and isolated cases of rights violations. The overall human rights situation has seen improvements from 1994 to mid-1998. The human rights situation in Guatemala improved from 1994 to mid-1998 but has since stagnated and shown signs of deterioration. Human rights groups have raised concerns about the government's failure to adhere to the implementation timetable of the Peace Accords, with many commitments being rescheduled to later years. The Consultative Group for Guatemala called for a reinvigoration of the peace process in 2002, but a year later, the U.N. reported disappointing progress in implementing the accords. Some progress has been made in demilitarizing Guatemala and strengthening civilian power, such as disbanding the Presidential Guard unit known for human rights abuses. However, failure to fully demilitarize the state remains a serious problem, with the army expanding its role in law enforcement functions instead of separating from the National Civil Police as called for in the Peace Accords. The National Civilian Police Academy's budget was reduced, weakening the force. Excesses in the military budget and lack of transparency are reported as persistent problems. Military budget exceeded the ceiling set by the Peace Accords, with increased spending in 2001 and 2002. MINUGUA warned about increased military spending diverting funds from social spending, while the government failed to dismantle illegal security forces as promised. President Portillo cooperated with a U.N. commission in 2003 to investigate clandestine structures but did not fully implement a new defense policy, including creating a civilian intelligence system. Observers raised concerns about the resurgence of these structures. President Berger's administration has faced challenges in asserting civilian power over the military and addressing military impunity for past human rights violations. Retired General Efrain Rios Montt's influence in the 2003 elections and the debate over legal proceedings against him have raised concerns. Continued impunity for human rights violations remains a significant obstacle, as identified by MINUGUA. The main obstacle to the effective enjoyment of human rights is identified as abusers, with an entrenched phenomenon of impunity. Factors contributing to this include ineffective administration of justice, government failure to investigate and punish offenders, and high-level officials obstructing efforts to address human rights violations. Despite some convictions in important cases, many human rights cases face long delays in the judicial process, with advances in addressing impunity often being reversed. For example, three military officers were convicted in 2001 for the murder of Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi in 1998. In 1998, the Archbishop's Human Rights Office member was murdered two days after a critical report on past human rights violations. Their sentences were annulled in 2002, and a retrial was ordered. Security forces in Guatemala continued to commit serious human rights violations in 2002, including extrajudicial killings and torture. Lynchings increased from 2001 to 2002, with some involving local leaders and former Civil Defense Patrol members. The number of deaths from lynchings decreased due to improved police efforts. Clandestine security units still exist, prompting the creation of a Commission of Investigation into Illegal Groups. Human rights observers have reported a climate of intimidation. Human rights observers have reported an increased climate of intimidation over the past two years in Guatemala. Activists, judicial officials, trial witnesses, journalists, and labor organizers have been threatened and attacked. The State Department traced these threats to groups related to the Guatemalan government. The reorganization of Civilian Defense Patrols has caused insecurity and instability in rural areas, threatening the Peace Accords and reconciliation efforts. The Portillo administration compensated former PAC members in 2002 to gain votes, but Guatemala's highest court deemed the payments unconstitutional in December 2003. The court's decision halted the disbursement of two scheduled payments in 2004. Guatemala faces inequitable distribution of wealth, with the top fifth of the population holding 54% of total consumption. Indigenous people, who make up nearly half the population, only account for a quarter of the wealth. Indigenous people in Guatemala make up close to half the population but only account for a quarter of the wealth. Poverty is widespread, with estimates varying from 80% to 54% of the population living in poverty. Social indicators such as infant mortality and illiteracy are among the worst in the hemisphere. Guatemala's social programs have slight improvements in the national budget, but funding for key ministries remains low. Indigenous Mayans, who make up half the population, face economic and social marginalization with high poverty rates. The government has agreed to inclusive development strategies to reduce poverty and improve access to education and healthcare. The Portillo Administration in Guatemala outlined a poverty reduction strategy in 2002 to improve living conditions and increase access to education and health services. However, implementation of elements related to indigenous rights from the Peace Accords is behind schedule. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights notes that access to education is still a challenge, especially for women, indigenous people, and the rural poor, with low levels of schooling. The indigenous and women face discrimination in the labor market, with limited opportunities for higher-paying jobs. The World Bank's Poverty Assessment highlights that lower-paying jobs in agriculture may not effectively reduce poverty for the indigenous population. The report highlights obstacles hindering social and economic advancement among the indigenous poor in Guatemala, including higher malnutrition rates, wage discrimination, and discriminatory treatment by public officials. U.S. policy objectives in Guatemala focus on strengthening democratic institutions, promoting human rights, combating drug trafficking, and supporting economic growth. Relations between Guatemala and the United States have been close but strained at times by human rights issues. The Bush Administration expressed concerns over the Portillo Administration's failure to implement Peace Accords, government corruption, and lack of cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts. U.S. assistance to Guatemala from 1997 to 2003 supported Peace Accords with almost $400 million. Assistance shifted in FY2004 to activities like developing justice centers, increasing transparency, and reducing corruption through USAID's Democracy, Conflict and. U.S. assistance to Guatemala has declined by over a third in the past three years, from almost $60 million in FY2002 to $38 million requested for FY2005. The request for FY2005 includes funds for Child Survival and Health Programs, development assistance, Economic Support funds, and food assistance programs. Congress criticized the Administration's strategy of reducing staffing and funding for Guatemala for FY2004, stating it would limit the ability of the United States to be responsive at a critical juncture in Guatemala's history. In recent years, Congress has pushed for the declassification of information on the murder of U.S. citizens in Guatemala. USAID's Central America Program in Guatemala focuses on free trade, natural resource management, HIV/AIDS services, and rural income diversification. Conditions on military assistance were imposed by Congress from 1986 to 1990 due to concerns over human rights abuses. The George H. Bush Administration suspended military aid in 1990 for the same reason. The Berger Administration has lobbied Washington to ease the military aid prohibition in Guatemala, citing reductions in military size and proposed reforms. They argue that funds are needed for modernization, border protection, and counternarcotics efforts. Human rights groups acknowledge the reduction in forces but call for additional reforms. Some human rights groups applaud the reduction in forces in Guatemala but express concerns about the lack of other reforms required by the Peace Accords, such as adopting a military doctrine limiting the military to external defense. They also raise issues about human rights abuses, impunity, and corruption among military officials. The proposed U.N. Commission for the Investigation of Illegal Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Organizations (CICIACS) has not been formed yet, which is crucial for investigating and prosecuting clandestine groups involved in human rights violations, drug trafficking, and organized crime. Some argue that the U.S. ban on military aid should not be lifted until these reforms are carried out. Guatemala and the United States signed a framework agreement on trade and investment in 1991, leading to the establishment of a bilateral Trade and Investment Council. The signing of the Guatemalan Peace Accords in 1996 facilitated foreign investment in Guatemala. In 2000, Guatemala was certified to receive export trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade and Partnership Act, with the United States being its top trade partner. Guatemala's primary exports include coffee, sugar, bananas, fruits, and vegetables, with 55.3% of exports going to the United States. In 2002, the U.S. trade deficit with Guatemala was $758 million, with U.S. exports at $2.0 billion and imports at $2.8 billion. U.S. foreign direct investment in Guatemala was $907 million in 2000, dropping to $477 million in 2001. President Berger aims to attract domestic and foreign investment to revive the economy. Guatemala supports a Free Trade Agreement with the United States for economic integration with neighbors. Guatemala established free trade agreements with El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua in 1993, later adding the Dominican Republic. Negotiations are ongoing to include Chile. Supporters believe the agreements will benefit farmers and reduce migration to the United States. However, there are concerns that small farmers may struggle to compete with subsidized U.S. products. The Central American governments agreed to include staple food crops like corn, rice, and beans in the trade agreement with the U.S. Quotas on sensitive agricultural imports will increase over time, with most tariffs eliminated by 2020. White corn will have perpetual protection, with increasing quotas but high tariffs. The trade agreement includes quotas on sensitive agricultural imports that will increase over time, with most tariffs eliminated by 2020. However, high tariffs on white corn imports above the quota level will remain indefinitely. Some U.S. industries, such as sugar growers and textile producers, have criticized the agreement for potentially harming their businesses. Supporters argue that the agreement will generate new jobs, but some Members of Congress are concerned about inadequate protection of labor rights. Critics are concerned that labor rights in Guatemala are inadequately protected under the DR-CAFTA agreement. They argue that the labor provisions are less stringent than those in U.S. trade arrangements, only requiring enforcement of existing laws without meeting international standards. Advocates believe technical cooperation programs will improve law enforcement, but the AFL-CIO maintains it is insufficient to address deep-seated issues. In response to criticism about labor rights under DR-CAFTA, Central American labor and trade ministers met in Washington in July 2004 to strengthen compliance with labor laws. They announced the formation of a working group to develop recommendations for each country and the region, led by Vice Ministers. Guatemalan Trade Minister Marcio Cuevas emphasized the importance of the labor dimension in passing CAFTA and committed to taking necessary actions for compliance and enforcement. The ministers plan to meet again in October to discuss implementation of the recommendations. The U.S. government, international organizations, and independent watchdog organizations have criticized Guatemala for extensive corruption, which allegedly increased under the Portillo Administration. Transparency International ranked Guatemala as the 33rd most corrupt country out of 133 in 2003. Guatemala was listed as one of nine countries with heavy business regulations but weak enforcement systems, making it susceptible to bribery and corruption. The Bush Administration identified corruption as the main obstacle to the effectiveness of U.S. programs in Guatemala. In Guatemala, corruption is pervasive in customs transactions despite efforts to improve operations. President Berger has prioritized governance and anti-corruption measures, introducing a code of ethics and investigating corruption in the previous government. Guatemala is a major drug-transit country for cocaine and heroin. According to reports, Guatemala is a key transit country for cocaine en route to the US and Europe, with significant amounts passing through the country despite efforts to improve counternarcotics measures. President Bush designated Guatemala as one of three countries that \"failed demonstrably\" in fulfilling international counter narcotics obligations in 2003, but continued US assistance was granted. In September 2003, Guatemala was removed from the \"failed demonstrably\" list for its efforts to improve counter narcotics practices. This included allowing U.S. security forces to enter its airspace and waters for joint operations. The Financial Action Task Force also removed Guatemala from its list of non-cooperative countries in July 2004 due to progress in anti-money laundering legislation. Guatemala still faces a growing domestic drug abuse problem. Guatemala has a domestic drug abuse problem. The government has an aggressive demand reduction program. Legislation restricts military education and training for Guatemala to civilian personnel only. Funds for training must go through notification procedures. Foreign Military Financing is prohibited. There is a call for the investigation of murders of American citizens in Guatemala since 1999. The enactment orders federal agencies to declassify and release information to victims' families. It prohibits Foreign Military Financing for Guatemala and restricts military education and training to civilian personnel only. USAID foreign service employees in Latin America cannot be reduced without notification. Regarding USAID operations in Guatemala, the conference report (H.Rept. 108-401) expresses concerns about substantial staffing reductions in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, stating that it does not align with U.S. priorities in the region. The report highlights Guatemala's post-conflict challenges and urges USAID to consider establishing a long-term child nutrition program based on the success of a nutritional drink in reducing malnutrition among Guatemalan children. The conference report highlights concerns about staffing reductions in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua not aligning with U.S. priorities in the region. It urges USAID to consider establishing a long-term child nutrition program to reduce severe malnutrition rates among Central American children. The report does not include the Senate's earmark for the Commission to Investigate Illegal Groups in Guatemala but recommends providing at least $250,000 for this effort in FY2004. The conference agreement addresses concerns about releasing information on murders of American citizens in Guatemala since December 1999. The U.S. Attorney General ordered agencies to review relevant information for possible release to victims' families. Congress expects a report on the international coffee crisis strategy to be released soon. The Central American Security Act, H.R. 1300, extends permanent resident status adjustment provisions to Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran nationals. The Human Rights Information Act, H.R. 2534, promotes human rights by declassifying and disclosing documents on human rights abuses in Guatemala and Honduras. The Senate introduced S.Res. 289 (Dorgan) to renegotiate CAFTA provisions regarding access to the U.S. sugar market. The resolution aims to limit Central American signatories' access and exclude sugar from any free trade agreement. Introduced on January 23, 2004, it was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance."
