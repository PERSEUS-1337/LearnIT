    "content": "After more than two years of negotiations, the EU and South Korea signed a bilateral free trade agreement on October 6, 2010. The agreement was ratified by both the South Korean National Assembly and the EU Parliament, coming into effect on July 1, 2011. The South Korea-EU FTA is the largest in market size for South Korea, with the US-South Korea FTA being the second-largest. The KOREU FTA aims to strengthen economic ties outside their home regions and reflects the surge in trade and investment flows between South Korea and the EU over the past decade. The KOREU FTA, signed in 2010, mirrors the scope of the KORUS FTA with some exceptions. It reduces and eliminates tariffs and trade barriers in various sectors but differs in coverage and treatment of sensitive sectors like automobiles. Unlike the KORUS FTA, the KOREU FTA does not include a chapter on foreign direct investment or allow trade sanctions for labor and environmental violations. The KOREU FTA, signed in 2010, is of interest to U.S. policymakers and the business community due to its potential impact on U.S.-South Korean trade. It could divert some South Korean trade to the EU, giving the EU an advantage. This report sheds light on the KOREU FTA, reviewing EU-South Korean economic ties, objectives, and major provisions in areas like autos, manufacturing, agriculture, services, and labor. The report analyzes the KOREU FTA and its potential implications for the United States, focusing on trade in goods and services and two-way foreign direct investment (FDI) between the EU and South Korea. The report does not compare the KORUS FTA with the KOREU FTA directly, as their priorities and measurement models differ. South Korea has a smaller market compared to the US and EU, with 48.6 million consumers and a GDP of $1.4 trillion. In 2009, the EU was the second-largest market for South Korean exports, accounting for 13% of total exports. The EU was also the third-largest source of South Korean imports, with a 10% share. The US accounted for 10% of South Korean exports and 9% of imports. In 2009, EU-South Korean trade increased by 8.4% annually, surpassing total U.S.-South Korea trade. South Korea's major trading partners within the EU are Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Manufactured goods dominate trade between the EU and South Korea, with machinery and transportation equipment being the largest category. The dominance of manufacturing in EU-South Korean trade suggests intra-industry trade and transnational production networks. Services trade has also increased, with EU exports to South Korea rising 42% and South Korean exports to the EU increasing 36% between 2004 and 2008. Leading types of EU services exports to South Korea in 2008 included transportation, business services, and intellectual property royalties. In 2008, EU services exports to South Korea included transportation, business services, travel, receipts, royalties, and insurance. Economic ties between the EU and South Korea also involve foreign direct investment (FDI), with EU FDI in South Korea increasing from 2004 to 2007 before decreasing in 2008. South Korean FDI in the EU increased from 2004 to 2007 but declined in 2008. The EU is a significant source of FDI in South Korea, accounting for 32.3% of total FDI in 2008. The EU and South Korea have been accelerating their negotiations for bilateral FTAs, moving away from their previous reliance on the WTO and regional preferential trade arrangements. The EU has been a pioneer in negotiating preferential trade arrangements, using them to strengthen trade relations with neighboring countries. The EU has been using preferential trade arrangements to strengthen trade relations with neighboring countries and former colonies among developing countries. The FTA with South Korea is part of the EU's Global Europe strategy to reduce trade barriers and liberalize markets for foreign investment. The EU's Global Europe strategy aims to reduce trade barriers through FTAs, focusing on complex issues like competition policy and intellectual property rights enforcement. FTAs are seen as more suitable for addressing these issues compared to multilateral negotiations in the WTO. The strategy selects FTA partners based on market potential and growth opportunities. The European Commission identified South Korea as a priority country for an FTA due to its potential growth opportunities and the removal of trade barriers. South Korea has been actively pursuing FTAs as part of its economic strategy, with the KOREU FTA being the EU's first completed FTA in Asia. President Lee of South Korea aims to enhance national competitiveness by diversifying FTA partners and creating a \"free-trade network\" by 2014. The KOREU FTA aligns with his vision of a \"Global Korea\" and covers various economic activities in the EU-South Korean bilateral relationship. The KOREU FTA, consisting of 15 chapters and special sector-specific annexes, eliminates tariffs on most manufactured goods in the EU-South Korea trade within seven years. It also addresses non-tariff barriers, trade rules, intellectual property rights, labor rights, and environmental protection, aiming to boost exports from the EU to South Korea. The KOREU FTA aims to increase exports between the EU and South Korea, focusing on various manufacturing sectors. It also aims to boost FDI flows, particularly EU investment in South Korea. Key areas of importance include trade in manufactured goods, agriculture, services, IPR, worker rights, and environmental protection. The agreement eliminates tariffs on most manufactured goods within seven years and addresses non-tariff barriers. The KOREU FTA focuses on increasing exports between the EU and South Korea, particularly in manufacturing sectors. It includes the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers on manufactured goods. Bilateral trade in cars has been a major point of contention, especially regarding competition between South Korean and European car manufacturers. The KOREU FTA aims to increase exports between the EU and South Korea, focusing on the manufacturing sector. Negotiations involved the elimination of tariffs on cars and changes in regulations. Under the agreement, both parties removed tariffs on passenger cars, trucks, and auto parts over five years. The 2010 supplemental agreement to the KORUS FTA changed the original terms, aligning the U.S. and EU on a similar tariff elimination schedule. South Korea will eliminate its 8% tariff on U.S. passenger cars within five years, except for the 25% U.S. truck tariff which will be phased out in year 10. The agreements also differ on motor vehicle safeguards and rules of origin. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA diverge on rules of origin for automotive products. KORUS allows three options for calculating regional value content, while KOREU requires a specific method limiting foreign content to 45% of the ex-works price. Both agreements aim for at least 55% of the content to come from specific regions. Administration experts argue that the requirements in both agreements are essentially equivalent. The KOREU FTA introduces a duty drawback mechanism allowing exporters to receive rebates on customs duties paid on imports integrated into exported products. This provision is the first of its kind in EU trading agreements and is particularly beneficial for automotive exports. South Korean car manufacturers can import parts from low-cost countries like China, claim back duties, and export assembled vehicles to the EU, avoiding tariffs that EU companies would typically pay. The KOREU FTA introduces a duty drawback provision allowing South Korean producers to relocate production to lower cost countries. European auto manufacturers are concerned about the potential influx of autos with Chinese components. The agreement includes a provision to cap refundable tariffs at 5% in case of increased foreign sourcing. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association strongly opposes this provision. The KORUS FTA does not mention duty drawback, allowing the practice without safeguards. Foreign automakers must meet South Korea's safety and environmental standards to sell in the relatively small market, leading to customization of vehicles and higher costs. U.S. car manufacturers, like Ford, face barriers due to unique automobile standards in South Korea. These standards have been a key factor in delaying further consideration of trade agreements in Congress. EU negotiators also prioritize automotive standards in trade negotiations with South Korea. The KOREU FTA includes NTB reforms on automotive trade, adopting UNECE standards for regulatory convergence. South Korea will align 29 safety standards with UNECE over five years. New standards will be based on UNECE to avoid hindering trade. The KORUS FTA allows U.S. automakers to sell up to 25,000 vehicles per year in South Korea built to U.S. safety standards. The KOREU FTA allows U.S. carmakers to sell up to 25,000 vehicles per year in South Korea built to U.S. safety standards without additional modifications, four times the limit in the 2007 KORUS FTA. This eliminates the need for costly alterations to meet South Korean standards, promoting easier exports to the South Korean market. The agreement also includes provisions on auto emissions standards and establishes a working group on motor vehicles to address potential trade barriers related to testing and certification standards. The KOREU FTA covers industries like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, with tariffs on imports of pharmaceutical products being phased out immediately or within three years. Tariffs on medical device exports will also be removed, addressing non-tariff barriers and aligning practices with international standards for a more secure regulatory environment. The KOREU FTA introduces detailed rules on transparency for reimbursement decisions and pricing, with provisions requiring objectivity and clarity. The pending KORUS FTA includes NTB provisions to improve transparency in reimbursement, simplify regulatory policies, and enforce pharmaceutical patent rights. A Working Group on Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices is established under the KOREU FTA for regulatory cooperation. The KOREU FTA includes provisions on non-tariff barriers for consumer electronics, allowing EU exporters to conduct safety testing in the EU. It also abolishes most tariffs on textiles and apparel, similar to the KORUS FTA. The KORUS FTA adopts a \"yarn forward\" rule for apparel, with a special textile safeguard. EU manufacturers face tariffs on industrial products exported to South Korea, but under the KOREU FTA, the EU will eliminate import tariffs on industrial goods within five years. Under the KOREU FTA, the EU will eliminate import tariffs on industrial goods within five years, while South Korea will remove all tariffs within seven years, faster than the KORUS FTA. Provisions in both agreements address non-tariff barriers in major industrial sectors to facilitate trade. The KOREU FTA includes provisions on rules of origin for autos, competition laws, and regulatory transparency. Protocols attached to the agreement also impact manufactured goods trade, specifically regarding rules of origin criteria and duty drawback provisions. The KOREU FTA includes duty drawback provisions and protocols for facilitating customs issues. The agreement acknowledges South Korea's sensitivity on some agricultural products, leaving in place quotas and high tariffs. EU agricultural exports to South Korea in 2009 accounted for almost 5% of total EU merchandise exports to the country. The KOREU FTA will reduce South Korea's high tariffs and restrictive quotas on most agricultural imports from the EU over a 20-year period. EU exporters will receive immediate duty-free status for almost 30% of the agricultural exports they currently ship to South Korea. The KOREU FTA provides duty-free access for 62% of EU agricultural products to Korea, with tariff reduction schedules and quota expansion similar to the KORUS FTA. However, South Korea can protect sensitive products differently. EU quotas in Korea may be smaller due to being a smaller supplier compared to the US. For example, in year five, the EU's natural honey quota is 54 MT compared to the US's 225 MT. South Korea's quotas for certain dairy products, natural honey, and oranges from the EU will be capped at the end of their transition periods. The EU-27 quotas will be capped at the end of their transition periods, while the US quotas will continue to increase annually. South Korea has safeguards against import surges triggering temporary tariff increases. The elimination of tariffs will benefit EU agricultural exporters, particularly in pork, wine, spirits, and processed foods. The KOREU FTA's sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) chapter outlines commitments and processes for addressing health issues in bilateral trade of agricultural products, focusing on animal welfare standards and disease-free areas. A SPS committee is established to resolve problems, similar to the KORUS FTA. The KORUS FTA and KOREU FTA emphasize using science and risk-based assessment to resolve SPS issues through bilateral cooperation. Dispute settlement provisions cannot address SPS matters in bilateral trade. The KOREU FTA has more extensive provisions on geographic indications (GIs) for products like wines and agricultural goods. GIs are valuable in international trade for identifying goods' geographical origins. The EU secured additional protection for GI-designated agricultural and beverage products in its FTA with South Korea, including 162 GI-designated products. South Korea also gained GI recognition in the EU market for 64 of its products. The U.S. dairy sector expressed concerns about potential competition from EU cheeses in the South Korean market. Members of Congress have urged the USTR to ensure that South Korean regulations do not undercut U.S. generically labeled cheeses in the market. The EU prioritized increased market access for services in South Korea, given the competitiveness of EU-based providers. EU and South Korea adhere to GATS, but EU and U.S. providers see it as a first step in establishing trade agreements. The GATS, resulting from the Uruguay Round negotiations, is seen as a first step in establishing a multilateral framework on trade in services. However, its trade liberalizing commitments are considered insufficient by many WTO members. The KOREU FTA expands on these commitments, addressing rules for EU-South Korea trade in services and establishing principles for bilateral trade. This includes non-discriminatory treatment, market access, and the establishment of a commercial presence through investment. The KOREU FTA expands on GATS commitments, focusing on non-discriminatory treatment, market access, and establishing principles for bilateral trade in services. It uses a \"positive list approach\" for commitments, covering a broad range of services similar to the KORUS FTA. The KOREU FTA expands on GATS commitments, focusing on non-discriminatory treatment and market access for various services. South Korea gained increased access to EU markets for multiple services, but not for audiovisual services. The agreement mirrors the KORUS FTA in terms of market access for EU providers in South Korea. The European Commission considers the KOREU FTA to be the most comprehensive EU FTA in terms of services trade. EU prioritized securing South Korea's commitment to allow EU law firms to expand their presence. EU firms can open representative offices in South Korea to advise on non-Korean law. They can enter cooperative agreements with Korean law firms after two years and form joint ventures after five years. Similar provisions are in place for U.S. law firms under the KORUS FTA. In telecommunication services, South Korea will allow EU-owned telecommunications providers to own 100% of Korean-based providers, except for KT Corporation and SK Telecom. Under the KOREU FTA, South Korea will allow EU satellite television providers to offer cross-border transmission services without needing a domestic telecom tie. This benefits EU providers, while U.S. satellite broadcasters' access is unclear. EU and South Korea agreed to provide financial market access similar to the KORUS FTA, with EU commitments being member-specific. EU commitments in services are member-specific, with 21 EU countries and South Korea agreeing to open up their markets in insurance and financial services under the KOREU FTA. This includes allowing financial institutions to provide services across borders and opening markets for risk management services. The agreement is cautious in some aspects but forward-looking in others, covering all financial services. The KORUS FTA covers all financial services, with distinctions between services sold through commercial presence and cross-border trade. It includes banking and insurance services listed in the agreement for cross-border trade. The KORUS FTA covers banking and insurance services listed in the agreement for cross-border trade, with trade remedy provisions closely resembling those in the KOREU FTA. Special safeguard measures are included to counter adverse effects of import surges, and both sides commit to abide by WTO agreements. Under the KOREU FTA, government procurement contracts are opened up to bids from providers of signatory countries, including the EU, South Korea, and the United States. The agreement reaffirms commitments to abide by WTO agreements on antidumping and countervailing duty measures. The KOREU FTA expands trade liberalization provisions to more public agencies than the GPA requires. It lowers thresholds for eligibility of contracts, potentially increasing government procurement opportunities. The agreement includes a special section for BOT and public works contracts above 15 million SDRs. The EU sees this as significant as these contracts are not covered by the WTO GPA. The KOREU FTA reaffirms commitments to uphold WTO TRIPS provisions. The KOREU FTA reaffirms South Korea's commitment to uphold international conventions on intellectual property protection, including copyrights, trademarks, and patents. It also includes provisions to assist owners in obtaining payment for the use of their IP and extends authors' rights to 70 years after death. Additionally, the agreement preserves the integrity of certain geographical indications important to EU producers. The KOREU FTA combines provisions on workers' rights and environmental standards, committing both sides to uphold ILO core labor standards and implement multilateral environment agreements. It also includes measures to monitor the implementation of these provisions. The KOREU FTA includes provisions on workers' rights and environmental standards, with a panel of experts to resolve issues. Disputes can only be resolved through consultations without sanctions. Studies suggest a positive impact on the economies of the EU and South Korea, with a larger relative impact on the South Korean economy. The KOREU FTA is expected to have a greater impact on the South Korean economy compared to the EU due to its smaller size, higher dependence on the EU market, and higher trade barriers. Studies show that South Korea's GDP may increase by 1%-2% after the agreement, while the EU's GDP is expected to increase by less than 0.05%. The KORUS FTA had similar effects on the United States and South Korea. The KOREU FTA is expected to have a significant impact on specific sectors in the economies of the EU and South Korea. EU service providers, particularly in retail, wholesale trade, transportation, financial services, and business services, are likely to benefit the most from the agreement due to their competitiveness and the relatively closed nature of the South Korean services market. EU exporters of pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, electronics parts, and some agricultural goods and processed foods will benefit from the KOREU FTA. South Korean producers of cars, ships, wireless telecommunications devices, chemical products, and imaging equipment will also see an increase in exports to the EU market."
