    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Timber Innovation Act of 2016\". Congress finds that wood products are vital to the US economy, employing over 548,000 individuals in manufacturing and forestry. Private forest owners support millions of jobs and billions in payroll. Supporting wood buildings and expanding market opportunities could benefit forests, create income for owners, and promote sustainable land use. Developing new markets for wood in buildings is crucial. (5) Developing new markets for wood in buildings can drive investment in hazardous fuels treatments on forest land;\n(6) Innovative wood technologies enable longer spans, taller walls, and higher buildings, expanding wood use in construction;\n(7) Wood as a building material sequesters carbon, reducing the overall carbon footprint of projects;\n(8) Research modernizes building codes internationally, especially for tall wood buildings;\n(9) Building codes ensure safety standards for all building materials and systems. Building materials must meet safety standards regardless of the material used. Wood construction projects must adhere to building codes for safety. Mass timber buildings have inherent fire resistance, allowing for taller and larger structures. National Forest System lands provide a sustainable source of wood. National Forest System lands are a sustainable source of wood for mass timber and tall wood buildings. The Act defines \"mass timber\" as large panelized wood construction and \"tall wood building\" as a building over 85 feet in height using mass timber. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the \"Secretary.\" Additionally, a research program is established for advancing tall wood building construction. The Secretary will establish a research program to advance tall wood building construction in the US. Activities include conducting research at the Forest Products Laboratory and providing grants to higher education institutions. Collaboration with the wood products industry and conservation organizations is essential. The research program aims to improve tall wood building construction through competitive grants to higher education institutions. Priorities include commercialization, safety analysis, environmental footprint calculations, building code modifications, and reducing environmental impact. The research program aims to improve tall wood building construction through competitive grants to higher education institutions. Priorities include analyzing the environmental footprint of tall wood building construction, potential implications on wildlife and forest biodiversity, and other research areas identified by the Secretary. Measurable performance goals for the research should be achievable within a 5-year timeframe. The Secretary will conduct an annual tall wood building design competition from 2017 to 2021, funded by appropriations. Additionally, a Wood Innovation Grant Program will be implemented. The Wood Innovation Grant Program allows for grants to be given to eligible entities such as individuals, public or private entities, and government bodies for the purpose of advancing innovative wood products for tall wood building construction. The Wood Innovation Grant Program prioritizes proposals that utilize existing sawmill facilities in counties with high unemployment rates. Recipients must match the grant amount with funds from non-Federal sources. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary, in collaboration with State foresters and extension directors, will implement an education and technical assistance program for mass timber applications. Activities include providing assistance for skill development, identifying usage opportunities, and promoting public understanding of environmental, economic, and social values. The program aims to promote the use of wood in building construction, emphasizing sustainable forest management and market development. It includes educational materials, events for knowledge transfer, and collaboration with experts. The Secretary will partner with non-Federal entities to enhance tall wood building commercialization in the United States, develop technical assistance, and carry out the program."
