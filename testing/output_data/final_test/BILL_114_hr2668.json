    "content": "The \"National Care Corps Act of 2015\" establishes the National Care Corps, defines key terms like Corps and Director, and sets up local care corps programs funded by grants. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is also mentioned in the Act. The National Care Corps is established in the Department of Health and Human Services, with volunteers providing approved services through local programs. A Director is appointed to design and administer Corps programs, manage operations, and employ necessary staff. SEC. 4. SELECTION AND ELIGIBILITY OF VOLUNTEERS. The Director selects eligible individuals as Corps volunteers, complying with nondiscrimination laws. To be eligible, individuals must be at least 18 years old, commit to a maximum of 24 months in the Corps, and submit an application as required by the Director. Before being selected as a Corps volunteer, individuals must agree to comply with the Director's requirements, pass a nationwide criminal background check, and be deemed fit for service by the Director based on the results of the check. Authorized benefits for Corps volunteers. The Director shall provide Corps volunteers with allowances, health insurance, and post-service educational awards to ensure their well-being and effectiveness in service. Allowances include living, travel, and leave allowances, as well as housing, transportation, supplies, equipment, and subsistence. Health insurance coverage meeting specific requirements will be provided, along with post-service educational awards. The Director will establish an educational award for Corps volunteers, allowing each volunteer to receive up to 2 awards, one for each term of service. For a full term of 12 months, a volunteer will receive an educational award equivalent to the maximum amount of a Federal Pell Grant. The educational award for Corps volunteers allows for up to 2 awards per volunteer, with double the value for those pursuing a degree in a health care profession. For volunteers completing less than a 12-month term, the award amount is adjusted accordingly. For Corps volunteers completing less than 12 months of full-time service, they may receive a portion of the educational award corresponding to the service completed. If a volunteer serves more than 12 months but less than 24 months, they can receive a portion of the award for the additional service beyond 12 months. An educational award can be used to pay for costs of attendance at a higher education institution or to repay government or commercial loans for education expenses. Cost of attendance is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Higher Education Act of 1965 defines terms related to institutions of higher education. Corps volunteers completing a term of service may be eligible for federal hiring preference. The Director will issue necessary regulations for this section. SEC. 6. ASSIGNMENT OF CORPS VOLUNTEERS TO SENIORS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. The Director assigns Corps volunteers to local Care Corps programs, prioritizing based on volunteers' preferences and serving areas with a shortage of services. Corps volunteers provide approved services to individuals in need. Approved services provided by Corps volunteers are person-to-person, supportive relationships that help individuals achieve and maintain independent living. These services are supported by orientation, training, and supervision, and may involve coordination with caregivers. No volunteer is allowed to provide prohibited services while serving in the Care Corps program. The Care Corps program allows volunteers to provide supportive services to individuals in need, with guidance on the scope of services issued by the Director. Volunteers cannot offer medical, administrative, institutional care, services prohibited by State law, or any other services deemed inconsistent with the program's purposes. The term \"individual in need\" refers to those aged 65 or older or with disabilities. Individuals aged 65 or older or with disabilities, who have difficulty with self-care or living independently, and meet additional criteria determined by the Director. SEC. 7. TRAINING AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. The Director will develop a training program for Corps volunteers, including at least 40 hours of instruction per term, additional training as needed, and other requirements. Standards of conduct will be established and enforced by the Director. Corps volunteers are not considered federal employees except for work-related injuries, where they are treated as employees for compensation purposes under specific conditions. Absences from duty must be authorized to be considered in the performance of duty. Corps volunteers are treated as employees of the United States for tort claims liability and procedure under specific conditions. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must provide Congress with an annual report on the Corps, including details on the population served, evaluation of Corps operations, and recommendations for improvement. Additionally, there is a provision for local Care Corps programs. Local Care Corps programs are responsible for conducting orientation and training for volunteers, managing volunteer assignments, maintaining records, and carrying out activities as directed by the Director. The Director has the authority to grant funds to qualified entities for operating these programs. Qualified entities are defined as public or private nonprofit organizations within the aging network. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, a qualified entity must submit an application to the Director and abide by the terms and conditions determined by the Director. Qualified entities are defined as part of the aging network, time-banking or volunteer organizing agencies, State, county, or local governments, or any other entity deemed appropriate by the Director. Authorization of appropriations is set at $350,000,000 for each fiscal year after the enactment of this Act, with funds remaining available for the following fiscal year."
