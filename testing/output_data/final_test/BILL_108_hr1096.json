The Act defines key terms such as Commissioner, Maquiladora, Northern border, Southern border, and Under Secretary. During fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the Under Secretary is required to increase the number of full-time agents and support staff in the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement by at least 100 more than the previous year, and the number of full-time inspectors and support staff in the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection by at least 200 more than the previous year. The Under Secretary can waive fte limitations for Homeland Security personnel. Training is provided to agents and support staff to use new technologies and maintain proficiency levels for border protection. SEC. 4. PORT OF ENTRY INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT STUDY. The Administrator of General Services must update the Port of Entry Infrastructure Assessment Study annually by January 31 and submit it to Congress. Consultation with key officials is required, and each updated study must contain specific content. The updated study required by the Administrator of General Services must identify port of entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects to enhance border security and facilitate legitimate commerce. Projects must be prioritized based on security requirements and trade facilitation, with implementation in order of priority assigned. The Commissioner may diverge from the priority order based on significantly changed circumstances, such as immediate security needs or changes in infrastructure in Mexico or Canada, that compellingly alter the need for a project in the United States. SEC. 5. NATIONAL LAND BORDER SECURITY PLAN. The Under Secretary must prepare a National Land Border Security Plan by January 31 each year and consult with relevant agencies. The plan should include a vulnerability assessment of each port of entry on the northern or southern border. Port security coordinators may be established at these entry points. The Under Secretary prepares a National Land Border Security Plan annually, including a vulnerability assessment of ports of entry on the northern or southern border. Port security coordinators may be established to assist with the assessment and plan preparation. SEC. 6. EXPANSION OF COMMERCE SECURITY PROGRAMS.

Another demonstration program will focus on developing a cooperative trade security system to enhance supply chain security. SEC. 7. PORT OF ENTRY TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM. The Under Secretary will conduct a technology demonstration program to test and evaluate new port of entry technologies, refine operational concepts, and train personnel under realistic conditions. Technologies tested will enhance port operations, including inspections, communications, tracking, identification of persons and cargo, sensory devices, personal detection, decision support, and detection of weapons of mass destruction. Facilities will be developed at a selected demonstration site to provide training to law enforcement personnel responsible for border security.
