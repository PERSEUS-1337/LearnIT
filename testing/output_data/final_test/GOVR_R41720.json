    "content": "In 2009, the U.S. power sector generated 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity, projected to increase to over 5 trillion kilowatt hours by 2035. The fuel mix includes coal, natural gas, renewables, and nuclear. Coal is the largest source, but natural gas and renewables are expected to grow. President Obama proposed a Clean Energy Standard aiming for 80% clean energy by 2035. President Obama proposed a Clean Energy Standard aiming for 80% clean energy from renewables, nuclear power, and partial credits for clean coal and natural gas by 2035. This standard encourages U.S. electricity generation from cleaner sources and requires utilities to comply through various means like electricity generation, clean energy credits, and alternative compliance payments. The report evaluates design elements of previous CES proposals, summarizes the Administration's CES policy framework, provides state-level baseline CES compliance analysis, and presents policy options for Congress to consider in a CES debate during the 111th Congress. Clean/Renewable Energy Standard policies were proposed but none became law. Four CES proposals were analyzed and compared against design parameters. A side-by-side comparison matrix in Appendix A provides a detailed analysis. The base quantity of electricity is a critical design element, with proposals ranging from 100% of utility power sales to sales minus power generated by hydro-electricity and municipal solid waste. Clean Energy Standard targets set the percentage of electricity that must be generated from clean sources by a certain date. Examples include 50% by 2050, 15% by 2039, and 15% by 2020. Defining qualifying sources is crucial for compliance. The proposals analyzed in this paper include typical renewable energy, coal-mine methane, landfill gas, hydropower, geothermal, waste-to-energy, nuclear, advanced coal/fossil with carbon capture and storage, and biomass re-powering/co-firing as qualifying sources for compliance with Clean Energy Standards. Energy efficiency/savings and output from combined heat and power systems are also considered. Some proposals allow utility companies to use energy efficiency/savings credits to comply with Clean Energy Standards, with limits on the percentage that can be used. For example, one proposal permits up to 25% of the CES target to be met with energy efficiency credits, requiring the remaining 75% to be achieved through other means like generating electricity from qualified sources or purchasing CES credits. A challenge with energy efficiency/savings credits is establishing a baseline for calculating energy savings. Determining the value of Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs) for Clean Energy Standards is complex. ACPs allow utility companies to pay a fee instead of meeting clean energy targets, but setting the ACP too low may hinder clean energy development while setting it too high could increase costs for ratepayers. The value of Alternative Compliance Payments (ACPs) for Clean Energy Standards is crucial, as setting it too high may lead to significant electricity rate increases in regions lacking clean energy resources. ACPs act as a cost containment mechanism by capping the value of clean energy credits and comparing generation costs from various sources. Funds from ACPs could support new clean energy projects, with utilities earning credits for electricity generated from clean sources to meet Clean Energy Standard requirements. The CES allows utilities to use energy credits for compliance, including banking or trading excess credits. Details on credit trading are not clearly defined, and the Secretary of Energy is responsible for establishing trading programs. Some proposals include double and triple credits to incentivize clean energy projects. Some CES proposals incentivize clean energy projects by providing credits for demonstration projects, such as advanced coal facilities that capture and sequester carbon dioxide. Civil penalties are imposed on utilities that fail to comply with CES requirements, calculated based on the annual kilowatt-hour target shortfall multiplied by a multiple of the alternative compliance payment. CES proposals may exempt certain utility companies from compliance if they sell less than 4 million megawatt-hours of electricity in the preceding year. Hawaii's utility companies are also exempt. Some proposals allow the Secretary of Energy to provide loans for clean energy projects to assist with compliance and reduce costs for utilities and consumers. President Obama set a goal for 80% of America's electricity to come from clean sources by 2035. President Obama's plan aims to increase clean electricity production, with goals to double the share of clean electricity in 25 years, utilize various clean energy sources, drive innovation, and create jobs. The Clean Energy Standard proposal outlines five core principles and states that 40% of electricity in the US comes from clean sources. Compliance with the proposal varies among states, with policy considerations needing further evaluation as the debate progresses. Currently, electricity generation in each state varies in compliance with a federal Clean Energy Standard. Some states exceed the 80% clean energy goal for 2035, while others generate a small percentage from clean sources. Proposed legislation typically applies to electric utilities based on electricity sold to consumers. Data used for compliance assessment is also used to create a corresponding map. The map in Figure 3 illustrates regional differences in CES compliance based on existing electricity generation sources. It does not provide utility-level percentages but shows generation profile differences among U.S. states. President Obama's CES proposal aims for 40% of U.S. electricity to come from \"clean energy\" sources. Obama's CES proposal aims for 40% of U.S. electricity to come from \"clean energy\" sources. Each state has a different generation mix, leading to varying baseline compliance levels. Allowing existing \"clean energy\" generation to count towards the standard could result in wealth transfer between states. Congress may consider only allowing incremental generation capacity added after the policy is enacted to count towards CES compliance. President Obama's CES proposal aims for 40% of U.S. electricity to come from \"clean energy\" sources. Congress may consider only allowing incremental generation capacity added after the policy is enacted to count towards CES compliance, which could result in wealth transfer between states. Alternative compliance payments (ACPs) provide flexibility for utility companies, acting as a cost ceiling for CES compliance. Setting the value of ACPs is complex due to factors like generation costs, transmission availability, and regional resources. A single ACP that encourages \"clean energy\" generation nationwide can be challenging to establish. Setting a single, absolute ACP value that will be fair and equitable for all regions and technologies is a challenging endeavor. Evaluating the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of \"clean energy\" generation options can help estimate an ACP, but regional differences in resources and technology risks make it difficult to determine a universal ACP value. Three legislative proposals exempt certain utilities from complying with the Clean/Renewable Energy Standard based on electricity sales. An analysis of exempt utilities' electricity generation as a percentage of total U.S. generation may be useful. CRS analyzed EIA data to estimate the number of utility companies required to comply and the electricity sales represented by non-exempt companies. Results are provided in Figure 4. Based on the analysis in Figure 4, 149 utility companies representing 77% of annual U.S. electricity sales may have to comply with the Clean/Renewable Energy Standard. Including an exemption in the policy could impact achieving the clean energy target, requiring non-exempt utilities to generate more clean energy to meet goals by 2035. Legislative proposals include interim targets for implementation to phase in clean energy over time. Figure 5 illustrates possible phase-in scenarios. Three possible phase-in approaches for clean energy implementation are illustrated in Figure 5. The linear approach, back-end loaded approach, and stepped approach each have advantages and disadvantages for different types of energy generation sources. President Obama's proposal allows various \"clean energy\" sources to qualify for CES compliance, providing utility companies flexibility in choosing among different generation alternatives. This includes nuclear, coal with carbon capture, natural gas, and renewable sources like wind and solar. Some may prefer a specific percentage of generation dedicated to renewable energy, but a stepped approach with increasing targets every few years may lead to fluctuating periods of project development and stagnant market growth, challenging manufacturing and job sustainability. President Obama's CES proposal includes various \"clean energy\" sources like nuclear, coal with carbon capture, natural gas, and renewables like wind and solar. The proposal aims to encourage the development of low-carbon power sources through a multi-tiered CES credit approach. Qualified sources for CES compliance include renewable electricity, nuclear power, clean coal with carbon capture, and efficient natural gas. The objective is to provide flexibility for utility companies in choosing generation alternatives while promoting the growth of low-carbon power sources. The text discusses the need for further analysis in determining qualified \"clean energy\" sources and credits under a federal Clean Energy Standard. Policy considerations such as transmission requirements, agency responsibility, credit trading guidelines, and economic impacts are highlighted for evaluation. On March 21, 2011, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee released a Clean Energy Standard white paper, seeking feedback on policy design questions regarding threshold for inclusion, qualifying resources, crediting system design, technology deployment, compliance payments, and consumer protections. The Clean Energy Standard white paper released by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee on March 21, 2011, sought feedback on policy design questions including compliance payments, regional costs, and consumer protections. Data sources used for baseline CES compliance assessment included Electric Power Annual 2009 and EIA-923 January-December Final data. Methodology involved calculating generation mix for each state based on EPA 2009 data. The EPA 2009 data lacked detail to differentiate between natural gas generation technologies, so EIA-923 data was used to extract NGCC generation figures. The pivot table was modified to include NGCC and \"Other Natural Gas\" generation, categorized as \"Clean Energy Generation\" or \"Other Generation\" based on Obama's Clean Energy Standard proposal. Clean energy sources include geothermal, hydroelectric, natural gas combined cycle, nuclear, biomass, pumped storage, solar, wind, and wood-derived fuels, while other sources include coal and other gases. The text discusses the calculation of clean energy generation percentages using pivot tables for different sources like coal, natural gas, and petroleum. This calculation was done at both national and state levels."
