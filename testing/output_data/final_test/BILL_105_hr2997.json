    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fairness in the Workplace Commission Act\". The Congress finds that workers are not seeing wage and benefit increases proportional to corporate profits, with a widening wage gap between men and women. Despite progress in closing the education gap, wage disparities persist among minority groups, leading to increased job insecurity due to corporate downsizing and deregulation. The last decade has seen a growth in the use of part-time and temporary workers, with insufficient research done on the extent and impact of this trend. Wage disparities persist, especially for female workers, as wages fail to keep pace with economic growth and corporate profits. The National Commission on Fairness in the Workplace is established by the Act, with members authorized to take actions on behalf of the Commission. The Chairperson is appointed by the President, and the Vice Chairperson is elected by the members. The Commission's term lasts for 18 months after the Act's enactment. The National Commission on Fairness in the Workplace will examine the growing corporate practice of providing lower wages and benefits to part-time and temporary employees compared to full-time employees. They will also investigate the impact of part-time and temporary employment on wage levels, job insecurity, and productivity. Additionally, the Commission will explore reasons for stagnant wages, the wage gap between men and women, and wage disparities among minority populations. The Commission will develop policy options for Congress to address problems identified in the examination regarding minority populations in various states and territories. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP.
