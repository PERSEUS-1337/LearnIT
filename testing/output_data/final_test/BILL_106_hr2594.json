    "content": "The Act is titled \"America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project\" and includes provisions for Mental Health Diversion Courts under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Grant authority is established for these courts. The Attorney General can provide grants for programs involving judicial supervision over offenders with mental illness or substance abuse disorders charged with nonviolent misdemeanors, and specialized training for law enforcement to address the needs of mentally ill offenders. The curr_chunk describes voluntary diversion programs for mentally ill or mentally retarded defendants facing criminal charges, centralized case management for misdemeanor cases, and life skills training for participants needing services such as housing, vocational training, and health care. The curr_chunk defines a \"preliminarily qualified offender with mental illness, mental retardation, or co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders\" as someone diagnosed or showing signs of these conditions and eligible for diversion by designated judges. The Attorney General consults with relevant officials, may use DOJ components, issues regulations for program evaluation, and requires detailed grant applications. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for Federal assistance programs, including the need to supplement existing funding sources, coordinate with other initiatives, consult with affected agencies, have designated judges for supervision, and plan for program sustainability. The curr_chunk outlines the need to describe the methodology and outcome measures for evaluating the program following the conclusion of Federal support. The curr_chunk discusses the process for requesting funds under a specific part, requiring submission of an application with necessary information to the Attorney General. The Federal share of a grant under this part is limited to 75 percent of total costs, with the possibility of a matching contribution waiver by the Attorney General. The funds must be used for new expenses related to the diversion program. The Attorney General must ensure equitable geographic distribution of grant awards, considering the needs of rural communities, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. \"States, tribal governments, or local governments receiving funds must submit a report on the effectiveness of the program. Technical assistance, training, and evaluation are also provided under this part.\" The Attorney General may provide technical assistance, training, and evaluations for programs under this part. The evaluations can be carried out directly or through collaborative arrangements with other entities. Part V of the text outlines the establishment and administration of Mental Health Diversion Courts, including grant authority, definitions, applications, federal funding, geographic distribution, reporting requirements, and provisions for technical assistance, training, and evaluation. Additionally, there is an authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 through 2004 to support these programs. The Attorney General is also empowered to provide technical assistance, training, and evaluations for these initiatives."
