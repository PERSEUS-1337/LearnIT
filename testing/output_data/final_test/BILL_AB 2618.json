    "title": "AB 2618",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 53328.1 of the Government Code is amended to allow for the formation of a community facilities district consisting of territory proposed for future annexation, with the condition that annexation and special tax imposition require unanimous approval of parcel owners. The legislative body is not required to specify special tax rates in resolutions, as long as they state the rate will cover costs and administrative expenses. The maximum tax rate for each parcel must be specified in the unanimous approval process. The legislative body is not obligated to specify conditions for prepayment of special taxes in resolutions. Prepayment provision can be included in unanimous approval of parcel owners when annexed to the community facilities district. The appropriations limit, special tax rate, and bonded indebtedness for a community facilities district can be approved unanimously by parcel owners upon annexation, without the need for additional hearings or procedures. If a majority of registered voters or landowners protest the establishment of a community facilities district, no further proceedings can take place for one year. If the majority protests against certain facilities or services or a special tax in a community facilities district, those specific items will be removed from the resolution of formation. The legislative body cannot impose a special tax lien on a parcel in a community facilities district without unanimous approval from the parcel owner for annexation to the district. After formation of a community facilities district, the legislative body can levy special taxes on parcels annexing to the district with unanimous approval from parcel owners. The local agency can take legal action to validate special taxes levied in accordance with specific procedures outlined in the Code of Civil Procedure. If a challenge is made regarding the validity of these taxes, it must be done within 15 days of the tax lien notice being recorded against the parcel. A tax lien is recorded against the parcel, and any appeal from a judgment must be filed within 30 days after entry of judgment. A community facilities district can only finance facilities under specific sections. The local agency can designate a parcel as an improvement area within the district without additional procedures, and all related proceedings will apply only to that area. In connection with a community facilities district, changes can be made with unanimous approval of affected parcel owners and written consent of the local agency, without additional hearings. If special tax proceeds are used to retire debt, reduction of the tax rate requires unanimous approval ensuring timely debt retirement. Section 53328.1 of the Government Code is amended. Section 53328.1 of the Government Code allows for the formation of a community facilities district with territory proposed for future annexation, where parcels can only be annexed with unanimous owner approval. The legislative body must follow specific procedures for this type of formation. The legislative body forming a community facilities district is not required to specify special tax rates initially. The resolutions must state the rate will cover improvement costs and administrative expenses. The maximum tax rate for each parcel is determined by unanimous approval. The legislative body forming a community facilities district is not obligated to specify conditions for prepayment of special taxes in the resolution of intention. Prepayment provision can be included with unanimous approval of parcel owners upon annexation. The appropriations limit, special tax rate, and bonded indebtedness for a community facilities district can be approved by unanimous agreement of parcel owners upon annexation, without the need for additional hearings or procedures. (4) This paragraph outlines the protest provisions for forming a community facilities district. If a majority of registered voters or landowners file written protests against the district's establishment, no further proceedings can take place for one year. If the majority protests against specific facilities or services or a special tax in a community facilities district, those elements will be removed from the formation resolution. The legislative body cannot impose a special tax lien on a parcel in a community facilities district without unanimous approval from the parcel owner for annexation to the district. After the resolution of formation for a community facilities district is adopted, the legislative body can pass an ordinance to levy special taxes on parcels annexing to the district with unanimous approval from parcel owners. The special taxes will be collected as specified in the resolution of formation without the need for further ordinances. The local agency can take legal action to validate special taxes levied in accordance with this chapter. Any challenge to the taxes must be filed within 15 days of the special tax lien notice being recorded. A tax lien is recorded against the parcel, and any appeal from a judgment must be filed within 30 days after entry of judgment. A community facilities district formed under this section can only finance facilities as specified in Section 53313.5. The legislative body must meet certain requirements before annexing parcels to the district, and parcels seeking financing for residential properties with four or fewer units must meet specific conditions. In forming a community facilities district and annexing parcels, the local agency can designate a parcel as an improvement area without additional procedures. All proceedings for special tax and bonded indebtedness will only apply to the improvement area. In forming a community facilities district, changes can be made with unanimous approval of affected parcel owners and written consent of the local agency, without additional hearings. If special tax proceeds are used to retire debt, unanimous approval for reducing the tax rate must ensure timely debt retirement. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to Section 53328.1 of the Government Code, contingent on the enactment of both this bill and Assembly Bill 2693 before January 1, 2017. If this bill is enacted after AB 2693, Section 1 of this bill will not take effect."
