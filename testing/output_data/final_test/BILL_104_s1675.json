The \"Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996\" defines terms related to the FBI, criminal offenses against minors, sexually violent offenses, sexually violent predators, mental abnormalities, and predatory behavior. It also outlines the criteria for a minimally sufficient sexual offender registration program, including offender registration, information transmission to the FBI, and verification requirements. The Attorney General will establish a national database to track convicted individuals of criminal offenses against minors, sexually violent offenses, and sexually violent predators. Registration is required for at least 10 years after release from prison, parole, supervised release, or probation. Under subsection (b), individuals in states without adequate sexual offender registration programs must register their address, fingerprints, and photograph with the FBI. Registration lasts for 10 years after release from prison or for life if there are multiple convictions or aggravated sexual abuse. Under subsection (b), individuals convicted of aggravated sexual abuse or determined to be sexually violent predators must register their address, fingerprints, and photograph with the FBI. Verification of their address will be conducted by the FBI during the registration period. Sexually violent predators must verify registration every 90 days after release. The FBI can release relevant information to protect the public but cannot disclose victim identities. A new residence is established if a person resides for at least 10 days. Each new residence must be reported to the FBI within 10 days by individuals required to register under subsection (c). If a person changes address to a different state, they must notify the FBI within 10 days. Individuals required to register as sexual offenders must report their new address, fingerprints, and photograph to the FBI and the State within 10 days of establishing a new residence. States with a sufficient registration program must notify law enforcement and the FBI when a registered person changes their address within or outside the state. The FBI ensures that local law enforcement officials are notified when a registered sexual offender relocates. State agencies must also inform the FBI of the offender's new residence for verification. When a registered sexual offender relocates, the State must notify the FBI. If the FBI cannot verify the offender's address or locate them, the FBI will take action. The text chunk states that if a person violates registration requirements, their name will be added to the National Crime Information Center Wanted person file if an arrest warrant is issued. Fingerprints of individuals required to register under subsection (c) must be obtained and verified by the FBI or local law enforcement. In states with a sufficient sexual offender registration program, fingerprints must be obtained and verified according to state requirements. Failure to comply with this section results in penalties. Failure to comply with the fingerprint registration requirements outlined in subsection (c) may result in penalties, including fines up to $100,000 for a first offense or imprisonment for up to 10 years for subsequent offenses. The FBI is authorized to release collected information to law enforcement agencies for enforcement purposes and community notification. Upon release from prison, offenders convicted of specific offenses must be notified of their duty to register with the FBI. States without established programs must also notify the FBI of the release of such offenders. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to specify the duration of state registration requirements for offenders. Offenders must comply with registration until 10 years after release from prison or for life if they have prior convictions or are deemed sexually violent predators. SEC. 4. STATE BOARDS amended to include victim rights advocates and law enforcement representatives. SEC. 5. FINGERPRINTS requirement for registration includes submission of fingerprints. SEC. 6.

SEC. 8 provides immunity for good faith conduct. SEC. 8 provides immunity for good faith conduct for State and Federal law enforcement agencies, employees, and officials under section 170102. SEC. 9 requires the Attorney General to issue regulations within 1 year of enactment. SEC. 10 specifies the effective date of the Act. The Act and its amendments will take effect one year after enactment. States must implement certain amendments within three years, with a possible extension of two years for good faith efforts. Non-compliant states will lose 10% of allocated funds, which will be reallocated to compliant states. SEC. 11. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its amendments is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act and its amendments will not be affected."
