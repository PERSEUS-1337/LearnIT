    "content": "The congressional budget process involves a separation between money and policy decisions, seen through authorizations and appropriations. Authorizations establish government activities, while appropriations provide funding for those activities. Authorizations do not provide funding by themselves, while appropriations authorize payments from the Treasury. Since 1835, the House has distinguished between authorizations and appropriations, with authorizations establishing programs and appropriations providing funding. Authorization laws grant broad authority to government departments and agencies, while appropriations control the details and amounts through annual processes. The distinction between authorizations and appropriations in government funding laws is important. Authorizations grant broad authority to departments and agencies, while appropriations specify the details and amounts of funding through annual processes. Temporary authorizations are rare and usually reserved for limited-duration programs. Legislative committees handle authorization measures, while the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee oversee appropriations. During the Civil War, separate Appropriations Committees were created to handle increased federal expenditures. Congressional practices evolved to consolidate authorization laws for federal programs and shift appropriations from specific line-items to more general lump-sums. The shift from specific line-items to lump-sum appropriations based on statutory authorization led to a separation of money and policy decisions in Congress, causing tensions between the authorization and appropriations processes. The tensions between authorization and appropriations processes have influenced the evolution of how the Federal government operates and funds its activities. Legislative committees began asserting their role in fiscal decision-making by including provisions in authorization acts and conducting reviews and revisions on a periodic basis for certain agencies and departments. The report discusses changes in language concerning authorizations of appropriations over the past century, illustrated through case studies on three agencies. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 increased the role of Appropriations Committees in congressional spending decisions, leading to significant changes in authorization laws. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 led to significant changes in authorization laws, with provisions explicitly authorizing future budgetary resources. This practice grew rapidly, with over 100 measures enacted into law with explicit authorizations of appropriations by 1937. This had broader implications for the role of legislative committees in budgetary decision-making. The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921 brought changes to authorization laws, allowing for explicit authorizations of future budgetary resources. This led to legislative committees having more influence over funding decisions by setting procedural ceilings on subsequent appropriations. Language authorizing appropriations became more common, with committees specifying amounts for specific fiscal years and limiting future appropriations. At the end of WWII, about 5% of programs had specific authorizations of appropriations for certain fiscal years. However, postwar legislative committees increasingly used provisions authorizing \"such sums as are necessary\" for larger or permanent programs. These provisions have continued to be used to this day, indicating two schedules of legislative review: \"annual\" and... The use of annual authorizations of appropriations began as a way for legislative committees to closely oversee agency spending decisions, especially for newly created agencies or programs. This approach later expanded to include existing agencies in response to perceived oversight issues. Legislative committees sometimes added annual authorization provisions to agencies, converting them to an annual reauthorization schedule. This was done for programs facing rapidly changing conditions or with direct effects on states or districts. Close oversight was sought for these programs, leading to more incremental changes compared to agencies on longer reauthorization schedules. During the post-World War II period, legislative committees chose annual authorization schedules for agencies due to dissatisfaction with funding levels and program structure provided through congressional appropriations. Authorization laws enacted on an as-needed basis focused primarily on policy issues, making future fiscal year levels less relevant during appropriations. An annual authorization approach allowed for immediate congressional debate on funding levels before considering appropriations for programs. The mid-twentieth century saw a significant expansion in the proportion of agencies subject to annual reauthorizations. Prior to 1950, only military construction and mutual security required annual authorizations. However, in the 1950s, a few more programs were added to the list, and it wasn't until two decades later that a number of small and large-scale government programs, such as those of the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of State, began receiving annual authorizations. During the mid-twentieth century, government programs like the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and Department of State started receiving annual authorizations in response to events like the Vietnam War. The use of multiyear authorizations also became more common, with varying lengths of reauthorization schedules. Legislative committees adopted these schedules for oversight reasons, sometimes choosing multiyear schedules over annual ones for certain programs or agencies. Multiyear reauthorizations allowed for comprehensive reevaluation of programs and agencies on longer intervals, leading to more widespread policy changes compared to annual reauthorizations. They were sometimes motivated by dissatisfaction with funding levels and assumed funding increases over the authorization period to build congressional support. However, discrepancies between authorized and appropriated amounts often increased in later years. In the 1980s, programs shifted to longer-term multiyear schedules, with some authorizations expiring for fiscal years between reauthorizations. New agencies typically only received specific activity authorizations, not full agency funding. For instance, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 had temporary authorizations for some agencies, but few explicit appropriations for new activities. The reauthorization process for agencies and programs has shifted to longer-term schedules, focusing more on policy concerns rather than funding levels. Some reasons for this change include being crowded out by new budgetary decision-making mechanisms and concerns about duplicate votes on funding levels. The historical development of the form and timing of authorizations over the past century has been characterized by a desire for increased involvement in budgetary decisions, with annual authorizations leading to incremental program changes and multiyear authorizations involving widespread policy changes. The historical development of authorizations over the past century has involved annual authorizations leading to incremental changes and multiyear authorizations resulting in widespread policy changes. Case studies of agencies like the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Peace Corps illustrate variations in authorization purposes and frequency. The National Science Foundation was established in 1950 and underwent changes in authorization laws starting in 1968. Annual authorizations of appropriations were enacted from FY1969 through FY1982, with intermittent reauthorizations until FY1988. Since FY1989, the agency has been reauthorized for periods of time. The National Science Foundation (NSF) was established in 1950 and has undergone changes in authorization laws since 1968. Reauthorizations have occurred intermittently, with the most recent one from FY2011 through FY2013. The agency has been reauthorized for periods of three to five fiscal years since FY1989. The rationale for definite authorization of appropriations was to promote increased fiscal accountability to Congress. The National Science Foundation (NSF) underwent changes in authorization laws in 1953, replacing a $15 million authorization limit with an indefinite authorization of appropriations to provide greater flexibility in budget requests and fiscal planning. This change aimed to promote increased fiscal accountability to Congress. The National Science Foundation (NSF) saw no new laws authorizing appropriations for fifteen years, with most changes coming from executive actions and minor modifications to existing programs. In 1965, the House Committee on Science and Astronautics began a review to write a new charter for the agency, leading to recommended changes in 1967. In the post-Sputnik era, public opinion shifted towards viewing basic science as essential for public safety, health, and the economy. The most crucial point in the proposed changes to the National Science Foundation (NSF) was the issue of policy control. The Senate committee amended the bill to include a specific authorization of appropriations for FY1969 and every fiscal year thereafter. The committee is concerned about the lack of thorough review of NSF authorization since 1950. Appropriations have significantly increased over the years. A change to annual authorization is proposed in the bill, with an authorization of $523 million for FY1969. Future authorizations will be set after hearings. The timing of annual authorizations can impact funding decisions. The annual reauthorizations typically occurred about one month after the fiscal year began, with only three instances of pre-fiscal year enactment. Appropriations usually followed authorization, with lower levels than authorized. Congress debated transitioning NSF to multiyear authorization starting in 1977. The Carter Administration and some Senators advocated for a multiyear authorization of appropriations for the NSF to promote continuity in planning basic research. The House Science Committee argued for annual authorization to enhance congressional control. The FY1978 reauthorization considered a two-year authorization but ultimately enacted a single-year authorization. The Senate proposed authorizations for FY1979 and FY1980, but only one year was enacted into law. In FY1989, multiyear authorizations were proposed by both the House and Senate, leading to appropriations authorized through FY1993 (P.L. 100-570). Subsequent reauthorizations saw modest increases in funding, with the budget doubling over five years and significant growth in later years (P.L. 105-207, P.L. 107-368). The most recent laws cover FY2008-FY2010 and FY2011-FY2013. The America COMPETES Act and its reauthorization aimed to invest in innovation and enhance US competitiveness by funding research, development, and STEM education programs. The NSF appropriations after FY1989 were lower than authorized amounts, with widening gaps between authorization and actual funding, especially when significant budget increases were assumed over multiyear periods. The authorization assumed significant budgetary increases over a multiyear period, with widening gaps between authorization and actual funding. For example, FY1989-FY1993 saw a doubling attempt with increasing gaps in subsequent appropriations. The FY1998 reauthorization proposed more modest increases, resulting in smaller appropriations gaps. NASA transitioned to an annual authorization schedule in 1958, reauthorized each fiscal year from FY1961 through FY1986, with increasing gaps in outyears starting in FY1982. When NASA was established in 1958, it was given permanent funding for operations but required specific authorization for capital expenditures. The agency's authorization schedule has experienced delays, with gaps in reauthorization from FY1994 through FY1999. Committees were created in Congress to oversee NASA's activities. NASA transitioned to an annual authorization of appropriations in stages over the next few years, starting with the FY1958 supplemental appropriations bill. The provision initially required a specific authorization for each fiscal year through FY1960 to provide accountability and oversight to legislative committees. NASA transitioned to an annual authorization of appropriations starting with the FY1958 supplemental appropriations bill. The provision was revised to allow a one-year trial run after criticism of burdening NASA. The House and Senate proposed extensions of the specific requirement for annual authorization, with the House setting it through FY1965 and the Senate removing the termination date. Rapid changes in the space program necessitated this process. The committee removed the terminal date of July 30, 1965, on the authorization requirement, making it indefinite. Arguments against making it permanent were raised due to potential delays in annual appropriations. Despite this, the requirement has continued to apply to NASA appropriations. NASA was reauthorized annually from FY1961 to FY1981, with appropriations usually covering only a single fiscal year. Annual reauthorizations were often enacted after the fiscal year had begun. During the period from FY1961 to FY1981, NASA was reauthorized annually, with appropriations typically covering only one fiscal year. Reauthorizations were usually enacted ahead of appropriations, with an average of about two months in advance. This timely enactment may have helped minimize discrepancies between authorized and funded amounts, with appropriations generally falling less than 1% below the authorized level. In 13 out of 20 fiscal years, the authorized amount exceeded the appropriated amount. During FY1961 to FY1981, NASA was reauthorized annually with appropriations typically covering one fiscal year. The amount authorized was higher than appropriated in the first 13 fiscal years, but in the remaining seven years, appropriations equaled or exceeded the authorized level. NASA received program direction from Congress through authorization report language and appropriations. Policy changes were occasionally enacted through reauthorizations, such as the FY1976 law (P.L. 94-39) for upper atmospheric research. Changes to the agency or programs also occurred in broader laws covering multiple agencies. In the 1980s, space-related public policy concerns expanded rapidly into new areas. During the 1980s, NASA saw significant events like the first Space Shuttle Columbia flight and plans to build a space station. New programs were initiated through stand-alone authorization laws, such as the Commercial Space Launch Act. International cooperation issues became more important, leading to NASA reauthorizations being used for significant space policy changes. The FY1985 reauthorization established the National Commission on Space to develop a long-term national space strategy. The focus on space policy and fiscal concerns increased during this time. During the 1980s, NASA faced delays in completing reauthorization laws due to fiscal constraints and a focus on space policy. Reauthorizations were enacted closer to appropriations, with some being delayed or vetoed. The Space Shuttle Challenger explosion and dissatisfaction with the Administration's response were key factors in the disputes. In the late 1980s, reauthorization laws addressing space policy faced delays in enactment, with FY1990 not being reauthorized due to unresolved differences between the House and Senate. The House Science Committee proposed multiyear authorizations for major activities starting in FY1989. In the late 1980s, reauthorization laws addressing space policy faced delays in enactment. The House Science Committee proposed multiyear authorizations for major activities, such as line items under the Research and Development and Space Flight accounts. The Senate Commerce Committee versions recommended authorizations for a single fiscal year only. NASA was required to compile a five-year capital development plan and a 10-year strategic plan in FY1989. Starting in FY1990, NASA had to submit a three-year budget request, later changed to a five-year budget submission for programs exceeding $200 million in FY1992. NASA reauthorizations have been enacted periodically in response to policy developments, such as the Vision for Space Exploration program in 2004. Reauthorizations cover more than a single fiscal year but do not follow a set schedule. Laws for programs exceeding $200 million have been enacted, with varying authorization periods. The FY2000-FY2002 reauthorization was uncontroversial, authorizing appropriations for a three-year period. The FY2007-FY2008 reauthorization had House and Senate versions with different authorization periods. The reauthorization laws for NASA have covered multiple fiscal years, with funding amounts proposed for single or multiple years. There has been a trend towards multiyear reauthorizations, with a growing gap between authorized and appropriated amounts. The FY2009 reauthorization had funding levels almost 14% higher than the actual appropriations, while the FY2011-FY2013 reauthorization was enacted ahead of appropriations. The FY2011-FY2013 reauthorization for the Peace Corps was enacted ahead of appropriations, with funding levels lower than the authorization in each fiscal year. The Peace Corps has experienced gaps in reauthorization since FY1982, transitioning to a multiyear schedule. The agency was permanently established through the Peace Corps Act in 1961. The FY2011-FY2013 reauthorization for the Peace Corps was enacted with funding levels lower than the authorization in each fiscal year. Congressional intent for reauthorization the following fiscal year was not clearly discussed in legislative history. The motivation for an annual schedule initially stemmed from the newness of the agency. The first reauthorization law for the Peace Corps was enacted in FY1963, with a definite authorization of appropriations. The committee expressed confidence in the Peace Corps' program and managers, questioning only the justification for the requested $63,750,000 authorization. The Peace Corps reauthorization laws from FY1964-FY1979 were typically stand-alone authorization laws that updated appropriations for the fiscal year and amount, with little other changes. The House and Senate committees used reauthorization as an opportunity to communicate about the agency's work and future plans. The Senate Foreign Relations Committees used reauthorization to address various agency issues, such as the status of Peace Corps operations and concerns about administrative costs. In 1971, the Peace Corps merged into a new agency called ACTION, with changes implemented through the annual authorization process. In the FY1970 reauthorization (P.L. 99-199), provisions were included to restrict the use of Peace Corps funds for other volunteer and training programs. The FY1975 and FY1976 reauthorizations (P.L. 93-302 and P.L. 94-76) mandated statutory transfers of Peace Corps appropriations to finance increases in certain volunteer benefits. The frequency of reauthorization and funding specificity were seen as important tools of agency oversight by Congress. In FY1977, the President's budget requested a two-year authorization for the Peace Corps with specific funding amounts for FY1977 and FY1978. The Executive Branch requested a two-year authorization for the Peace Corps with specific funding amounts for fiscal 1977 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal 1978. However, due to concerns about open-ended authorizations, the authorization was limited to a single year. The Senate version provided a definite one-year authorization of appropriations and did not comment on the Administration's proposal. The Administration's request for a \"such sums\" two-year authorization of appropriations was rejected by both the House and Senate in subsequent years. Starting in FY1980, significant changes for the Peace Corps occurred as Congress rejected open-ended authorization requests, preferring annual oversight through authorization and appropriations processes. The Peace Corps was reestablished as an independent agency, with FY1981 reauthorization provisions facilitating the transition. Subsequent reauthorizations focused on new policy developments within the agency, with Congress experimenting on changes in reauthorization vehicle and timing. The FY1980 and FY1981 reauthorizations included the Peace Corps in a larger omnibus foreign aid vehicle. The FY1981 reauthorization of the Peace Corps was enacted later than usual, on December 16, 1980, and included changes in practice. Subsequent reauthorizations also made changes, such as authorizing appropriations for multiple fiscal years. These changes were influenced by various factors. The Peace Corps reorganization in the early 1980s led to changes in authorization practices, with a shift towards addressing agency policy concerns. The transition to a multi-agency foreign aid authorization also impacted the frequency of authorizations, potentially causing delays. Late enactment of authorizations compared to appropriations and gaps in authorization further weakened the influence of provisions authorizing appropriations on budget decisions. Efforts to reauthorize the Peace Corps have been irregular over the past 25 years, with a focus on policy concerns rather than appropriations. In FY1993, a law was enacted to reauthorize appropriations and establish a foreign exchange fluctuations account. In FY1995/FY1996, a two-year authorization of appropriations was included in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The most recent authorization covered four fiscal years. The most recent authorization of appropriations for the Peace Corps covered FY2000-FY2003, aimed at expanding the program. Subsequent legislation focused on policy changes rather than funding, with little congressional action on reauthorization. The evolution of authorizations allowed committees to play a greater role in funding decisions. During the evolution of authorizations, explicit authorizations of appropriations were used as a tool to increase congressional oversight for agencies like the Peace Corps, NASA, and NSF. Annual authorization schedules were implemented to facilitate this oversight, with the transition to annual reauthorization for NSF motivated by oversight concerns. This allowed legislative committees to have a greater role in agency and congressional budgetary decisions. Annual authorizations for NSF, NASA, and the Peace Corps allowed legislative committees to formally weigh in on budgetary needs each fiscal year. Transition to long-term reauthorization schedules over the past thirty years led to more policy-focused laws with significant program changes, especially for NSF and NASA. Peace Corps reauthorizations have been enacted intermittently with recent proposals for significant program changes. The evolution of authorizations in recent years has shifted towards longer periods, moving away from annual reauthorizations. This change allows Congress to focus on policy issues rather than lapsed authorizations. The separation between authorization and appropriations processes may lead to further procedural adaptations in congressional rules and practices."
