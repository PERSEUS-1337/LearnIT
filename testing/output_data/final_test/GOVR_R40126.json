    "content": "Chile, a politically stable nation in South America, gained independence from Spain in 1818. Under General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship from 1973 to 1990, thousands were killed, imprisoned, or tortured. Democratic governance was restored in 1990, with a center-left coalition known as the \"Coalition of Parties for Democracy\" governing for two decades despite constraints from the Pinochet-era constitution. Despite being constrained by authoritarian provisions in the Pinochet-era constitution, the center-left coalition in Chile enacted incremental political, economic, and social reforms. They maintained a market-oriented economic framework and negotiated trade agreements with 60 countries, gaining access to major consumer markets. The coalition also implemented countercyclical fiscal policies and strengthened Chile's social safety net. Sebastian Pi\u00f1era of the center-right coalition continued these policies during his presidency from 2010-2014. Analysts credit Chile's policy framework for significant economic and social gains. Chile's policy framework is credited for the country's economic and social progress in the past 25 years. The GDP has grown significantly, with a decrease in poverty rates. However, there is discontent due to high inequality and limited improvement in living conditions for most Chileans. The Gini coefficient has remained high, indicating income concentration. Chile's Gini coefficient has remained high at around 0.53, dropping slightly to 0.50 after accounting for taxes and government transfers, well above the OECD average of 0.31. Intergenerational social mobility is low due to class disparities replicated in the education system. Dissatisfaction with political leaders and institutions is growing, exacerbated by the binomial electoral system inherited from the Pinochet dictatorship, which limits government responsiveness by requiring coalitions to win by two-to-one margins in two-member electoral districts. Chile's electoral system limits change due to power concentration in the central government. Chileans protest for better education and accountability. The \"New Majority\" coalition formed for the 2013 elections to address popular discontent. In Chile's 2013 general elections, the \"New Majority\" coalition, led by former President Michele Bachelet, won with a promise to reduce inequality and improve social mobility through fiscal reform, education system overhaul, and a new constitution. Bachelet easily defeated her opponent in the runoff election and secured a significant majority in the legislative elections. She quickly implemented her policy agenda after taking office in March 2014. Bachelet implemented a fiscal reform in September 2014 to increase revenues by 3% of GDP by 2018. The reform includes raising the corporate tax rate, abolishing a business tax credit, taxing pollution sources, and offering incentives to small businesses. The additional revenue will fund changes in education, balance the budget, and strengthen public programs in Chile. President Bachelet enacted fiscal reform in Chile to increase revenues. The focus shifted to overhauling the education system, with initial reforms signed into law in May 2015. Changes include cutting off funding to for-profit educational institutions and ensuring equal admissions. Further reforms are being debated, such as strengthening teacher training and providing free post-secondary education for most students. The 2016 budget proposal aims to allow 200,000 low-income students to attend nonprofit higher education institutions tuition-free. President Bachelet announced plans for a new constitution in Chile, aiming to educate citizens, hold a national dialogue, and seek approval through congressional supermajorities and a national referendum. The current constitution, adopted in 1980 under the Pinochet dictatorship, is seen as illegitimate by some sectors of society. Bachelet's proposed changes include free post-secondary education and other reforms to the education system. President Bachelet's electoral platform includes constitutional changes such as citizen rights recognition and decentralization of power. The new electoral system in Chile will elect the next Congress through proportional representation, with increased seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Political parties will need to ensure gender balance in their candidate selection. While supporters of the previous binomial electoral system argue for political stability, critics highlight its limitations on citizen participation and accountability. President Bachelet's reforms include changes in tax, education, and political systems, as well as initiatives like labor reform, state-run pension fund creation, abortion decriminalization, and amnesty law repeal. These policy changes, requiring simple majorities in Congress, are likely to be implemented. The Bachelet Administration in Chile is focusing on advancing anti-corruption policies following a series of scandals involving business executives and politicians. Charges have been brought against individuals from the Independent Democratic Union party for illegal financing and tax evasion. Other corruption scandals have implicated members of the New Majority Coalition, including Bachelet's son. These scandals have reinforced public perceptions of wealth and power concentration in Chile. President Bachelet in Chile is addressing concerns about wealth and power concentration among elites by introducing anti-corruption measures, despite facing public division over the pace of reform. President Bachelet in Chile faces public division over her reform agenda, with approval ratings declining due to debates in Congress, corruption scandals, and economic challenges. Despite initial public support for her reforms, her approval rating has dropped significantly. President Bachelet's approval rating has dropped to 54% since taking office in March 2014. Chileans are dissatisfied with the political class, with low approval ratings for various coalitions and government bodies. The country's economy, heavily reliant on the copper industry, has been affected by declining prices, leading to slowed economic growth in 2014. The Chilean economy has decelerated due to a sharp decline in private investment, lower business confidence, and the impact of Bachelet Administration's reforms. The government has increased public expenditure by nearly 10% in the 2015 budget, focusing on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. Chile has low public debt and access to a stabilization fund, allowing for countercyclical fiscal policies. The Central Bank has also implemented expansionary monetary policies to support economic growth. Chile's economic growth is forecasted to accelerate slightly to 2.3% in 2015 due to fiscal stimulus and expansionary monetary policy. However, growth is expected to remain below the 2005-2014 average of 4.3% for several years due to global economic factors. The Bachelet Administration's reforms may have a negative short-term impact but could boost productivity and long-term growth. Chile is considered one of the safest countries in Latin America, despite sporadic acts of violence by small militant groups. Some attacks by anarchist groups and members of the Mapuche community have occurred in Santiago, with a notable explosion near a subway station injuring 14 people in September 2014. The Mapuche, accounting for 9% of Chile's population, have lower living standards and have used militant tactics to seek recognition of their rights and territories. Some Mapuche groups have used militant tactics, including occupying ancestral lands and destroying property. An activist was convicted of killing an elderly couple in 2013. The Chilean antiterrorism law, dating back to the Pinochet regime, has faced criticism for harsh penalties and detentions without bail for accused individuals. The Chilean government has faced criticism for using the anti-terrorism law against Mapuche activists. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered the government to overturn convictions of activists charged under this law. The Bachelet Administration has proposed amendments to the law, including allowing covert police infiltration of terrorist organizations and extending coverage to \"lone-wolf\" terrorists. Special preventative measures have been announced to protect truckers after arson attacks in southern Chile. Some opposition members have criticized Bachelet's proposals. Members of the opposition Alianza coalition have criticized Bachelet's proposals as insufficient and called for the government to apply the anti-terrorism law to attacks by Mapuche activists. The United States and Chile have friendly relations, with a focus on trade, investment, security, and energy cooperation. President Obama hosted President Bachelet in 2014 to strengthen the relationship between the two countries. They also collaborate on scientific research, such as astronomy and glacier monitoring. U.S.-Chile trade relations have significantly improved since the U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement took effect in 2004. The agreement eliminated tariffs on 87% of bilateral trade, leading to a quadrupling of total bilateral trade from $7.9 billion in 2003 to $31 billion in 2014. This has provided both countries with preferential access to each other's markets, with 100% of U.S. exports entering Chile duty-free. U.S.-Chile merchandise trade increased significantly under the Free Trade Agreement, reaching $31 billion in 2014. U.S. exports to Chile grew over 500%, leading to a trade surplus of $7 billion. Major exports included refined oil products, heavy machinery, and civilian aircraft, while imports consisted of copper, edible fruit, and seafood. Services trade also expanded, totaling $5 billion in 2014. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement in 2014 amounted to $5 billion. U.S. services exports to Chile were $3.8 billion, while imports were $1.2 billion. Travel and intellectual property charges were top categories for U.S. exports, while transport and travel were top categories for imports. Travel between the two countries is expected to increase due to Chile's entry into the Visa Waiver Program. Both countries have participated in negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, involving Australia, Brunei, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam, was concluded on October 5, 2015, but still needs ratification. Chilean analysts and policymakers have expressed concerns about the agreement, stating that Chile should only sign onto the TPP if it offers more favorable conditions due to existing trade agreements with participating nations. The TPP agreement could indirectly renegotiate Chile's trade agreement with the US, potentially leading to concessions on issues like pharmaceutical patents. President Bachelet, despite initial concerns, now defends the agreement, citing new trade opportunities for Chilean exporters. Analysts expect Chilean Congress to ratify the agreement. Analysts anticipate that President Bachelet will secure ratification of the TPP agreement from the Chilean Congress in about five months. The U.S. Trade Representative and some Members of Congress have raised concerns about Chile's adherence to intellectual property rights commitments, leading to Chile being placed on the Priority Watch List since 2015. USTR has urged Chile to enhance protection for pharmaceutical patents and plant varieties and amend its Internet Service Provider liability regime to combat online piracy effectively. Some Members of Congress have called for formal dispute settlement proceedings against Chile. The Chilean government disputes USTR's Special 301 Report, claiming it fails to recognize Chile's progress in protecting intellectual property rights. They argue that the report reflects U.S. companies' desire to impose their standards on other countries and does not contribute to improving bilateral relations. Chile is seen as an attractive investment destination due to its open economy and strong institutions. As of 2014, U.S. foreign direct investment in Chile was $27.6 billion, with $12.5 million in the mining industry. Chilean investment in the U.S. was $730 million. A tax treaty signed in 2010 aimed to boost investment by clarifying tax treatment and reducing barriers. The U.S. and Chile signed a tax treaty in 2010 to enhance investment by addressing tax issues and reducing barriers. President Obama submitted the agreement to the U.S. Senate in May 2012. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the treaty in November 2015 after previously doing so in April 2014. General John F. Kelly praised Chile as a strong partner in regional and international security efforts. Chile has supported peacekeeping missions in Haiti. Chile has actively supported peacekeeping efforts in Haiti since 2004, contributing troops and resources to the U.N. Stabilization Mission. Additionally, Chile has provided training to Central American police and militaries, participated in drug interdiction efforts, and supported peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC. The United States provides security aid to Chile, with an amount of $1.1 million in FY2014 and FY2015. The Obama Administration requested $700,000 in security assistance for Chile in FY2016, with $500,000 for military training and $200,000 for government support. In June 2013, the United States and Chile signed an extradition treaty to modernize extradition processes. President Obama submitted the agreement to the U.S. Senate for approval in September 2014, but the Senate has yet to act on it. Both countries are interested in developing clean energy resources. Chile has shown interest in clean energy development to address domestic needs and combat climate change. However, the country has increasingly relied on carbon-emitting power sources due to rising energy demand. Between 2004 and 2014, Chile's coal consumption surged by 142%, leading to a significant increase in its share of total energy consumption. To reduce dependence on costly energy imports and lower fossil fuel emissions, Chile enacted a law in 2013 mandating 20% of energy to come from renewable sources by 2025. Chile aims to have 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2025, with a focus on nonconventional renewable energy sources. President Bachelet's energy strategy emphasizes this goal, aiming for 45% of electricity capacity to come from renewables. The strategy also looks to increase the use of liquefied natural gas in Chile's energy mix. The United States is collaborating with Chile to overcome barriers in utilizing wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal energy potential through a memorandum of understanding on clean energy technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy supported Chile's Renewable Energy Center and solar plant pilot projects in the Atacama Desert. OPIC approved $700 million in loan guarantees for solar energy projects in Chile. The U.S. and Chile signed a joint statement on expanding energy cooperation, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and oil and gas development. Chile's ENAP plans to import U.S. LNG by 2016 amidst a political and economic transition. Since Chile's return to democracy in 1990, leaders prioritized political stability and economic growth over ambitious reforms, leading to democratic governance and improved living standards. However, high inequality remained unaddressed. President Bachelet's reforms aim to tackle this issue but could pose risks if mishandled, yet they offer potential for inclusive growth and democratic revitalization. U.S.-Chilean relations are expected to remain friendly. U.S.-Chilean relations are expected to remain friendly due to shared values and common interests. Cooperation includes trade, security, energy, and scientific research. Approval of trade agreements and treaties could lead to increased trade and investment, as well as enhanced security cooperation. Chile's economic development may open up new areas for collaboration."
