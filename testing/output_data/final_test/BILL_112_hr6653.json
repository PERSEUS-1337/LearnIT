The Congress acknowledges the vital role of independent contractors in the economy, their entrepreneurial spirit, and the need for clear rules in determining their classification. Objective rules for distinguishing between independent contractors and employees. SEC. 3. STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING EMPLOYMENT STATUS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to address controversies regarding individuals' employment status for tax purposes. The text discusses the termination of certain employment tax liability if a taxpayer did not treat an individual as an employee and filed all required returns consistently. The individual will not be deemed an employee unless the taxpayer lacked a reasonable basis for not treating them as an employee. For tax purposes, a taxpayer can be considered to have a reasonable basis for not treating an individual as an employee if they relied on judicial precedent, IRS audits without assessments, or other official guidance. The individual's position can be exempt from employment tax treatment if it aligns with industry practices or is consistent with past tax treatment. Refunds or credits may be available for overpayments resulting from this exemption. The application of paragraph (1) is not restricted by any law or rule of law at the enactment of this section. The period for filing a claim for refund or credit of an overpayment related to paragraph (1) shall not expire before one year after the enactment of this section. No regulations or Revenue Rulings shall be published by the Department of the Treasury regarding the employment status of individuals for employment taxes, except for Revenue Rulings related to section 3512. The term 'employment tax' refers to any tax imposed by this subtitle. The term 'employment status' refers to an individual's status as an employee or independent contractor. There is an exception for individuals providing services in specific skilled professions. Special rules apply, including notice of availability of the section before an audit inquiry. The commencement of an audit inquiry regarding employment status requires providing the taxpayer with a notice of the relevant provisions. A taxpayer cannot rely on audits post-1996 for determining employee status without an examination for employment tax purposes. The significant segment requirement does not need a showing of more than 25 percent of the industry, and the long-standing recognized practice does not require the practice to have continued for more than 10 years. Safe harbors are available in this section and do not limit subsection (a) to specific cases. The burden of proof in determining employee status lies with the taxpayer if they can show it was reasonable not to treat an individual as an employee and cooperate with the Treasury Secretary. The taxpayer has the burden of proof to show a reasonable basis for not treating an individual as an employee. If an individual was not deemed an employee in the past but is treated as one in the future, prior period safe harbor rules apply for tax purposes. For tax purposes, if an individual was not considered an employee in the past but is treated as one in the future, safe harbor rules apply. The determination of a substantially similar position considers the relationship between the taxpayer and the individuals. Safe harbor standards for determining employment status are outlined in SEC. 3512. The text outlines that if certain requirements are met, a service provider, service recipient, and payor will not be considered as employees or employers for the service provided. This does not supersede the categories of employees described in section 3121(d)(3). The requirements include investment or income fluctuation. The text outlines that a service provider must meet certain requirements to not be considered an employee, including incurring financial responsibility for equipment, unreimbursed expenses, and income fluctuations related to sales or output. A service provider must meet specific criteria to avoid being classified as an employee, including being compensated based on work performed and controlling the means of service delivery. Definitions for \"service provider\" and \"service recipient\" are also provided. The terms \"service recipient\" and \"payor\" are defined in relation to the service provider. Exceptions are made for entities owned by the service provider. A \"qualified agreement\" is a written contract stating the service provider will not be considered an employee for the services provided. The Revenue Act of 1978 is repealed, and the table of sections for chapter 25 of the Code is amended. The amendments in the Act address controversies regarding employee status for employment taxes and establish safe harbor standards. The effective dates for these amendments are specified, with the repeal of section 530 applying to calendar years after the Act's enactment."
