    "content": "Aliens have constitutional and statutory rights to counsel at their own expense in removal proceedings. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process, and courts have recognized the importance of access to counsel for \"fundamental fairness\" in formal removal. The Fifth Amendment guarantees aliens the right to counsel at their own expense in formal removal proceedings, ensuring fundamental fairness. Courts have emphasized the importance of this right, stating that denying it could lead to fundamental unfairness. Courts have generally treated actions that deprive aliens of counsel at their own expense as violating the statute, not the Constitution. Then-Attorney General Mukasey departed from this view in his 2009 decision in Matter of Compean, finding that aliens have no Fifth Amendment right to counsel at their own expense in removal proceedings. This decision was later vacated by then-Attorney General Holder, who primarily focused on the standards for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings. Various provisions of the INA and other immigration-related statutes provide aliens with a right to counsel at their own expense in removal proceedings. Section 292 of the INA governs aliens' right to counsel, allowing them to be represented by counsel of their choice at no expense to the Government. Other provisions address the rights of specific categories of aliens or in particular types of removal proceedings. Various statutory provisions afford aliens certain rights to counsel in removal proceedings, including restrictions on when hearings can be held to allow for counsel, provision of lists of pro bono representation options, and additional protections for vulnerable classes of aliens. While many provisions describe retaining counsel as a privilege, implementing regulations suggest a legal right to counsel at the alien's expense. Numerous courts have interpreted this right. Numerous courts have interpreted the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as establishing a statutory right to counsel at the alien's expense. Violations of this right have been found in specific circumstances, such as when the alien was not advised of their due process rights in a language they could understand or when the government rushed removal proceedings without allowing the alien to consult with counsel. Courts have found violations of aliens' statutory right to counsel in removal proceedings, but reopening proceedings or allowing re-litigation requires showing the violation was \"prejudicial.\" For example, in United States v. Reyes-Bonilla, the Ninth Circuit ruled an alien wasn't entitled to challenge a conviction for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a71326. The Ninth Circuit found that an alien's conviction for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a71326 could not be overturned due to a violation of his statutory rights, as he could not show the necessary prejudice. The immigration judge failed to provide the alien with notice of his rights, including the right to counsel in a language he could understand. However, the error was not deemed to have affected the outcome of the proceedings due to the alien's limited ability to obtain relief from removal. Aliens generally do not have constitutional or statutory rights to counsel at the government's expense in removal proceedings. The Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel for indigent persons does not apply in civil proceedings like removal, and the INA does not provide a right to counsel at the government's expense for most aliens. However, individual aliens could potentially have a right to counsel based on the Fifth Amendment or the Rehabilitation Act. Courts have generally not recognized a Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the government's expense for indigent aliens in removal proceedings. Aliens in removal proceedings do not have a Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel at the government's expense, as removal proceedings are civil, not criminal. However, aliens may be entitled to counsel at the government's expense in criminal proceedings that could lead to a judicial order of removal. The INA generally does not provide aliens with a right to counsel at the government's expense in removal proceedings, except for a provision in 8 U.S.C. Section 1534 that allows for counsel to be assigned to financially unable aliens in the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, which has not been utilized. Other provisions specify that aliens' right to counsel should be at no expense to the government, leading to debates on whether the government can provide or pay for aliens' counsel in removal proceedings. The INA does not guarantee aliens the right to government-funded counsel in removal proceedings, leading to debates on whether the government can provide or pay for aliens' counsel. Some argue that aliens can't claim entitlement to counsel at the government's expense, but the government can still pay for counsel under other laws or at its discretion. Federal courts have suggested that due process may require appointing counsel for aliens unable to represent themselves. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit's 1975 decision in Aguilera-Enriquez v. Immigration and Naturalization Service rejected the argument that Section 292 of the INA unconstitutionally deprived aliens of their right to counsel. The court indicated that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment may require appointed counsel for indigent aliens in certain cases, but it is determined on a case-by-case basis. Courts have recognized a Fifth Amendment right to appointed counsel for certain proceedings, but not for aliens in removal proceedings. A federal district court in Washington rejected the argument that unaccompanied alien children have a due process right to appointed counsel. The court stated that the right to counsel for aliens has not expanded and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. The government's expense in removal proceedings has been challenged in court, with recent decisions denying the government's motion to dismiss complaints brought by unaccompanied alien children (UAC). These decisions argue that UAC have a right to counsel at the government's expense to ensure due process under the Fifth Amendment. The courts emphasize the importance of individuals being heard and represented in a meaningful manner before facing significant consequences. The J.E.F.M. decision only addressed the federal government's motion to dismiss the aliens' complaint for failure to state a claim, without requiring the government to provide counsel to the plaintiff UAC at its expense. No court has found that the Due Process Clause mandates appointment of counsel for individual aliens. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act may require the appointment of \"qualified representatives,\" including legal counsel, for mentally incompetent aliens in removal proceedings. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs conducted by Executive agencies, ensuring reasonable accommodations for meaningful access to public services. In Franco-Gonzales v. Holder, mentally incompetent aliens established a prima facie case under Section 504, raising questions about the sufficiency of current protections in removal proceedings. The court found that existing protections for mentally incompetent aliens in removal proceedings are inadequate, as near relatives or friends acting as representatives cannot be compelled to appear. The appointment of qualified representatives for the entirety of immigration proceedings was deemed a reasonable accommodation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In a 2010 decision, the court defined a qualified representative as someone obligated to provide zealous representation, free of conflicts of interest, with adequate knowledge, and obligated to maintain confidentiality. A 2011 decision clarified that qualified representatives can include licensed attorneys, law students, or graduates supervised by attorneys. In 2013, a nationwide policy was adopted for unrepresented immigration detainees with serious mental disorders. This policy calls for qualified representatives to be available for individuals who may be mentally incompetent to represent themselves in immigration proceedings."
