The Congress finds the industrial and cultural heritage of northeastern Pennsylvania, including anthracite mining, ironmaking, textiles, and rail transportation, to be nationally significant. This heritage area also includes the social history and living cultural traditions of the region. The labor movement in the region played a significant role in developing the nation, forming key unions like the United Mine Workers of America and fighting for better wages and working conditions through strikes. The Department of the Interior is responsible for protecting the region's cultural and historic resources, which merit federal involvement to conserve and interpret this heritage for future generations. The Lackawanna Heritage Valley Authority is proposed as the management entity for a Heritage Area in northeastern Pennsylvania. The objectives of the Lackawanna Heritage Valley American Heritage Area include fostering relationships with government and communities, conserving historical resources, and pursuing economic opportunities in the region.
