Establishment of Gun Violence Reduction and Mental Health Counseling Trust Fund under SEC. 9512 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Gun Violence Reduction and Mental Health Counseling Trust Fund is created in the Treasury of the United States, funded by taxes under section 4181(b). 50 percent of the fund is allocated for community mental health services. The Gun Violence Reduction and Mental Health Counseling Trust Fund allocates 50 percent of funds for community mental health services and supplements existing provisions for health and crime control services. SEC. 4. PASSIVE CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY LOST AND STOLEN FIREARMS. The Attorney General, in consultation with the National Institute for Standards and Technology, will establish a national standard for incorporating passive identification capability into all firearms sold in the United States. Passive identification capability refers to technology that allows a firearm to be identified without emitting electronic signals for monitoring or tracking. Considerations for developing the standard include equal priority to certain factors. The Attorney General must prioritize the privacy rights of firearm owners under the 4th Amendment and their right to own firearms under the 2nd Amendment. Law enforcement should have the ability to track lost or stolen guns, manufacturers should be able to incorporate tracking technology, and the technology should be resistant to tampering. It is illegal to manufacture a firearm without passive identification capability. The Attorney General may impose a civil penalty on individuals who violate the requirement of having a firearm with passive identification capability, with a maximum penalty of $1,000 per firearm. This requirement will take effect within 3 years of the establishment of the national standard. SEC. 5. REPORTING OF LOST AND STOLEN FIREARMS. The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives will establish a \"National Database of Lost and Stolen Firearms\" within a year of this Act. The database will contain details of each reported firearm, including description, status (lost or stolen), report date, owner's name, source of the firearm, location of loss or theft, and reporting status. The database of lost and stolen firearms will be available to law enforcement authorities at all levels. Owners must report a lost or stolen firearm within 48 hours to local law enforcement. Penalties will be imposed for non-compliance. Penalties for failure to report loss or theft of firearms include a $10,000 fine per firearm. Local law enforcement must report lost or stolen firearms to the National Database within 7 days."
