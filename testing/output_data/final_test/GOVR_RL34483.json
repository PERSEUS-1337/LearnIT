    "content": "The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-378) reauthorizes programs for runaway and homeless youth, expands congressional oversight, and establishes new activities. Major provisions include funding for the Basic Center Program, Transitional Living Program, and Street Outreach Program, requirements for grantees, and accountability of programs. The law authorizes increased funding levels for FY2009, exceeding levels authorized for FY2004 by $35 million. It also increases minimum funding levels for states and territories and requires HHS to reallocate unused funds. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-378) mandates that states receive no less funding in FY2009 and FY2010 than in FY2008. It allows youth to stay longer in funded programs, with additional criteria for extended stays. The definition of \"homeless youth\" is expanded to include older individuals under certain circumstances. Priority is given to diverse applicants for grants related to runaway and homeless youth. HHS is required to establish regulations for accountability. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-378) mandates funding levels for states and allows longer stays in programs for homeless youth. It expands the definition of homeless youth and prioritizes diverse grant applicants. HHS must establish regulations for accountability in grant programs. The Youth Act authorized funding for various programs under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, with specific allocations for different years. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 set funding levels for different parts of the program, including the Street Outreach Program and a new study provision. Funding is distributed competitively by HHS to states and territories for the Basic Center Program and related activities. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 increased minimum annual funding for states and territories under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. The law allows the HHS Secretary to reallot unobligated funds to other states at the end of the fiscal year. Funding structure for the Transitional Living Program and Street Outreach Program remains unchanged. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 amended program requirements for Basic Center Program and Transitional Living Program facilities, allowing youth to stay for longer periods. Youth can now stay at a BCP shelter for up to 21 days and at a TLP project for up to 540 days. Funding for these programs is allocated competitively by HHS to community-based organizations. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 extended the stay duration for youth in Transitional Living Program facilities to 540 days (18 months) or up to 635 days (21 months) in exceptional circumstances. The definition of \"homeless youth\" was also amended to include individuals under 18 who cannot live safely with a relative or in an alternative arrangement. P.L. 110-378 expands the definition of \"homeless youth\" to include individuals aged 16 through 22, or older if permitted by law, who enter the Transitional Living Program before turning 22. The stay duration is 540 days, extendable to 635 days in special cases. Under current regulation, a \"runaway youth\" is defined as a person under age 18 who leaves home without permission. P.L. 110-378 also defines \"runaway youth\" as an individual who leaves home without parental permission. Applicants for TLP funding must now provide shelter, services, and assistance through a grant, agreement, or contract. Additionally, under P.L. 110-378, applicants for TLP and BCP grants must have an emergency preparedness plan. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 made changes to grant prioritization for services to runaway and homeless youth. Public agencies now receive priority alongside non-profit private agencies. Priority areas for grants have been modified, including a shift from mental health care to behavioral health care in projects addressing access to quality health care. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 prioritizes public agencies alongside non-profit private agencies for grants addressing runaway and homeless youth. Priority areas now include projects focusing on access to education, behavioral health care, and assisting youth in obtaining safe housing. The law also requires selected applicants to represent diverse geographic regions and serve diverse youth. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 prioritizes public agencies and non-profit private agencies for grants serving diverse youth. It includes provisions for improving program accountability, establishing performance standards, and issuing rules for grant recipients. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 prioritizes public and non-profit agencies for grants serving diverse youth. It requires HHS to integrate performance standards into grant processes for BCP, TLP, and SOP. Grantees are expected to meet performance measures set by OMB, including achieving 85% of youth entering safe settings after exiting care by FY2010. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 mandates performance standards for grants serving youth in programs like BCP, TLP, and SOP. Grantees must meet outcome measures such as increasing graduation rates, community service participation, and preventing youth from running away. Data is collected through the NEO-RHYMIS reporting system to track program effectiveness. Applicants must outline expected program results during the grant application process. Applicants must discuss the expected results of their programs, including quantitative outcomes that align with the program's purpose and scope. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 requires the Government Accountability Office to review the application process for BCP, TLP, and SOP grants, focusing on HHS's communication with unsuccessful applicants, clarity of application materials, and the peer review process. The application process for BCP, TLP, and SOP grants involves evaluation by an independent review panel using specific criteria to assign scores and identify strengths and weaknesses. The process includes discussing expected program results and the peer review process, as required by the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008. The grant announcements outline criteria such as identifying services, demonstrating organizational capacity, setting quantitative outcomes, defining program objectives, and providing an organizational chart for funded positions. The grant application process requires a detailed line-item budget and justification for project costs, along with reviewer scores that influence funding decisions. Other factors considered include comments from reviewers and officials, previous program performance, compliance with grant terms, and audit reports. HHS does not have an appeals process for unsuccessful RHYA grant applicants, but they are provided with a detailed explanation for the funding decision, including review comments on their application's strengths and weaknesses. Successful applicants also receive a compilation of review comments. The number of homeless and runaway youth is difficult to determine due to their mobility and lack of standardized counting methods. RHYA does not provide automatic scores to applicants, but they can request compilations of review comments. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 requires HHS to estimate the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth aged 13 to 26 every five years. HHS must conduct surveys and interviews to gather information on their characteristics, socioeconomic status, barriers to housing, and other relevant data. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 mandates HHS to estimate the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth aged 13 to 26 every five years. Surveys and interviews will be conducted to gather data on their characteristics, socioeconomic status, and barriers to housing. HHS will consult with states and the federal Interagency Council on Homelessness for the studies. The methodology for the studies is not specified, but HHS must use the best research methods available. Non-governmental organizations or individuals with expertise may be involved in carrying out the assessment. Funding is authorized for FY2009 through FY2013. The studies must be submitted to specific committees and made public. Hearings were conducted during the 110th Congress on this issue. During the 110th Congress, hearings were held on challenges facing runaway and homeless youth, including funding issues, lack of outcome data, and limited education and workforce opportunities. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 addresses these concerns, but concerns were raised about funding not keeping up with the cost of living. Costs have risen significantly for federal youth programs, including those funded by RHYA. Funding has remained stagnant, with individual local programs capped at $200,000 since 1992. This amount is insufficient to cover operational costs, leading to concerns about funding not keeping up with the cost of living. The funding for BCP and TLP programs has remained stable or slightly declined from FY2004 to FY2007. Average grant amounts for BCP stayed around $128,000, while TLP grant amounts decreased from $189,000 to $181,000. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 increased funding authorization for BCP, TLP, and SOP in FY2009. The continuing resolution for FY2009 (P.L. 110-329) provides funding at the same level as FY2008 for programs like the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Former homeless youth shared challenges of street life at Senate Judiciary and House Education hearings. One witness credited a TLP-funded program for helping him overcome drug use and achieve independence. Outcomes for homeless youth remain largely unknown. Limited information exists about the outcomes of runaway and homeless youth, with research on their adult homelessness experiences being outdated. Long-term studies are challenging due to their transient nature, and there is a lack of knowledge on effective strategies for serving these youth. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 requires HHS to determine the incidence and prevalence of runaway and homeless youth. HHS is conducting research on runaway and homeless youth to understand their characteristics and outcomes. A study by Abt Associates is evaluating the Transitional Living Program to identify factors contributing to the success or challenges of participating youth. Site visits have been conducted in Dallas, Texas; Portland, Oregon, to gather data. FYSB has conducted site visits to TLP grantees in Dallas, Portland, and Wichita, and consulted with HHS and experts to design the study. The TLP survey sites for the study have not been selected yet, but will likely have experience with homeless youth and continuous TLP funding. Staff at these sites will be trained to administer surveys to youth participants at entry, during services, and up to a year after leaving the program. Youth will self-report data online six and twelve months after exiting. FYSB plans to collect data from TLP graduates by having them self-report on a website six and twelve months after exiting the program. The data will be compared to benchmark data, and preliminary information will be available before all surveys are completed. HHS issued a proposed information collection request for public comment on the evaluation. The discussion focused on disconnected youth, who lack strong social networks for support in areas like employment, education, and housing. Factors such as family conflict, abuse, neglect, and involvement in the foster care system contribute to youth becoming disconnected. Some youth experience family disconnection due to abuse, neglect, and foster care involvement, leading to homelessness and barriers to education. LGBTQ+ youth may also face family disassociation when coming out. Transportation issues and lack of parental support contribute to homeless youth not attending school regularly. The Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 aims to connect runaway and homeless youth to education and career pathways by funding research projects. These projects prioritize increasing access to education, decreasing high school dropout rates, and improving placement in postsecondary education or workforce training programs."
