    "title": "SB 297",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends to impose an excise tax on medical marijuana at the point of sale, as outlined in Section 10508 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. The department shall develop an electronic verification process for timely decisions on means-tested public benefit programs, allowing county eligibility workers to access data electronically. The department shall develop an electronic verification process for means-tested public benefit programs, allowing county workers to access data electronically before requesting verification from applicants or recipients. The electronic verification process for means-tested public benefit programs must be completed before the federal waiver for Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87 expires. If the process includes information from agencies subject to federal credit reporting laws, the department must report to the Legislature on how it protects individuals' rights. Section 18901.10 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require county human services agencies to conduct telephone interviews for eligibility determination, with face-to-face interviews only if requested or deemed necessary. Compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code is mandatory for report submission. A face-to-face interview is required for households with disabilities, elderly individuals, or homeless individuals. Electronic interviews can be conducted if both parties have the capability. County human services agencies conduct interviews, and guidance is provided for electronic and telephonic signatures. The department will provide a technological solution for storing telephonic and electronic signatures in coordination with county human services agencies. Counties are not mandated to use this solution if they follow department guidance. The goal is to ensure all applicants can use telephonic and electronic signatures. The state and counties must conduct eligibility interviews through county human services agency workers. If the Commission on State Mandates finds this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies will follow government guidelines."
