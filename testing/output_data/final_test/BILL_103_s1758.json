    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stewardship Endowment Fund Act of 1993\" and outlines the findings, purpose, and intent of Congress. Congress finds the importance of steady and secure energy sources for national security, while also emphasizing the need to protect the environment. Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, a settlement was reached where Exxon agreed to pay $900 million over 10 years for damages. The settlement funds of $900 million over 10 years will be used for damages and environmental restoration in Alaska. A portion of the funds will be placed in a Stewardship Endowment Fund to generate income for long-term environmental restoration needs. Research is urgently needed to address catastrophic failures in salmon fisheries and other biological events. Research is needed to fully examine all possible causes and solutions for failures in salmon fisheries. A broad scientific investigation may be necessary to determine the impact of events in other geographic areas. Stable funding is essential for long-term research in Prince William Sound. An Endowment Fund will aid in the administration of settlement funds. The purpose of this Act is to establish a Stewardship Endowment Fund in the Treasury of the United States to facilitate the administration of settlement funds by designated Trustees for natural resources injured by the oil discharge from the T/V EXXON VALDEZ. The fund will create a stream of income to carry out the purposes specified in a Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree between the United States and the State of Alaska. The intent of Congress is to encourage the conservative use of settlement funds and earnings for the maintenance of restoration and enhancement activities in Prince William Sound, including long-term scientific studies and ecosystem research. SEC. 3. STEWARDSHIP ENDOWMENT FUND. Amends Title XXX of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 by adding a new section for the establishment of a Stewardship Endowment Fund. The definitions in this section include terms such as Agreement and Consent Decree, Endowment Fund, natural resources, Oil Spill, and restoration. The term 'restoration' refers to actions that aim to restore natural resources and services to their pre-spill condition, including replacing or substituting for injured resources and affected services. The term 'Trustees' refers to officials designated to act as trustees of natural resources injured as a result of the Oil Spill, pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. A Stewardship Endowment Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to restore natural resources in Alaska affected by the Oil Spill. The Fund consists of deposited sums and interest earned on investments. Trustees can transfer a portion of settlement funds to the Fund for investment by the Secretary with unanimous consent. The Endowment Fund shall be invested in various interest-bearing accounts or securities with the consent of the Trustees. Withdrawals from the corpus require unanimous consent, while permissive withdrawals can be made as needed. The Secretary shall transfer income of the Endowment Fund to the Trustees for expenditure in a manner consistent with restoration. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENT. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include a new item: \"Sec. 3022. Stewardship Endowment Fund.\""
