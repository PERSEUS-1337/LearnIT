They buy mortgages from lenders, package them into bonds backed by homeowners' payments, and sell these MBS to investors with a guarantee of timely payments. The value of mortgages purchased, securitized, and guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie exceeds $5 trillion, ensuring the availability of funds for mortgage borrowing. The global bond market, rather than the local banking industry, plays a significant role in mortgage lending. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's operations have increased accessibility to mortgage credit. The private-label MBS market saw a sharp decline in 2008 due to rising defaults and falling home values, leading to a significant decrease in new MBS issuances. The housing market downturn in 2010 led to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac becoming insolvent, prompting the government to place them under conservatorship in September 2008. The Federal Housing Finance Agency now controls their operations to prevent risks to the financial system and housing market. If Fannie and Freddie had failed, mortgage securitization would have been severely impacted. If Fannie and Freddie had failed, mortgage securitization would have dried up, causing banks to be reluctant to make new mortgage loans. Liquidation of the two entities would have led to a market dump of mortgage assets, driving down prices and increasing costs for new borrowers. Currently under conservatorship, Fannie and Freddie continue to support the housing market by issuing MBS and maintaining their portfolios, despite operating at a loss to the government. Private capital has not returned to the market, with over 90% of new mortgages being purchased, guaranteed, and securitized by government agencies. Continued government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship has been costly, with the Treasury injecting capital to prevent negative net worth. As of Q4 2010, purchases totaled $90.2 billion for Fannie Mae and $63.7 billion for Freddie Mac. There is little support for returning them to their pre-conservatorship status due to concerns about using their government-sponsored status for profit in good times and shifting losses to taxpayers in bad times. The Obama Administration's reform proposal identified reasons for the failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including their for-profit structure undermining their public mission and taking on excessive risks due to weak regulation. Their \"government-sponsored\" status gave them unfair competitive advantages in the market. The Obama Administration's reform proposal highlighted the issues with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such as their ability to borrow at lower rates and operate with more leverage due to implicit government support. Weak regulation and low capital requirements allowed them to dominate the mortgage market. The proposal aims to wind down their participation. The Obama Administration proposes to wind down Fannie and Freddie's participation in the housing market by removing their competitive advantages and restricting the types of mortgages they can purchase. This includes mechanisms like raising guarantee fees, obtaining credit loss protection from private insurers, and reducing investment portfolios to prevent them from operating as hedge funds. The Obama Administration proposes to wind down Fannie and Freddie's participation in the housing market by reducing the size of their portfolios, allowing conforming loan limits to expire, and increasing the required down payment on mortgages purchased by the two firms. These measures do not require congressional action and aim to reduce the firms' role in the housing market. The Obama Administration aims to wind down Fannie and Freddie's involvement in the housing market by shrinking their portfolios, letting conforming loan limits end, and raising the necessary down payment for mortgages they buy. Treasury Secretary Geithner estimates this process could take five to seven years, with the ultimate fate of Fannie and Freddie left undiscussed. The proposal suggests that the GSEs should eventually compete equally with Wall Street firms in the secondary mortgage market, without government charters giving them an advantage. This assumes that market participants will no longer see the charters as guaranteeing federal support, and that investors will assess the risk of Fannie and Freddie securities like private ones. Fully privatizing the two firms would need congressional approval, and the Administration's report outlines three potential long-term scenarios for the government's role in the housing market. The Obama Administration aims to wind down Fannie and Freddie's involvement in the housing market by shrinking their portfolios and raising down payment requirements. Three long-range scenarios for the government's role in housing finance involve tradeoffs among improving access to credit, housing investment incentives, protecting taxpayers, and ensuring financial stability. None of the options envision Fannie and Freddie remaining in their current roles, with an increasing government presence in housing finance in options one through three. The government may cover private losses in the mortgage market to prevent a standstill, shifting risk to the private sector. Option 3 poses more risk and potential distortion than options 1 and 2. Providing mortgage reinsurance to regulated insurers could lead to conflicts similar to Fannie and Freddie. An explicit government backstop could attract investors to buy MBS, ensuring a steady flow of funds into the mortgage market. Other housing finance reform proposals take different approaches. Housing finance reform proposals vary in approaches, with a key policy choice being the balance between protecting taxpayers from losses and providing government support to the mortgage market. Calls have been made to end Treasury support for Fannie and Freddie sooner to minimize taxpayer losses. Legislation like H.R. 1182 aims to set a definite timeline for ending government assistance. H.R. 1182 aims to end the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie within two years of enactment. If deemed financially viable, they will operate under new regulations, with the GSE charter set to expire in three years. Otherwise, the FHFA would place them into receivership and liquidate, potentially impacting bondholders. The GSEs would face new requirements and restrictions if they came out of conservatorship, including shrinking their investment portfolio to $250 billion within three years. Minimum capital requirements and guarantee fees would increase, conforming loan limit increases would be repealed, and restrictions on mortgage purchases and down payments would be imposed. Affordable housing goals for GSE purchases would also be repealed, along with certain current charter features. At the end of the three years following the end of conservatorship, Fannie and Freddie would be similar to private mortgage securitizers, with their government charters expiring. Their GSE status may be a competitive disadvantage due to more stringent regulation. Ending assistance to Fannie and Freddie too soon could shock the housing market. The Administration's plan for Fannie and Freddie, as outlined in H.R. 1182, includes changes such as expiration of loan limits, higher guarantee fees, and increased down payments. Other proposals suggest a larger government role in housing finance, with options from the Mortgage Bankers Association and the Center for American Progress aiming to maintain Fannie and Freddie's functions in regulated entities. These proposals would make private mortgage insurers operate more like Fannie and Freddie. The CAP and MBA proposals aim to create new mortgage institutions that would guarantee MBS meeting quality standards and provide credit risk insurance for low-risk mortgages. These entities would be subject to housing goals and regulations to prevent large investment portfolios. The CAP and MBA proposals include a federal guarantee for qualifying MBS, supporting affordable housing programs. The proposals aim to maintain the basic GSE concept while improving regulation and eliminating excesses. The losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are attributed to bad loans taken during the housing bubble. The losses at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are due to bad loans from the housing bubble. Currently, new loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are of higher quality, reducing the risk to taxpayers. The Administration is cautious about exposing taxpayers to pre-crisis mortgage risks, which could potentially make mortgage credit more accessible and affordable. Congress faces a trade-off in GSE reform."
