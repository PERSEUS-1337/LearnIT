    "content": "The Act titled \"Preventing Homeowners from Foreclosure Act of 2010\" establishes a Foreclosure Mediation Grant Program. The \"Preventing Homeowners from Foreclosure Act of 2010\" establishes a program for competitive grants to States and local governments to set up mediation programs for mortgagors facing foreclosure on home mortgages. Grants can only be used for foreclosure mediation programs that operate at the state or local government level. The program established by the \"Preventing Homeowners from Foreclosure Act of 2010\" applies to mortgagees initiating foreclosure proceedings and mortgagors subject to foreclosure. It provides referrals to attorneys or housing counselors for assistance. The program requires a meeting between the mortgagor and their representative before foreclosure proceedings, as well as a mediation conference conducted by the mortgagee. The program mandates a mediation conference to resolve foreclosure issues, held in an appropriate court with a neutral mediator, involving the mortgagee. The program requires a mediation conference for foreclosure issues involving the mortgagee and mortgagor or their representatives. If the mortgagor does not attend, verification by the mortgagee or their agent is sufficient. The grant recipient must verify foreclosure notice and receive authorization to proceed with foreclosure. An outreach program must be established to raise homeowner awareness. Grant recipients are selected through a competitive process based on set criteria. Recordkeeping is required for each grant recipient. Each grant recipient must maintain records of mediation conference outcomes, including loan modifications. Definitions for foreclosure proceedings, home mortgages, and grant recipients are provided in the Act. The Act defines terms such as grant recipient, mortgaged home, required foreclosure notice, and State. These definitions are important for understanding foreclosure proceedings and mediation conference outcomes. The Act authorizes appropriations for grants to territories and possessions of the United States for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will issue necessary regulations for implementation."
