    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Center for Bioengineering Research Act\". Congress finds that bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies physical, chemical, and mathematical sciences to advance knowledge in biology, medicine, and health. Efforts to reduce Federal budget deficits require maximizing productivity. Congress requested a report on bioengineering research at the National Institutes of Health in 1993. In 1994, an External Consultants Committee submitted a report to the Director of the National Institutes of Health on support for bioengineering research. In 1995, the Director submitted a report to Congress on Support for Bioengineering Research with recommendations for greater coordination. In 1996, an amendment directed specific plans and timeframes to be submitted to Congress. In 1997, the National Institutes of Health established the Bioengineering Consortium to advance bioengineering within the organization. Legislation is needed to support these efforts and maximize health benefits for the American people. Establishment of National Center for Bioengineering Research under SEC. 425A in the Public Health Service Act to advance bioengineering and maximize health benefits for Americans. The Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute will establish a National Center for Bioengineering Research to promote basic research in bioengineering and improve coordination of bioengineering research within the National Institutes of Health and the Federal Government. The Center will be headed by a director appointed by the Institute. The National Center for Bioengineering Research aims to increase funding for basic bioengineering research, improve grant application reviews, and promote collaborative research efforts. A conference of experts will provide recommendations on research directions and opportunities in bioengineering. The National Center for Bioengineering Research aims to promote joint funding of collaborative research projects, enhance communication among investigators, educate Congress and the public on the importance of bioengineering, convene experts annually, and submit an annual report to Congress. The National Center for Bioengineering Research receives annual funding for its operations and general bioengineering activities. The Center is not allowed to award grants with the provided amounts. Authorization of appropriations includes $750,000 for the Center's operation and $20,000,000 for bioengineering activities from 1998 to 2007. The Service Act is amended to include the National Center for Bioengineering Research."
