    "content": "U.S. scientists and engineers are rapidly developing novel materials at the nanoscale level, with potential applications in various industries. Despite enthusiasm for nanotechnology, concerns about environmental and health risks are restraining investment in some countries. Nanotechnology raises questions about potential environmental and health risks, leading some to call for government regulation to control these risks and prevent adverse consequences. The risks of unanticipated adverse consequences in the nanotechnology industry could lead to consumer rejection of all nanotechnology products. Some argue against federal regulatory requirements, fearing delays in environmental, health, and economic benefits. The challenges faced by federal EHS risk assessors, risk managers, and policy makers in regulating nanotechnology are discussed in this report. \"Nanotechnology involves manipulating tiny particles at a scale where quantum effects influence their properties. Materials at this scale can exhibit different chemical, physical, and biological properties. For example, nanoparticles of gold can have varying colors. Legislative approaches to address challenges in nanotechnology are being discussed.\" Nanoparticles of gold can exhibit different colors based on size and shape, with properties enhanced at the nanoscale due to high surface area. Therapeutic drugs in nanoparticles can be more effective than in larger particles. The United States leads in nanotechnology, with many patents and products incorporating nanoengineered materials available in the market. The President established the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to promote nanotechnology research and development in the United States. The NNI, codified by Congress in 2003, aims to advance products like faster-burning rocket fuel additives, cancer treatments, and detectors for biological toxins. The National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) overseen by the National Science and Technology Council (NSET) coordinates funding for nanotechnology research among federal agencies. Twenty-six federal agencies participate in the initiative, with 13 having an R&D budget for nanotechnology. Each agency allocates part of its budget to nanotechnology and reports its efforts to the NSET. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are actively exploring the EHS implications and risks of nanotechnology. Potential economic gains and beneficial uses are exciting, but concerns about potential risks associated with nanoparticles exist among scientists, policy makers, and consumer groups. Congress directed the NNP to address these concerns as nanotechnology develops. Scientists are exploring the potential use of nanoparticles to deliver medicine with minimal side effects, but there are concerns about their environmental impact and toxicity. Some nanoparticles have been found to be hazardous, raising questions about their safety. Some nanoparticles are toxic to microbes and may be more toxic than larger particles of the same composition. Studies show that toxicity of nanoparticles can vary and may not be solely based on size. Changing the surface chemistry of nanoparticles can sometimes make them non-toxic. The unknown potential of nanomaterials to harm the environment or human health could lead to consumer rejection of products with nanotechnology. Consumer products with nanotechnology may face backlash if consumers perceive inadequate federal oversight. Collaboration between researchers, analysts, and federal agencies is ongoing to address risks and define nanomaterial characteristics. EPA, FDA, and Consumer Product Safety are involved in addressing possible risks. The EPA, FDA, CPSC, and OSHA are actively researching the health and safety implications of nanotechnology and the need for regulations. Federal agencies are also studying the environmental, health, and safety applications of nanotechnology, facing challenges due to the wide variation in nanomaterial properties. Researchers are exploring different properties of nanomaterials for product development. Researchers and developers explore properties of nanomaterials, which can vary between batches supplied by manufacturers. Nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes can be modified by doping, coating, or embedding in other materials. Various elements and compounds are used in nanoengineering, with commercial products falling into categories like nanotubes, metal oxides, quantum dots, and clays. Nanomaterials have diverse properties due to chemical composition, dimensions, and shapes. Risks associated with nanomaterials depend on the application and exposure level. Potential uses are vast, with variations in risk throughout the product life cycle. The potential risks of nanomaterials in cosmetics vary throughout the product life cycle, including manufacture, use, recycling, treatment, or disposal. Traditional regulatory toxicology and risk assessment may be time-consuming and expensive, so a new approach called risk forecasting is proposed by Vicki Colvin of Rice University's International Council on Nanotechnology. This approach correlates material properties with environmental and human health effects to determine general factors affecting toxicity. The structure and chemical composition of nanomaterials can vary widely between batches, making it difficult and expensive to measure all properties. Researchers often do not investigate certain properties like melting point or solubility in water. There is a lack of agreement on which data is useful for assessing toxicity, leading to limited data collection in this area. Scientists are unsure which physical-chemical properties are most important for determining ecological and toxicological properties of nanomaterials. They emphasize the need to assess a material's surface reactivity and investigate key properties before assessing toxicity. Without routine data collection on basic properties, predicting relationships between size, structure, composition, and toxicity is not possible. The absence of consensus on naming conventions, scientific testing methods, and sample standards hinders data collection for predicting toxicity of nanomaterials. Developing internationally accepted standards could facilitate collaboration, data sharing, and the creation of a comprehensive dataset. The U.S. approach to standards development is voluntary, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology playing a role. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working on developing a measurement system and nomenclature for nanotechnology scientists and engineers. The NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) collaborates with industry, academia, and government to achieve common goals. They offer access to nanoscale measurement and fabrication capabilities through the CNST Nanofab, operated by professionals within an economical cost-sharing model. Other U.S. agencies like EPA and NIOSH are also involved in the Nanotechnology National Program (NNP) along with ANSI and ASTM International. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), ASTM International, the Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (established by NCI, NIST, and FDA), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) are collaborating on nomenclature, characterization, and measurement issues in nanotechnology. The U.S. government is working with trading partners to develop internationally consistent standards. Developing physical reference standards for each nanomaterial is a top priority for EHS risk assessment. Physical reference standards are crucial for identifying nanomaterials accurately. Vicki Colvin emphasizes the need for standards in EHS research for nanotechnology to ensure research results are interpretable. Funding for workshops to develop these standards is lacking, hindering progress in the field. Funding is essential for travel to workshops by academics and federal employees related to nanotechnology research. Private entities conducting nanomaterial research are hesitant to disclose details due to competition and regulatory concerns. Scientists in private labs focus on specific nanomaterials, limiting their scope of research. The proprietary nature of nanotechnology hinders scientific study by limiting data sharing, which is crucial for detecting patterns in toxicity and characteristics of nanomaterials. Limited access to diverse data impedes the development of theoretical models for hypothesis testing in nanotoxicology. Some hope lies in augmenting synthesized data with information on naturally occurring nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be naturally occurring or incidentally produced, with thousands of peer-reviewed articles available on both types. Synthesized nanomaterials differ from natural ones. Interdisciplinary collaboration is hindered by a lack of common understanding and terminology. Limited federal resources are available to evaluate EHS implications and regulate nanomaterials, as executive agency budgets responsible for monitoring and regulating risks have remained steady or declined in recent years. EPA's budget has stayed relatively flat for the past 20 years and has slightly decreased since 2003, despite expanded duties and the expiration of Superfund tax authority. The Superfund tax authority has expired, leading to the EPA's budget covering the costs of cleaning up hazardous waste sites. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is also facing budget constraints, which may impact its ability to maintain standards. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is experiencing funding issues and requires increased resources according to a workshop convened by the Institute of Medicine. Congress should approve increased resources for the FDA as recommended by two organizations formed in 2006. A recent report by the Subcommittee on Science and Technology of FDA's Science Board highlighted serious scientific deficiencies at the agency due to growing demands without sufficient resources. The FDA is facing challenges due to increasing demands without sufficient resources, posing a risk to public safety. Despite encouragement to allocate more budget to nanotechnology research, only a small percentage of funding is currently allocated. Only a small percentage of funding is allocated to research on the potential applications and implications of nanotechnology for the environment and human health and safety. EPA's budget for nanotechnology in FY2006 was $3.7 million, with some funding directed towards environmentally beneficial applications like removing arsenic from water. EPA was the only regulatory agency contributing to NNI funding in the President's budget, reflecting the rudimentary understanding of nanomaterials. The National Science Foundation receives the bulk of the EHS research budget for scientific studies, totaling $21 million in FY2006. Research is focused on developing standardized tools for nanomaterials and understanding their interactions with living organisms. A lack of clear statutory directives or regulatory frameworks poses a potential obstacle to federal risk management for nanotechnology. The existing environmental, health, and safety statutes may need new policies, guidance, and regulations to address nanomaterials. One concern with existing environmental, health, and safety statutes is the potential for redundant or inconsistent regulation of nanomaterials under multiple federal laws, such as the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Agencies may face controversy in making decisions that could delay or restrict commerce or allow unknown health or environmental risks associated with nanoproducts. EPA has expressed intent to regulate nanosilver under FIFRA. The EPA intends to regulate nanosilver under FIFRA for products with antibacterial properties. Various EPA offices have responsibilities for managing nanomaterials, including nanosilver. The EPA's Science Policy Council formed a Nanotechnology Workgroup to address key science issues related to nanotechnology benefits and potential risks. The Toxic Substances Control Act allows coordination to reduce regulatory burden. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) allows coordination to reduce regulatory burden and aims for maximum enforcement with minimal duplicative requirements. Certain nanomaterials may be excluded from TSCA requirements, such as those used only in research laboratories or those not meeting the definition of a \"chemical substance\" under TSCA Section 2. The EPA does not consider size a relevant feature under TSCA for nanoparticles, despite size being a central issue with nanomaterials. Regulations can complicate agency decisions regarding nanomaterials, as laws often exclude small quantities of chemicals not yet in commerce from regulatory requirements. The exclusion of nanomaterials from regulatory requirements, such as food additive regulations, may be possible if they are considered to be generally recognized as safe by the FDA. This raises concerns about the limitations of existing laws regarding nanomaterials. Some stakeholders are engaging in \"responsible development\" of nanotechnologies, with professional organizations, industries, universities, and government involved in initiatives. The IEEE is developing standard methods for electronics and photonics products, while companies like Intel and DuPont adhere to responsible principles to minimize EHS problems. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is collaborating with industry to gather data on exposure and worker health related to nanotechnologies. Stakeholders are calling for additional research to determine the best approach to protecting health and safety. EPA emphasizes partnerships with industrial sectors to ensure responsible development from the start. Working with producers, suppliers, and users to establish best practices and standards throughout the supply chain is crucial for responsible development of nanomaterials. The EPA launched the Nanoscale Materials Stewardship Program (NMSP) in 2008 to oversee the development and management of nanomaterials. The program offers basic and in-depth participation levels for manufacturers and processors to provide data, identify risk management practices, and develop risk management plans. The information gathered will guide the agency's TSCA program for regulating nanoscale materials. The Nano Risk Framework, developed by DuPont Corporation in partnership with Environmental Defense, aims to manage and reduce potential risks of engineered nanomaterials. Another initiative by the International Council on Nanotechnology at Rice University promotes responsible development of nanotechnology. ICON is a globally supported organization focused on nanotechnology risk management. Their mission is to communicate potential risks and promote risk reduction while maximizing societal benefit. Collaboration between nanotechnology developers and toxicologists is encouraged to understand and mitigate material toxicity. Tight collaboration between materials engineers, chemists, and toxicologists is essential for engineering safer nanomaterials. Regulatory challenges may be resolved over time through stakeholder collaboration and gradual adaptation of rules by federal regulators. Congress may take a wait-and-see approach to nanotechnologies, but legislative strategies are available if intervention is needed. The contribution from agencies' budgets to the National Nanotechnology Initiative has significantly increased. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has seen substantial growth in funding over the years, including for research on the potential environmental, health, and safety (EHS) implications of nanotechnologies. This growth has sometimes come at the expense of other programs within regulatory agencies like EPA, FDA, and CPSC. The National Research Council has recommended increased funding for research on evaluating health and safety risks associated with nanotechnologies. The National Nanotechnology Initiative has seen increased funding for research on potential health and safety risks associated with nanotechnologies. Requests for additional funding for EHS-related research have been made by companies, public interest groups, and the NanoBusiness Alliance. Legislation such as H.R. 5940 and S. 3274 aim to reauthorize the initiative and require oversight for planning and budget requests for EHS research. The funding level for EHS research is suggested to be around 10% of the total initiative's funding. Congress may need to consider changing the allocation of research funding among agencies for nanotechnology research, including increasing or decreasing basic research relative to risk assessment research. Policy analysts have emphasized the need for a strategy to avoid duplication of research and set priorities in nanotechnology-related EHS research. The House Committee on Science has requested the National Nanotechnology Initiative to develop such a strategy. The House Committee on Science requested the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to develop a strategy for Environmental and Health Implications (EHS) research. In September 2006, the NNI provided a general framework developed by the NEHI Working Group, identifying five research categories: instrumentation, nanomaterials and human health, nanomaterials and the environment, health and environmental surveillance, and risk management methods. Some experts criticized the categorization for lacking direction and advocated for a more centralized approach to EHS research management. The priorities for evaluating and predicting the toxicity of nanoparticles were identified in a paper published in November 2007, based on a workshop held in April 2006. The six critical information needs include physico-chemical characterization, macromolecular perturbation, potential for carrying toxic molecules, translocation, agglomeration state, and chemical composition. There is a disagreement on whether a top-down approach is necessary for this research. The debate over the need for a top-down approach in overseeing nanotechnology EHS research continues, with proponents arguing for an interagency working group to address a wide range of issues. Environmental Defense suggests potential conflicts in NNI responsibilities and calls for independent budgetary and management authority for EHS oversight. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed the need for independent budgetary and management authority for the National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) to develop and direct the Federal nanomaterial risk research strategy. This approach is modeled after the federal government's oversight of nuclear power. The Committee aims to prioritize and coordinate all Federal environmental, health, and safety research to ensure that nanotechnology's benefits are realized while protecting human health and the environment. The Committee urges EPA to work with the National Academy of Sciences to develop a research roadmap for nanotechnology. The Senate did not act on S. 1696, but the report language is being treated as approved. The National Academy will review the NNI strategy. The NSTC released the final NNI Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related Environmental, Health, and Safety. The NSTC released the final NNI Strategy for Nanotechnology-Related Environmental, Health, and Safety Research in February 2008. The strategy prioritizes research needs in five categories, with a focus on instrumentation, metrology, and analytical methods. Coordination of research will be handled by different agencies based on the specific areas of human health, environment, and exposure. The NSET is responsible for coordinating research on human and environmental exposure assessment, while risk management research will be coordinated by the FDA and EPA. H.R. 5940 and S. 3274 would require the OSTP Director to designate an associate director as Coordinator for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology, overseeing the development and implementation of a research plan for environmental, health, and safety activities within the NNI. The bill aims to address ethical, legal, environmental, and societal concerns related to nanotechnology, including human health. It encourages public-private partnerships for EHS research and requires a research plan with specific objectives, milestones, agency roles, funding allocation, and information collection by regulatory agencies. Congress may intervene to ensure adequate information collection by regulatory agencies. Congress may need to pass legislation to ensure that information about the potential risks of nanotechnology and nanomaterials is collected by regulatory agencies. This could involve directing or constraining agency action to require manufacturers to determine physical and chemical properties, conduct toxicity tests, and report relevant information. Requirements or constraints could be phased in based on risk and industry investments, such as tying increased information demands to the introduction of new applications or products. Regulatory agencies may need additional authority or legislation to collect information on nanomaterial risks. This could involve requiring manufacturers to submit health and safety studies, with options including amending existing statutes or enacting new legislation. Options to reduce unintended consequences of legislation authorizing research funding include allowing manufacturers to share test data and costs, granting exclusive production or marketing rights, or exempting certain products or manufacturers from requirements. Existing laws like the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act provide examples of tailored requirements. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) directs EPA to promulgate testing and reporting requirements for pesticides, mechanisms for simplifying requirements for safe pesticides, and grants exclusive data use. Tailoring requirements may be seen as unfair by some regulated entities, while exemptions for small enterprises could reduce important risk assessment information. Requiring testing or reporting could provide useful information for regulatory agencies to evaluate EHS risks and benefits. Congress could legislate to ensure that nanotechnology is regulated for environmental, health, and safety risks. This could involve authorizing or restricting agencies' authorities to regulate various stages of nanomaterials' lifecycle. While imposing requirements on manufacturers may delay benefits, it could also reduce risks from exposure to nanomaterials. The Bush Administration has issued guidelines for potential regulations under existing statutes. The potential economic benefits of nanotechnology could be quickly realized if Congress restricts agencies' authority to regulate, but this may also increase the risks of adverse consequences. The cost of these consequences would depend on their severity, frequency, and reversibility, as well as public perception. Companies developing nanotechnology products could suffer if consumers reject all nanotechnology products. Additional research is needed to identify potential hazards and evaluate risks to the environment and human health and safety. The regulatory challenges of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies include diversity, lack of data, standardization issues, and limited resources in regulatory agencies. Congress may need to intervene by increasing funding for research, changing allocation of resources, adopting a national/international strategy, or enacting legislation to address these challenges. H.R. 4040 and S. 3274 propose oversight of EHS research plan for nanomaterials, as Congress addresses regulatory challenges in early stages of nanotechnology development."
