    "content": "The federal income tax system consists of various components, with the individual income tax being the largest revenue generator at 50% in FY2018. Corporate income tax contributes around 7% of total revenue, while social insurance or payroll taxes account for 35%. The remaining revenue comes from excise taxes (3%) and other sources (6%). Most income reported on individual tax returns is from wages and salaries, making up 68% of gross income in 2018. In the United States, a significant portion of business income is taxed in the individual income tax system, including pass-through businesses like sole proprietorships and partnerships. Projections show that 10% of income reported by individual taxpayers in 2018 will be from business, farm, or Schedule E income. Economists often refer to the Haig-Simons comprehensive income definitions to define taxable resources as changes in a taxpayer's ability to consume during the tax year. The individual income tax in the United States is based on gross income from various sources, including wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and more. Certain items like employer-provided health insurance and pension contributions are excluded from taxable income. Employer contributions to Social Security are also not included in taxable wages. Certain exclusions from income for tax purposes include employer-provided health insurance, pension contributions, and Social Security contributions. Additionally, amounts received under life insurance contracts and interest from certain state and local bonds are excluded. Capital gains and dividends are subject to special rules, with exclusions for certain capital gains on primary residences. Income from operating a business or rental property is also taxable. Income from operating a business, such as a Subchapter S corporation or rental property, is subject to individual income tax. This income is calculated as gross receipts minus deductible costs like labor, depreciation, and interest. Adjusted gross income (AGI) is determined by subtracting \"above-the-line\" deductions from gross income, which are available regardless of itemizing deductions. Tax liability is based on the taxpayer's filing status. Tax liability is determined by the taxpayer's filing status, with four main categories: married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, and single individual. The standard deduction amount varies based on filing status, with options to claim either the standard deduction or itemized deductions. Additional standard deductions are available for the elderly and blind, indexed for inflation. The standard deduction amount is indexed for inflation and can be claimed by taxpayers, with options to itemize deductions if they exceed the standard deduction. Deductions are allowed for mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and up to $10,000 for state and local taxes. Some deductions, like medical expenses, can only be claimed in excess of a certain percentage of AGI. The JCT estimates that for 2018, 135.2 million tax returns will use the standard deduction, while 20.4 million will itemize deductions. The deduction for qualified business income is also taken into account in determining taxable income. The deduction for qualified business income allows individual taxpayers to deduct 20% of income from partnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships, REIT dividends, and other sources. The deduction phases out for certain service-based income above threshold amounts of $315,000 for married taxpayers and $157,500 for others. It is also limited by the taxpayer's share of W-2 wages and capital investment. The income tax system is progressive with marginal tax rates increasing as income rises. In 2018, there are seven marginal income tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%. Taxpayers pay the same rate within a bracket, and higher rates apply only to income exceeding threshold levels. The deduction for qualified business income allows a 20% deduction for certain income sources, with limitations based on W-2 wages and capital investment. Tax rates for 2018 are summarized in Table 1, with threshold levels based on filing status. Higher-income individuals may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) with marginal rates of 26% and 28%. Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends may be taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on taxable income and filing status. The 20% rate applies to taxpayers in the former 39.6% bracket. Taxpayers in the 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35% tax brackets now face a 15% tax rate on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends, while those in the 10% and 15% brackets have a 0% rate. Higher-income individuals may be subject to an additional 3.8% tax on net investment income, with thresholds of $250,000 for joint filers and $200,000 for others. This increases the maximum tax rate on capital gains and dividends to 23.8%. Tax credits can offset tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with refundable credits allowing for refunds if the credit amount exceeds tax liability. Unused credits can be carried forward to future tax years, and some credits are phased out as income rises. Refundable tax credits include the earned income tax credit (EITC) and the child tax credit (CTC). Tax credits, such as the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for tuition expenses and nonrefundable credits for child and dependent care, add complexity to the tax system. They can cause effective marginal tax rates to differ from statutory rates, with the earned income tax credit (EITC) reducing rates as income increases. Tax credits also present administrative challenges and may affect individuals subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). The alternative minimum tax (AMT) applies lower tax rates to a broader income base to prevent higher-income taxpayers from avoiding taxes. To calculate the AMT, certain deductions and preferences are added back to taxable income. The AMT exemption for 2018 is $109,400 for married joint filers, $54,700 for married separate filers, and $70,300 for other individuals, indexed for inflation. The exemption is reduced as income exceeds certain thresholds. The AMT exemption amount for 2018 begins to phase out at $1,000,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $500,000 for other individual tax filers. A two-tiered rate structure of 26% and 28% is applied to AMT taxable income. Taxpayers compare their AMT tax liability to their regular tax liability and pay the greater amount. Nonrefundable personal tax credits can be used against the AMT. The JCT estimates that around 600,000 tax filers will pay the AMT in 2018. Corporate income tax generally applies to C corporations, which are taxed separately from their shareholders. Pass-through businesses, such as S corporations and partnerships, pass their income through to owners who pay taxes at individual income tax rates. Business income for these entities is taxed only once. Corporate income tax is a tax on corporate profits, calculated as total income minus associated costs. Expenses like employee compensation can be deducted from income. The corporate income tax allows deductions for expenses like employee compensation, depreciation, supplies, advertising, and interest payments. Special deductions, credits, and preferences are also available to reduce taxes paid by corporations. Tax liability is calculated as Taxes = [(Total Income \u2013 Deductible Expenses) \u00d7 Tax Rate ] \u2013 Tax Credits. Net operating losses (NOLs) can be carried forward after 2017. The corporate income tax rate is 21%, with deductions for expenses like employee compensation, depreciation, and interest payments. Net operating losses (NOLs) can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future tax liability. Tax credits can further reduce corporate tax liability, including credits for research, low-income housing, energy, new markets, work opportunity, and employer credits for paid family and medical leave. Corporate income tax is based on the return to equity capital, including income from both borrowed funds and equity investments. The corporate income tax largely applies to equity capital, with deductions for expenses like wages and interest payments. Equity investments are financed by retained earnings and stock sales, generating income through dividends and capital gains. The tax base excludes labor's contribution and returns to debt capital, focusing on the return to equity capital. The corporate tax burden is mainly on owners of capital, including bondholders and homeowners. The tax is seen as progressive as it affects higher income groups. The US has a quasiterritorial tax system, with dividends from foreign corporations eligible for deductions, but certain incomes are taxed immediately under subpart F. Certain forms of passive or easily shifted income are taxed in the year earned under subpart F. Global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) is taxed at 10.5%, with a deduction allowed for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). The base erosion and antiavoidance tax (BEAT) disallows deductions for certain \"base erosion\" payments made by U.S. parents to their foreign subsidiaries. BEAT imposes a minimum tax of 5% on corporations with average annual gross receipts of at least $500. Payroll taxes fund specific programs like Social Security and Medicare. The combined rate for Social Security and Medicare taxes is 15.3% of wages, with 7.65% paid by both employees and employers. The Social Security tax is 6.2% for both parties, while the Medicare tax is 1.45%. There is no wage cap for the Medicare tax. The Medicare HI tax applies to all wage earnings, with an additional 0.9% tax for certain higher-income taxpayers. Married taxpayers filing jointly with combined wages above $250,000 are subject to the extra tax, while the threshold for single and head of household filers is $200,000. Employers may also face a federal unemployment insurance payroll tax of 0.6% on the first $7,000 of wages. Most taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes, with low- and middle-income taxpayers paying more in payroll taxes. Upon death, an individual's estate may be subject to federal estate tax, with a base on property transferred at death. Deductions and exemptions can lower the taxable amount, with an exemption of $11.2 million for 2018. The estate over this amount is taxed at a rate of 40%. The federal gift tax works alongside the estate tax to prevent tax avoidance through property transfers to heirs before death. The gift tax and estate tax work together to prevent tax avoidance by transferring property before death. The gift tax exempts the first $15,000 of gifts annually, with any amount over this reducing the lifetime estate tax exemption of $11.2 million. Taxable gifts lower the exemption available for estate tax purposes, with a 40% tax rate for gifts beyond the exemption amount. Only a small percentage of taxpayers pay the estate tax, with estimates showing 0.06% of decedents paying through 2025. The estate tax is progressive, with taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentile estimated to pay 0.2% of cash income in 2016. The estate tax for taxpayers in the top income percentiles was estimated to be 0.5% of cash income in 2016, increasing with higher exemption levels in 2018. Excise taxes are levied on goods and services, not income, with the largest tax being on gasoline. Federal excise taxes are collected at various points, including production and retail sales. The largest federal excise tax is on gasoline, with other significant excise taxes on diesel, fuels, trucks, trailers, aviation, alcohol, tobacco, ACA fees, firearms, and ammunition. Most excise taxes go to specific federal trust funds, with an estimated $108 billion in revenue in 2018, 61% supporting trust funds like the Highway Trust Fund. Aviation-related taxes support the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Aviation-related excise taxes, along with other general fund excise taxes, can lead to higher prices for consumers. These taxes are considered regressive, with lower-income households bearing a larger burden compared to higher-income households. Federal excise taxes vary in their degree of regressivity, with tobacco taxes being more regressive than aviation-related taxes. Overall, federal tax revenues come from various sources and have ranged from one-fifth to one-seventh of the economy. Federal tax revenues have been around 16.7% of GDP in 2018, slightly below the post-World War II average. Individual income tax is the main revenue source, with receipts decreasing from 10% of GDP in 2000 to 6% in 2010, but increasing to 8.3% in 2018. Corporate income tax has fallen to the third-most important revenue source over time. The changing shares of federal revenues over time are evident in Figure 6, with corporate income tax declining from 30% of federal revenue in 1946 to 9% in 2016. By 2021, it is projected to further decline to 7%. Excise tax revenue has decreased from nearly 18% in 1946 to roughly 3% currently. On the other hand, social insurance and retirement taxes have increased post-World War II and now account for approximately 35% of federal revenue. In 2018, lower-income taxpayers have a negative share of individual income taxes, receiving more in refundable tax benefits than they pay. Taxpayers above $200,000 pay more in taxes than their share of income earned. The tax system is generally progressive, with higher-income taxpayers paying a larger share of taxes, leading to a more equal distribution of after-tax income. The U.S. tax system is generally progressive, with higher-income taxpayers paying a larger share of taxes. However, payroll and excise taxes tend to be regressive, offsetting some of the progressivity of the individual income tax. Compared to other OECD countries, total U.S. taxes as a percentage of GDP have historically been below average, with some countries having lower taxes and others having higher taxes relative to the size of the economy. The United States has the lowest revenue and spending as a percentage of GDP among G-7 countries, with the second-highest deficit level in 2017. Changes to the federal tax system in 2018 may lead to further adjustments by Congress. Tax policy for the 115th Congress could be influenced by the changes enacted in P.L. 115-97, with considerations for expirations, phase-ins, and delayed policies. The report provides an overview of the federal tax system in 2018, including information on taxes relative to the economy, tax burden distribution, and global comparisons. This information may help in considering modifications to expirations, phase-ins, or other delayed policies in P.L. 115-97."
