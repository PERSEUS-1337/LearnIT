    "content": "Companion bills (S. 1155 / H.R. 2470) in the 109th Congress propose establishing a Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA) to review federal agencies and programs for duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or failed aspects. The bills differ in member appointment procedures, scope of agencies covered, and requirements for using saved funds. The 109th Congress proposed establishing a Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies (CARFA) to review and realign or eliminate programs and agencies. Recommendations would be included in an implementation bill for expedited congressional consideration. Similar provisions appeared in other bills and resolutions, including a budget process reform bill and a bill to offset costs of Hurricane Katrina and Rita. President George W. Bush also mentioned including CARFA in his FY2006 budget submission as part of his President's Management Agenda. The Bush Administration proposed legislation for \"results commissions\" to consider restructuring programs and agencies. The commissions would expedite approval of proposals by Congress. Bills (H.R. 3276 / S. 1399) were introduced to establish these commissions. This report analyzes issues related to the CARFA legislation. The CARFA proposal is compared to the BRAC commissions for expedited congressional consideration. OMB suggests using the PART tool for program evaluation. The results commissions proposal resembles presidential reorganization authority. The results commissions proposal is similar to the BRAC commissions for expedited congressional consideration. It involves multi-stage review of reorganization plans by the commission, President, and Congress. The report summarizes the history and provisions of the CARFA legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses, discusses other review commission legislation, highlights perspectives on advantages and disadvantages, and analyzes issues for the 109th Congress. The report discusses issues related to establishing a review commission, including membership, scope, definitions, decision-making criteria, congressional consideration, and transparency. It also explores potential success factors and alternatives/complements to a review commission, such as government reorganization and agency program evaluation. Legislative history of the proposed CARFA legislation in the 108th and 109th Congresses is also examined. In the 108th Congress, Senator Sam Brownback introduced legislation to establish a commission to review Federal agencies and programs for efficiency. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management. The subcommittee held a hearing on S.1668 on May 6, 2004, but the bill did not progress further. A companion House bill, H.R. 3213, introduced by Representative Todd Tiahrt, also did not receive further action. Both bills proposed the creation of CARFA, a commission appointed by the President to review non-defense, non-entitlement federal agencies and programs, accounting for one-fifth of the federal budget. The bills aimed to use funds saved for other domestic programs or to pay down the national debt. Similar provisions were seen in various budget process reform bills in the 108th Congress. The CARFA proposal in the 108th Congress aimed to establish a commission to review federal executive agencies and programs, with provisions in budget resolutions for realigning or eliminating government agencies and programs. The CARFA proposal in the 108th Congress aimed to establish a commission to review federal executive agencies and programs, with provisions in budget resolutions for realigning or eliminating government agencies and programs that are duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, or irrelevant. Senator Brownback referenced the CARFA proposal during Senate consideration of the resolution, which called for the enactment of legislation to create a bipartisan commission to submit recommendations on eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, and achieving cost savings. The CARFA proposal in the 109th Congress aimed to provide recommendations for achieving cost savings through enhancing program efficiencies in government agencies and programs. The Senate-passed budget resolution for FY2006 included a provision similar to previous years, calling for a review of agencies that are duplicative, inefficient, outdated, or irrelevant. The Senate passed a resolution calling for a review of federal agencies and programs to provide recommendations for realigning or eliminating wasteful, duplicative, inefficient, outdated, or irrelevant government entities. The language was amended to include an assessment of programs on an accrual basis. The conference report was agreed upon in both the House and Senate, leading to the introduction of bills proposing the establishment of CARFA or a similar entity. Several bills were introduced proposing the establishment of CARFA or a similar commission, including the Family Budget Protection Act of 2005. The bill aimed to reform the budget process and establish a Commission to Eliminate Waste, Fraud, and Abuse. This measure was endorsed by the Republican Study Committee but has not received further action. Senator John Ensign introduced S. 1928 (Spending Money Accountably to Rebuild After Tragedy Act) in 2005, which aimed to establish a CARFA. Similarly, Representative Tiahrt introduced H.R. 2470 (Commission on the Accountability and Review of Federal Agencies Act) with identical provisions. Both bills were referred to committees but did not progress further. The bill, H.R. 2470, introduced by Representative Tiahrt and Senator Brownback's legislation, S. 1668, proposed the establishment of a commission with a scope excluding the Department of Defense and entitlement programs. The bill also included provisions for presidential appointment of commission members and the allocation of saved funds for domestic programs or national debt reduction. Senator Brownback introduced S. 1155, a similar bill, but it did not progress beyond the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Senator Brownback's bill, S. 1155, differed from the previous version by expanding the commission's scope to include DOD, entitlement programs, and the Executive Office of the President. It also allowed for a \"hybrid\" appointment of commission members by the President and Members of Congress. The bill no longer required saved funds to support domestic programs or pay down the national debt. Senator Brownback explained the changes and his hopes for the proposal. Witnesses supported the CARFA concept, with improvements made based on suggestions. The Senate backed CARFA through Section 502 of the budget resolution. A proposal for \"results commissions\" was compared to CARFA, with OMB mentioning it in a press release. The proposed results commission was likened to the Base Realignment and Closure program. President George W. Bush addressed the issue on February 7, 2005. President George W. Bush proposed legislation to create results commissions as part of the budget and performance integration initiative. The Administration cited dysfunctional program overlap and overlapping jurisdictions in Congress as reasons for poor program performance. The Administration proposed legislation to create Results Commissions to address poor program performance caused by overlapping programs and jurisdictions in Congress. The President would have the authority to propose these commissions, which would consider restructuring or consolidating programs to improve efficiency and productivity. Congress would approve individual Results Commissions to address specific programs or policies. The Administration proposed legislation to create Results Commissions to address poor program performance caused by overlapping programs and jurisdictions in Congress. Congress would approve individual Results Commissions to address single program or policy areas where duplication and overlapping jurisdictions hinder reform. Proposals approved by the commission would then be approved by the President and considered by Congress under expedited procedures. Deputy Director for Management Johnson announced that the Administration would submit the results and sunset commission draft legislation to Congress in the next few months. Senator Brownback had sponsored similar legislation in the previous Congress, alluding to his CARFA bill. OMB released the legislative proposal to establish results commissions and a sunset commission, entitled \"The Government Reorganization and Program Performance Improvement Act of 2005.\" The Administration proposed legislation to create Results Commissions to address poor program performance caused by overlapping programs and jurisdictions in Congress. Bills were introduced in the Senate and House that substantially incorporated the draft results and sunset commission language, albeit with some changes. Representative Jon Porter introduced H.R. 3276 (Government Reorganization and Improvement of Performance Act), which would provide only for results commissions, with two original cosponsors. The bill introduced by Representative Kevin Brady, H.R. 3277, aimed to establish a sunset commission. It was referred to House Committees on Rules and Government Reform, and later to the House Committee on Government Reform's Subcommittee on the Federal Workforce and Agency Organization for a hearing. However, the bill did not progress further. Senator Craig Thomas introduced S. 1399, a bill for results commissions and a sunset commission, referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs but has not progressed further. The bills (H.R. 3276 / S. 1399) differ from the proposed CARFA legislation in various aspects related to the establishment of commissions and the need for further congressional action. The proposed CARFA Act differs from the results commissions proposal in terms of commission establishment, membership appointment, scope of review, decision-making criteria, transparency, public participation, and commission powers. The proposed results commissions and CARFA legislation aim to expedite congressional consideration of commission recommendations. The results commission proposals resemble presidential reorganization authority, which expired in 1984. The CARFA Act was proposed instead of reorganization authority due to the Administration's belief that it would not be approved by Congress. The CARFA legislation, introduced in the 109th Congress, establishes a 12-member commission to review recommendations. Members must be appointed within 90 days of enactment. The House and Senate versions of the bill are discussed, highlighting any substantive differences. The CARFA legislation establishes a 12-member commission to review recommendations, with members appointed within 90 days. The House version requires the President to appoint all members, while the Senate version has a \"hybrid\" commission with members appointed by the President and certain Members of Congress. Both versions require the President to designate a chairperson and vice chairperson. The commission would evaluate executive branch agencies and programs, excluding those within the Department of Defense. The CARFA legislation establishes a commission to review executive branch agencies and programs, excluding those within the Department of Defense, entitlement programs, and the EOP. The commission will determine if agencies are duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or failed, and submit a plan with recommendations for realignment or elimination within two years of enactment. The CARFA legislation establishes a commission to review executive branch agencies and programs, excluding those within the Department of Defense, entitlement programs, and the EOP. The commission will determine if agencies are duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or failed, and submit a plan with recommendations for realignment or elimination within two years of enactment. The House version requires recommendations for realignment or elimination if agencies are deemed wasteful or inefficient, with saved funds to support other domestic programs or pay down the national debt. The Senate version allows but does not require recommendations for realignment or elimination, with no specified use for saved funds. The President must establish a systematic method for assessing agency effectiveness and accountability within one year of enactment. The CARFA legislation establishes a commission to review executive branch agencies and programs, excluding those within the Department of Defense, entitlement programs, and the EOP. The commission will assess the effectiveness and accountability of covered programs, identify common performance measures, and have powers to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, and secure information from federal agencies. Non-federal CARFA members would not receive compensation except for travel expenses. The CARFA chairperson can appoint and terminate an executive director and staff without following civil service laws. The pay for the executive director and staff cannot exceed the maximum rate for a GS-15 position. They are considered federal employees for various benefits under Title 5, United States Code. The legislation establishes an expedited procedure for each house to consider the commission's proposed legislation, allowing for automatic introduction of the implementation bill in each chamber and referral to any appropriate committees. Federal government employees could be detailed to the commission without reimbursement to the lending agency. The CARFA legislation allows for automatic introduction of the implementation bill in each chamber and referral to appropriate committees. Committees in the House can report the bill without amendment, while in the Senate, they can review and comment but not amend it. If a committee fails to report the bill within 15 days, it will be automatically discharged for further consideration. Members can then move for the house to consider the bill, with waived points of order and prohibitions on dilatory motions. The CARFA legislation allows for automatic introduction of the implementation bill in each chamber and referral to appropriate committees. Various dilatory motions against the motion to proceed would be prohibited. Debate on the implementation bill would be limited to 10 hours with no amendments allowed. A vote on final passage would occur automatically after debate. The House version authorizes appropriations for FY2004 through FY2006, while the Senate version authorizes appropriations for FY2006 through FY2008. Other review commission bills were introduced in previous Congresses. In the 108th and 109th Congresses, bills were introduced along with the CARFA legislation. These bills raised similar issues as CARFA but were not subject to hearings or committee reports. H.R. 1227 proposed the establishment of a Federal Agency Sunset Commission to review agencies and recommend actions, including abolishment if not reauthorized by Congress. The legislation included provisions for commission member appointments, public hearings, and opportunities for public comment. H.R. 1632 proposed the establishment of a Government Reform Commission to review federal agencies and programs, with a reorganization plan for expedited consideration by the President and Congress. The President would appoint commission members after consulting with House and Senate leaders. The Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act of 2003 (H.R. 2153) aimed to identify inequitable federal subsidies, establish a commission to review determinations, and require the President to approve or disapprove recommendations. The Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act of 2003 (H.R. 2153) required a commission to make recommendations on federal subsidies, with the President having the final approval. The commission's scope was narrower in some aspects compared to other proposals but wider in others. Appointments to the commission would have been made by the President and congressional leadership. The legislation, similar to H.R. 2902 and H.R. 3762, required federal agencies to identify inequitable federal subsidies provided to corporations and entities. It established a commission to review these determinations and submit findings to Congress. The scope of the commission was narrower in some aspects but wider in others, including tax advantages and non-appropriated benefits for corporations. The legislation, including H.R. 2902 and H.R. 3762, aimed to identify inequitable federal subsidies for corporations and entities. It proposed the appointment of commission members by congressional leaders, open meetings, and review of unnecessary programs by federal agencies. The scope of the commission would cover programs in all federal agencies. The proposed legislation, including H.R. 2902 and H.R. 3762, aimed to review federal subsidies for corporations and entities. H.R. 973 and H.R. 974, introduced by Representative Adam Smith, also focused on program reform and corporate subsidy reform, with changes such as establishing the commission in the legislative branch and prohibiting federal agency employees from serving as members. H.R. 974, similar to H.R. 3762, focuses on corporate subsidy reform. Changes include establishing the commission in the legislative branch and prohibiting federal agency employees from serving as members. H.R. 3276 incorporates language from a Bush Administration proposal on \"results commissions.\" The proposed commission under H.R. 974 would study programs and be established under expedited procedures. The President would appoint seven members, with four in consultation with congressional leaders. The commission would evaluate proposals to reorganize agencies with overlapping responsibilities, hold public hearings, and recommend changes to the President. If the President disagrees, the commission must respond with modifications. The President's concerns with changes in recommendations would be addressed by allowing expedited transmission of final recommendations and draft legislation to Congress. H.R. 3277, the Federal Agency Performance Review and Sunset Act, includes provisions for a sunset commission to review executive branch programs and agencies. The commission would cease to exist within nine months of operation. Topics such as expedited congressional consideration and commission membership are discussed in relation to the CARFA legislation. The President would appoint seven commission members to review executive branch programs and agencies under expedited procedures. The commission would consider recommendations, agency evaluations, and OMB assessments. The OMB assessments would evaluate various aspects of programs, similar to H.R. 185. The commission appointed by the President would review executive branch programs and agencies, considering recommendations, agency evaluations, and OMB assessments. The commission would hold public hearings, report annually to the President with recommendations and legislation, and agencies/programs would be abolished unless reauthorized by law. H.R. 3282, the Abolishment of Obsolete Agencies and Federal Sunset Act of 2005, is similar to H.R. 1227 but does not authorize the commission to make certain decisions. The current bill, S. 1399, incorporates language from the Bush Administration's proposal on results commissions and a sunset commission, with some differences from previous versions. The provisions on results commissions are similar but not identical to H.R. 3276, while the provisions on a sunset commission are also similar but not identical to H.R. 3277. Various issues, advantages, and disadvantages of the proposed CARFA legislation were discussed during a hearing for S. 1668 in the 108th Congress. During the hearing for S. 1668 in the 108th Congress, the proposed CARFA legislation was discussed, focusing on identifying and reforming wasteful government programs. Chairman George Voinovich highlighted the challenge of overcoming support for ineffective programs in the Federal Government. The Federal Government has core supporters, making it difficult to restructure or shut down programs without opposition. Legislation aims to create a more effective and efficient government. Senator Voinovich and Senator Brownback highlighted overlap and fragmentation in federal agencies and programs, emphasizing the need for reform. Senator Brownback also discussed the challenge of eliminating programs once they are established. Senator Brownback highlighted the need to learn from past failures and successes in addressing ineffective government programs. He proposed modeling the CARFA Act after the successful process of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) for program elimination and spending prioritization. This approach involves submitting recommendations to Congress for approval, similar to the BRAC commission's process for military base realignment and closure. Senator Brownback proposed modeling the CARFA Act after the BRAC Commission, which focused on military bases and the Department of Defense. CARFA would review federal agencies and programs, targeting non-DOD discretionary agencies, roughly a quarter of federal spending. Brownback sees this as a reasonable first step, with the potential for future rounds like BRAC. Concerns about Congress delegating authority are addressed by noting that CARFA is an appropriate exercise of oversight. Expedited processes for CARFA are also a point of concern. The expedited process for CARFA is a concern as amendments are not allowed, but it is argued that a straight up-or-down vote is necessary to eliminate government waste. Representative Tiahrt supports CARFA as a way to review and eliminate duplicative, ineffective, or inefficient programs through a single package vote. The expedited process for CARFA aims to eliminate government waste by allowing an up-or-down vote on a single package to review and eliminate duplicative, ineffective, or inefficient programs. OMB's deputy director supports systematically assessing program performance and cost to ensure accountability and results. During the Senate hearing, Deputy Director Johnson expressed the Bush Administration's willingness to collaborate with Congress on evaluating and streamlining programs. He mentioned supporting expedited congressional consideration for realigning or eliminating programs based on PART information. Senator Voinovich emphasized the importance of using unbiased criteria for commission recommendations. Former House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey testified in favor of the proposed CARFA Act at the Senate hearing, stating that it aims to find and eliminate federal waste in a systematic manner. He suggested expanding the proposal to include all discretionary spending and cited a GAO report calling for a fundamental review of government programs. Armey also compared CARFA favorably to BRAC. Mr. Armey testified in favor of the CARFA Act, comparing it to BRAC and emphasizing the need for professional, non-political decision-making to eliminate wasteful spending in government programs. The need for insulation from politics and professional criteria in a commission to overhaul the executive branch was emphasized by witnesses, including Paul Weinstein Jr. from the Progressive Policy Institute. He advocated for a commission to reinvent government and eliminate corporate welfare, but suggested modifications to the CARFA legislation proposed by Senator Brownback. Paul Weinstein Jr. recommended modifications to the CARFA Act, including closer adherence to the BRAC model for bipartisan appointments, expanding the scope to include all executive branch agencies and programs, allowing multiple rounds of recommendations, and adding additional criteria for success. Mr. Weinstein recommended additional criteria for the commission to consider, such as restructuring agencies, simplifying regulations, eliminating corporate subsidies not serving the public interest, and ensuring no negative impact on the American people's health, safety, and security. These suggestions may be of interest to Congress for further consideration of the CARFA legislation during the 109th Congress or exploring alternative approaches to improving executive branch operations. The curr_chunk discusses the potential issues, success factors, and alternatives to review commissions used by Congress and the President to assess government operations. Various review commissions were established in the 20th century to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency in the executive branch. The detailed assessment of these efforts is not within the scope of the report. The curr_chunk highlights characteristics of past review commissions like the Hoover Commission and the BRAC commission. Congress has various options to consider for a commission proposal, along with other alternatives. The report analyzes six types of issues Congress might consider in the context of a commission proposal. The curr_chunk discusses the membership criteria, scope, definitions, standards, and transparency of a review commission proposal, comparing it to the CARFA legislation. It highlights topics like membership determination, coverage of laws, and federal vs. non-federal representation. The curr_chunk discusses the appointment and removal process of a statutorily created commission under the CARFA legislation, highlighting the President's influence over commission members' views and activities. Critics may argue that this provision gives too much legislative power to the President. The CARFA legislation's provisions for expedited congressional consideration and potential policy implications for federal agencies are contrasted with the Senate version, which involves appointments by House and Senate leaders. Critics raise concerns about potential bias in party representation within the commission. The CARFA legislation allows the President to appoint all commission members, raising concerns about potential bias in party representation and removal power. Without \"for cause\" removal protection, the President could remove members at will and appoint new ones if the presidency changed hands. The CARFA legislation allows the President to appoint commission members, raising concerns about bias and removal power. The Senate version requires congressional leaders to appoint members, with the authority to remove them unless \"for cause\" protection is added. Other review commissions have used different appointment methods. The Hoover Commission's statute required equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans for commission memberships, appointed by both the President and Members of Congress. Critics argue that this framework may prevent consensus. In contrast, the BRAC commission approach required Senate confirmation of the President's appointments and consultations with majority. The BRAC approach requires Senate confirmation of the President's appointments and consultations with leadership in the House and Senate. Supporters argue it reduces politicization and holds the President's power in check. However, the President can bypass Senate confirmation through recess appointments, as seen in the 2005 BRAC round. Opponents claim it limits the President's flexibility in appointing nominees. The CARFA Act limits the President's ability to recommend policies through nominees, potentially affecting the commission's membership under FACA regulations. FACA requires advisory committees to have balanced representation and covers committees established for providing advice to the President or federal agencies. The CARFA Act may not fall under FACA's definition of an \"advisory committee\" as it primarily submits recommendations to Congress, not the President or an agency. However, the legislation requires a report to be submitted to both the President and Congress, raising uncertainty about FACA coverage. Some prefer that a CARFA not be covered by FACA to allow flexibility in appointing members. Some observers criticize the flexibility in appointing members under CARFA as potentially politicizing the commission. Conflict of interest laws and regulations are also a concern, as the legislation is silent on the commission's location and the requirements for non-federal members. The legislation does not clarify if non-federal CARFA members would be considered federal government employees for conflict of interest laws. However, based on the provisions, it seems non-federal members would not be subject to federal conflict of interest regulations. If CARFA were considered an advisory committee under FACA or if commission members were deemed federal employees, conflict of interest provisions would likely apply. Concerns about conflict of interest were raised in the past with President Reagan's Grace Commission, which was funded and staffed by the private sector. If CARFA were established, concerns about conflicts of interest could arise due to commission members having financial or political interests in their recommendations. The composition of federal and non-federal members would impact FACA and conflict of interest laws, as well as perceptions of the commission's recommendations. If CARFA members were all federal, FACA would not cover the commission but conflict of interest laws would apply. If all members were non-federal, FACA coverage would be uncertain and conflict of interest laws may not apply. A mixed membership would also have uncertain FACA coverage and varying implications for conflict of interest laws. These scenarios could affect the commission's operations and how their recommendations are perceived. The scope of the CARFA legislation would cover executive branch agencies and programs, excluding DOD and entitlement programs. Previous review commissions have had varied scopes, from narrow to broad, impacting how their recommendations are perceived. The CARFA legislation would cover executive branch agencies and programs, excluding DOD and entitlement programs. Non-defense discretionary funding was estimated to decline to 15.5% of total outlays by FY2010. The CARFA Act proposed in the 108th Congress aimed to address non-defense discretionary agencies and programs as a first step. Senator Brownback suggested future rounds could be authorized if successful. In the 109th Congress, Senator Brownback's bill expanded the scope in response to previous hearings. Some suggested expanding the legislation to include all executive branch agencies, programs, and targeted tax incentives. According to analysis, tax expenditures totaled nearly 51% of federal outlays in FY2002. Broadening the scope to include all agencies and tax expenditures could provide a more holistic perspective on public policies. This expansion might also help avoid the appearance of partisanship. Other options for a review commission's scope could be of interest to Congress. The review commission's scope, including policy tools like loans, loan guarantees, tax laws, and regulations, could be explicitly defined under the legislation. The legislation also contains provisions for program assessments similar to the Administration's PART, focusing on evaluating appropriated funds. The PART could be an essential tool for the CARFA, meeting the legislation's requirement for a systematic method to assess agency programs. The CARFA legislation focuses on the effectiveness and accountability of agency programs, with special terms used to recommend realignment or elimination of duplicative, wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or failed programs. Implementation and ramifications would depend on these definitions, which may need further clarification by the commission. Congress could also choose to refine the terms during legislative consideration. During the legislative process, Congress may decide to provide more detailed definitions in the legislation or establish a legislative history to show intent. This could offer flexibility to the commission but may also lead to accusations of bias without clear definitions. Definitions of key terms, such as \"program\" as any agency activity, are crucial for the CARFA Act. The CARFA Act gives considerable discretion to identify programs for evaluation, with definitions of key terms crucial for clarity and potential bias accusations. OMB primarily uses a budgetary perspective to define programs for evaluation through the PART. GAO has raised concerns about OMB's approach, noting inconsistencies in how programs are defined. This has led to a lack of available planning and performance information. The tensions between PART and GPRA raise questions about strategic planning and consultation with stakeholders. The CARFA legislation calls for recommendations on program realignment without a defined term, unlike the BRAC commission law which provides a specific definition for realignment in the context of military installations. Congress may need to further define the term to avoid ambiguity. CARFA may define the term \"realign\" as reorganizing or making new groupings, with an emphasis on eliminating or realigning duplicative, wasteful, and outdated functions. This aligns with the legislation's provision to consolidate or streamline programs, consistent with Representative Tiahrt's remarks on the CARFA Act in the 108th Congress. The organization design literature suggests that an organization's structure and purpose are closely linked when considering organizational architectures. Reorganization or realignment may involve not just moving organizational boxes but also changing processes and possibly the purpose of programs. The proposed commission could define realignment as allowing both organizational and policy changes, in line with CARFA legislation's aim to recommend the realignment of programs judged duplicative, wasteful, or inefficient. The CARFA legislation requires a commission to recommend realigning or eliminating duplicative, wasteful, or inefficient programs and agencies. The definition of duplicative includes consolidating or streamlining agencies performing the same essential function. The term \"overlap\" and \"duplication\" in federal government programs has a long history dating back to 1920. Concerns about wasteful practices were highlighted by the Hoover Commission in the late 1940s. More recent terms like crosscutting, fragmented, and redundant have been used to describe similar agency activities. GAO's analysis of mission fragmentation and program overlap provides the basis for current discussions on agency consolidation. The GAO uses federal budget classifications to categorize programs, but notes that identifying program duplication requires analyzing target populations and specific goals. The analysis of target populations, program goals, and means to achieve them is crucial. Assessing programs for duplication involves complexities, as some may compete while others may be complementary. Terms like wasteful, inefficient, outdated, irrelevant, or failed are challenging to define in CARFA legislation. The CARFA legislation proposes a commission to recommend realigning or eliminating agencies or programs that have wasted federal funds through egregious spending, mismanagement, or personal benefit. It also aims to eliminate programs that have completed their purpose, become irrelevant, or failed to meet objectives. The legislation raises questions about defining terms like \"egregious spending\" and \"mismanagement,\" as well as determining what constitutes a \"special\" interest group and identifying outdated or failed programs. The CARFA legislation proposes a commission to recommend realigning or eliminating agencies or programs that have wasted federal funds through egregious spending, mismanagement, or personal benefit. It also aims to eliminate programs that have completed their purpose, become irrelevant, or failed to meet objectives. The legislative history behind the CARFA legislation does not answer questions about defining terms like \"egregious spending\" and \"mismanagement,\" leaving it to be determined by Congress or the commission's appointees. Critics argue that the terms are subjective and expedited procedures for congressional consideration may not allow sufficient scrutiny of the commission's recommendations. The CARFA legislation proposes a commission to recommend realigning or eliminating agencies or programs that have wasted federal funds through egregious spending, mismanagement, or personal benefit. The commission may use standards for decision making, including non-biased criteria and systematic assessment of programs. Former Majority Leader Armey emphasized the need to keep politics out of the process, while OMB Deputy Director for Management suggested using the Bush Administration's PART for making determinations. The CARFA legislation proposes a commission to recommend realigning or eliminating agencies or programs that have wasted federal funds through egregious spending, mismanagement, or personal benefit. Congress could evaluate the legislation by considering standards and criteria used by similar commissions in the past, such as the BRAC statute. Perspectives from program evaluation and social science literature, like validity, reliability, and objectivity, could be useful in assessing standards for CARFA. The curr_chunk discusses the concepts of reliability, objectivity, and subjectivity in research, highlighting the importance of ensuring that measurements are consistent, inquiries are pursued objectively, and biases are minimized. These concepts are essential for evaluating the effectiveness of programs like CARFA, which aim to realign or eliminate wasteful federal agencies or programs. The curr_chunk discusses the application of validity, reliability, and objectivity in assessing the effectiveness of a BRAC commission's decision-making standards. It emphasizes the need for a valid, reliable, and objective process in determining the relevance of non-defense discretionary programs. The curr_chunk discusses the need for consensus on determining the relevance of programs, including the use of the PART instrument. It also highlights the expedited consideration provision in the CARFA legislation. The CARFA legislation includes a provision for expedited consideration of the commission's recommendations by Congress, which has both advantages and disadvantages. These include ensuring Congress reviews the commission's work, reducing vote trading, and preventing filibusters. However, it may also limit compromises, diminish minority power in the Senate, and restrict individual Senators' debate rights unless a supermajority invokes cloture. When the BRAC commission legislation was being considered in 1990, there was a consensus that military installations needed to be reduced to save funds. Supporters argued parochial politics hindered base closures, while critics believed Congress should make these decisions, not a commission. Concerns arose about how bases were chosen and the potential for amendments to the commission's recommendations during the legislative process. Members of Congress could be incentivized to exclude certain bases. The BRAC commission framework was created to prevent vote trading and preserve the integrity of the list of facilities to be realigned or closed. Congress would only have an up-or-down vote on the commission's recommendations, with no amendments allowed. This would prevent Members of Congress from excluding installations from the list through deals. The BRAC commission framework was established to maintain the integrity of the list of facilities to be realigned or closed, preventing political manipulation. The proposed CARFA Act aimed to review Federal agencies and programs for potential elimination or realignment, addressing concerns about logrolling. The CARFA Act proposes a disciplined spending review process for nondefense, nonentitlement programs, aiming to eliminate duplicative, wasteful, and outdated functions. Congress will vote on the commission's recommendations as a whole, bypassing traditional logrolling practices. Public choice theory suggests that the effectiveness of vote trading in improving societal welfare is debatable. Vote trading is controversial, with proponents arguing it leads to efficient provision of public goods and reveals preferences. Opponents fear special-interest gains may not outweigh general losses. Stakeholders have differing views on how CARFA legislation's no-amendment provisions would impact logrolling. Theory alone cannot determine if logrolling is beneficial for society compared to other options. Three issues Congress may consider regarding the CARFA legislation include whether legislation based on the BRAC model would be appropriate for reviewing non-defense agencies, the impact of vote trading on societal welfare, and the legitimacy of the proposal as an exercise of legislative power. The CARFA legislation's Section 7 would expedite congressional consideration of the commission's implementation bill in the Senate, limiting amendments and procedural delays. This could reduce the power of minorities in the Senate by preventing filibusters on the implementation bill. The CARFA legislation's expedited procedure provisions in the Senate may reduce minority power by limiting amendments and procedural delays, potentially speeding up consideration of proposals. Senators could modify these provisions through unanimous consent or a super-majority vote if desired. The Senate would require a super-majority of three-fifths or two-thirds to change expedited procedures, making it more restrictive than the House, which only needs a simple majority vote for changes. Transparency and participation in CARFA operations could also be considered by Congress. The transparency and public participation in CARFA operations, like past review commissions such as BRAC, are crucial. BRAC operated with open meetings for the public, while the Hoover Commission lacked specific requirements on transparency. The Hoover Commission predated FACA and other \"open government\" laws. The 9/11 Commission was excluded from FACA's requirements. It is unclear if a CARFA would be covered by FACA. A CARFA would likely not be subject to the Government in the Sunshine Act. The CARFA legislation does not specify the commission's location in the executive branch. The CARFA legislation does not specify the commission's location in the executive branch or whether its members would be Senate-confirmed. It is also unclear if the proposed commission would be subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). If the commission is deemed strictly advisory, it may not be covered by FOIA, but if considered an establishment in the executive branch, FOIA would likely apply. The CARFA legislation's location in the executive branch and Senate confirmation of its members are unspecified. It is unclear if the commission would be subject to FOIA. The extent to which CARFA could operate publicly or privately is uncertain. Some advantages of a CARFA approach include limited public involvement to avoid pressure, cohesive policy recommendations, and advisory recommendations considered by Congress and the President. However, disadvantages may include lack of transparency and credibility if observers are unsure of involvement. Critics may argue that expedited congressional procedures for legislation like CARFA may not allow enough time for public participation or input through mechanisms like GPRA. When evaluating proposals for major reorganization commissions, Congress should consider key success factors identified by observers. A focused and limited mandate for a commission is more likely to provide useful results than a broad mandate with substantial policy implications. The commission should have ties with central managerial agencies in the executive branch and Congress. Commissions should be aware of the legal aspects of governmental organization and activities, including a review of general management laws. Consensus among commission members on organizational principles is essential for effective outcomes. The success of government restructurings relies on creating consensus among key players, such as Congress and the President. Operational reorganization proposals have been more successful than complex policy changes. Consensus among commission members on organizational principles is crucial for effective outcomes. The 9/11 Commission, established after negotiation among Congress and the President, made operational and policy recommendations in a charged political environment. The bipartisan 9/11 Commission report has faced criticism and praise for omitting certain policy topics. A proposed CARFA could allow the President and Congress to consider streamlining programs and agencies, but establishing a commission is just one approach to addressing these issues. One alternative to establishing a commission to address government efficiency and effectiveness issues is pursuing government reorganization legislation, similar to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. This approach could realign programs and improve efficiency. In 2003, the Comptroller General recommended streamlining and simplifying the federal government's organizational structure to address duplicative, overlapping, and conflicting government programs. The Second Volcker Commission proposed a fundamental reorganization into a limited number of mission-related executive departments to enhance mission coherence and role clarification. The President would define agency subordinate organizations and personnel systems, with oversight by OMB. The President would define agency subordinate organizations and personnel systems, subject to oversight by OMB and Congress. Reorganization can improve organizational performance but may create barriers to information sharing outside the group. Organizations are ultimately defined by their ability to share information and cooperate. Strategic grouping in organizations can lead to power shifts and resource allocation changes. The Homeland Security Act included Section 888 to protect the Coast Guard's non-homeland security missions. In the 108th Congress, concerns were raised about preserving non-homeland security missions such as maritime search and rescue and fisheries enforcement. Establishing a commission like CARFA could expedite congressional consideration without risking amendments undermining the package. The CARFA legislation offers more flexibility compared to executive reorganization authority, allowing for a broad range of policy matters. However, some may prefer reorganization through the regular legislative process for preserving congressional prerogatives and public participation. The CARFA legislation provides flexibility in policy matters compared to executive reorganization authority. Congress enacted major legislative changes in various areas in the past, and the CARFA Act could be seen as having disadvantages in terms of power distribution. An alternative to CARFA could be the Government Performance and Results Act for continued oversight. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) was enacted by Congress to hold federal agencies accountable for achieving program results, improve decision-making, and enhance the internal management of the Federal Government. GPRA has been seen as successful in establishing a foundation for results-oriented planning, measuring, and reporting. Some challenges remain with GPRA, including inadequate focus on cross-agency issues and concerns about agency analytical capacity. Some suggest using the PART initiative alongside GPRA to link performance with budgets, but others criticize PART for inconsistency and serving only executive branch needs. The CARFA proposal aims to address the limitations of the PART initiative by emphasizing congressional involvement, focusing on cross-agency issues, and promoting independence in recommendations. Proponents believe CARFA could provide integrated recommendations, insulate deliberations from politics, increase credibility, and prevent congressional interference. Opponents of establishing a commission to evaluate programs and agencies argue that it may lead to duplication of effort, less transparency, limited credibility, and reduced ability for Congress to amend recommendations. Bolstering program evaluation capacity in federal agencies could address issues related to inadequate program evaluation, lack of management attention, and resources. Establishing \"Chief Program Evaluation Officers\" positions could be an alternative to the proposed CARFA legislation. To address issues of inadequate program evaluation and lack of management attention, Congress may establish \"Chief Program Evaluation Officer\" positions in major agencies. These positions have been created in recent years to elevate different functional perspectives within agencies' management ranks. This could help ensure that long-standing problems are addressed effectively. The Comptroller General expressed concerns about federal agencies' capacity to evaluate program effectiveness due to small evaluation offices with limited resources. Establishing Chief Program Evaluation Officer positions in major agencies and creating an interagency council of CPEOs could help address these challenges and ensure quality performance. Establishing Chief Program Evaluation Officer positions in major agencies and creating an interagency council of CPEOs could help agencies ensure quality performance information, evaluate crosscutting programs, and report findings to Congress. Critics argue that adding another chief officer position would be excessive for agency leaders. This option could complement the CARFA legislation and potentially improve agency performance and coordination of programs. Establishing Chief Program Evaluation Officer positions in major agencies and creating an interagency council of CPEOs could help agencies ensure quality performance information, evaluate crosscutting programs, and report findings to Congress. Some may view bolstered agency program evaluation efforts as beneficial for CARFA, while others see CARFA as duplicative of agency CPEOs and unaccountable to Congress."
