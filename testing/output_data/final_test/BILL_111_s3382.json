    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Coastal Habitat Conservation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that protecting coastal habitats is crucial for conserving Federal trust species and promoting self-sustaining populations. Coastal ecosystems are vital for a diverse range of wildlife, including fish, shellfish, migratory birds, and mammals. Coastal areas play a significant role in supporting refuges, endangered species, and fisheries conservation efforts, despite making up a small percentage of the total land area in the contiguous United States. Coastal areas in the United States are home to over half of the population, leading to pressure on coastal ecosystems. Human populations in these areas are projected to increase by 25% in the next two decades, threatening the health of coastal ecosystems. It is necessary to incorporate adaptation assistance into coastal ecosystem management strategies to address coastal deterioration and habitat fragmentation. Coastal ecosystems serve as important sources of food and wildlife habitat. Coastal ecosystems provide food, protect against floods, filter runoff, and offer commercial and recreational benefits. Fish and wildlife conservation is a shared responsibility, supported by public-private partnerships for assessment, protection, planning, restoration, and enhancement. Successful conservation relies on collaborative partnerships since 1985. Since 1985, the Service has administered a coastal program to assess, protect, plan, restore, and enhance coastal ecosystems with willing partners. The program provides strategic conservation planning at regional and landscape scales, integrating resources to address priorities identified by partners. This complements the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grant Program. The Protection and Restoration Act authorizes matching grants to coastal States for conservation of coastal wetlands and habitats. The purpose is to support collaborative habitat projects in priority coastal areas to conserve Federal trust species. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"coastal area\" includes coastal wetlands, waters, coastlines, estuaries, and associated uplands. \"Coastal ecosystem\" refers to ecological communities providing habitat in coastal areas. \"Coastal habitat assessment\" involves evaluating the function of a coastal site for fish and wildlife. \"Coastal habitat enhancement\" is the manipulation of coastal ecosystem characteristics. Coastal habitat planning involves developing a comprehensive plan to characterize, protect, restore, or enhance a coastal ecosystem. It includes setting goals, conservation strategies, implementation timelines, and identifying roles of sponsors and participants. Coastal habitat protection refers to long-term actions to safeguard coastal habitats. Coastal habitat protection involves safeguarding habitats important to fish and wildlife species in a coastal ecosystem through activities like conservation easements or fee-title acquisition. Coastal habitat restoration aims to restore natural biological functions to lost or degraded native habitat in a coastal ecosystem. Federal trust species refer to species listed as threatened or endangered. The term \"species\" includes threatened or endangered species, migratory birds, interjurisdictional fish, marine mammals identified by the Secretary, and other species of concern. Financial assistance refers to Federal funding support through grants or cooperative agreements. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Service refers to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Technical assistance is also defined. Technical assistance is defined as collaboration, facilitation, or consulting related to habitat projects where the Fish and Wildlife Service provides scientific expertise. A volunteer is someone who performs tasks without pay. SEC. 4. COASTAL PROGRAM. The Secretary implements the Coastal Program to address natural resource issues in priority coastal ecosystems through partnerships with various entities and provide support for habitat projects on public or private land. The Coastal Program aims to support habitat projects on public or private land, develop monitoring protocols for ecosystem conservation, and collaborate with partners on conservation methods. The Coastal Program aims to support habitat projects and collaborate with partners on conservation methods. The Secretary is required to involve youth volunteers and organizations in nonhazardous habitat restoration activities. Additionally, reports are mandated to be submitted. The Secretary is required to submit a biennial report on the Coastal Program to specific committees and the public. The report will assess the state of coastal ecosystems, progress in identifying natural resource problems and solutions, and the long-term success of protecting coastal ecosystems. It will also include quantitative information on areas protected and restored. The biennial report on the Coastal Program includes quantitative information on areas protected, restored, or enhanced, Federal funds expended or leveraged, description of adaptive management practices, number of volunteers and their contributions, and recommendations for additional research, management, or legislation needed to address problems and achieve objectives of the Act. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 is provided to carry out the Act."
