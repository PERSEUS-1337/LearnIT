    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section defining renewable biomass. The curr_chunk provides a definition of renewable biomass under the Clean Air Act, specifying materials from National Forest System land and public lands used for preventive treatments to reduce hazardous fuels. The curr_chunk defines renewable biomass under the Clean Air Act as materials from National Forest System land and public lands used for disease or insect infestation control, ecosystem health restoration, and lower-value product utilization, harvested in accordance with applicable laws and land management plans. The curr_chunk discusses the maintenance, restoration, and management direction for old-growth forests as well as large-tree retention under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The curr_chunk focuses on the definition of organic matter available on renewable or recurring basis from non-Federal land or land held by Indian tribes, including renewable plant material like feed grains, agricultural commodities, plants, trees, and algae. The curr_chunk amends the definition of organic matter to include algae, crop residue, vegetative waste material, animal waste and byproducts, food waste, and yard waste. The curr_chunk amends the definition of \"renewable biomass\" to align with the Clean Air Act, applying it to future federal laws related to renewable electricity standards and greenhouse gas emissions."
