    "content": "The Act of 1999 is titled the \"Environmental Stewardship and Natural Resources Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that economic growth should be balanced with environmental management and include collaborative scientific inquiry, technology development, and public policy. The failure of environmental science data to support long-term policy leads to questions of data quality and credibility, resulting in conflicting policy. Individuals affected by decisions on long-term stewardship have not always been effective in determining needs and participating in environmental research and development. The Department of Energy is developing long-term strategies for managing its land holdings, which can impact the economy and quality of life. The environmental management program is the largest in the Department and must have scientific capability for managing legacy waste. There are no national laboratories designated for addressing the science needs of long-term stewardship. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is a key research facility in this area. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is designated as the Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship of the Department of Energy to provide long-term stewardship of Department land. It also establishes the Natural Resources Institute within the Center and authorizes scientific and technical assistance for environmental missions and research. The Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory conducts research on modeling, detection, characterization, remediation, treatment, and control of contaminants in the environment or waste. It serves as a neutral forum for developing scientific solutions for long-term stewardship of Department land and coordinates research on appropriate approaches and tools for implementation to support public policy development. The Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory focuses on developing public-private partnerships and providing education and training on long-term stewardship through modern information systems for various users including the public, government, and industry. The Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory aims to facilitate the creation of commercial enterprises by involving local economic development agencies, technology incubators, research institutes, and the private sector. It also focuses on transferring information and analyses regarding long-term stewardship to enable informed decision-making. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"atomic energy defense activity,\" \"Center,\" \"Department,\" and \"Department of Energy defense nuclear facility.\" These terms are crucial for understanding the provisions outlined in the Act. The curr_chunk discusses various types of facilities related to atomic energy, including production, utilization, waste storage, disposal, weapon testing, research, and development facilities. It also mentions facilities that are no longer operational but were used for these purposes. The curr_chunk defines terms related to atomic energy defense activities, including Department of Energy defense nuclear facilities, Institutes, long-term stewardship, and the Secretary of Energy. The curr_chunk establishes a Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is designated as the Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship of the Department. The Center's duties include developing new methods and technologies for long-term stewardship of contaminated, remediated, and uncontaminated land used as a buffer area around a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility. The Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is responsible for various tasks including developing systems engineering methods for waste management, conducting scientific research on contaminant transport, developing predictive models for contaminant risks, and testing new innovative technologies. The Center of Excellence for Environmental Stewardship at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory is responsible for developing, testing, and demonstrating new technologies for detecting, monitoring, stabilizing, and remediating contaminants in the environment. The Center may enter into memoranda of understanding with federal agencies to participate in work on Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture lands and solve long-term stewardship problems. Additionally, the Center can acquire unclassified and nonproprietary information from federal agencies to carry out its tasks. The Natural Resources Institute is established. The Natural Resources Institute within the Center serves as a partner and facilitator for multidisciplinary research on long-term stewardship, coordinating activities and involving public and private scientific experts. The Natural Resources Institute in the Center facilitates research on long-term stewardship, including predicting ecosystem dynamics, developing environmental stewardship tools, and supporting public policy formulation. This involves balancing socioeconomic and quality of life concerns with environmental remediation, cost, and schedule considerations, as well as involving the public in research activities. The Institute facilitates research on long-term stewardship, balancing socioeconomic concerns with environmental remediation. It acts as an information resource center, providing access to environmental data through partnerships with private entities and public agencies. The Institute facilitates research on long-term stewardship by providing access to public and private databases, training personnel, and collaborating with colleges and universities. It also cooperates with Federal and State agencies. The Institute collaborates with Federal and State agencies, colleges and universities, national laboratories, the public, and the private sector."
