CATS is an abstractive neural summarization model that introduces a new mechanism to control the latent topic distribution of summaries. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show state-of-the-art performance in producing shorter, semantically related versions of source documents. Recent advances in neural sequence-to-sequence modeling have sparked interest in abstractive summarization, which aims to produce shortened versions of a source document by generating new sentences. While extractive summarization selects sentences based on a scoring scheme, abstractive summarization offers flexibility and a wide range of applications. Most research has focused on extractive summarization due to its simplicity, but there is potential for selective summarization based on user preferences. CATS is a customizable abstractive topic-based sequence-to-sequence summarization model that can selectively focus on desired topics when generating summaries. It outperforms existing models and allows for the addition or removal of specific topics in the summary. The paper introduces a novel neural sequence-to-sequence model for abstractive summarization, outperforming existing baselines. It utilizes an attention mechanism to identify important topics and encoder output. The experimental results show superior performance in terms of ROUGE on a benchmark dataset. The paper presents a new neural sequence-to-sequence model for abstractive summarization, surpassing existing baselines. It uses an attention mechanism to highlight key topics and encoder output. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through superior performance in terms of ROUGE on a benchmark dataset. The experimental setup and results comparing the model to various state-of-the-art baselines are discussed in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes the paper and suggests future research directions. The paper introduces a new neural model for abstractive summarization, utilizing an attention mechanism to focus on key topics. The Pointer Generator Network (PGN) is applied to address out-of-vocabulary words and factual errors by choosing between generating words from a fixed vocabulary or copying from the source document. This model combines extractive and generative methods to improve summarization. Our model differs from the Pointer Generator Network (PGN) by using a different attention mechanism to focus on specific topics and enabling selective inclusion or exclusion of topics in the summary. This is achieved by incorporating information from an unsupervised topic model, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The proposed model utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize ROUGE L for generating sub-sequences similar to a reference summary. It incorporates a content selector and an information selection layer for abstractive document summarization, focusing on topics to improve performance. This approach is distinct from existing neural models by leveraging latent topic structures in input texts. The paper introduces a neural abstractive summarization model called CATS, incorporating pointer networks and a novel attention mechanism controlled by an unsupervised topic model. This approach leverages latent topic structures in input texts to improve performance. The CATS model introduces a novel mechanism called topical attention, where model parameters adapt during training to learn document topics. The encoder-decoder architecture uses a Bi-directional LSTM network for encoding. The decoder generates summaries without needing input from the topic model during testing. The decoder in the CATS model uses a single-layer LSTM network and calculates a topical attention distribution using a combination of attention weights and a \"topical word vector\" from an LDA topic model. LDA was chosen for its robust performance and the ability to assign probabilities between 0 and 1 to words in each topic, simplifying fusion with attention weights. The CATS model decoder utilizes a single-layer LSTM network and computes a topical attention distribution by combining attention weights with a \"topical word vector\" derived from an LDA topic model. This approach leverages the strength of each topic in target summaries and the probability scores of words in a fixed vocabulary, enabling the calculation of a topical word vector for each document. The final attention vector at decoding step t is computed for an input sequence of length K. The CATS model decoder combines attention weights with a \"topical word vector\" from an LDA topic model to generate an attention distribution over the input sequence. This distribution guides the decoder on where to focus to produce the next word, leading to the creation of a context vector by summing the encoder hidden states. The CATS model decoder utilizes attention weights and a \"topical word vector\" from an LDA topic model to generate an attention distribution over the input sequence. This guides the decoder in focusing on specific areas to produce the next word, resulting in the creation of a context vector by summing the encoder hidden states. The context vector is then concatenated with the decoder state and linearly transformed to produce the final output distribution over all words in the vocabulary. Pointer generators are used to allow the model to choose between generating a word from the vocabulary or copying it directly from the source. Generation probability is calculated based on the context vector, decoder state, and decoder input. The CATS model decoder uses attention weights and a \"topical word vector\" from an LDA topic model to guide word generation. It combines encoder hidden states to create a context vector, which is then used to produce the final output distribution over the vocabulary. Pointer generators enable the model to choose between generating a word or copying it from the source. The probability distribution over the extended vocabulary is determined by linear interpolation, considering out-of-vocabulary words and words not in the source document. The pointer generator model in the CATS decoder utilizes attention weights to adjust word generation probabilities based on attention received. It can switch between out-of-vocabulary words and vocabulary words to prevent factual errors. The coverage mechanism tracks attention levels for each word throughout decoding. The CATS decoder's pointer generator model uses attention weights to adjust word generation probabilities and prevent factual errors by switching between out-of-vocabulary and vocabulary words. The coverage mechanism tracks attention levels for each word to alleviate repetition in recurrent neural networks with attention. It introduces an additional loss term to encourage redistribution of attention weights during decoding. The CATS decoder's pointer generator model uses attention weights to adjust word generation probabilities and prevent factual errors. It introduces a coverage mechanism to alleviate repetition and encourage redistribution of attention weights during decoding. The model uses beam search for generating output summaries without topical information from a trained LDA topic model. The experiments are based on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, containing training, validation, and test pairs of articles and summaries. The dataset used for experiments contains training, validation, and test pairs of articles and summaries. Pre-processing scripts were used to tokenize documents. The CATS model was compared with various abstractive baselines, and evaluated based on F1 ROUGE scores. The CATS model outperformed baseline methods in terms of F1 ROUGE scores. Model parameters include hidden state dimension of 256, word embedding dimension of 128, and a vocabulary size of 50,000 tokens. LDA was used to train a topic model on the dataset. The LDA model was used to estimate the number of underlying topics by running the model with different values of M. The optimal number of topics on the CNN/Dailymail dataset was found to be 100. The training of each LDA model took nearly a day, limiting the range of M values tested. Our model outperforms all baselines in terms of ROUGE metrics. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in ROUGE 2 and conduct a statistical significance test to verify the difference. However, BID18 reports the highest performance in ROUGE L due to their model optimizing directly on the evaluation metric. The study compares the readability scores of different models, including PGN and UnifiedAbsExt. The method of BID3 was not included in the comparison due to different preprocessing scripts used. Human evaluation was conducted to assess the quality of summaries produced by CATS+coverage, PGN+coverage BID19, and RL with Intra-Attention BID18. The study evaluated the quality of summaries generated by three models: CATS, PGN, and RL+Intra-Attention. Human assessors assigned scores ranging from 1 to 5 for readability and informativeness. CATS was found to produce more readable and informative summaries. Additionally, CATS allows users to selectively include or exclude topics in their summaries, demonstrating its unique feature compared to other models. In an experiment, the trained summarization model was fine-tuned by removing two topics related to health-care and police arrests from the output of a topic model. The expectation was that the focus of the output summaries would change, leading to a decrease in ROUGE values. The first topic, health-care, included keywords like \"dr\", \"medical\", and \"patients\", while the second topic, police arrests and charges, included words like \"charges\", \"court\", and \"arrested\". The experiment involved fine-tuning a summarization model by excluding health-care and police arrests topics. The focus was on evaluating the impact on output summaries by removing these topics. The experiment randomly selected 50 test documents related to these topics and assessed the effectiveness of the model in excluding or reducing them. Human judges evaluated the summaries generated by the model, with the majority decision determining the final outcome. The results showed that in 44 out of 50 cases, there was a noticeable impact on the exclusion or reduction of the specified topics. The experiment evaluated the impact of excluding health-care and police arrests topics on output summaries. In 44 documents, topics were excluded, in four documents topics were reduced, and in two documents, there was no significant difference. The focus of the summaries shifted towards crime-related aspects to avoid health-care terms. The quality of the output summaries was analyzed for text repetition, a common issue in attention-based encoder-decoder architectures. The experiment focused on reducing text repetition in output summaries generated by different models. The comparison was made between CATS, CATS+coverage, PGN, and PGN+coverage models in terms of n-grams repetition. The results showed that CATS and CATS+coverage models had lower repetition compared to PGN and PGN+coverage models. Our model, CATS, reduces text repetition in output summaries by focusing on topically connected words and diversifying attention. This approach decreases repetition compared to other models like PGN and PGN+coverage. The experiment suggests that CATS' topical attention mechanism could address the repetition issue in sequence generation. CATS is an abstractive summarization model that utilizes latent topic information to control the topics in the output summary. It allows for customization of generated texts based on user profiles or given topics. Experimental results show that CATS achieves state-of-the-art performance in summarization metrics while enabling customization. This model can serve as a foundation for future work in automatic summarization, offering exciting possibilities for tailored summaries to users' needs. The text discusses three ways to customize output summaries using the CATS model: disabling certain topics, providing a reference document to direct the focus, and extracting content from user profiles to tailor summaries. These directions offer potential for future research in the field."
