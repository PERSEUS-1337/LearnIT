    "content": "Over the past 20 years, various groups have criticized the appointment process for Presidential positions requiring Senate approval. Issues include lengthy processes, intense scrutiny of appointees, excessive paperwork, and political complications during confirmation. These criticisms have been linked to longer vacancies, nominee confusion, and challenges in attracting qualified candidates. Recommendations for reforms have been proposed by reports and studies. Various reports have suggested reforms to the appointment process for Presidential positions requiring Senate approval, including reducing the overall number of positions and streamlining the process for making appointments. The Presidential Appointee Initiative (PAI) at the Brookings Institution recommended reducing the number of political appointees by a third, limiting Senate confirmation to key positions, such as judges and ambassadors. The 9/11 Commission Report suggested not requiring confirmation for national security team appointees below Executive Level 3. The PAI advisory board, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, supports reducing the number of political appointees to streamline Senate confirmation processes. They believe focusing on key positions like judges and ambassadors will lead to a more efficient and effective confirmation process. The PAI advisory board, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, supports reducing the number of political appointees to streamline Senate confirmation processes. Critics argue that appointments to PAS positions are taking too long, and reducing the number of these positions could lead to a more efficient confirmation process. Interest in reforming the PAS appointment process and possibly reducing the number of PAS positions led to the enactment of a provision directing agencies to submit advice and consent position reduction plans. During the 107th and 108th Congress, bills were introduced to require reduction plans for political appointees. The provision was later included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. This report discusses the potential use of agency plans for future decisions on reducing PAS positions. This report analyzes issues related to reducing PAS positions in the federal government, including the appointment process, trends in appointment length, and potential benefits of reducing positions for efficiency. It also discusses congressional approaches to reducing PAS positions and the associated institutional and political considerations. The Constitution outlines the appointment process for officers of the United States, stating that all officers are to be PAS positions unless Congress delegates otherwise. The Constitution mandates that all officers of the United States are to be appointed through the presidential appointment with Senate consent process, unless Congress delegates otherwise. The Supreme Court defines \"officers\" as individuals with significant authority under U.S. laws, requiring appointment as prescribed. Congress has the discretion to appoint \"inferior\" officers through various methods, without a clear distinction between principal and inferior officers established. The distinction between principal and inferior officers is not clearly defined, but guidance from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel suggests that the extent of an officer's discretion and the location of supervisory powers are key factors. This guidance can help Congress identify positions that do not require Senate confirmation and positions that can be filled by the President, courts, or agency heads at Congress's discretion. Under the Constitution, officers of the United States can be appointed in various ways. In the executive branch, appointments can be made by the President with Senate confirmation, by the President without Senate confirmation, or by department/agency heads. Political appointments are at the discretion of the appointing authority, while career appointments are made through a competitive process. Congress can choose to maintain the current appointment process or implement a different method for certain positions. The executive leadership of the federal bureaucracy consists of political appointees and career members of the Senior Executive Service (SES). Political positions include PAS, PA positions, noncareer SES, and Schedule C positions. Congress can change appointment authority for positions, and agencies may create SES or Schedule C positions as needed. The President submits over 20,000 nominations to the Senate each year, including routine armed forces officer appointments and positions in various government agencies. Nominations to high-level positions in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches are also included. The President submits over 20,000 nominations to the Senate each year, including positions on regulatory boards, district court judgeships, U.S. attorney positions, ambassadors, and other policymaking roles in the federal government. These Presidential Appointments with Senate Confirmation (PAS) positions are considered top policy decision makers responsible for implementing statutes. The nomination and confirmation process for PAS appointments is specified by federal law. Additionally, other types of appointments, such as PA, Schedule C, and SES positions, are used to fill policymaking roles in the federal bureaucracy. Positions in the federal government can be political or career-based. Approximately 125 full-time PA positions exist government-wide, mainly in the White House Office. The Department of Homeland Security has exceptions where some officers are appointed solely by the President. Program manager roles are typically filled by SES members, which include both career and noncareer positions. Career SES appointees are selected competitively and have their qualifications reviewed by the Office of Personnel. Noncareer SES appointees are appointed by agency heads with OPM and White House approval, serving at the pleasure of the appointing official. They hold top-level supervisory positions, involved in developing Administration policies. Congress determines the number of SES positions allocated to political appointees. As of September 2004, 6,203 SES positions were filled by career appointees and 691 by noncareer appointees. Schedule C positions are created under federal regulations, with appointees excepted from certain requirements. Schedule C appointees are exempt from competitive service and hold positions of confidential assistants or policy-determining roles in the executive branch. As of September 2004, there were 1,526 Schedule C officials, mostly paid at upper General Schedule grades. Approval from OPM is required to establish a Schedule C position. As of September 2004, approval from OPM is needed to establish a Schedule C position, which is automatically revoked when the incumbent leaves office. Concerns have been raised about the increasing number of political appointments in the federal bureaucracy, with recommendations for reducing such positions. Legislative initiatives have proposed maintaining or decreasing political appointments in recent years. In the Department of Transportation, statutory limits have been placed on political and career leadership positions in annual appropriations measures. The balance between political accountability and neutral managerial competence is crucial in American government. Political appointments are made to pursue specific policy agendas, while careerists are hired based on merit to execute laws impartially. Public administration involves both political and administrative aspects, with accountability for implementing elected officials' will being essential. The appointment process for certain positions in public administration may shift from PAS to political or career appointees, impacting accountability to Congress. Career officials may align with Congress or respond to the political environment. Congress could specify functions for career officials or provide more flexibility to the Administration. The appointment process for certain positions in public administration involves three stages: selection and nomination, confirmation, and appointment. The President nominates candidates, but the Senate confirms most nominations. Other parties, such as interest groups, may try to influence the outcome. The process for Senate-confirmed appointments involves several steps. The President selects a candidate for Senate-confirmed appointments with the help of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. The candidate submits various forms and undergoes background investigations by the FBI, IRS, OGE, and agency ethics officials. Conflicts found during the check are mitigated, and once cleared by the Office of the Counsel, the nomination is ready. The White House consults with Senators from the state where a position is located before submitting nominations to the Senate. This consultation process allows Senators to have a role in selecting qualified office holders and gain political capital. The President may also seek recommendations from Senators of the opposition party and consult with party leaders and committee chairs. The Senate may be hesitant to relinquish its role in appointments as it provides valuable political capital. The selection and vetting process can be lengthy, especially at the beginning of an administration or when conflicts arise. Senate confirmation and presidential appointment are necessary for a nominee to assume the duties of a position. The President may appoint a nominee temporarily under the Vacancies Act or through a recess appointment, granting them legal authority to fulfill the duties of the office. Temporary appointments can last up to 210 days or more than two years, while recess appointments can range from less than a year to nearly two years. These appointments have been used to bypass the confirmation process, leading to political consequences such as holds on other nominations or stricter legislation by Senators. During the consideration stage, the Senate determines whether to confirm a nomination based on the position's importance, political circumstances, and policy implications. Nominations are referred to a committee for a hearing before being voted on by the Senate. Most nominations proceed routinely, with the median confirmation time during the 107th Congress being 36 days. Military and officer appointments are common and typically handled efficiently. The Senate confirmation process for military or officer appointments is typically routine, with en bloc confirmations of hundreds of nominations at a time. However, nominations to policymaking positions can stall, especially if controversial. Senators may use holds to block noncontroversial nominations for leverage. Committee nomination activity is centered at the committee level, with some handling many nominations while others handle few, and timetables specifying minimum periods between steps in the process. The Senate confirmation process for military or officer appointments is typically routine, with en bloc confirmations of hundreds of nominations at a time. Committee nomination activity generally includes investigation, hearing, and reporting stages. Committees may draw on information provided by the White House and collect personal and financial information from nominees. Senators may have access to FBI reports with authorization from the President. During Senate confirmation processes, nominees commit to responding to committee requests and participate in hearings. Hearings serve as a public platform to discuss nominations, program issues, and nominee qualifications. Committees may hold hearings based on nomination importance and workload considerations. They can discontinue acting on a nomination at any stage. The Senate committee may discontinue acting on a nomination at any point, and if they choose to report it back to the full Senate, they can do so favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. Rejections of nominations mostly occur in committee due to various reasons, such as opposition, time constraints, or unrelated factors. The Senate may fail to confirm nominations for various reasons. A study from 1981 to 1992 showed failure rates of 9% for executive departments, 11% for independent agencies, and 22% for boards and commissions. Once confirmed, the nominee receives a commission from the President and is sworn into office. The President can delay or prevent the appointment by not signing the commission. The appointee receives full authority after being sworn in. Some argue that the appointment process has lengthened due to the increasing number of PAS positions. Data limitations hinder a comprehensive comparison of appointment process lengths. At the beginning of a new Administration, many PAS positions become vacant and filled simultaneously. G. Calvin Mackenzie found that the average time from inauguration to confirmation for initial PAS appointments increased from 2.38 months during John F. Kennedy's presidency to 8.53 months during William J. Clinton's presidency. The inexperience of new presidential staff and the high number of appointments contribute to longer confirmation times. From 1965 to 2004, six new departments were created: Housing and Urban Development (1965); Transportation (1966); Energy (1977); Education (1979); Veterans Affairs (1988); and Homeland Security (2003). Table 1 provides a summary of the average length of time taken to nominate and confirm initial appointees to PAS positions in each of these departments, ranging from 77 days to 352 days. The appointment process for PAS positions has grown longer and more complex over the last 40 years, with median times increasing from 140 days in 1965 to 206 days in 2004. This trend is attributed to increased scrutiny by Congress and Presidents in response to potential scandals. Specific circumstances, such as the delayed nomination process for the Department of Veterans Affairs due to legislation timing, have also impacted the length of the appointment process. The appointment process for PAS positions has become longer and more complex over the past 40 years, with median times increasing from 140 days in 1965 to 206 days in 2004. The time between enactment and nomination plays a significant role in the appointment process, with Presidents taking longer to submit nominations than the Senate takes to confirm them. This trend is supported by a study of departmental appointments in 1981 and 1993, showing that the time Presidents took to submit nominations accounted for over 75% of the total time from inauguration to confirmation. The appointment process for PAS positions has become longer and more complex over the past 40 years. A new President has lead time before his inauguration to begin the selection and vetting process, but there might be a bottleneck in the vetting process for the large numbers of potential nominees at the beginning of a new Administration. The number of PAS positions has grown over the past several decades, with growth in the 1970s and 1980s, a slight decline in the 1990s, and additional growth between 2000 and 2004. The number of PAS positions has grown over the past several decades, with most of the growth attributed to incremental increases across many agencies. For example, the EPA had seven PAS positions in 1972 and 14 in 2004. The creation of new PAS positions reflects the importance of policymaking functions and the perceived need for congressional influence. Proponents suggest reducing the number of PAS positions for a more efficient Senate confirmation process. Efficiency gains would likely occur at the committee level, as most confirmations on the Senate floor are uncontroversial. Committee activities include reviewing FBI reports and financial disclosures. The Senate confirmation process for high-level nominees involves thorough investigation, review of financial disclosures, meetings, and hearings. Committees have more rigorous procedures for high-level nominees, which may not significantly improve Senate efficiency if only top policymaking positions are considered. Changing the appointment method for higher-level PAS positions could potentially reduce workload and improve efficiency, but it may also come with costs such as losing the opportunity for Senators to review and approve presidential appointees' qualifications and conflicts of interest. The Senate confirmation process allows Senators to review and influence policy through the confirmation of presidential appointees. If advice and consent requirements were discontinued for some state-level appointments, Senators may lose the opportunity to consult with nominees. This could decrease the Senate's efficiency and oversight performance. The reduction in the number of PAS positions could potentially shorten the appointment process, but it is unclear if it would reduce the average length of the process for remaining positions. The appointment process involves three stages, with selection and nomination taking the longest period of time. The appointment process for PAS positions involves three stages: selection and nomination, Senate consideration, and appointment at the pleasure of the President. Shortening the presidential vetting process or Senate consideration could expedite the appointment process. Vetting potential nominees' backgrounds and finances is time-consuming, especially for non-top nominees. If fewer nominees had to go through the process, it could speed up the process for the remaining applicants. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to reduce delays in the selection stage of the appointment process by providing presidential candidates with information on appointed positions early on. This allows for the selection process to begin before taking office, potentially expediting the appointment process. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aimed to streamline the national security clearance process for high-level national security positions. It required expedited background investigations for candidates and made government-wide changes to consolidate and streamline the clearance process. Additionally, the act mandated a report from the Office of Government Ethics on potential improvements to the financial disclosure process for executive branch employees. The Office of Government Ethics recommended changes to the Ethics in Government Act in 2001 to streamline the financial disclosure process. The findings of the mandated report could lead to legislation that shortens the appointment process. Investigatory activities and preparation for hearings are the most time-consuming aspects of the Senate confirmation process. The Senate confirmation process involves selection, nomination, collection of forms, and scheduling of hearings, which can lengthen the average confirmation time. Removing positions that require investigations or hearings may result in shorter appointment times. Congress could address delays by increasing committee staffing or reducing the number of nominations receiving hearings. Policy differences among Senators may also contribute to delays or blocks in nominations. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton placed a hold on a nomination due to concerns about air quality around Ground Zero after the collapse of the World Trade Center. Holds or delays on nominations can also be due to retribution or efforts to \"trade\" confirmation. In 2004, Congress acted to hasten Senate consideration of nominations at the beginning of a new Administration, setting a timetable for submission and consideration of high-level national security nominations. The analysis suggests that reducing the number of PAS positions could ease the Senate's workload. The section suggests that decreasing the number of PAS positions could ease Senate committees' workload, speed up confirmation times, and shorten the appointment process. The conversion of higher-level positions could have the most significant impact, but Congress may be hesitant to make these changes. If Congress decides to reduce PAS positions, it would be part of a broader task of determining the appropriate number and distribution of such positions, as granted by the Constitution. The appointment of PAS positions can be done by the President, courts, or agency heads, with potential consequences for Congress, the President, and agency heads. Congress plays a significant role in shaping federal agencies and programs by establishing departments, agencies, and determining their internal organization. Congress shapes federal agencies by determining their missions, personnel systems, and funding. It also oversees agencies and programs, sometimes through confirmation hearings. Delegating authority for appointments to the President or agency heads reduces Congress's influence over the selection process. Congress can enhance its oversight ability by requiring all officers with operational responsibilities to respond to congressional committees. This would ensure easier access to testimony and strengthen Congress's ability to oversee federal agencies. Several participants in the political process, including Congress, the President, agency heads, and interest groups, have a stake in determining the number and distribution of PAS positions. The confirmation process for these positions provides the Senate with leverage in negotiations with the President. The reduction in the number of PAS positions may impact congressional influence in the selection process for appointees, particularly for state-level positions like U.S. attorney, U.S. marshal, and district judge. This could lead to difficulties in deciding which PAS positions to reduce. The reduction in PAS positions may diminish congressional influence in appointee selection, especially for state-level roles like U.S. attorney, marshal, and district judge. Converting these positions into political appointments by the President or agency heads could make appointees more responsive and accountable to the administration's priorities. They would not have prior commitments to the Senate and could testify before congressional committees at the administration's discretion. Agency heads prefer significant leeway in appointing officials to control policy implementation and management goals. The White House consults with them for presidential appointments. Politically active groups influence federal policymaking officials' selection. Politically active groups seek to influence the selection of federal policymaking officials, with preferences based on alignment with political parties and visibility advantages. Senate allies can check the President's appointment power, even if the party in control differs. Interest groups may prefer Senate hearings for nominee visibility and policy highlighting. Rejection in the Senate can rally supporters. Some groups may opt for behind-the-scenes agency support for appointments. Congress could maintain current PAS positions without systematic reduction. This option aligns with constitutional principles and benefits Congress, especially the Senate. During confirmation, nominees confirmed by the Senate may be more responsive to Congress, as they agree to testify and build relationships with committee staffers or Senators. Senators can gain political leverage and oversight opportunities through the confirmation process. Senators have political leverage through holds and influence in appointing home state officials. Continuing the status quo avoids politically difficult appointment processes. However, calls for changes in the appointment process are growing, potentially impacting the Senate's identification with the issue. The Senate's identification with appointment processes could impact its prestige. Committee consideration consumes time and resources, hindering other important matters. Sharing appointment power with Congress may impede the President's management reforms and political agenda. Congress could create an advisory commission to study PAS positions. An advisory commission could study PAS positions and recommend reductions or increases on an agency-by-agency basis. This approach allows for an objective assessment outside of immediate political processes, with Congress retaining control over implementing recommendations. The report with recommendations from an advisory commission could provide a basis for future action to change the appointment process. However, there are drawbacks such as findings being ignored, difficulty in implementing recommendations, and the need for high-profile members in the commission to increase the likelihood of implementation. One potential drawback of establishing an advisory commission for appointment process changes is the risk of outside influence from political leaders and interest groups. To mitigate this, balanced representation of various parties, including the President, could be included. Congress could implement a fast-track procedure, similar to the one used for military base closures in the 1980s and 1990s, to expedite the selection of positions for reduction. The appointment process for the commission involves nominations from various political leaders, submission of criteria by the Secretary to congressional defense committees, recommendations by the Secretary based on the criteria, modifications by the commission, and final approval by the President before submission to Congress. The commission sends revised recommendations to the President for approval and transmission to Congress. Congress can block the recommendations by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within 45 days. Constraints on congressional activity during this period include time limits on committee consideration, debate, and amendments. If Congress were to establish a similar procedure for reducing PAS positions, it might include provisions on the role of the Administration, structure of a commission, congressional committees, agency roles, limits on debate and amendments, and time limits. If Congress were to pursue expedited procedures for reducing PAS positions, it would need to provide for legislative adoption of any recommended changes. Expedited procedures limit Members' rights to debate and amend legislation, but Congress retains the power to defeat objectionable proposals. Some argue that the slow legislative process acts as a check against hasty laws. Expedited procedures limit Members' rights to debate and amend legislation, potentially closing off avenues of legislative refinement. Congress could use categories like military, foreign service, and public health officer positions for PAS positions. This approach is suggested by the Presidential Appointee Initiative. Former Director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel Robert J. Nash recommended reducing the number of confirmed appointments for part-time board and commission members, such as those in agencies like the National Endowment for the Humanities. This method has been used before in reorganizations, converting positions like collectors of internal revenue and postmasters from PAS positions to competitive service positions. The Constitution specifies positions requiring presidential appointment with Senate approval. Congress could remove certain categories from this requirement, reducing the number of positions without significant loss. This could have symbolic and practical effects, improving efficiency in promotions and potentially leading to further changes. Retaining top officer positions in PAS status could provide Congress with more focused control and accountability. Reducing the number of PAS positions based on their functions could improve efficiency in promotions. Some appointees value Senate confirmation for tradition or prestige, and alternative methods may impact morale. Some argue that certain positions, like general counsels, may not require Senate confirmation due to their non-policymaking nature. However, these positions can still have significant influence in the policy arena, such as preparing legislation and commenting on legislation to OMB. General counsels play a significant role in policymaking by preparing legislation, commenting on legislation to OMB, conducting regulatory and legislative clearance, and defending the agency against legal challenges. Congress could reduce the number of PAS positions by distributing them based on the size of each agency, ensuring a proportional representation of PAS positions. The distribution of PAS positions across agencies should be proportional to ensure accountability to Congress. This approach could help make accountability more uniform, but may have drawbacks such as varying policy concerns among Members. The distribution of PAS positions across agencies should be proportional to ensure accountability to Congress. This approach might lead to an increase in the number of PAS positions, with some areas showing stronger interest in oversight. Congress could delegate appointment suggestions to committees for more focused control. One approach to increase congressional control over the reduction of PAS positions is to delegate appointment suggestions to committees. This could allow committees to assess where less direct control through the confirmation process might be feasible, aligning with Congress's institutional interests. However, drawbacks include committees lacking an incentive to propose significant reductions and the absence of an explicit avenue for the President's input. One approach to increase congressional control over the reduction of PAS positions is to delegate appointment suggestions to committees. This approach may not align with the President's priorities or management goals, making it difficult to determine specific targets for each committee. Congress could change the appointment method for some positions and restrict the President's appointment authority for those positions by specifying qualifications in statute. The Controller at the head of the Office of Federal Financial Management should possess demonstrated ability in accounting and financial management. Congress could specify qualifications for the position to retain control over appointments and reduce the number of PAS positions. Another option is for the President to appoint from nominees submitted by specific organizations or offices. The Technical Review Board is appointed by the President from nominees selected by the National Academy of Sciences, who must be eminent in a field of science or engineering. This option allows Congress to influence the qualifications of PAS appointees without the advice and consent process, but does not address other concerns like political leverage and oversight. Another option is for Congress to reduce the number of PAS positions and require the President to notify appropriate Members of Congress upon appointment. The option of requiring the President to notify Congress upon appointment to certain positions could provide an intermediate level of congressional involvement in the appointment process, maintaining accountability from the President. This approach may mitigate the loss of congressional authority and provide an opportunity for oversight without the need for Senate confirmation. The options for congressional determination of PAS positions in the federal bureaucracy vary in institutional and political considerations. Maintaining the status quo is the default option, offering the least risk for Members, but may lead to political consequences if the appointment process lengthens. The appointment process for positions subject to Senate confirmation has drawn attention to perceived shortcomings. Submission of PAS position reduction plans by agency heads, as required by law, could increase the salience of this issue. Congress may benefit politically from reducing the number of PAS positions, even if the benefits are unclear. A functional or proportional distribution approach may best protect Congress's institutional interests in this matter. A functional or proportional distribution approach may best protect Congress's institutional interests in reducing the number of PAS positions subject to Senate confirmation. Committees with oversight responsibilities could play a key role in determining where Congress needs the most accountability in this process. The adoption of an expedited procedure might afford Congress the least control over the reduction process. The President's institutional interests may be best served by political appointments without Senate confirmation, as appointees might be more responsive. An expedited procedure with the President selecting positions not requiring confirmation would be preferable. The reduction process of political appointments may involve committees suggesting positions for consideration to avoid political challenges. Alternatively, a commission outside Congress could be responsible for selecting positions for conversion to non-confirmation status. The reduction of political appointments could involve committees suggesting positions for consideration or a commission outside Congress selecting positions for conversion to non-confirmation status. This method, while politically feasible, may have significant institutional costs. If Congress sees reducing PAS positions as a step towards comprehensive reform, the magnitude of the reduction may not be as crucial as establishing a coalition for further changes and setting a precedent for reform momentum. Congress may develop a process combining various options for reducing political appointments. This could involve categorizing PAS positions into principal and inferior officers, as well as by routine/non-routine or full-time/part-time appointments. Positions could also be assessed by department and agency to determine potential impact on Congress as an institution. Congress may consider creating an expedited procedure for reducing PAS positions in a particular organization, along with establishing statutory qualifications or restrictions on the President's appointment authority. Additionally, Congress could implement appointment notification requirements for newly converted positions. These options could be combined to determine the number and distribution of PAS positions in the federal bureaucracy. Congress could include a sunset provision for appointment changes in the federal bureaucracy to allow for a trial period to assess benefits versus drawbacks before making changes permanent."
