    "content": "The Act titled \"American Community Renewal Act of 2002\" designates renewal communities. The American Community Renewal Act of 2002 allows for additional designations of renewal communities, with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development able to designate up to 20 nominated areas as renewal communities, with at least 5 in specific areas. Designations can be made between the enactment of the subsection and January 1, 2004. The American Community Renewal Act of 2002 allows for additional designations of renewal communities, with designations remaining in effect from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2011. The rules for eligibility determinations will apply, using the 2000 census data. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 1046 of the American Community Renewal Act of 2002 allows for nonrecognition of gain on proceeds from the sale of real property when invested in renewal community businesses. SEC. 1046 of the American Community Renewal Act of 2002 allows for nonrecognition of gain on the sale of real property held for over a year if the taxpayer elects. Gain is recognized only if the sale amount exceeds the cost of qualified assets purchased within 60 days, including qualified empowerment zone assets, qualified community assets, and similar properties. The section provides special rules for the nonrecognition of gain on the sale of real property under SEC. 1046 of the American Community Renewal Act of 2002. It includes provisions for the treatment of ordinary income, purchase rules, and basis adjustments for qualified assets purchased within a 60-day period. The paragraph discusses the holding period for determining gain nonrecognition on qualified assets purchased within a 60-day period. It clarifies that the holding period is calculated without considering certain sections and only the first year is considered for specific purposes. Technical amendments are made to sections 1016(a)(23), 1223(15), and the table of sections for part III of subchapter O of chapter 1 of the Code. These changes involve inserting references to section 1046 in addition to sections 1397B in the mentioned sections. \"Sec. 1046 allows nonrecognition of gain on real property sales reinvested in renewal community businesses. Effective for sales after enactment. SEC. 4 addresses local allocation of commercial revitalization deduction amounts if states do not adopt allocation plans.\" The amendment to section 1400I of the Internal Revenue Code allows for local allocation of revitalization amounts if a state fails to adopt an allocation plan within 120 days. This changes the definition of a commercial revitalization agency for renewal communities. The amendment made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
