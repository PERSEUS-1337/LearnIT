    "content": "The \"Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act\" allows certain Alaska Native veterans to apply for land allotments. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act is amended to allow eligible recipients to receive land allotments of up to 160 acres under certain conditions. Eligible recipients can receive land allotments of up to 160 acres within 3 years of regulations being promulgated. Allotments must be selected from vacant land owned by the United States, land relinquished by the State of Alaska, or land conveyed to a Native Corporation. The Native Corporation can voluntarily relinquish land for allotment and select equivalent Federal land. Allotments cannot be chosen from land within the right-of-way of the TransAlaska Pipeline. A person qualifying for an allotment under this section may select an alternative allotment from land within specified boundaries that is withdrawn, contiguous to withdrawn land, or vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved. In subsection (b), eligibility criteria for allotments under this section are specified for veterans who served during a specific period. Deceased individuals may have heirs apply for and receive allotments on their behalf. The Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act specifies eligibility criteria for allotments for veterans who served during a specific period. Heirs can apply for and receive allotments on behalf of deceased individuals. The Secretary is required to approve applications for an allotment by January 31, 2010, unless there is a valid existing right. The Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act allows for allotments to be issued under specified conditions. The Secretary must notify interested parties of any potential adverse interests and provide options for contesting or protesting the allotment. The Secretary must delay issuing a certificate for an allotment if a private contest or protest is initiated. A person can reselect land if the originally selected land was not conveyed before the Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act was enacted. The Secretary of the Interior must create final regulations within a year of this Act's enactment to implement the amendments."
