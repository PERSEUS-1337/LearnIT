    "content": "The people of California enact the following: Section 667.61 of the Penal Code is amended to specify the punishment for certain offenses, including rape and spousal rape, under different circumstances. Offenders convicted under these circumstances face imprisonment in the state prison for 15 to 25 years to life. The amended Penal Code specifies punishment for offenses like spousal rape, rape, sexual penetration, lewd acts, sodomy, oral copulation, and continuous sexual abuse of a child. Offenders convicted under these circumstances face imprisonment for 15 to 25 years to life in state prison. The defendant may face enhanced punishment if they committed multiple offenses, kidnapped the victim, inflicted aggravated mayhem or torture, or committed the offense during a burglary of the first degree. The defendant may face enhanced punishment if they committed multiple offenses, kidnapped the victim, inflicted bodily harm on a victim under 14 years of age, or committed the offense during a burglary. The defendant may face enhanced punishment if they used a weapon, committed an offense against multiple victims, tied or bound a victim, administered drugs, or committed specific offenses like rape or sexual acts with a minor. If the minimum required circumstances for a specific punishment have been proven, they will be used as the basis for imposing the term provided, rather than applying any other law unless a greater penalty is specified. Additional circumstances can be used to impose a different punishment in addition to the one provided. The court shall not strike any allegation, admission, or finding of specified circumstances for a person subject to punishment under this section. Probation or sentence suspension shall not be granted for such individuals. Consecutive sentences shall be imposed for offenses involving separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions. Any person convicted of specified offenses against a child under 14 years of age under certain circumstances will face life imprisonment without parole or 25 years to life in state prison. Probation or sentence suspension is not an option for these individuals, and consecutive sentences will be imposed for offenses involving separate victims or the same victim on separate occasions. (k) \"Bodily harm\" refers to significant physical injury from excessive force. \n(l) Conviction for specified offenses under certain circumstances against a minor 14 years or older results in life imprisonment without parole or 25 years to life in state prison. \n(m) Conviction for specified offenses under certain circumstances against a minor 14 years or older leads to imprisonment for 25 years to life in state prison. Subdivisions (l) and (m) outline penalties for specific offenses, including rape, spousal rape, sexual penetration, sodomy, and oral copulation. The penalties apply if certain circumstances are alleged and proven in court."
