    "content": "The \"Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Act\" or the \"DRIVE-Safe Act\" establishes an apprenticeship program for commercial drivers under the age of 21. The \"DRIVE-Safe Act\" defines an apprentice as an individual under 21 with a commercial driver's license. Apprentices can drive in interstate commerce during probationary periods and after completing an apprenticeship program. The program includes a 120-hour and 280-hour probationary period. The apprentice must complete a 120-hour probationary period, with at least 80 hours of driving time in a commercial vehicle. Performance benchmarks include various driving skills and safety awareness. After completing a 120-hour probationary period with driving time in a commercial vehicle, the apprentice must then complete a 280-hour probationary period, with at least 160 hours of driving time. Performance benchmarks include backing, maneuvering, pre-trip inspections, fueling procedures, and weighing loads. During the 280-hour probationary period, apprentices must learn about load weighing, weight distribution, tandems sliding, coupling and uncoupling procedures, trip planning, truck routes, map reading, navigation, permits, and transporting hazardous materials with proper endorsement. Restrictions include not driving vehicles with hazardous materials placards and only driving vehicles with automatic transmissions. The apprentice must have active braking collision mitigation systems, forward-facing video event capture, and governed speeds of 65 miles per hour. They must be accompanied by an experienced driver in the commercial motor vehicle. The employer must maintain records of the apprentice's compliance with requirements. Reportable incidents must be reported to the Department of Transportation. The apprentice must undergo remediation and additional training after a preventable accident or moving violation while driving a commercial motor vehicle. The program is completed after the probationary period, and employers can impose additional requirements on apprentices. In this section, employers can add technologies to commercial motor vehicles beyond those specified. Definitions include \"commercial motor vehicle\" and \"driving time.\" An \"experienced driver\" is at least 21 years old. An \"experienced driver\" must be at least 21 years old, have held a commercial driver's license for 2 years, no preventable accidents or violations for a year, and have 1 year of interstate driving experience. The term \"pointed moving violation\" refers to a violation that results in points being added to a driver's license or a similar violation deemed comparable by the Secretary. The Secretary must issue regulations that comply with this Act within one year of its enactment."
