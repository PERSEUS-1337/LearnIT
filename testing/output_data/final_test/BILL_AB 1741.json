    "title": "AB 1741",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Part 54.7 of the Education Code establishes the California College Promise Innovation Grant Program, to be administered by the chancellor's office. Grants will be distributed to community college districts that meet the program's requirements. The California College Promise Innovation Grant Program aims to support community college districts in establishing or expanding regional programs in partnership with schools and universities to increase college readiness, placement in college-level courses, degree/certificate completion, and successful transfer to a university. The California College Promise Innovation Grant Program aims to increase bachelor's degree graduation rates for regional students and reduce achievement gaps for underrepresented groups. It also emphasizes leveraging local and state funding to improve student success through partnerships with school districts and universities. The Early Commitment to College Program partners with school districts to provide K-12 students and families assistance in college preparation and application. It also supports high school student preparation for college and reduces postsecondary remediation through various evidence-based practices. The community college district utilizes evidence-based indicators for student assessment, provides enrolled students with access to courses and priority registration, and offers outreach regarding transfer programs and grants. The chancellor's office encourages community college districts to seek local and private funding for sustainable California College Promise programs. They also urge leveraging new or existing funding sources to align efforts for student success. The chancellor's office will post grant program applications on its website and encourage districts without grants to find local funding sources. The office will establish criteria for the grant program, giving priority to applications that identify funding sources for sustainable programs or leverage funding for student success. An application demonstrating partnerships with local school districts, serving more students, and partnering with a California State University for guaranteed admission and transfer will receive secondary priority. The Legislature encourages various educational institutions and organizations to provide support services for community college districts. The governing board of a district receiving a grant is encouraged to partner with school districts or universities to coordinate programs and activities. The part in effect until January 1, 2021, will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date."
