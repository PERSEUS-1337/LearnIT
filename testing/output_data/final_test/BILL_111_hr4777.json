    "content": "There is no relevant information provided in the prev_chunk to summarize the curr_chunk. Section 3111 is amended to provide a special exemption for certain individuals hired in 2010, allowing qualified employers to not apply subsection (a) to wages paid during that period. Qualified individuals must perform services for the employer's trade or business, or in furtherance of activities related to the employer's tax-exempt status under section 501. The term 'qualified employer' excludes the United States, States, political subdivisions, or their instrumentalities, but includes public institutions of higher education. A 'qualified individual' is someone who starts working for a qualified employer. An individual who starts employment with a qualified employer between February 3, 2010, and January 1, 2011, must certify that they have not worked more than 40 hours in the 60-day period before starting. They cannot be hired to replace another employee unless that employee left voluntarily or for cause, and they must not fall under a specific category as defined in section 51(i)(1). A qualified employer can choose to make this election. The subsection allows qualified employers to elect not to apply certain provisions. Coordination with the Work Opportunity Credit is specified, stating that wages do not include amounts paid to qualified individuals within a specific timeframe unless the employer elects otherwise. Appropriations are made to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund. The amendments made by this section allocate funds to the Survivors Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to offset revenue reductions. These appropriations will be transferred from the general fund to replicate the transfers that would have occurred without the amendments. The effective date for these amendments is for wages paid after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 2. Business credit for retention of certain newly hired individuals in 2010.

A \"retained worker\" is defined as a qualified individual under section 3111(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The current year business credit will increase based on the number of retained workers who meet specific criteria outlined in section 3111(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The increase is limited to 4 percent of their wages for a 52-week period, with certain conditions to be met.
