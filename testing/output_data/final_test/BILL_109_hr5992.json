    "content": "The \"Choices in Child Care Act\" is the short title of this legislation. Congress acknowledges the severe underfunding of child care assistance for low-income working families, with only 1 in 7 eligible children receiving support. Funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act has remained stagnant for 5 years, hindering access to child care. A significant percentage of parents, including women with infants, are part of the workforce, highlighting the need for affordable child care options. Research highlights the crucial role of quality caretaking in early childhood for brain development and well-being. There is a severe shortage of affordable infant care, especially in rural areas, with only 18% of the potential need being met by licensed providers. Working parents, especially those with a high percentage of low-wage residents, should be able to provide child care for infants themselves without undermining family economic stability. SEC. 3. AT-HOME INFANT CARE. The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to include demonstration projects for at-home infant care benefits. The Secretary will award grants to 5-7 States for at-home infant care projects for low-income families. Indian tribes may also receive grants for similar projects, with modifications as needed. The program under this section allows Indian tribes to receive grants for projects, separate from grants awarded to States. States must apply to the Secretary to participate in the program and carry out demonstration projects. The Choices in Child Care Act allows States to apply for grants to participate in the program within 270 days of enactment. The Secretary will review applications and select participating States within 1 year based on specified criteria. The Secretary will select participating States based on criteria including geographic diversity and a strong commitment to improving infant care quality and parental choices. Priority will be given to States with experience in at-home infant care programs. The participating States selected for the demonstration project must provide certifications to the Secretary, ensuring that they will not reduce child care expenditures below previous levels during the project period. The State must not prioritize eligible low-income families seeking at-home infant care benefits over other eligible low-income families on a waiting list for child care assistance through another program. They must select a combination of families from both groups to receive at-home infant care benefits. The State must provide information on child care options to parents applying for at-home infant care benefits. Approved applicants can choose between at-home infant care subsidies or certificates for child care. Families receiving subsidies can exchange them for other child care services. The State offers at-home infant care benefits through a demonstration project. Families can choose between subsidies or certificates for child care. The State must improve infant care quality, provide parent education, and cooperate with evaluations. Family eligibility criteria apply. To qualify for at-home infant care benefits under the demonstration project, a family must have income below a specified limit, include a child under 12 months (or 24 months at State's discretion), have a parent with recent work history, and meet other State-established eligibility requirements. The demonstration project allows low-income families with children under 12 months to receive at-home infant care benefits, with the amount not exceeding the State's maximum rate for licensed child care providers. Two-parent families can participate, and the benefit is not considered TANF assistance. The demonstration project provides at-home infant care benefits to low-income families with children under 12 months, not exceeding the State's maximum rate for licensed child care. Two-parent families can participate, and the benefit is not considered income for federal assistance programs. The Secretary will evaluate the projects and report to Congress within 4 years of the Choices in Child Care Act enactment. The Secretary will evaluate the implementation experiences of States carrying out demonstration projects providing at-home infant care benefits under the Choices in Child Care Act, including design and coordination issues. Characteristics of participating families and the duration of their participation will also be examined. The evaluation of demonstration projects under the Choices in Child Care Act will include the length of family participation, reasons for ceasing participation, employment outcomes, costs and benefits, and the effectiveness of state efforts to improve infant care quality. The Secretary must reserve $1,000,000 for evaluating demonstration projects under the Choices in Child Care Act for a fiscal year. SEC. 4. Authorization of appropriations and conforming amendments. Authorization of appropriations for at-home infant care benefits under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to allocate $75,000,000 annually starting from fiscal year 2007. Conforming amendments are made to specify reservations under section 658B(a). The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 authorizes $75,000,000 annually for at-home infant care benefits starting from fiscal year 2007. Amendments are made to specify reservations under section 658B(a) by inserting \"under section 658B(a)\" in various paragraphs."
