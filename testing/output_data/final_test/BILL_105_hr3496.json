    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Information Technology Partnership Act\" and authorizes a demonstration program. The \"Information Technology Partnership Act\" authorizes a demonstration project where the Director of the National Science Foundation awards grants to 5 local educational agencies. The grants can be used to develop information technology programs in mathematics, science, and IT, purchase necessary equipment, and provide teacher training in these fields. The program under the \"Information Technology Partnership Act\" trains teachers in IT, math, and science, and provides students with specialized training in the same areas. Eligible local educational agencies must be located in cities awarded by the National Science Foundation, have agreements with the private sector for services and funds, and agree to terms with the Director. The Information Technology Partnership Act requires eligible local educational agencies to enter into agreements with the Director to comply with the Act. Private sector participation includes donating computer hardware and software, providing internship and mentoring opportunities for students, and offering scholarship funds for eligible students. Agencies must submit applications to the Director following established guidelines. The guidelines for the scholarship program application require a description of proposed activities, scholarship program details, and evidence of private sector support. The Director will establish an internship, mentoring, and scholarship program with guidelines to be published within 6 months. Selection of local educational agencies for awards will be based on merit after a comprehensive review. Priority will be given to agencies with strong private sector commitments for services and funds. The Director will assess the effectiveness of activities under the Act and conduct a longitudinal study on scholarship recipients. The report will include graduation and employment numbers in math, science, or IT fields. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"Director\" as the head of the National Science Foundation, \"eligible student\" as a 12th-grade student interested in IT, math, science, or engineering with high academic standing, and \"local educational agency\" as a school district. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined as a school district according to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The National Science Foundation is authorized to receive $1,500,000 for this Act, with a maximum grant award of $300,000 for eligible local educational agencies."
