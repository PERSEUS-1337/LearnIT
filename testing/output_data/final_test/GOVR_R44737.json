    "content": "In AY 2017-2018, 6,700 higher education institutions enrolled over 27 million students in federal student aid programs. These institutions varied in sector, size, and programs offered, ranging from certificate programs to doctoral degrees. While most operate without major issues, some face financial or operational concerns leading to closures, especially in the proprietary sector. The recent closure of large proprietary IHEs has raised concerns about postsecondary students' education disruptions. Student worries include transferring credits, financing future education, and loan repayment after a school closure. This report explains academic options, financial relief, and practical implications for students affected by an IHE closure. This report discusses academic options for students affected by school closures, including transferring to a new institution or participating in a teach-out. It also covers financial issues such as loan discharge, future financial assistance, tuition reimbursement, and potential income tax implications. In the event of a school closure, currently enrolled students must consider their academic options, including teach-outs and credit transfer. To participate in federal student aid programs, an institution must submit a teach-out plan if closing a location or ceasing operations. A teach-out plan is a written plan that ensures fair treatment of students if an institution closes before they finish their program. It includes provisions for completing studies, communication with affected parties, and access to records. Institutions may also enter into teach-out agreements with other institutions. A teach-out agreement is a formal agreement between two institutions that allows students from a closing institution to complete their programs at a new institution. The new institution must meet certain criteria and provide a similar educational program. Teach-out agreements establish the cost of attendance for students being taught out. They can take various forms, such as providing faculty and student support at the closing institution's facilities or offering educational programs at the teach-out institution's facilities. If an institution closes without a teach-out plan, the accrediting agency must assist students in completing their education, potentially through credit transfers. Credit transfer is the process of one institution measuring a student's prior learning at another institution and determining if it meets its standards. If it does, the accepting institution gives credit towards its programs, allowing students to transfer credits without repeating coursework. Transfer-of-credit policies are set by individual institutions, and some have articulation agreements to streamline the process. Articulation agreements between institutions streamline the credit transfer process by ensuring that a student's prior learning meets the accepting institution's standards. Title IV participating institutions must make their transfer-of-credit policies publicly available, including criteria for evaluating credit transfers and a list of institutions with articulation agreements. Students who attended a closed institution may transfer credits to another institution through articulation agreements. The credit transfer process varies among institutions, with some students experiencing smooth transitions while others face disruptions. Students who attended a closed institution may face disruptions and delays in their postsecondary education, potentially leading to greater financial obligations like student loans if coursework needs to be repeated. Transferring credits to another institution requires meeting the accepting institution's satisfactory academic progress policies, which include minimum GPA and completion time frame requirements. Only transfer credits that count towards the educational program at the accepting institution are considered in the calculation of satisfactory academic progress. If a student's credits from a closed institution transfer to another institution, their Title IV eligibility may be affected based on the accepting institution's satisfactory academic progress policy. Students should also consider financial options if they received financial assistance at the closed school. Students who borrowed funds for education at a closed school may need financial assistance to continue their postsecondary education. They should consider their responsibility for repaying loans and how their eligibility for financial aid at another institution may be affected. Some individuals may be relieved from repaying loans based on specific circumstances. Students who attended a closed school may have borrowed federal student loans. They may be eligible for relief through a closed school loan discharge or a borrower defense to repayment for certain acts or omissions of the institution. The closure of a school may be linked to borrower defense to repayment (BDR) claims, often based on misleading information provided by the institution. New regulations were introduced in 2016 to enhance BDR standards and procedures, with an original effective date of July 1, 2017, later delayed to July 1, 2019. However, after legal challenges, the delay was overturned. The 2016 regulations for borrower defense to repayment (BDR) were delayed but went into effect on October 16, 2018. The Department of Education (ED) is working on fully implementing these regulations. A new Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was issued on July 31, 2018, to revise the BDR standards, with a potential effective date of July 2020. Closed school discharge allows students affected by school closures to have their HEA Title IV loans discharged. HEA Title IV loans can be discharged if a student is unable to complete their program due to school closure. Borrowers may also be reimbursed for previous payments and any adverse credit history associated with the loan will be reported to credit bureaus for deletion. To qualify for loan discharge, the student must have been enrolled in the school when it closed or withdrawn within 120 days prior to closure. If a student is unable to complete their program at a closed school or a comparable program at another institution, they may qualify for loan discharge. Refusing a teach-out agreement and transferring credits to a new school for a different program can also make a borrower eligible for loan discharge. If a student is unable to complete their program at a closed school or a comparable program at another institution, they may qualify for loan discharge. Borrowers must cooperate with ED in any proceeding to recover discharged amounts, or the discharge may be revoked. Loan discharge can be obtained by applying for a closed school discharge or having loans automatically discharged by the Secretary of Education. Borrowers must fill out the closed school loan discharge application and return it to their loan servicer. During the closed school loan discharge process, borrowers can temporarily stop or reduce payments on federal student loans. Interest accrues on both subsidized and unsubsidized loans during forbearance. The Secretary is required to identify eligible borrowers and send them a discharge application after a school closure. The Secretary suspends collection efforts on defaulted loans after sending notice to the borrower. The borrower has 60 days to submit a closed school discharge application. If not submitted within the timeframe, collections resume, but the borrower can still apply at any time. Loans may be automatically discharged if the borrower did not reenroll in a Title IV eligible institution within three years of school closure. If a borrower receives a closed school discharge, the full balance of the outstanding Title IV loan borrowed to attend the institution is discharged. Borrowers may also be reimbursed for any amounts previously paid on those loans. Loans in default are considered not in default following discharge, and borrowers regain eligibility for additional Title IV assistance. Consumer reporting agencies are updated to delete any adverse credit history associated with the loan. Borrowers who attended a closed school may seek debt relief through a borrower defense to repayment (BDR) for certain acts or omissions of the institution related to the loan or educational services provided. The availability of a BDR claim may be linked to a school's closure due to misleading representations. Relief eligibility depends on the type of Title IV loan borrowed and when it was disbursed. Newly promulgated BDR procedures apply to many cases. The Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) procedures apply to various cases involving different types of Title IV loans. If a borrower's BDR claim is successful, the Department of Education (ED) determines the amount of debt relief, which may include forgiving part or all of the loan balance and reimbursing previous payments. Adverse credit history associated with the loan, such as default, will be reported to credit bureaus for removal. Borrowers of Direct Loans can assert a defense to repayment for certain actions of the institution. Loans eligible for Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) claims include Direct Loan program loans, Federal Family Education Loan program loans, and Perkins Loans program loans if consolidated into a Direct Consolidation Loan. FFEL program loans may also be unenforceable in certain instances. Borrowers can assert defense to repayment for specific actions under both programs. Perkins Loan program loans not consolidated cannot assert a BDR claim. For eligible student loans under the Direct Loan program, borrowers can assert a defense to repayment based on specific standards. Loans made before July 1, 2017, must meet one standard, while loans made after that date must meet a different standard. The borrower must prove either an IHE's acts or omissions that would give rise to a cause of action under State law for pre-July 1, 2017 loans, or a substantial misrepresentation by an IHE for post-July 1, 2017 loans. The Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) standard applies to eligible student loans under the Direct Loan program. For loans made before July 1, 2017, borrowers must prove acts or omissions by the institution that would give rise to a cause of action under State law. For loans made after that date, borrowers must show a substantial misrepresentation by the institution that they relied on to their detriment. The BDR standard used depends on the date the loans were disbursed and other factors related to the type of federal student loan. The Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) standard applies to eligible student loans under the Direct Loan program. The standard used depends on the date the loans were disbursed. For FFEL program loans not paid off through a Direct Consolidation Loan, the pre-July 1, 2017, standard applies. For DL program loans paid off through a Direct Consolidation Loan, the standard depends on the date the underlying Direct Loan was disbursed. Loans paid off through a Direct Consolidation Loan comprising underlying loans disbursed both before and after July 1, 2017, would follow the post-July 1, 2017, standard. The Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) standard applies to Direct Loans paid off through Direct Consolidation Loans, depending on the disbursement date of the underlying Direct Loan. BDR Procedures Regulations outline processes for asserting BDR claims on DL program loans, with separate procedures for individual and group claims. These procedures do not apply to ED-owned FFEL program loans. The procedures for asserting Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) claims on FFEL program loans not owned by ED involve submitting a BDR application with supporting evidence. Upon receipt, ED places nondefaulted Direct Loans into forbearance and stops collections on defaulted loans. If a borrower files a BDR claim with ED, the lender or loan holder is notified, and the loan is placed in forbearance while collections on defaulted loans cease. The Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDR) process involves submitting an application with evidence. ED places loans in forbearance and stops collections during evaluation. If eligible, loans can be consolidated for relief; if not, collections resume. An ED official reviews evidence and resolves claims through a fact-finding process. After the fact-finding process, the ED official issues a written decision on the claim, notifying the borrower of the relief provided or reasons for denial. The decision is final, but borrowers can request reconsideration with new evidence. ED may also reopen applications at any time. Regulations establish a group process for BDR claims based on common factors like facts or fiscal impact. The Secretary may initiate a process to determine if a group of borrowers has a BDR claim based on common facts and claims. Borrowers with individual claims may have their loans consolidated into a group BDR claim, while those without individual claims will have their loans placed in forbearance. Identified group members can opt out of the group proceeding, and the school is notified of the claim. For group BDR claims related to loans made to attend a closed school without financial protection, a hearing official reviews evidence and arguments presented by ED. After the fact-finding process, the ED official issues a written decision on the group borrower defense claim. If approved, borrowers are notified of the relief provided; if denied, reasons are given. The decision is final, but individual borrowers can seek relief separately. The ED may reconsider evidence not previously reviewed. The procedures for group borrower defense claims related to loans for closed schools with financial protections are similar to those for loans for open schools. The school can present evidence during the fact-finding process, and appeals can be made within 30 days. The Secretary issues a final decision on appealed claims. The procedures for group borrower defense claims related to loans for closed schools with financial protections are similar to those for loans for open schools. After a final decision has been made, an individual borrower may file a claim for individual relief. Additionally, ED may reopen a BDR application at any time to consider new evidence. Borrowers must cooperate with ED to obtain relief, or it may be revoked. The report focuses on BDR relief available to borrowers with DL program loans. Consolidation Loans can repay eligible non-DL program loans. Borrowers of FFEL program loans not consolidated into Direct Consolidation Loans may be eligible for loan discharge and reimbursement. Perkins Loan borrowers must consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan for BDR relief. Approved borrower defense can result in loan discharge or reimbursement of payments made. Reimbursements by ED for Direct Loans, including Consolidation Loans, are based on borrower's BDR claim within statute of limitations. Relief amount considers various factors like cost of attendance and value of education received. The Department of Education (ED) provides relief to borrowers in cases of judgment against an institution of higher education (IHE) or breach of contract by the IHE. Relief may include monetary compensation and other forms of assistance, such as loan forgiveness or eligibility for additional Title IV benefits. The borrower, eligible for additional Title IV assistance, may seek relief if their TEACH Grant converts into a Direct Loan due to failure to complete service requirements. They can apply for closed school discharge or a successful BDR to avoid repaying the converted grant. Private education loans taken out by students at a closed school may have varying terms and conditions depending on the lender, borrower's creditworthiness, and market conditions. Relief from repayment obligations for these loans depends on individual loan terms. Pell Grant recipients affected by a closed school may have their eligibility partially restored. The HEA exempts Pell Grant recipients from the lifetime eligibility cap if they were unable to complete their studies due to a school closure. The GI Bill entitlement may be restored after a school closure, but overpayments may need to be repaid. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 addresses these issues. The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48) allows for the restoration of GI Bill entitlement for individuals affected by school closures. Recipients can receive benefits for up to 36 months of full-time enrollment under one GI Bill, or 45 months for the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program. Entitlement is restored for incomplete courses or programs due to school closures after January 1, 2015. P.L. 115-48 allows for the restoration of GI Bill entitlement for individuals affected by school closures after January 1, 2015. The VA can continue paying a Post-9/11 GI Bill housing allowance for up to 120 days after the closure. Participants must apply for benefit restoration and the housing allowance extension. The VA is required to notify affected individuals of school closures and how it will affect their GI Bill entitlement. GI Bill participants who withdraw from all courses may remain eligible for benefits under certain circumstances. If there are no mitigating circumstances, the individual may need to repay all benefits received for their education. Mitigating circumstances, such as a school closing, can prevent this repayment. Some GI Bill benefits may be paid upfront, but an overpayment may occur if the individual cannot complete the academic term. The VA can determine the end date of educational assistance if it needs to be discontinued for reasons not described in regulations. A school closure may qualify as a reason for discontinuing educational assistance not described in regulations. Students transferring to another institution should consider how their eligibility for financial aid, such as Pell Grants and GI educational benefits, may be affected. Borrowing limits and eligibility restrictions for Title IV student loans could impact future financial aid. Loan limits dictate the maximum amount that can be borrowed in an academic year, with aggregate limits applying to the total outstanding Title IV loans. Borrowing limits for Direct Loans vary based on academic standing, loan type, and dependency status. Discharged loans due to closed school discharge or successful BDR claim do not count towards limits. Direct Subsidized Loans have interest paid by the government while enrolled at least half-time, during a grace period, and deferment. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, have limits on receiving Direct Subsidized Loans. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, may only receive Direct Subsidized Loans for a period equal to 150% of their academic program length. Discharged loans from closed school discharge or successful BDR claims do not count towards usage period. State tuition recovery funds (STRFs) may provide relief for expenses not covered by other sources, such as tuition payments or private student loans for closed institutions. The availability and eligibility of state tuition recovery funds (STRFs) for private student loans borrowed to attend an IHE vary by state. Borrowers whose student loans are discharged due to school closure will be subject to federal and state income taxes on the discharged loans unless they qualify for an exception. Students who received funds from an STRF might also face tax consequences. Borrowers whose debt is forgiven must include the canceled debt amount in their federal income tax liability. The Higher Education Act (HEA) provides exceptions for certain student loan discharges due to school closure. Borrowers of FFELs, Direct Loans, and Perkins Loans who meet specific criteria will not be subject to federal income taxes on the discharged amounts. The HEA does not address the tax treatment of federal student loans discharged due to borrower defense to repayment or private education loans. The Higher Education Act provides exceptions for student loan discharges due to school closure, but does not address tax treatment for loans discharged under borrower defense to repayment or private education loans. Borrowers may be taxed on discharged loans unless they qualify for exceptions such as insolvency or disputed debt doctrine. The IRS guidance in 2015 and 2017 shows how the disputed debt doctrine applies to discharged student loans from Corinthian Colleges, Inc. and American Career Institutes, Inc. The IRS extended tax relief to former students of these schools, including private student loans, discharged due to legal settlements over unlawful practices. Private lenders engaged in unlawful business practices may lead to discharged loans being excluded from income, requiring borrowers to prove eligibility for exceptions. If the IRS challenges this, taxpayers can contest in federal court. Students receiving funds from STRFs may also face federal tax consequences, with unclear tax treatment. Any amount received is generally taxable unless excluded by law, but it's uncertain how this applies to STRF payments due to lack of court decisions or IRS guidance. Various theories exist for students to potentially exclude these payments from income based on their circumstances. Students may exclude payments from income based on their circumstances and state's plan, such as treating it as nontaxable reimbursement. Excluding payments may require accounting for federal education tax benefits. Discharged student loans and STRF payments may have tax consequences, affecting higher education tax benefits. Four relevant federal tax benefits include the student loan interest deduction. The tax benefits for education include the student loan interest deduction, tuition and fees deduction, Lifetime Learning Credit, and American Opportunity Tax Credit. These benefits allow taxpayers to reduce their income subject to tax or tax liability for tuition, fees, and other eligible expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) can be claimed for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment, but not room and board. It is a refundable credit, allowing taxpayers with little to no tax liability to receive up to $1,000 as a refund check. Expenses paid with a loan can count towards the tax benefits, but tax-free aid like Pell Grants may reduce the eligible expenses. Either the parent or student can claim the benefit, depending on dependency status. Only one tax benefit per student can be claimed annually. Students continuing education after a school closure are still eligible for these tax benefits. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) can only be claimed for expenses incurred during the first four years of postsecondary education. If a student's school closes, they may only claim the AOTC for one additional year. IRS guidance on this issue is lacking. Taxpayers may need to adjust previously claimed education tax benefits if they qualify to exclude discharged student loans or STRF payments. Borrowers who claimed certain tax benefits for expenses paid with student loans that were later discharged may be affected. This is to prevent borrowers from receiving double benefits. The IRS may not require borrowers to repay previously claimed education tax benefits in certain circumstances, such as school closures or discharged student loans. State income tax consequences may also arise from these situations, as most states follow federal income tax definitions. The borrower may face state income tax consequences on discharged debt or education tax benefits, with some states having different tax treatment than the federal level. States with their own education tax benefits or tuition recovery funds may have specific laws regarding state tax treatment."
