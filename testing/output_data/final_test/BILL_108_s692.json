    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Digital Consumer Right to Know Act\" and includes Congressional findings and purpose. Congress finds that consumers have expectations about using legally acquired content for personal purposes, but digital technologies can also enable unlawful distribution of copyrighted content. Technology companies are developing tools to prevent this behavior and promote competition. Technologies developed to prevent unlawful distribution of digital content may restrict consumers' flexibility and frustrate their expectations. The Act aims to inform consumers about technological restrictions on digital content to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions and encourage the development of technologies to combat unlawful distribution. The Act aims to address the problem of unlawful reproduction and distribution of content while preserving consumer flexibility and competition among distribution channels for digital information and entertainment content. SEC. 3. FAIR DISCLOSURE OF TECHNOLOGICAL USE RESTRICTIONS. The Federal Trade Commission must issue rules within a year to implement disclosure requirements for producers or distributors of copyrighted digital content with technological limitations on playback, copying, or transferring. Producers must clearly disclose these limitations to purchasers before sale. The Federal Trade Commission will prescribe disclosure methods for copyrighted digital content with playback limitations. Different types of content and distribution channels may have varying disclosure requirements. Limitations on recording audio or video programming for later viewing trigger disclosure obligations. The consumer can access programming through a subscription package without additional charges or the ability to choose specific delivery times. There are limitations on the noncommercial use of legally acquired audio or video content, including space shifting and using content on different electronic platforms. Backup copies of legally acquired content distributed in specific forms or mediums are also restricted. The curr_chunk discusses limitations on using legally acquired content for specific purposes like criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. It also mentions restrictions on transferring or selling content to another consumer. The Federal Trade Commission may exempt certain unusual or uncommon uses from disclosure requirements regarding limitations on transferring digital content. The Commission must annually review the effectiveness of its rules to consider changes in technology or consumer practices. Consumers may suffer unfair surprise if technology limits their use of digital content without prior notice. SEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. This Act does not limit fair use rights under section 107 of title 17, US Code. It does not allow illegal reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content. SEC. 5. COMPETITION IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. SEC. 5. COMPETITION IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. Congress believes competition benefits consumers. Copyright holders should license digital content to multiple distributors for competition among different models and technologies."
