    "content": "State and local sanctions typically involve selective purchasing or contracting laws that prohibit agencies from doing business with companies in certain countries, or selective investment laws that restrict public funds from being invested in these companies. Some states have also enacted divestment laws targeting specific countries or poor foreign labor practices. In the 1990s, laws focused on Burma, Nigeria, Tibet, Cuba, Indonesia, Switzerland, and Northern Ireland, while more recent legislation has addressed issues in Darfur. Between 2006 and 2010, several states proposed or enacted divestment legislation targeting Sudan, while others passed laws prohibiting pension fund investment in debt instruments from nations designated as supporting terrorism. Some states also aimed at divesting state funds from companies involved in certain activities in Iran, Sudan, or state sponsors of terrorism. In February 2007, a federal court ruled an Illinois statute restricting state funds deposit and pension investments with Sudanese entities as unconstitutional. State and local economic sanctions targeting foreign government behavior raise constitutional issues related to foreign commerce, federal government's foreign affairs power, and preemption by federal law. The Constitution grants Congress authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, with the Commerce Clause implying a restriction on states' interference with commerce. This restriction, known as the \"dormant\" Commerce Clause, applies even in the absence of Congressional action. The \"dormant\" Commerce Clause prohibits states and localities from unreasonably burdening or discriminating against interstate or foreign commerce without Congressional authorization. The Supreme Court has set criteria for evaluating state measures that burden foreign commerce without Congressional permission, requiring a closer examination than for interstate measures. The Court allows for state measures in situations where federal involvement is not clearly required, as seen in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles where a California statute was struck down under the Foreign Commerce Clause. The court struck down a California state statute applying an ad valorem property tax on foreign cargo containers, citing the risk of multiple taxation and potential impairment of federal uniformity in foreign commerce cases. If a state tax violates these principles, it is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. In Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board, the Court upheld a state income tax law challenged by a multinational enterprise, stating that it did not infringe upon the federal government's authority over foreign commerce. The Court emphasized that a state tax may be impermissible if it prevents the federal government from speaking with \"one voice\" on international trade issues. The Court upheld a state tax law in Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board, stating it did not infringe on federal authority over foreign commerce. In Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board of California, the Court noted that state statutes may be sustained even if they make it difficult for the federal government to speak with one voice on international trade, as long as Congress did not intend to bar the state practice. Arguments that state selective purchasing or divestment laws may burden foreign commerce can be countered by invoking the market participant doctrine, which exempts such laws from the Foreign Commerce Clause if the state acts as a buyer or seller of goods. However, this doctrine may not apply if the state seeks to affect behavior beyond its immediate market, and it does not protect laws from other constitutional challenges. The Supreme Court has ruled that state or local laws encroaching on federal authority over foreign affairs may be unconstitutional. In Zschernig v. Miller (1968), a law in Oregon prohibiting nonresident aliens from inheriting property was struck down. The federal government's exclusive power over external affairs means states cannot interfere in this area. The Supreme Court in Zschernig v. Miller (1968) ruled that state or local laws interfering with federal authority over foreign affairs may be unconstitutional. The Court found that Oregon's statute on inheritance by nonresident aliens intruded on the President and Congress's constitutional powers. The ruling's application is often debated in cases involving state or local restrictions on economic transactions with foreign entities. State or local selective procurement laws may be unconstitutional if they interfere with federal authority over foreign affairs, as seen in the Zschernig v. Miller case. The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law is supreme, and states cannot take actions that conflict with it. Federal law can preempt state laws if Congress clearly expresses its intent. This can be done through explicit statements or implied preemption. Implied preemption can occur through field preemption, where federal regulation is pervasive, or conflict preemption, where state laws conflict with federal objectives. The delineation between preemption categories, conflict and field preemption, is not rigid in cases involving foreign affairs. Courts may weigh deference to state regulation against federal policy considerations. The Supreme Court's ruling in Hines v. Davidowitz emphasized federal supremacy in foreign affairs, limiting state power in this area. Opponents of state sanctions laws may argue that they conflict with federal laws and policies towards specific countries. They may also claim that Congress intended for all state measures targeting a country to be preempted. However, federal limitations on proprietary powers must be expressly intended or result from a pervasive federal scheme. State laws may have different consequences from federal remedies as long as they do not interfere with a complex federal scheme. In Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, the Supreme Court ruled that a Massachusetts selective purchasing law targeting Burma was preempted by federal sanctions against Burma. The Court found the state law undermined federal provisions, despite Congress not expressly preempting state laws in the federal Burma statute. This case clarified the uncertainty surrounding constitutional challenges to state sanctions laws. The Supreme Court ruled in Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council that a Massachusetts law targeting Burma was preempted by federal sanctions. The state law undermined federal provisions by lacking flexibility and discretion granted to the President. The Supreme Court ruled that a Massachusetts law targeting Burma was preempted by federal sanctions, as it exceeded federal authorities and impeded the President's ability to pursue a multilateral strategy. The Supreme Court found that Congress's silence on preempting state sanctions against Burma was ambiguous and insufficient to allow states to impose their own sanctions. This decision reaffirmed the Court's stance on federal foreign affairs power and struck down a California law related to Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief. The Supreme Court struck down a California law, the Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act, which required insurers to disclose information about policies issued in Europe during the Nazi regime. The Court cited an executive agreement with Germany and determined a conflict between state and executive policies, leading to preemption. The Supreme Court struck down California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act, citing conflict with executive policies and preemption. In a related case, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled the Illinois Sudan Act unconstitutional, prohibiting state funds investment. The Illinois Sudan Act prohibits the state treasurer from investing in Sudan-related entities and requires financial institutions to certify they do not support \"forbidden entities.\" It also restricts pension funds from investing in companies that have transferred assets to forbidden entities. The Illinois Sudan Act prohibits investments in forbidden entities, including firms with Sudan-related assets or transactions. The statute was challenged on legal grounds related to foreign affairs and commerce. The Illinois Sudan Act prohibits investments in entities with Sudan-related assets. The court found that the statute's lack of flexibility and impact on foreign entities interfered with national foreign affairs, preempting the Deposit of State Moneys Act amendment. However, pension divestment was not preempted as federal law did not address it explicitly. The court found that the effects of pension divestment on foreign policy are minimal and do not obstruct Congress' objectives regarding Sudan policy. The court also concluded that the Illinois Sudan Act's impact on national foreign affairs outweighed the state laws in previous cases. The court found that the pension divestment amendments had a significant impact on Sudan's economy, leading multinational companies to potentially withdraw from the country. This interference with federal foreign affairs authority was deemed impermissible, unlike the pension amendments which did not pose the same pressure on firms to sever business ties with Sudan. The court found that the Illinois Sudan Act's banking amendments were unconstitutional and violated the Foreign Commerce Clause. It stated that the state's control over municipal pension funds was acting as a market regulator, not a market participant, and the market participant exception did not apply in this case. The court also ruled that the state's control over its own pension funds was not affected by the amendments. The court struck down the pension amendment in Illinois as a whole, ruling it unconstitutional. The State of Illinois appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and enacted new divestment legislation. The case was later dismissed as moot and remanded back to the district court. In a separate case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that states can restrict funds for travel to specific countries by state education employees. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that states can limit funds for travel to certain countries by state education employees for national security reasons. The court upheld a Florida statute that prohibited the use of public and non-public funds for travel to countries identified as \"State Sponsors of Terror\" by the federal government. The court distinguished previous cases by noting that there were no penalties for traveling to these countries and that the law did not conflict with federal law. The statute was found to not impose broad limits on trade or travel to these countries, minimizing interference with the Executive's foreign affairs powers. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in a case regarding trade and travel limits on countries. In Odebrecht Constr., Inc. v. Prasad, a Florida law was halted by a preliminary injunction for preventing contracts with Cuba-connected companies. The court found the law likely preempted by federal law and violating the Foreign Commerce Clause. The Florida law in Odebrecht Constr., Inc. v. Prasad was found likely preempted by federal law and violating the Foreign Commerce Clause due to its interference with the President's discretion in imposing sanctions against Cuba. The district court also determined that the law could infringe on the federal government's foreign affairs power by forcing foreign companies to choose between doing business with Florida and abiding by federal law. The Florida law in Odebrecht Constr., Inc. v. Prasad was likely preempted by federal law and violated the Foreign Commerce Clause by interfering with the President's discretion in imposing sanctions against Cuba. The law could force foreign companies to choose between doing business with Florida or abiding by federal law, potentially causing diplomatic disruption. The Eleventh Circuit has yet to issue a ruling on the appeal. Challenges to state or local sanctions on foreign affairs or Foreign Commerce Clause grounds may be possible, as Crosby did not address these constitutional arguments. Questions remain on how courts would interpret congressional silence on these measures and whether the market participant exception applies in Foreign Commerce Clause cases. The Supreme Court's ruling in Garamendi suggests that executive agreements or statements may play a role in cases where state laws intrude on federal foreign affairs power. The Supreme Court's ruling in Garamendi indicates that executive agreements or statements could preempt state action without specific agreement language. Critics of state divestment laws raise concerns about inaccurate information leading to divestment activities conflicting with U.S. foreign policy goals. The National Conference of State Legislatures has requested authoritative information for U.S. investors regarding firms with ties to terrorism. Concerns arise about the efficacy of public divestment plans in achieving foreign policy goals and potential negative impacts on investment returns and portfolio diversification. Administrative costs and limited stakeholder overlap further complicate divestment decisions. The Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 authorizes state and local governments to adopt divestment measures involving persons with investments in Sudanese energy and military sectors. The act is not preempted by federal law and was based on S. 2271. H.R. 180 and S. 831 also addressed Sudan divestment, with H.R. 180 passing the House on July 31, 2007. The Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 allows state and local governments to divest from entities with investments in Sudan's energy and military sectors. President George W. Bush signed the act, emphasizing the federal government's exclusive authority in foreign relations. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 permits state and local governments to divest from Iran. States can require divestment from businesses investing $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 allows states to divest from companies investing $20 million or more in Iran's energy sector. States must provide notice and opportunity to challenge divestment measures. If no action is taken after 90 days, divestment can occur. No federal laws preempt state actions under these provisions. Some measures include language for their expiration if Congress or the President take specified action."
