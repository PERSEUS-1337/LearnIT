School personnel must immediately remove a student from school-sponsored athletic activities if they suspect a concussion. The student cannot resume participation until they are cleared by a written release from the concussion management team. The personnel must report the suspected concussion and provide all available information about the injury to the team. The concussion management team must confirm and report the type, date, and time of a student's injury to their parents. Before resuming school-sponsored athletic activities, relevant school personnel need a written release from a healthcare professional outlining a recovery plan for the student.
