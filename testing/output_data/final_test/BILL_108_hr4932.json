    "content": "The Act titled \"Northwest Rural Employment and Forest Restoration Act of 2004\" includes definitions. The term \"Northwest Forest Plan\" refers to documents issued in 1994 for forest management in the range of the Northern Spotted Owl. \"Westside Forest land\" includes publicly owned forests in Oregon and Washington covered by the Northwest Forest Plan. The forests in the Northwest region are managed by the Bureau of Land Management or the Forest Service. They belong to the western hemlock and pacific silver fir plant associations and are located north of the mixed conifer and pine series in Southern Oregon. These forests are within various national forests and Bureau of Land Management districts. The term \"forest health\" for Westside Forest land refers to supporting native species or historic composition. \"Late-successional reserve\" is designated land under the Northwest Forest Plan. \"Old growth\" refers to mature conifer forests over 120 years old providing complex habitat. \"Young managed stands\" are tree stands with altered overstory. A young managed stand is a tree stand where the overstory has been mechanically removed and the stand has been artificially regenerated. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. The Northwest Forest Plan can be better implemented to improve protection for native forest ecosystems and wildlife, increase timber production, and benefit rural communities. Logging of old-growth forests diminishes natural heritage and habitat for rare species, causing public controversy. Thinning in younger forests can help recover habitat, reduce controversy, and stabilize wood fiber production. To improve habitat and capture future commodity production potential, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management should implement an accelerated thinning regime in young managed stands on Westside Forest lands. There are over 1,000,000 acres of young managed stands designated as late-successional reserves that need immediate or near-future thinning, along with approximately 1,000,000 acres designated as matrix that also require thinning. Thinning these millions of acres could benefit the ecosystem and wood fiber production. The timber industry in Oregon and Washington has re-tooled mills to process smaller-diameter commercial timber from young managed stands. Intensive thinning could yield twice the timber volume compared to Federal lands under the Northwest Forest Plan. Olympic and Siuslaw National Forests represent nine percent of the National Forest land base in the region. The Siuslaw National Forest in Washington is highly productive, generating 20 million board-feet annually from young managed stands. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest, once the top producer in the state, now harvests around 2 million board-feet per year due to controversy over old-growth logging. The Gifford Pinchot National Forest shifted to thinning young managed stands, now producing 18,000,000 board-feet of timber annually with minimal controversy. This approach benefits forest health, water quality, wildlife diversity, and creates jobs in rural communities. SEC. 4. INVENTORY OF WESTSIDE FOREST LAND. Each administrative unit with Westside Forest land must identify forest management allocations and old growth stands within 180 days. Existing inventories can be used with internal review. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT PRIORITIES FOR WESTSIDE FOREST LAND. Upon completion of the forest inventory, forest health projects will be prioritized to enhance Westside Forest land. The highest priority will be given to projects involving thinning treatments to enhance late-successional forest development in young managed stands in late-successional reserves. Projects in late-successional reserves must avoid impacts to unstable slopes and disturbance to aquatic systems and soils. They should follow management guidelines from the Northwest Forest Plan, with the exception that active management for forest health in young stands can occur up to 120 years of age. Thinning prescriptions for these stands should consider factors like slope aspect, soil type, and vegetation composition. The second highest priority is given to thinning projects in young managed stands designated for timber production. An administrative unit may implement silvicultural projects to test new techniques in adaptive management areas under the Northwest Forest Plan, avoiding impacts to unstable slopes, streams, and old growth forests. For matrix land with old growth stands, timber harvest is restricted except for noncommercial use or in emergencies like wildland fire-fighting. Other management activities allowed by the Northwest Forest Plan may be conducted. SEC. 6. PREPARATION OF PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTATION. Based on forest inventory, administrative units may prepare programmatic environmental documentation under NEPA to study significant environmental effects of Federal actions. This allows for elimination of repetitive discussions and focus on actual issues in subsequent levels of environmental review. The programmatic environmental document summarizes issues discussed in the broader statement and incorporates discussions by reference. SEC. 7. IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. The Act supplements the Northwest Forest Plan for projects on Westside Forest lands. $25,000,000 is authorized annually for project planning and implementation under section 5. Proceeds from certain projects are subject to specific treatment. The Act allows the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management to keep proceeds from timber sales for future projects on Westside Forest lands. It does not impact other forest receipt laws or obligations related to sales of forest products from the same lands."
