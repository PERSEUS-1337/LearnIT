Regulatory approval from the DOJ and FCC is required for the $78.7 billion deal to proceed, with a $2 billion breakup fee if not approved. The companies filed for FCC approval in June 2015. As regulatory authorities review the proposed transactions involving Charter Communications, key issues include potential conflicts of interest on Charter's board of directors and John Malone's significant stake in Charter's competitor, DIRECTV. Malone's ties to both companies could impact competition in the distribution of video programming. Regulators are concerned about potential conflicts of interest on Charter's board of directors and John Malone's stake in DIRECTV, which could impact competition in video programming distribution. Authorities may investigate the reliability of Charter's commitment to investing in Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks products and services. Charter's merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks aims to enhance national presence and reduce costs to boost investment in products and services. However, concerns arise over Charter assuming significant debt, potentially limiting its ability to improve service quality. The television industry involves various players like content owners who produce video programming. Regulatory review processes and recent industry trends are crucial for analyzing these issues. The television industry involves various players like content owners, aggregators, packagers, and distributors. Congress defines multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) such as cable operators and satellite operators. The FCC is considering expanding the definition of MVPDs to include companies distributing video programming over the Internet. Many companies fall into multiple categories in the industry. Many companies in the television industry are involved in frequent negotiations for the right to transmit programming or retransmit broadcast signals. These negotiations can be governed by federal law or market forces and reciprocal relationships. Several media companies are involved in the television industry, offering consumers the opportunity to view programs online. These companies license programming from content owners and rely on ISPs to distribute the content. The FCC refers to them as online video distributors (OVDs), falling into categories like electronic sell-through and rental OVDs owned by retailers like Apple and Amazon, offering a selection of popular movies and TV series for one-time fees. Subscription OVDs are also prevalent in the industry. Subscription OVDs charge monthly or annual fees for unlimited video programming access, competing with MVPDs' \"TV Everywhere\" services. Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Instant are major players, while other studios and networks are launching their own OVDs. Advertising-supported OVDs include ads with programming and are owned by TV networks and studios. Two major advertising-supported OVDs are Hulu and Sony Corporation's Crackle, which need the ability to negotiate for programming and interconnect with Internet service providers to deliver content. The structure of the television industry plays a crucial role in how MVPDs and OVDs compete, with the proposed Charter transactions potentially impacting competition. MVPDs and OVDs differentiate themselves by offering exclusive access to original programming or content during specific time periods. The television industry is seeing a battle between subscription OVDs and MVPDs for exclusive access to programming, particularly in-season stacking rights. Netflix demanded a discount for online rights to 21st Century Fox's Empire, leading Hulu to outbid them. Networks are favoring licensing from co-owned studios to maximize revenue from MVPDs and OVD services. The FCC has rules in place regarding this competition. The FCC has rules in place governing cable operators and networks with common ownership, prohibiting undue influence and discrimination. These rules do not apply to studios owned by cable operators or guarantee nondiscriminatory treatment to on-demand services. In 2014, the FCC proposed extending these rules to benefit certain OVDs. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler expected final rules on this proposal in the fall. Tom Wheeler expected the FCC to issue final rules on the proposal in the fall of 2015. Online video distributors (OVDs) have various options for delivering their programming to consumers, including using transit providers or content delivery networks (CDNs). Netflix and MVPDs use their own CDNs to store and deliver content. All transit providers and CDNs must interconnect with broadband access providers to reach viewers. Charges and conditions are imposed by broadband access providers for this interconnection. The charges and conditions imposed by broadband access providers for interconnection have sparked debate, especially when providers and MVPDs are the same entities. Companies may engage in \"settlement-free Internet peering\" to reciprocally provide access without fees, but disputes can arise over perceived unequal value. There is no standard method to calculate this value, with Netflix arguing against arbitrary tolls imposed by broadband providers. The FCC adopted Open Internet rules in 2015 to prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization by broadband access services. The rules also include a general conduct standard to protect consumers and online video services. Various groups have challenged the legality of these rules in court. The structure of the television industry is changing as viewers' habits evolve. The percentage of households subscribing to MVPD services has decreased, with cable and satellite industries losing subscribers to telephone companies and OVDs. Despite losing video subscribers, cable operators are gaining broadband access subscribers. The number of broadband access subscribers has steadily increased, with cable providers and telephone companies being the main providers. The majority of broadband access subscribers rely on cable providers and telephone companies, with wireline technology being the main connection method. MVPDs face challenges with rising programming costs, leading to increased prices for consumers. This has resulted in viewers either forgoing video services or downgrading to cheaper options. Several MVPDs have responded to rising programming costs by offering less expensive video packages, such as Dish Network's Sling TV for $20 per month and Verizon's base a la carte package for $55 per month. Comcast also announced a $15-per-month online streaming service. In addition, MVPDs have engaged in mergers and acquisitions, including AT&T's proposed acquisition of DIRECTV and Frontier Communications Corporation's proposed acquisition of Verizon's services in certain states. The DOJ did not challenge the Frontier-Verizon and AT&T-DIRECTV transactions. The FCC approved the AT&T-DIRECTV deal and is reviewing the Frontier-Verizon transaction. Charter's merger with Time Warner Cable and acquisition of Bright House Networks in 2015 followed previous attempts by Charter and Comcast to merge with TWC. Liberty Media purchased 27.3% of Charter's stock in 2013, predicting that online video services would disrupt traditional TV and emphasizing the need for cable operators to consolidate to compete with Netflix and other online video providers. In June 2013, Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei met with TWC CEO Glenn Britt to discuss a possible merger between TWC and Charter. In January 2014, Charter made a hostile bid for TWC. In February 2014, TWC entered into a merger agreement with Comcast. Comcast's merger agreement with TWC did not specify the fate of TWC's services agreements with Bright House Networks. In early 2014, Charter and BHN began discussing a strategic transaction. In April 2014, Comcast reached an agreement with Charter Communications Inc. for a spin-off. In April 2014, Comcast reached an agreement with Charter Communications Inc. for a spin-off, purchase, and asset exchange. The merger was terminated in April 2015 due to regulatory concerns about Comcast becoming a gatekeeper for internet-based services. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler highlighted the importance of competition and innovation in the emerging online video market. Liberty Media Corporation created Liberty Broadband in November 2014 by spinning off its voting interest in Charter. In May 2015, Charter Communications Inc. announced agreements to merge with Time Warner Cable and acquire BHN for a total of $78.7 billion. The Department of Justice has jurisdiction over mergers involving \"common carriers,\" while the FCC affirmed its authority to review licenses and authorizations in cable television operations. Charter, TWC, and BHN hold numerous licenses and authorizations. The DOJ is reviewing the potential anticompetitive impact of the proposed Charter-TWC-BHN merger under the Clayton Antitrust Act. The parties must wait for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period to pass before closing the deal. They need to submit documents analyzing the transaction's impact on competition and markets to the government. The DOJ is reviewing the Charter-TWC-BHN merger for anticompetitive impact under the Clayton Antitrust Act. Highly confidential internal documents are analyzed, and the DOJ may share information with authorized committees but not the public. The parties may consent to sharing information with the FCC and state attorneys general. The DOJ must prove potential anticompetitive effects and can allow the deal, negotiate consent agreements, or seek to stop the transaction. The FCC has jurisdiction over transactions involving transfers of control of electromagnetic spectrum licenses, reviewing mergers involving various operations. It must affirm that the public convenience and necessity will not be adversely affected before approving a transaction. The FCC also reviews applications for wireless licenses, including those for broadband, satellite, broadcast television, and broadcast radio services. Section 310(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 prohibits the transfer of broadcast station licenses without FCC approval. The FCC reviews transactions involving transfers of control of licenses to ensure they serve the public interest. Complex cases are reviewed by FCC commissioners, with opportunities for Congress to provide input. In a specific case involving Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal, 51 Representatives and 15 Senators filed comments, and the FCC considered commitments made by the applicants in a congressional hearing. Additionally, an agreement between the applicants and Representative Bobby Rush led to commitments, including Comcast agreeing to carry at least 10 new independently owned channels. Comcast agreed to carry at least 10 new independently owned cable networks for eight years as a condition of acquisition approval by the FCC. The FCC's merger review process involves public participation through comments and petitions, with the agency deciding whether a deal may proceed. Interested parties can voice concerns or support through official petitions or informal comments, with the FCC addressing these in its final decision. The FCC may impose deadlines for public comments on mergers, with a self-imposed 180-day timeline for review. The FCC's merger review process involves public participation through comments and petitions, with the agency deciding whether a deal may proceed. The FCC may impose deadlines for public comments on the merger, but its 180-day period for reaching a decision is not legally binding. The parties must demonstrate that the proposed transactions would be in the public interest based on evidence. The FCC's review involves balancing potential harms against benefits, such as accelerating private-sector deployment of services and ensuring a diversity of information sources. The FCC's merger review process involves public participation through comments and petitions, with the agency deciding whether a deal may proceed. The FCC considers whether a transaction will enhance competition and looks at potential and future competition. Benefits of a merger must be specific, verifiable, and flow to consumers. FCC staff makes recommendations to commissioners, who vote on approving the transaction with or without conditions. If a hearing is ordered, parties can participate fully, including seeking access to confidential information and filing appeals.

If a hearing is ordered, parties can participate fully, including seeking access to confidential information and filing appeals. In the proposed Charter-TWC-BHN transaction, Liberty Broadband would have the right to vote up to 25.01% of the stock of Charter after the merger. Liberty Broadband may nominate up to three directors and Advance/Newhouse may nominate up to two directors to Charter's 13-member board. If Advance/Newhouse reduces its ownership stake in Charter, Liberty Broadband's stake cannot exceed 35%. The FCC investigates whether MVPDs have \"attributable interests\" in cable or broadcast networks to assess control over other firms through arrangements short of outright ownership. The FCC reviews mergers to determine control between firms and individuals with significant stock ownership. Conditions are imposed to strengthen program access and carriage rules in merger transactions involving MVPDs, programming networks, and studios. For example, in past reviews, the FCC attributed investments in cable programming networks to DIRECTV and imposed conditions on Comcast's merger with NBC Universal. When reviewing mergers, the FCC considers control between firms and individuals with significant stock ownership. Conditions are imposed to strengthen program access and carriage rules in merger transactions involving MVPDs, programming networks, and studios. In the case of Comcast's merger with NBC Universal, the FCC extended program access conditions to OVDs. Potential harms to competition in the television industry related to John Malone's ownership interests in Charter, television networks, and studios may merit analysis in the regulatory review process. The FCC reviews mergers considering control and significant stock ownership. Conditions are imposed to strengthen program access and carriage rules in merger transactions involving MVPDs, programming networks, and studios. John Malone's ownership interests in Charter, television networks, and studios may merit analysis in the regulatory review process. Liberty Media, founded in 1991, has interests in television and movie studios, cable networks, and MVPDs. Proposed transactions could increase Malone's control over the broadband access market and video distribution. John Malone's ownership interests in Charter, television networks, and studios could increase his control over the broadband access and video services market. Malone holds significant voting stakes in Starz, Discovery, and Lionsgate. His interests are considered attributable under FCC rules due to his positions on the companies' boards. The DOJ and FCC may request Charter to disclose all programming networks and agreements as part of their review process. The agencies may request Charter to submit agreements between John Malone, Liberty, or affiliates filed with the SEC to assess program access rules. They could extend conditions to studios licensing content online, ask for a list of studios where Malone has interests, and explore his incentives. In December 2006, News Corp. and Liberty Media exchanged stakes in DIRECTV and regional sports networks. The FCC approved the transfer of control to Liberty Media in 2008, with conditions to maintain competition. Liberty Media had to sever connections between DIRECTV and its cable systems in Puerto Rico. In 2010, Malone reduced his voting interest in DIRECTV from 24.3% to 3% and agreed not to have an attributable interest in the company. Despite this agreement, by 2013, Malone held a 5% stake in DIRECTV, making him the largest individual investor. The FCC approved Liberty Media's acquisition of DIRECTV with conditions to maintain competition. The FCC may review cases with extensive combined interests that raise issues of significant influence, even if they don't fall under specific attribution rules. With AT&T's merger with DIRECTV, regulatory agencies could assess John Malone's influence over AT&T and the potential impact on competition among MVPDs. Despite not having de facto control, Malone's influence over the merged Charter and AT&T-DIRECTV could still be significant. The FCC did not request information on Malone's influence in their review of the merger. According to Malone, ownership consolidation is not necessary to benefit from scale. The FCC could examine proposed transactions among cable operators like TWC and BHN to assess potential competition reduction through enhanced cooperation. Joint ventures, such as iN Demand LLC, involving TWC, BHN, Comcast, and Cox Communications, enable access to video-on-demand services and negotiations with studios for content distribution. This cooperation allows cable operators to compete directly with digital platforms like Apple's iTunes and Amazon Prime Instant. Comcast, TWC, BHN, and Cox Communications are involved in iN Demand, a joint venture that produces promotional programming and operates content delivery networks. Charter's potential acquisition of TWC's and BHN's interests in iN Demand could enhance coordination among cable operators for on-demand services. Additionally, TWC, Comcast, and Cox own National Cable Communications, which sells advertising time for TV service providers. Charter's involvement in these transactions could increase coordination among MVPDs for advertising sales. The cable operators have marketing agreements with Verizon Wireless to sell bundled offerings including Verizon Wireless services and their own services. The proposed transaction could increase Charter's coordination with Verizon, potentially leading to benefits for investment in new services and infrastructure. The FCC would need to verify these claims to mitigate potential harms of the transaction. The FCC would need to investigate whether TWC and BHN were planning to make investments independently, absent the proposed transaction. Charter's reliance on secured debt to fund the transactions could limit its ability to improve products and services. Charter may need to reduce spending on investments or sell off assets if costs are higher or revenues are lower than anticipated. Charter pledged to maintain a settlement-free interconnection policy until December 31, 2018. Charter will interconnect its network with OVDs at no charge under certain conditions, including delivering a minimum amount of traffic. Both parties agree to maintain capacity to meet demand, with the option to increase capacity for free. Netflix supports the proposal if the FCC includes Charter's new interconnection policy. The FCC is concerned about Charter's debt affecting its ability to provide sufficient capacity for broadband subscribers. Charter commits to following the FCC's Open Internet Order and additional constraints for three years. The merged firm resulting from the Charter transaction will adhere to the FCC's Open Internet Order for three years, committing to not block or throttle Internet traffic, engage in paid prioritization, or implement data usage caps. Cable operators, DBS operators, and telcos offer video and broadband services, with cable operators and telcos being the primary providers of broadband access. Cable operators generally operate in non-overlapping geographic regions, while DBS operators are available nationwide. The national market shares of MVPDs and broadband access providers indicate their bargaining power in negotiations with studios and networks for programming delivery. Table A-1 and Table A-2 show MVPDs' market shares before and after potential transactions. After potential transactions, national market shares of wireline broadband access service providers were analyzed using subscriber numbers from March 30, 2015. The FCC adopted a benchmark of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream for \"advanced telecommunications capability\" in 2015. The FCC's Media Bureau evaluated abandoned transactions involving Comcast, TWC, and Charter. The FCC's Media Bureau analyzed broadband subscriber data from Comcast, TWC, and Charter, considering it confidential and limiting public access. Charter claimed post-merger it would serve less than 30% of US customers meeting FCC's 25 Mbps/3 Mbps benchmark."
