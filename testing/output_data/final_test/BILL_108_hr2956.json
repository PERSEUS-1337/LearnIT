Section 491 (20 U.S.C. 1098) is amended to include a special study on simplifying the need analysis and application process for Title IV aid.

The special study on simplifying the need analysis and application process for Title IV aid will assess the impact on program intent, costs, integrity, delivery, and distribution of awards. It will also evaluate if reducing the number of data elements used to calculate expected family contribution can be done without adverse effects, and if the procedures for determining data elements are efficient and fair.

The Secretary of Education will consult with congressional committees and initiate a redesign of the application form within one year of the report submission. The Secretary of Education will redesign the free Federal form, including testing simplified versions, and report progress to congressional committees within one year of receiving the Advisory Committee report.
