The National Academy of Sciences emphasizes the careful and appropriate use of assessments, considering their intended purpose and data use. The National Academy of Sciences highlights the importance of well-trained early childhood educators in selecting and using assessments for young children. The emotional and social development of children is crucial for school readiness. The Head Start Act mandates assessments of children three times a year against performance standards. The proposed Head Start National Reporting System on Child Outcomes assessment does not cover all necessary skills and competencies. The National Academy of Sciences emphasizes the need for well-trained early childhood educators to use assessments for young children. The proposed Head Start National Reporting System on Child Outcomes assessment lacks input from various groups, including early childhood experts, educators, administrators, and Congress. Delayed implementation of assessment procedures for the Head Start National Reporting System on Child Outcomes is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must certify to Congress that oversight hearings and public forums have been completed before implementing the Head Start National Reporting System on Child Outcomes. The Secretary submitted a study on early childhood assessments to Congress, focusing on improving accountability, instruction, and service delivery. The study will be prepared by the National Academy of Sciences using experts in early childhood assessment, child development, and education. Funds are available to develop and implement new Head Start assessments and provide necessary technical assistance and professional development. The Secretary will ensure public forum participation for new assessments, including experts, educators, and family members. The study on early childhood assessments will focus on predictive skills, instrument development, and validation for preschoolers. The study will focus on developing reliable assessments for preschoolers in Head Start programs to evaluate literacy, language, math, emotional, social, health, and physical skills. It will also explore creating benchmarks and improving program effectiveness through early childhood assessments. Additionally, the study will assess the resources needed for implementing new assessments and their coordination with current processes to enhance program accountability and instruction. The study will focus on developing reliable assessments for preschoolers in Head Start programs to evaluate various skills. This includes exploring professional development needs, employing sampling techniques, observational assessments, and ensuring assessments accommodate diversity."
