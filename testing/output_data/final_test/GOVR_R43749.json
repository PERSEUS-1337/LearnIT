    "content": "Domestic drug enforcement involves controlled substances prohibited for recreational use but allowed for medical purposes. The federal government regulates these substances through the Attorney General. Congress recognized the medical benefits of certain drugs but also acknowledged the negative impact of illegal actions involving them in the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act emphasizes federal control of drug trafficking within states to effectively control interstate drug trafficking. The federal government focuses on domestic drug enforcement to restrict illicit drug availability, making it harder and riskier to obtain. Federal law enforcement agencies work with state and local agencies to dismantle criminal organizations involved in domestic drug production and distribution. The report reviews federal domestic drug enforcement, focusing on targeting large drug trafficking organizations. It addresses various issues such as state marijuana legalization, prescription drug abuse, and evolving synthetic drugs. The history and background of drug enforcement in the United States, legislative changes, and U.S. drug policy are also discussed. The report outlines the historic development of federal drug enforcement in the United States, highlighting the lack of government regulation in the 19th century for drugs like cocaine and opium. By the end of the century, abuse of these drugs became a significant social issue, leading to growing public concern. In the 19th century, the lack of government regulation for drugs like cocaine and opium led to significant social issues and growing public concern. Federal control over drugs began in the early 20th century with the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, which required registration, taxation, and record-keeping for importers, manufacturers, and distributors of these drugs. Practitioners were allowed to prescribe opiates and cocaine, but the law was open to interpretation by the Treasury. The Harrison Act led to restrictions on prescribing opiates and cocaine, causing physicians to stop prescribing these drugs. Enforcement agents, known as \"narcs,\" closed down narcotic clinics and sent violators to federal penitentiaries. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics was established to handle narcotic enforcement, closely tied to Prohibition enforcement. Marijuana emerged as a new recreational drug during this time. During Prohibition, marijuana became unpopular with law enforcement, leading to federal legislation to control its growth and use. Commissioner Anslinger claimed marijuana incited violent behavior, leading to the unofficial ban under the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 imposed strict regulations on marijuana sales, requiring a high-cost transfer tax stamp that was rarely issued. Enforcement of drug laws was mainly done by local police, with limited federal assistance from the FBN. Due to budget constraints during the Great Depression, the FBN's resources were reduced, leading to a focus on public awareness campaigns about the dangers of narcotics, particularly marijuana. Commissioner Anslinger lobbied for federal control of marijuana and uniform narcotic laws through personal appeals and editorial support. In the 1930s, there were personal appeals for anti-marijuana propaganda and legislative support. Congress passed drug control legislation like the Boggs Act in 1951 and the Narcotic Control Act in 1956, increasing penalties for drug offenses. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics enforced federal laws and supported local enforcement until the 1960s. Support for severe punishment for drug offenses decreased, with organizations speaking out against strict penalties. In the 1960s, support for a medical approach to drug abuse grew, leading to the acceptance of methadone maintenance for heroin dependence. The 1963 Presidential Commission recommended less strict punishment for drug offenses and the dismantling of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Congress created the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control and supported rehabilitation through treatment for drug addicted federal detainees. In the 1960s, there was a shift towards a medical approach to drug abuse, with a focus on rehabilitation through treatment for drug-addicted individuals. The 1963 Presidential Commission recommended increasing federal drug enforcement personnel and transferring drug enforcement functions to the Department of Justice. Congress later changed the constitutional basis for drug control to regulate interstate commerce, leading to the merger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control in 1968. In 1968, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics merged with the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control and was transferred to the Department of Justice. President Nixon declared a war on drugs in response to rising drug abuse, focusing on law enforcement and international efforts to curb drug production. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 placed control of drugs under federal jurisdiction, replacing previous laws with a comprehensive statute. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 replaced previous federal drug laws with a single comprehensive statute, establishing the framework for regulating controlled substances based on their danger, potential for abuse, and medical use. This law led to the creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1973 to enforce the CSA. The committee and President Nixon emphasized the DEA's role in coordinating counterdrug operations with the FBI and other DOJ agencies. The reorganization plan aims to end interagency rivalries, involve the FBI in drug enforcement, coordinate efforts with state and local authorities, and centralize federal drug law enforcement under a single Administrator. The reorganization plan aims to centralize federal drug law enforcement under a single Administrator in the DEA, maximizing coordination and accountability. The DEA started in 1973 with 1,470 special agents and a $74.9 million budget, growing to 2,135 agents and a $140.9 million budget by 1975. The DEA grew to 2,135 special agents with a budget of $140.9 million in FY1975. By FY2014, it had over 9,000 employees and a budget of approximately $2.0 billion. The rising popularity of cocaine and crack in the 1980s led to increased public concern about drug abuse. President Reagan emphasized the role of criminal justice agencies in combating drug abuse. President Reagan highlighted the federal government's efforts to combat drug abuse in 1986, reporting significant progress. Thirty-seven Federal agencies collaborated in a national effort, with drug law enforcement spending set to triple from 1981 levels. Seizures of illegal drugs increased, leading to shortages of marijuana. Over 10,000 drug criminals were convicted in the past year, with nearly $250 million in assets seized by the DEA. Federal drug convictions more than doubled from 1980 to 1986, reaching 12,285 individuals. The number of individuals convicted of drug offenses doubled from 5,244 in 1980 to 12,285 in 1986, accounting for 51% of the total increase in federal convictions. Most drug offenders were convicted of trafficking, importation, and distribution, with a sharp increase in simple possession convictions from 302 in 1980 to 1,353 in 1982. This rise was attributed to increased federal attention to drug cases and resources for prosecutions. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 enhanced penalties for drug violations and established criminal forfeiture provisions. It allowed the Attorney General to transfer forfeited property to law enforcement agencies and placed uncontrolled substances under temporary control to combat new synthetic drugs. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was a significant development in combating the illicit synthetic drug trade, amending the Controlled Substances Act to treat controlled substance analogues as Schedule I substances and establishing criminal penalties for possession. It also created mandatory minimum penalties for federal drug trafficking offenses, including a disparity in sentencing between powder cocaine and crack cocaine, which was later reduced through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 aimed to reduce drug supply and demand by establishing the Office of National Drug Control Policy and creating new criminal penalties for Controlled Substances Act violations. The Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act was passed to restrict access to chemicals used in illicit drug manufacturing. The CDTA and its amendments allow the DEA to control 40 chemicals known as \"listed chemicals\" for illicit drug manufacturing. Synthetic drugs have been a major focus of federal drug legislation in the last 20 years, with different synthetic compounds gaining popularity among users. Methamphetamine emerged in the late 1960s and was classified as a Schedule II drug in 1970. Congress and the Administration have responded to the proliferation of synthetic drugs, prescription drug abuse, heroin abuse, and state marijuana legalization. In the 1990s, methamphetamine abuse rose as cocaine's popularity waned. Methamphetamine was commonly produced with pseudoephedrine, and the Clinton Administration implemented strategies to reduce trafficking and production. The DEA targeted methamphetamine operations in the Southwest, where it first gained popularity in the United States. Since the mid-1990s, the DEA has assisted in methamphetamine lab cleanups and training for law enforcement. Congress has enacted legislation to address methamphetamine abuse, including enhanced penalties for manufacturing and trafficking (Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996) and stricter regulation of precursor chemicals (Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act). MDMA, also known as ecstasy, gained popularity in the 1980s and was placed on Schedule I of the CSA by the DEA. MDMA, also known as ecstasy, gained popularity in the 1980s and was placed on Schedule I of the CSA by the DEA. It resurfaced as \"molly\" in the 1990s and the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act of 2003 targeted producers of raves where MDMA was used. The act shifted focus to punishing those who knowingly maintain drug-involved premises and authorized appropriations for DEA education on club drugs. Temporary scheduling of synthetic drugs has been crucial in combating new substances. Congress granted the Attorney General the power to temporarily place substances on Schedule I of the CSA to prevent public safety hazards, particularly concerning pharmaceutically created and modified drugs. The DEA considers abuse history, patterns, and public health risks when determining imminent hazards. Substances can stay on Schedule I for up to three years before permanent scheduling or removal, with the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 extending the DEA's temporary scheduling authority. The DEA has used temporary scheduling authority to place synthetic drugs on Schedule I of the CSA, with Congress also taking action in response to hazardous synthetic drugs. This includes emergency scheduling of substances like GHB due to public safety concerns. Calls have been made for legislative scheduling of specific synthetic cannabinoids and stimulants. In response to the rise in opioid abuse, Congress passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 to permanently schedule selected synthetic stimulants. The number of medical emergencies related to nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased by 132% from 2004-2011, while past-year heroin users increased by approximately 300% between 2004 and 2013. Some experts have linked the crackdown on prescription drug abuse to the increase in heroin use. The rise in heroin abuse is a growing concern due to its affordability and accessibility as an alternative to prescription drugs. Federal law enforcement is focusing on diversion control to prevent unlawful access to prescription drugs. The DEA's Office of Diversion Control aims to detect and investigate the diversion of controlled pharmaceuticals while ensuring a legitimate supply for medical needs. The DEA has increased its Tactical Diversion Squads to prevent prescription drug abuse. Enforcement actions target doctors and traffickers, not individual users. Marijuana remains a Schedule I controlled substance federally, but states have implemented laws allowing its use. Some states have relaxed marijuana laws for medical and recreational use, leading to questions about federal restrictions. Federal law enforcement focuses on criminal networks rather than individual users, with a stance consistent with this approach. Deputy Attorney General Cole emphasized prioritizing resources on significant threats while acknowledging marijuana's illegal status under federal law. The United States has shifted its drug policy towards prevention, treatment, and enforcement, with a focus on reducing drug use and its consequences. However, federal drug control funding mostly goes to law enforcement, with approximately 60% dedicated to supply reduction and 37% towards domestic law enforcement. These figures have remained relatively unchanged since FY2005. Federal agencies enforce drug laws under the CSA, while states have their own frameworks. The majority of drug crimes are handled at the state level, with federal agencies assisting in arrests. In 2012, the DEA arrested 30,476 suspects for federal drug offenses, while state and local law enforcement arrested 1,328,457 suspects. Other federal agencies also participate in drug investigations and arrests. The DEA is the primary agency responsible for enforcing controlled substance laws in the United States. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies often work together in drug operations, as mandated by Congress. The DEA has 222 offices nationwide. The DEA has 222 offices nationwide that partner with state and local authorities and other federal agencies to investigate and prosecute drug offenses. In 2013, the DEA managed 259 state and local task forces, staffed by over 2,190 DEA special agents and 2,556 state and local officers, to increase investigative possibilities in drug enforcement efforts. The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Program was established in 1982 to target major drug trafficking organizations by focusing on financial investigations, asset forfeiture, and aligning federal resources with drug threats. Participating agencies include the DEA, FBI, ATF, USMS, IRS, U.S. Coast Guard, and others. The OCDETF program, established in 1982, targets major drug trafficking organizations through financial investigations and asset forfeiture. It involves various federal agencies, including the DEA, FBI, and ATF, as well as state and local agencies. In FY2013, OCDETF cases accounted for 21% of all criminal drug cases filed by U.S. Attorneys. The program focuses on organizations identified on the CPOT list, initiating 1,074 investigations in FY2013. Between 2003 and 2013, OCDETF participants dismantled 75 CPOT organizations and disrupted 2,918 CPOT-linked organizations, with federal support provided to state and local authorities for drug enforcement efforts. The HIDTA program provides financial and personnel support to assist state and local authorities in drug enforcement. It aims to reduce drug production and trafficking by promoting coordination and information sharing between law enforcement agencies at various levels. The HIDTA program, administered by ONDCP, aims to reduce illegal drug supplies in the US. There are 28 designated HIDTAs in the country. Federal agencies like the DEA conduct drug investigations abroad, with 86 offices in 67 countries. The Department of Defense (DOD) assists with international counterdrug support by detecting and monitoring illegal drug movement towards the United States. International law enforcement cooperation is guided by international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. The Attorney General has control over stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens based on treaty obligations. Drug-related intelligence gathering and analysis is crucial for federal drug enforcement, supporting tactical operations, investigations against criminal organizations, and informing policy decisions. Multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. military, and state and local law enforcement contribute to drug intelligence. Drug interdiction and domestic drug enforcement are interconnected methods of reducing drug supply. The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) and the DEA's Special Operations Division (SOD) are key players in drug interdiction and intelligence gathering. EPIC, led by the DEA, involves 15 federal agencies and supports drug interdiction, trafficking investigations, and efforts against smuggling, terrorism, and other crimes. SOD, operating at a classified level, coordinates with various agencies to gather, analyze, and distribute intelligence for law enforcement operations. The Special Operations Division (SOD) operates at a classified level and coordinates special operations targeting trafficker communications, provides funding and technical assistance to DEA divisions, disseminates investigative data to law enforcement partners, supports systems like DARTS and DICE, addresses financial crime and narcoterrorism issues, and assists the GangTECC in disrupting gang threats. The DEA has a long history of using drug intelligence to combat gang threats. The Intelligence Program has grown significantly since its establishment in 1973, now employing over 700 intelligence analysts. Trends in federal drug enforcement reflect changes in drug problems and enforcement priorities. The number of drug cases filed by U.S. Attorneys has steadily increased, indicating a focus on drug crimes. This section provides an overview of federal enforcement trends over the last few decades. The DEA is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing federal drug laws, with most arrests being for trafficking offenses. Over the last 25 years, the majority of DEA arrests have been for cocaine-related offenses, peaking in the late 1990s. Arrests for other drugs have declined since then, except for pharmaceutical narcotics and heroin/opiate-related arrests. In FY1989, DEA arrests totaled 25,986, increasing to 40,278 in FY1999, then declining to 29,212 in FY2003. Marijuana seizures have consistently been the majority of drugs seized by federal agencies over the last 25 years, comprising 95% of total seizures in FY2013. Heroin seizures at the southwest border have increased by 320% from 2008 to 2013. The DEA seized 4,518 and 4,836 kilograms of heroin in FY2012 and FY2013, respectively, attributing the increase in availability to Mexican heroin production. Heroin trafficking organizations are relocating to areas with rising non-medical use of prescription drugs. Drug cases are the second highest category of criminal cases filed by U.S. Attorneys. In FY2013, drug offenses were the highest or second highest category of criminal cases filed by U.S. Attorneys, with 31.6% of federal criminal appeals related to drugs. The number of federal prosecutions for drug offenses peaked in the early 2000s and has since declined, with 24,307 convictions recorded in FY2013. U.S. Attorneys primarily target drug dealing over drug possession, with only 1.4% of drug cases filed in FY2013 related to possession. Federal drug enforcement policies continue to spark debates among policymakers and law enforcement agencies. Federal drug enforcement policies in the U.S. have been a topic of debate among policymakers, law enforcement officials, scholars, and the public. The focus of federal law enforcement has been on disrupting and dismantling organizations involved in illicit drug trafficking rather than targeting individuals for drug possession. The evolving drug trends will continue to pose challenges for lawmakers, including the social impact of drug criminalization and federal involvement in domestic drug control. Congress may address current drug use in the future. In the future, Congress may address current drug use, including prescription drug and heroin abuse, synthetic drugs, and state legalization of marijuana, through changes to the Controlled Substances Act or other legislative means."
