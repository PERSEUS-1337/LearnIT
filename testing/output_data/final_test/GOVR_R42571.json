    "content": "Since 2008, the residential mortgage market has faced high default rates and tighter standards. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, have received financial support and owned a majority of new mortgage-backed securities in 2012. Some concerns have been raised about the solvency of the mortgage insurance program. The residential mortgage market has faced challenges since 2008, with concerns about the solvency of the mortgage insurance program. Changes in the market may be driven by legislation, regulations, and demographics, impacting homeowners, industries, and the financial system. In the 112th Congress, over 45 bills were introduced to change the residential mortgage market, potentially affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These bills aimed to make various changes to the GSEs, such as winding them down, adjusting executive compensation, and reducing their role in supplying mortgage funds. Legislation also targeted refinancing, foreclosures, fraud prevention, and mortgage servicing, including H.R. 940. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to change the residential mortgage market, affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. H.R. 940 introduced covered bonds as a competitive securitization option. Other bills proposed a temporary government agency to replace GSEs with a full faith and credit guarantee for mortgage-backed securities. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed reducing the tax deduction for mortgage interest paid on principal and second residences to increase tax revenues. Legislation has changed the maximum unpaid balance on mortgages purchased or guaranteed by government entities multiple times since 2008, affecting the supply of low-risk mortgage funding and interest rates. Bills introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to change the residential mortgage market, including introducing covered bonds and proposing a temporary government agency to replace GSEs. In the 112th Congress, proposed bills aimed to change the loan limit and reform the housing finance system, including FHA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Obama Administration suggested reducing government support for mortgage markets, potentially leading investors to switch to safer investments. New regulations are being developed that will impact the mortgage market, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires regulations on qualified residential mortgages and qualified mortgages, impacting risk retention, underwriting, and selling mortgages as MBSs. The CFPB published the QM rule in 2013 and is developing procedures for reviewing lenders' mortgage servicing. Other regulators are proposing regulations on capital reserves for insured depositories and using covered bonds for financing mortgages. House and Senate committees are considering additional government interventions in the housing finance system to support the sector amidst changing demographics and demand for housing. Factors such as a maturing population, immigration, and tighter mortgage qualification standards could impact homeownership rates. The ability and desire to own a home may have declined for those who have lost their homes to foreclosure, potentially changing historical patterns. The housing market is influenced by various factors such as the economy, interest rates, inflation, and expectations for the future. Changes in these factors could impact homeownership rates, with some households potentially deferring home purchases due to economic uncertainties. The net result on homeownership rates is uncertain, as they could either rise or fall. A home purchase involves consumption, investment, and various risks, making it a complex decision for households. Financing a home purchase with a mortgage adds financial complexity and risk but allows for better matching of housing services with capital payment flow. Homes are typically financed with 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, often paid off in 7-10 years through refinancing or selling. Demand for owner-occupied homes and mortgages depends on factors like home prices, credit history, rental costs, interest rates, and household income. Expected changes in house prices, income, household size, and government incentives also play a role. Supply of owner-occupied homes and mortgages is influenced by various factors as well. The supply of owner-occupied homes and mortgages depends on factors like housing prices, land costs, interest rates, and alternative investments. Mortgages are characterized by interest rates, term, payment allocation, frequency, and risks such as credit, prepayment, and interest rate risks. Credit risk is the likelihood of borrower default, impacting both borrower and lender. Federal programs and insurance options reduce costs and limit losses for lenders in the event of foreclosure. Prepayment risk arises when borrowers pay off mortgages early, leading to unanticipated prepayments. Lenders must anticipate prepayment speeds and adjust interest rates accordingly, but long-term interest rate forecasts are often inaccurate. When prepayment rates exceed expectations, lenders must find lower-yield replacement investments. When prepayment rates are higher than expected, lenders must find lower-yield replacement investments. Interest rate risk is incurred by lenders who finance long-term fixed-rate mortgages by borrowing at fluctuating short-term rates. The difference between short-term rates and mortgage rates covers costs and provides profits, but an increase in short-term rates can lead to losses. Home mortgages have evolved significantly since the National Housing Act of 1934. Since the National Housing Act of 1934, home mortgages have undergone significant changes. Initially, there were strict restrictions on mortgage lending, such as limits on distance from the lender's office. Today, homeowners apply to mortgage originators who review and approve applications based on various criteria, including government and quasi-government agency standards. Securitization involves selling mortgages to securitizers who pool them into MBSs for institutional investors. This process has benefits like making financial markets more efficient and allowing specialization in different aspects of mortgage management. Standardized securities are easier to trade, attracting institutional investors. Prior to the financial crisis, mortgage securitization was done by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, and private-label securitizers. Ginnie Mae authorizes and guarantees mortgages already backed by the federal government. Conflicts of interest can arise among originators, investors, and servicers during securitization. Renegotiating mortgage terms can be complex due to contracts between servicers, securitizers, and investors. Active management in renegotiation may result in the loss of favorable tax treatment for MBSs. Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are involved in mortgage securitization. Ginnie Mae guarantees mortgages backed by the government, while Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase and securitize mortgages meeting their standards. Private label securities have no guarantees. Investment banks securitize mortgages that exceed the conforming loan limit. Private label securities (PLS) are securitized by investment banks for mortgages that exceed conforming loan limits or do not meet credit requirements of Ginnie Mae or the GSEs. PLS activity has decreased significantly since the 2008 financial crisis, with little to no new PLS issuances. The graph in Figure 1 illustrates the increasing role of MBSs and the GSEs in financing outstanding mortgages since 1951, with Fannie Mae initially dominating before private-label securitizations began in 1984. Despite the decline in PLS volume, there are still PLS outstanding, while government involvement in the mortgage market is on the rise. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in federal conservatorship, own or guarantee about half of all mortgages outstanding. The federal government has provided over $187 billion in support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the Fed and Treasury purchasing more than $1,347 billion of MBSs. The Fed is using mortgage repayments to buy additional MBSs, while the Treasury has sold $225 billion of MBSs purchased in 2008 and 2009. Congressional committees have held hearings on the government's intervention in the mortgage market and conservatorship of the GSEs. The House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committees have examined the financial risks of the Federal Housing Administration's single-family insurance program. Factors like age distribution, interest rates, and rents impact housing and mortgage supply and demand. The evolution of house prices and homeownership rates from 1900 to 1950 is analyzed. The homeownership rate has fluctuated over the years, reaching a record high of 69.2% in 2004. The decision to own or rent a home involves comparing costs like interest, taxes, and maintenance with the benefits of homeownership. Household adjustments to housing market changes are slow due to transaction costs. Prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, rising house prices led to capital gains for homeowners, reducing the cost of homeownership. However, the expectation that national house prices could not decline resulted in overestimations of profitability. Real home prices show numerous declines, indicating periods when house prices did not keep up with inflation, challenging the belief that housing always protects against inflation. Between 1890 and 1945, there were 21 years of nominal house price declines, with five more years between 1945 and 1960. The next decline was in 1990, followed by a consistent decrease from 2006 to 2011, with some fluctuations in 2012. Easing credit standards can drive up demand for homeownership and prices, making it harder for first-time buyers to enter the market. Rising house prices can hinder first-time homebuyers from saving enough for a downpayment and keeping up with mortgage payments. Lenders benefit from higher home values as it reduces the risk of losses in foreclosure. Homeowners can borrow against increased equity through second mortgages. Equity can be accessed through second mortgages and home equity lines of credit, allowing for increased consumer spending. Mortgages have evolved since the 1930s with long terms, fixed interest rates, and government insurance for lenders. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the most popular, but borrowers have alternatives like adjustable-rate mortgages permitted by the Garn-St. Germain Act in 1982. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) were permitted by the Garn-St. Germain Act in 1982, offering varying interest rates and limits on rate changes. ARMs are less common, with only 4% of new home mortgages in 2012 having adjustable rates. Consumers are hesitant due to the risk of ARM rates exceeding fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) rates in the future. Treasury bonds, short-term interest rates not significantly lower than long-term rates, making ARMs less attractive. Despite greater complexity, many homeowners prefer simpler FRMs. ARMs can be advantageous when interest rates are substantially lower than FRMs, especially in times of uncertainty. Personal circumstances, like planning to move, can also make ARMs appealing. Delinquency rates on ARMs in the US have been higher than on similar FRMs. Shared-appreciation mortgages (SAMs) offer reduced interest rates in exchange for a share of the house value appreciation. Congressional interest is growing in promoting SAMs for underwater homeowners. However, the unclear profit sharing and potential lack of homeowner incentive to maintain the property are concerns. SAMs provide lenders with inflation hedging and lower borrower interest rates, but they are not widely popular and are not purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Approval from FHFA would be needed for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to buy SAMs. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would need FHFA approval for new program to buy SAMs. Census Bureau does not track SAM statistics. Mortgage funding has seen changes over 100 years due to various factors. Some lenders follow the originate-to-distribute model. Mortgage securitization dates back to 1870, with limited data before 1951. Financial markets evolve, making long-term comparisons challenging. From 1900 to 1952, institutions increased direct funding of mortgages. The OTD model evolved over time, with mortgage companies selling loans to insurance companies in the 1950s. Loan terms varied from 1.8 to 22.1 years during this period. In the 1970s, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) replaced whole loans sold to insurance companies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became dominant in the 1980s. The private-label securities market grew in the 2000s, shifting from the agency market. The OTD model remained consistent since the 1950s, with lenders selling loans to other institutions. Federal Reserve data tracks direct and indirect sources of funds, including securitization. The direct funding of mortgages in the US increased significantly from $52 billion in 1951 to $9.9 trillion in 2012. Commercial banks and savings institutions were major sources of funds, with commercial banks increasing their mortgage holdings from $10 billion to $2.2 trillion during the same period. Insured depositories provided over 50% of direct funding between 1951 and 1985, reaching a peak of 75% in 1973. Other sources such as households, nonprofits, and life insurance companies also contributed to funding, albeit to a lesser extent. The savings and loan crisis occurred in 1984-1986, with failed savings and loans being resolved until the mid-1990s. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) provided 5% or more of direct funding in 1970, with their market share growing until recently. Between 2005 and 2009, the GSEs' market share fell below 50%, but has been greater than 50% since 2009. Private-label securitizations have been significant since the mid-1990s, but smaller than the GSEs and government agencies. Commercial banks supplied 10%-20% of direct funding over the 1951-2012 period. The market for mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) has seen significant growth over the years, with the current dollar value of securities increasing from $2.3 billion in 1951 to $7.5 trillion in 2012. While U.S.-chartered commercial banks' market share declined from 77% to 20%, their holdings grew from $1.8 billion to $1.5 trillion. In 1951, major holders were state and local governments (19%) and commercial banks (77%), but by 2012, foreigners, the Fed, commercial banks, and mutual funds were major holders. The \"other\" category also saw significant growth from 4% in 1951 to 39% in 2012. Since 1951, the market for mortgage-backed securities has grown significantly, reaching $7.5 trillion in 2012. U.S.-chartered commercial banks' market share declined from 77% to 20%, but their holdings increased to $1.5 trillion. Different entities have been major holders over the years, with commercial banks consistently important. GSEs were major holders from 1996-2009, state and local governments until 1991, and savings institutions from 1957-1991. The sources of funding mortgages have fluctuated, and loan securitization has replaced deposits for various types of loans since Ginnie Mae issued the first residential MBSs in 1970. Funding sources for mortgages would likely continue to change in the future. Securitization, through asset-backed securities (ABSs), allows lenders to fund loans by selling ABSs, leading to more available credit and lower interest rates for consumers. However, there are concerns about aligned incentives and the costs of securitization. The \"originate-to-distribute\" model has been more profitable for lenders than the \"originate-to-hold\" model. The \"originate-to-distribute\" model is more profitable for lenders as they earn fees from creating, selling, and servicing loans, reducing capital requirements. ABS issues must comply with securities laws, sold to institutional investors who rely on specialists for underwriting and risk evaluation. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have competitive advantages in securitization, such as exemption from SEC registration, implicit government guarantee, and lower capital requirements. Lenders swap mortgages with them for MBSs, paying a guarantee fee for better guarantees. The GSEs charge lenders a guarantee fee for securitization, allowing lenders to sell MBSs without credit risk. This creates a liquid market for ABSs and MBSs, enabling quick buying and selling with minimal price impact. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac enhance MBS liquidity through active trading desks. FHA/Ginnie Mae shifts credit risk to the government, while private label securitizations rely on NRSRO ratings. Private label ABSs use NRSRO ratings for third-party due diligence and assurance on loan quality. They employ credit enhancement techniques like guarantees, over-collateralizations, and letters of credit to reduce investor risk and lower interest rates. MBSs have paved the way for securitization of various consumer loans, broadening funding sources and increasing mortgage availability. The private sector has increased funding for ABSs, following the model set by government-related MBSs. The private sector has increased funding for ABSs, which are not issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Government programs support homeownership through various interventions, including tax deductions, and the creation of entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to encourage mortgage lending. The Housing Inspectors General compiled a report summarizing federal government's single-family mortgage programs, providing guarantees to reduce risk to lenders and expand mortgage lending. The report lists various HUD programs including mortgage insurance, rehabilitation loan insurance, energy efficient mortgage insurance, and other assistance programs. The Housing Inspectors General compiled a report summarizing federal government's single-family mortgage programs, including various HUD programs and programs at USDA, VA, FHFA, and provisions in the tax code that reduce tax liabilities for activities related to homeownership. Tax liabilities for individual income taxpayers related to homeownership include deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, and qualified mortgage insurance premiums. There are also exclusions for capital gains on home sales, interest on government bonds, and income from discharged principal residence debt. Economists and analysts consider market failures when evaluating government interventions in the housing market. Local governments intervene with building codes and inspections to increase information and standardization, preventing defects and substandard construction techniques. Government programs promoting homeownership argue it benefits society by generating positive externalities. Tax deductions in the United States incentivize homeownership to correct for externalities and encourage optimal levels of owner-occupied housing. Tax incentives for homeownership are discussed in CRS Report R41596. Research shows homeowners are more politically active and maintain their homes better. However, correlations do not prove causation. Subsidizing homeownership balances rental subsidies, but counterarguments suggest cutting rental subsidies for lower-income households. Robert J. Shiller argues that homeownership is more about culture than financial wisdom, leading to unbalanced investment portfolios. Peter J. Wallison rejects government support for housing finance, citing the jumbo mortgage market as proof that it's not necessary. Robert J. Shiller argues that homeownership is more about culture than financial wisdom, leading to unbalanced investment portfolios. Peter J. Wallison rejects government support for housing finance, suggesting that investors do not require a federal guarantee to purchase mortgages or MBSs. He believes that current investors value safety highly and would be replaced by other institutional investors if mortgage underwriting were sound and rates higher. Additionally, he proposes more targeted subsidies for low-income homeownership. In 1932, the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) were created to provide direct support to savings and loan associations and savings banks for mortgage support. In 1938, Fannie Mae was established to provide mortgage liquidity to lenders, followed by the creation of Freddie Mac in 1970 to compete with Fannie Mae. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 created the FHLBank System to increase mortgage availability during banking contractions and provide funds for members to respond to mortgage applications. Savings and loan associations were required to become members of the system. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 established the FHLBank System to increase mortgage availability during banking contractions. Savings and loan associations were required to become members and purchase non-public stock of regional banks, which provided loans secured by mortgages to members. The act allowed for the creation of 8 to 12 regional banks, each federally chartered with its own board of directors. The FHLBanks obtained funds through selling stock to the Treasury and members, as well as selling bonds to the public. The regional banks redeemed the Treasury's stock by 1951, becoming privately owned by FHLBank members. The Federal Home Loan Bank System was established in 1932 to increase mortgage availability during banking contractions. Savings and loan associations were required to become members and purchase stock of regional banks. The FHLBanks are jointly liable for each other's debt, leading to them being called a collective or cooperative GSE. Oversight of the FHLBanks was initially by a board of directors appointed by the President, later changed to the Federal Housing Finance Board, and then replaced by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2008. The Federal National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, traces its creation back to the 1935 RFC Mortgage Company. In 1938, the Federal Housing Administration chartered the National Mortgage Association as a subsidiary of the RFC Mortgage Company to create a market to buy FHA-insured mortgages. The National Mortgage Association later changed its name to the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae initially provided subsidized mortgages for government programs and purchased FHA-insured mortgages, but later expanded to purchase VA-guaranteed mortgages. Fannie Mae financed its mortgage purchases by selling bonds and preferred stock to the Treasury. In 1954, Fannie Mae sold non-voting common stock to those selling it mortgages and purchased additional mortgages. Fannie Mae was transferred to the Housing and Home Finance Agency (HHFA) in 1950, and in 1965, HHFA became part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Fannie Mae's board of directors consisted of government employees while under HUD. The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 divided Fannie Mae into a government corporation, Ginnie Mae, and a GSE, Fannie Mae. Ginnie Mae took over special housing assistance functions. Ginnie Mae assumed special housing assistance and management functions from the old Fannie Mae. The new Fannie Mae provided access to the secondary mortgage market for FHA and VA mortgages. In 1970, Freddie Mac was created to deal in conventional mortgages, while Fannie Mae was authorized to purchase conventional loans for moderate-income housing. Ginnie Mae began guaranteeing FHA/VA mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae's stock traded on the NYSE until delisted in 2010, now trading over-the-counter. Freddie Mac was chartered in 1970 to provide competition to Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac was created in 1970 to provide competition to Fannie Mae and offer liquidity for conventional mortgages. It raised capital by selling stock to FHLBank System members and introduced mortgage-backed securities called Participation Certificates. These securities pool mortgages to attract institutional investors to the U.S. mortgage market. Freddie Mac allowed FHLBank members to sell mortgages to its regional FHLBank or use them as collateral for an advance, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest to investors. Freddie Mac was created in 1970 to provide competition to Fannie Mae and offer liquidity for conventional mortgages. It raised capital by selling stock to FHLBank System members and introduced mortgage-backed securities called Participation Certificates. The regional FHLBank could purchase more mortgages from members, who could in turn make more mortgages. Freddie Mac's stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) until 2010 when FHFA ordered them to be delisted. Government oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was initially under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932 created the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to oversee the FHLBanks, including Freddie Mac. In response to the savings and loan crisis, FIRREA separated Freddie Mac from the FHLBank system and made it a publicly traded company with HUD as its regulator. FIRREA also created the Federal Housing Finance Board to oversee the FHLBanks, while the Office of Thrift Supervision took over regulation of savings and loan associations. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created OFHEO as an independent agency within HUD. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (FHEFSSA; P.L. 102-550) established OFHEO as an independent agency within HUD to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's safety and soundness. OFHEO set capital requirements, conducted risk-based examinations, and enforced compliance to prevent excessive risk-taking. HUD was tasked with setting housing goals for underserved areas and minority census tracts. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA; P.L. 110-289) consolidated regulatory oversight. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 consolidated regulatory oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks in the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship under FHFA."
