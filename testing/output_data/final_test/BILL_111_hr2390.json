    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Guidance, Understanding, and Information for Dual Eligibles (GUIDE) Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress finds that nearly 8.8 million Americans were dual eligible beneficiaries in 2005, with 40% having cognitive impairments. In 2008, 53% of dual eligible beneficiaries faced medication access issues, leading to adverse clinical events for 27% of them. Between 2006 and 2007, over 1,000,000 dual eligible beneficiaries and low-income subsidy beneficiaries were automatically enrolled in new benchmark prescription drug plans under Medicare Part D. Community providers play a crucial role in helping vulnerable dual eligible beneficiaries access prescription drug coverage and navigate enrollment requirements. The purpose of this bill is to assist low-income individuals with cognitive impairments in enrolling and navigating the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Front line community providers will receive financial assistance to conduct education, outreach, and direct case management for this population. The bill aims to help low-income individuals with cognitive impairments enroll in Medicare prescription drug benefit through a demonstration program for dual eligible beneficiaries with mental disabilities. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a 3-year demonstration program to award grants and contracts to community programs and clinics for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities. These programs will employ social workers and case managers to provide Medicare prescription drug assistance to target full-benefit dual eligible individuals. The program aims to provide Medicare prescription drug assistance to target full-benefit dual eligible individuals with mental disabilities, including conditions like dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and autism. Medicare prescription drug assistance includes counseling for enrollment, plan switching, formulary exceptions, grievances, and utilization management. The demonstration program offers assistance with navigating utilization management programs, obtaining prescription drugs, and contacting the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman. The Secretary will evaluate the program, including analyzing the utilization of the assistance provided. The demonstration program aims to assist target full-benefit dual eligible individuals in accessing covered part D drugs and improving medication compliance. The Secretary will evaluate the program's success and submit a report to Congress with recommendations for permanent funding of an education and outreach program on the prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The program aims to assist full-benefit dual eligible individuals in accessing part D drugs under Medicare. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2011-2013 for program implementation."
