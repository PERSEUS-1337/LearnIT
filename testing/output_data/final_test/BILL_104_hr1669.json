    "content": "The Act titled \"Science and Mathematics Early Start Grant Program Act of 1995\" is established for the purpose of promoting early education in science and mathematics. The Congress finds that preschoolers from low-income families lack exposure to science and math activities, need age-appropriate experiences to develop normally, and most teachers have little experience in these subjects. To achieve the National Education Goal of leading in math and science, a comprehensive program for these preschoolers is necessary, but efforts to train teachers in these areas have been limited. The purpose of this Act is to provide Head Start teachers with training programs focused on age-appropriate science and mathematics activities to increase students' interest and familiarity with these subjects. The goal is to move the Nation towards being first in the world in math and science achievement. Model Science and Mathematics Early Start Programs aim to introduce science and mathematics in early childhood education. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may award Science and Mathematics Early Start Grants to organizations for model programs that provide science and math instruction to Head Start personnel. Priority is given to applicants who offer hands-on teacher training programs with experienced instructors and necessary materials. The Science and Mathematics Early Start Grants program provides funding for model programs that offer science and math instruction to Head Start personnel. Recipients must conduct follow-up activities over a 6-month period, employ teachers with college experience, and report results to the Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and Science Education. $4,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1996, with additional funding for subsequent years. The Secretary will evaluate and report to Congress every 2 years on activities funded under this section for fiscal years 1997-2000. The Secretary may award grants to regional Head Start agencies for professional development in science and mathematics. Funds are allocated based on the number of children enrolled in Head Start programs. The Secretary establishes per child ratio amounts for determinations. Any unclaimed allotments are reallocated to other regional agencies. Regional agencies must allocate at least 90% of funds for local activities and can retain up to 10%, with 3% for administrative costs. The regional agency uses funds for administrative costs and to support science and mathematics professional development programs. Local Head Start agencies must submit applications with specific goals and objectives to receive grants. The local Head Start agency must establish goals for improving math and science teaching through professional development. A needs assessment must be included in the application, involving teachers to identify local needs. The local Head Start agency must include plans for professional development in mathematics and science in their application, focusing on teaching and learning, involving teachers, administrators, staff, and pupil services personnel, with a timeline for activities and periodic review. The local Head Start agency must include plans for professional development in mathematics and science in their application, focusing on teaching and learning, involving teachers, administrators, staff, and pupil services personnel, with a timeline for activities and periodic review. The local Head Start agency's grant application must reflect changes in their strategies and programs, and the maximum grant amount is based on the number of children served and the per child ratio amount determined under subsection (b)(1). If a local agency misses the grant allocation deadline, reallocation may occur. The local Head Start agency must allocate funds for professional development, including stipends, tuition, and fees, to enhance teaching and learning for teachers, administrators, and staff. If a local agency misses the grant allocation deadline, reallocation may occur. The local Head Start agency must allocate funds for professional development, including stipends, tuition, registrations, fees, travel, food, lodging, child care, training supplies, books, and materials. They can also use up to 30 percent of the grant for mathematics and science classroom supplies. The grant should be used to enhance teachers and administrators' knowledge and skills in providing children with a strong foundation in mathematics and science. Professional development activities funded under this section aim to incorporate effective strategies for meeting the educational needs of diverse student groups, including females, minorities, children with disabilities, limited English proficient children, and economically disadvantaged children. Professional development activities funded under this section aim to support the teaching of mathematics and science for disadvantaged children, including preparation for future content and pedagogical components. Amounts received under a grant may be used for professional development activities for teachers, administrators, and other staff to enhance teaching in these subjects. The professional development activities funded aim to support teaching mathematics and science for disadvantaged children through appropriate activities and enabling Head Start teachers to participate in programs offered by various organizations. This includes follow-up activities for teachers who have participated in professional development. The professional development activities aim to ensure teachers implement knowledge and skills in the classroom, support partnerships between Head Start agencies and institutions of higher education for ongoing math and science programs, and establish local professional networks for teacher interaction. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of professional development for teachers to support the development of all students in mathematics and science, including females, minorities, limited English proficient children, children with disabilities, and the economically disadvantaged. It also emphasizes preparing teachers to work with parents and families to foster student success. The curr_chunk focuses on professional development activities for new teachers in mathematics and science, as well as for teachers, parents, educators, administrators, and staff to support preschool transition programs and raise student performance in these subjects. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of appropriations for professional development programs in mathematics and science, as well as reporting requirements for regional Head Start agencies receiving funds for these activities. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of Head Start agency activities and reporting requirements for local agencies receiving grants under this section. The agency's activities under this section will be evaluated, and a report on their effectiveness will be submitted to the President and Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment."
