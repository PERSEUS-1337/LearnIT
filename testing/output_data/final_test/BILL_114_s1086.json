    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Insurance Capital Standards Accountability Act of 2015\". It includes findings related to insurance capital standards. The Act titled the \"International Insurance Capital Standards Accountability Act of 2015\" emphasizes the need for transparency and public observer access in global insurance regulatory forums. The Secretary of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Director of the Federal Insurance Office are required to support greater transparency and advocate for public access to meetings. Additionally, they must take a position on insurance proposals by global regulatory forums. The Act requires the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and Federal Insurance Office to reach consensus with State insurance regulators through the NAIC when participating in international insurance regulatory negotiations. The Insurance Policy Advisory Committee on International Capital Standards and Other Insurance Issues is established at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with up to 21 members representing diverse perspectives from the U.S. insurance industry. The committee will focus on various sectors including life insurance, property and casualty insurance, reinsurance, agents and brokers, academics, consumer advocates, and experts on underserved insurance communities and consumers. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, or their designee, must submit an annual report and provide testimony to the Senate and House committees on their efforts with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners regarding global insurance regulatory forums. The annual report must include a description of insurance regulatory standard-setting issues discussed at international forums like the Financial Stability Board and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. It should also cover the potential effects of international proposals on US consumer and insurance markets, as well as any positions taken by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The annual report must include efforts by the Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the Federal Insurance Office, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to increase transparency in international insurance discussions. This involves providing additional public access to working groups and committees of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners may provide testimony to Congress on issues related to insurance supervision. The Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the Director of the Federal Insurance Office will conduct a study in consultation with the NAIC and submit a report to Congress. This paragraph will terminate on December 31, 2018. Congress requires a report on the impact of international insurance proposals on US consumers and markets before approval. The Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Director of the Federal Insurance Office must provide notice and allow for public comment during the drafting process. The Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the Director of the Federal Insurance Office must submit a report for review by the Comptroller General of the United States. Additionally, a report on the reduction in transparency must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Chairman and the Secretary will report to Congress and testify on efforts to increase transparency at meetings of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors."
