The Act \"Charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003\" allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualified charitable organizations under section 170(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003 permits tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualified charitable organizations for charitable remainder trusts, pooled income funds, or charitable gift annuities. This applies if no person other than the charity holds an income interest in the distributed amounts. The Charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003 allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualified charitable organizations for charitable remainder trusts, pooled income funds, or charitable gift annuities. The distribution can only benefit the individual, their spouse, or organizations described in section 170(c). Inclusions in gross income are determined for payments or distributions from trusts or charitable gift annuities. The Charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003 allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualified charitable organizations. Qualified charitable distributions are not treated as investments in the contract and are not included in the gross income of pooled income funds. The Charitable IRA Rollover Act of 2003 allows tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualified charitable organizations for individuals aged 59 1/2 and above. The deduction under section 170 for the taxpayer is reduced by the sum of qualified charitable distributions made directly to eligible organizations or trusts. The amendment applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
