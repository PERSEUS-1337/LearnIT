    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002\". The Congress recognizes the potential of genomic science for new technologies and innovations. Federal policies can both stimulate innovation and hinder scientific progress. Intellectual property policies for genomic products need better understanding of their impact. Decisions about intellectual property policy made now will significantly impact basic research and genomic technology development for years to come. The Office of Science and Technology Policy can lead the development of a coordinated policy to promote innovation in genomic science. A study by the Office of Science and Technology Policy identifying the impacts of Federal innovation policy on the genomic technology pipeline and recommending policies and statutory changes would greatly contribute to policy development. The Office of Science and Technology Policy can lead a study to identify the impacts of Federal innovation policy on genomic technology and recommend policy changes. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will conduct a study to assess the impact of Federal policies on genomic technology innovation. Consultation with various agencies and an advisory committee will be part of the study. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will conduct a study with a Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology to assess the effects of innovation policy on genomic science and technology innovation. The study will identify the impact of intellectual property protection on genomic research at universities and other institutions. The study will assess the impact of innovation policy on commercial genomic research, development of genomic technologies, and access to genomic technologies and processes. It will also evaluate the net impact of Federal innovation policies on researchers' access to genomic materials, rate and quality of innovation, and cost of new genomic technologies brought to market. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of restricted access to genomic diagnostics, the cost and availability of innovative technology, and whether Federal innovation policies create barriers to research. It also addresses how these policies may affect the choice of research areas conducted by researchers. The curr_chunk discusses the positive benefits of research in specific areas and incentives for genetics research beyond intellectual property protection. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will transmit a report to Congress within 270 days containing study findings and policy recommendations for optimizing genomic technology innovation. Subsequently, the Director will incorporate these recommendations into a coordinated interagency policy to promote innovation in genomic science and technology. The Act defines \"genomic materials\" as human or human pathogen polynucleotide sequences, \"genomic technology\" as genetic diagnostic methods or tools using genomic materials, and \"innovation policy\" as including intellectual property protection."
