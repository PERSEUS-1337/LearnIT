    "content": "The \"Emergency Agricultural Response Act of 1998\" includes provisions for disaster assistance, uncapping loan rates, extending marketing assistance loans, reinstating farmer-owned reserve program, establishing a strategic food reserve, improving Farm Service Agency services, creating a temporary conservation reserve, and implementing special crop insurance rules for disaster-affected counties. SEC. 2. Use disaster reserve authority for disaster assistance to certain producers. The Secretary will provide cash payments to agricultural producers to supplement crop insurance benefits for alleviating distress from multiple year crop losses. $1.2 billion is appropriated for this purpose under the Agricultural Act of 1970. The funds will be available upon the President's official budget request designating the amount as an emergency requirement. The funds allocated for cash payments to agricultural producers are designated as an emergency requirement under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. SEC. 3. UNCAPPING LOAN RATES FOR MARKETING ASSISTANCE LOANS FOR CERTAIN CROPS. The Agricultural Market Transition Act is amended to include more crops and adjust loan rates for marketing assistance loans. The Agricultural Market Transition Act is amended to adjust loan rates for marketing assistance loans for various crops including Extra Long Staple Cotton, Rice, and Oilseeds. Amendments include changes in the time periods for eligibility and the minimum price per pound. Amendments to the Agricultural Market Transition Act include increasing the number of crops eligible for marketing assistance loans to 7, adjusting minimum price thresholds for Oilseeds. SEC. 4. Extension of marketing assistance loans allows the Secretary to extend loans for 6 months under certain conditions. SEC. 5. Reinstatement of farmer-owned reserve program removes a specific subparagraph. SEC. 6. Strategic food reserve of loan commodities is added as a new section. SEC. 138. Strategic food reserve. The Secretary is required to maintain a reserve stock of a loan commodity when prices fall below 75% of the loan rate. The reserve can be acquired through purchases from producers or the market, or by designating stocks from the Commodity Credit Corporation. The release of commodities from the reserve is allowed only in cases of a domestic shortage. The Secretary maintains a reserve stock of a loan commodity when prices drop below 75% of the loan rate. Concerns exist about affordable food supply in the US, with prices exceeding 200% of the loan rate. The Secretary administers the release of stocks from the reserve to prevent price depression for agricultural producers. The total quantity acquired for the reserve cannot exceed 25%. The Secretary manages the reserve stock of loan commodities, including selecting storage locations and rotating stocks to prevent spoilage. The Commodity Credit Corporation's funds and facilities are used for this purpose, with exceptions for restrictions on acquisition, storage, or disposition. Improved delivery of Farm Service Agency services at local and area levels. The Secretary of Agriculture may transfer funds to the Farm Service Agency for prompt response to producer requests in fiscal year 1999. The transferred amounts can only be used for activities at local and area offices. In subsequent years, the Secretary must certify that the budget for these offices will be sufficient. The Secretary of Agriculture may transfer funds to the Farm Service Agency to meet the needs of agricultural producers for services. SEC. 8. TEMPORARY CONSERVATION RESERVE TO RESPOND TO DISEASE INFESTATIONS. A new section is added for a three-year conservation reserve for diseased croplands. SEC. 1257 establishes a three-year conservation reserve program for croplands affected by plant diseases to assist owners and operators in combatting the devastation. Eligible lands must be suitable for crop or livestock production and have the potential for effective disease response within four years. The program involves contracts with a three-year term. The Secretary of Agriculture may not penalize producers in designated disaster areas for crop insurance purposes. Exceptions apply for recurring farming risks that cannot be controlled within a 7-year period. The section applies to counties in designated disaster areas, defined as areas with a Presidential declaration of major disaster or determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. It is effective from the 1999 crop year for relevant commodities grown in covered counties. For commodities grown in covered counties where multi-peril crop insurance is available, the section applies to the 1999 crop year in the United States."
