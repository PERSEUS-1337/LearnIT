Title I focuses on improving access to land through eligibility for assistance for agricultural land easements. This includes mandatory funding for farmers' market and local food promotion programs, as well as grants to support farm viability programs. The Food Security Act of 1985 allows qualified land trusts to receive assistance for reserving easements on eligible land for farmers or ranchers. This amendment aims to support access to land for agricultural purposes. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include a provision allowing qualified land trusts to receive assistance for reserving easements on eligible land for farmers or ranchers. The amendment also specifies exceptions related to section 1265B(e). Priority for option to purchase at agricultural value in agricultural land easements is emphasized in the amendment to the Food Security Act of 1985. The Secretary will prioritize applications that maintain agricultural viability and require subsequent land purchases to be at agricultural value. The Secretary of Agriculture must develop procedures by October 1, 2018, to provide preliminary credit determinations for prospective loan applicants from Farm Service Agency programs. Additionally, there is an amendment to increase the limit on direct farm ownership loans and index it to inflation. \"Limitations on farm ownership loans are set by SEC. 305.\" The Secretary sets limitations on farm ownership loans to ensure that the borrower's unpaid indebtedness does not exceed the value of the farm or security, with specific dollar amounts based on loan type and inflation adjustments. The Secretary determines the value of the farm based on competent appraisals and considers the cost inflation percentage for the fiscal year. The cost inflation percentage is calculated by comparing the Prices Paid By Farmers Index for the current and previous fiscal years. The Secretary determines the farm value using competent appraisals and considers the cost inflation percentage for the fiscal year. The regional farm real estate inflation percentage is calculated based on the regional farm real estate inflation index for the farm's region. The Secretary determines farm value using competent appraisals and considers cost inflation percentage for the fiscal year. A farm real estate inflation index measures changes in farm real estate prices in each US region. The Secretary may establish a program for microloans with a $50,000 limit per borrower to streamline the application process. SEC. 105. REPORT AND ACTION PLAN ON AGRICULTURAL CONSERVATION EASEMENT PROGRAM. The agricultural conservation easement program is valued for assisting beginning farmers and ranchers in acquiring farmland. The Chief of the Natural Resources Conservation Service must submit a report to Congress within one year, evaluating the program's support for new farmers and ranchers and addressing any identified shortcomings to further program goals. The evaluation aims to support the agricultural conservation easement program's goals of protecting farmland and facilitating farmers' access to productive land. Improved access to Department of Agriculture training and programs is addressed in Title II, with a focus on beginning farmer coordination. The Secretary will establish a program to assign coordinators to each State to facilitate communication between the Department of Agriculture and beginning farmers or ranchers. This program aims to increase access to apprenticeship programs, farm loan programs, and land for purchase. Existing Department of Agriculture employees may be designated as coordinators, eliminating the need for hiring new staff. The term \"State\" in this section refers to each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. SEC. 202. Transfer of Advisory Committee on Beginning Farmers and Ranchers to Farm Service Agency jurisdiction. The Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 is amended to coordinate the activities of the Farm Service Agency with the Advisory Committee on Beginning Farmers and Ranchers. The Secretary of Agriculture will develop an online customer self-service portal for farmers and ranchers to access program information and complete applications. Congress emphasizes that the portal should not disadvantage those without high-speed internet. Appropriations of at least $6,000,000 are authorized for this purpose over a three-year period starting from October 1, 2018. Appropriations of at least $6,000,000 are authorized for developing an online customer self-service portal for farmers and ranchers, with additional amounts as needed. SEC. 204. Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program for training, education, outreach, and technical assistance initiatives. Section 7405 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 is amended to allow the Secretary to transfer funds for individual development accounts, with a limit of $10,000,000 per year plus administrative costs. Administrative costs cannot exceed 4% of the transferred funds. The Secretary shall allocate funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation for this section, with increasing amounts from $20,000,000 in 2018 to $50,000,000 in 2023 and beyond. An additional $30,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year. The allocated amounts will remain available until expended. SEC. 205.

SALE OF SURPLUS FARM EQUIPMENT OR PROPERTY TO SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS, VETERAN FARMERS, AND BEGINNING FARMERS. The Administrator of General Services can sell surplus farm equipment to socially disadvantaged, veteran, or beginning farmers. A beginning farmer is defined as someone who has not operated a farm for more than 10 years and will actively participate in farm operations. The terms \"socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher\" and \"veteran farmer or rancher\" are defined in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990. TITLE III--INVESTMENT IN LOCAL AND REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEMS\n\nSEC. 301. MANDATORY FUNDING FOR FARMERS' MARKET AND LOCAL FOOD PROMOTION PROGRAM.\n\nAmends the Farmer-to-Consumer Direct Marketing Act of 1976 to allocate $50,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2023 for the Farmers' Market and Local Food Promotion Program.\n\nSEC. 302.
