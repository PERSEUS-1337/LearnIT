The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure that each medical facility annually certifies compliance with regulations for scheduling appointments and accuracy of wait time data. The director of a medical facility must annually certify compliance with regulations, and if unable to do so, provide an explanation and plan for compliance. The Secretary cannot waive regulations for a facility, and bonuses are prohibited for noncompliance. If a director of a medical facility fails to certify compliance, no bonuses can be awarded to certain officials at the facility in the following year. Covered officials include the director and chief of staff. The Secretary must submit an annual report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs listing medical facilities that did and did not certify compliance, along with reports submitted under subsection (b). The report covers key officials such as the director, chief of staff, associate director, associate director for patient care, and deputy chief of staff. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to uniformly apply the directives and policies of the Department to all offices and facilities. If there is a deviation from this uniform application, the Secretary must notify the Committees on Veterans' Affairs. Additionally, certain officials of the Department must be appointed and confirmed. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must ensure uniform application of directives and policies.

Appointments for key officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Benefits, Deputy Under Secretary for Disability Assistance, and Deputy Under Secretary for Field Operations, are made by the President with Senate approval.
