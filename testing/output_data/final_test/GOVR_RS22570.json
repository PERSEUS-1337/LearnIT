    "content": "Guam, a strategically significant U.S. territory in the Western Pacific, was acquired from Spain in 1898. It houses two important military bases and plays a key role in U.S. deterrence and power projection in Asia. With about 160,000 residents and 6,000 military personnel, Guam's defense buildup has been moderate. Guam's defense buildup is critical for enhancing forward presence, strengthening alliances, and countering China's rise. Defense Secretary Robert Gates described it as one of the largest movements of military assets in decades. The U.S. emphasized the importance of the U.S.-Japan Realignment Roadmap to deploy forces in Japan and transform Guam into a regional security hub. The Quadrennial Defense Review also introduced a new joint Air-Sea Battle Concept to counter challenges and improve U.S. freedom of action. Defense Secretary Robert Gates emphasized the importance of Guam's defense buildup in countering China's rise and enhancing forward presence in the Asia-Pacific region. He highlighted the shift in U.S. defense posture towards a more geographically distributed and operationally resilient approach. Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn III also stressed Guam's value in ensuring the security of allies and quick disaster response capabilities. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued strategic guidance in 2011 prioritizing U.S. security interests in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with a sharper focus on the Asian-Pacific region. The U.S. defense strategy in January 2012 declared a \"rebalancing\" towards a strengthened presence in the Pacific, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel overseeing the enhancement of the U.S. force posture in Guam, Japan, and South Korea. Guam's strategic significance has increased steadily. In 2000, the Air Force sought to base elements of an Air Expeditionary Force in Guam and sent B-2 stealth bombers to expand U.S. options for contingencies involving North Korea. Admiral Dennis Blair approved the forward deployment of air-launched cruise missiles on Guam in August 2000. The Air Force stockpiled precision munitions on Guam, including Joint Direct Attack Munitions and Joint Standoff Weapons. Guam also saw the visit of an aircraft carrier for the first time in over 30 years in 1997. Additionally, the Navy announced plans to station up to three nuclear-power attack submarines at Guam in 2001, shortening travel time to the western Pacific. The first submarine arrived at Guam in 2002, with more SSNs replacing the initial ones. The Navy's force posture shifted to have a greater presence in the Pacific, with plans for aircraft carriers and submarines. The proposal for a transient berth for aircraft carriers at Guam was later deferred indefinitely. The QDR of 2010 aimed to maintain a force structure of 10-11 aircraft carriers. The QDR of 2010 called for maintaining a force structure of 10-11 aircraft carriers. In mid-2010, three Ohio-class guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) showed their presence in the Pacific and used Guam to support their operations. By 2020, 60% of the Navy's fleets would be in the Pacific, including 6 of 11 aircraft carriers. The Navy announced in February 2014 that the USS Topeka will be deployed as the fourth SSN to Guam by 2015. Guam's three SSNs form part of the force of 56% of total SSNs deployed to the Pacific, as of August 2014. In 2002, the Commander of Pacific Air Forces requested basing aircraft in Guam, including F-22 stealth fighters, 767 tankers, C-17 transports, bombers, and Global Hawk reconnaissance drones. B-1 and B-52 bombers deployed temporarily from air bases in Texas and Louisiana as U.S. forces prepared for war against Iraq. The Air Force began continuous deployment of aircraft into Guam, with the first B-52 bombers arriving in February 2004. In 2005, B-2 stealth bombers and F-15 fighters deployed to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The Air Force also planned to station KC-135 tankers on Guam and deployed F-16 fighters in 2007. F-22 fighters from Alaska began deployments to Guam in 2008. Andersen Air Force Base received RQ-4 Global Hawk UAVs in 2010 and planned to host MQ-4C Triton drones in 2017. The Chief of Naval Operations announced the operation of Navy's MQ-4 Global Hawk UAVs from Guam by the middle of the decade. In response to threats from North Korea, a THAAD ballistic missile defense system was deployed to Guam as a precautionary measure. The U.S. and Japan agreed in 2005 to realign their force posture to meet changing security needs. The United States and Japan agreed to expand training for Japan's Self-Defense Forces in Guam, Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland. They also planned to realign U.S. Marine Corps forces, moving 7,000 marines plus dependents from Okinawa to Guam by 2014 at an estimated cost of $10.27 billion, with Japan pledging $6.09 billion for the relocation. Admiral Timothy Keating mentioned a possible delay and increased costs for transferring the marines to Guam in 2009. The relocation of 8,000 marines to Guam may be delayed and cost more, with questions raised about authority. PACOM clarified the goals to start construction by 2010 and complete relocation by 2014. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed an agreement with Japan reaffirming the relocation roadmap, with Japan providing $6.09 billion and the US funding $3.18 billion for the $10.27 billion project. The United States committed to fund $4.18 billion for the relocation of 8,000 personnel from Okinawa to Guam by 2014. The relocation depended on Japan's completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF) at Camp Schwab. In April 2009, Japan's parliament approved a bilateral agreement for the relocation of 8,000 marines to Guam from Okinawa. However, political changes in Japan led to uncertainty as the new prime minister sought to renegotiate the agreement. Defense Secretary Robert Gates emphasized the importance of implementing the agreement to Japan's Defense Minister. Defense Secretary Robert Gates stressed the importance of implementing the agreement to Japan's Defense Minister, emphasizing that without the FRF, there would be no relocation to Guam and no consolidation of forces in Okinawa. Despite efforts, a \"working group\" was established to discuss differences, with the U.S. side agreeing to discuss implementation while Japan sought to review the agreement. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged progress on implementation during a meeting in Honolulu, expecting a decision on the FRF by May. In January, Senator Daniel Inouye visited Tokyo where Hatoyama promised to decide on the Futenma issue by May. In May 2010, the ROK announced that the DPRK sank their naval ship, Cheonan, leading to President Obama condemning the act. The crisis caused by the DPRK prompted Japan to resolve the realignment dispute. Additionally, China's PLAN confronted Japan's surveillance forces near Okinawa and Miyakojima in April. In May 2010, China's maritime survey ship approached and chased away Japan's Coast Guard survey ship in the East China Sea, demanding that Japan's ship stop its surveys. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs Wallace Gregson testified to Congress that actions by North Korea and China prompted Japan's recognition of a vital U.S. role in Japan's deterrence. Joint Statements were issued in Tokyo by Secretary of Defense Gates and Secretary of State Clinton along with their counterparts in Japan. In a \"2+2\" Joint Statement, the U.S. and Japan reaffirmed commitments on the relocation of marines from Okinawa to Guam. The U.S. Navy expressed doubts about meeting the relocation goal by 2014. Gregson mentioned that 10,000 marines would remain on Okinawa after the relocation to Guam, emphasizing a realignment of the alliance. Guam will see a buildup of U.S. forces and Japan's continuous presence for training. In March 2012, Japan's media reported an increase in marines in Okinawa from 18,000 to 21,000 by 2011. The completion of the FRF and the relocation of marines from Okinawa to Guam will not meet the target date of 2014. After Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda took office in September 2011, Japan indicated it would implement the realignment. President Obama stressed the importance of implementing the relocation agreements during a meeting with Noda in New York on September 21. Before Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's trip to Asia, Senator Webb urged a reexamination of alternatives to the 2006 Roadmap due to concerns about affordability and workability. Despite this, Secretary Panetta reaffirmed commitment to the Roadmap during a meeting with Japan's Defense and Foreign Ministers. The impasse in Japan continued through 2011, with an environmental impact report on Futenma being dropped in Okinawa in December. In early 2012, visiting Diet Members expressed pessimism about the realignment. Finally, in February 2012, Members of Congress called for a review of the realignment in light of the impasse. Japan's officials visited Washington to adjust the Realignment Roadmap of 2006, separating the move of marines from the plan for the FRF. The U.S. and Japan reaffirmed the need to strengthen the alliance and build Guam as a strategic hub with an operational Marine Corps presence. However, details such as numbers, locations for transfers of marines, timeline, and cost changes were not provided in the U.S.-Japan Joint Statement on Defense Posture. Senator Webb acknowledged the need to adjust the Roadmap to preserve the alliance's strength and regional stability. The U.S.-Japan Joint Statement on Defense Posture discussed the realignment of marines, with about 5,000 marines to move to Guam and 10,000 to remain on Okinawa. Senators emphasized the need for Congress's support in any new proposals. Training areas in Guam and CNMI will be developed as shared-use facilities for a deeper U.S.-Japan alliance. The Marines in Guam would form one of four Marine Air-Ground Task Forces in the Pacific. The move of marines to Guam would cost $8.6 billion, with Japan's share being $3.1 billion. Defense Department officials acknowledged no timeline for the distributed laydown but called for starting the move to Guam to shore up political support in Japan and boost U.S. credibility in the \"rebalancing\" strategy. Representatives Forbes and Bordallo requested a timeline. In December 2012, Shinzo Abe of the Liberal Democratic Party became Prime Minister, emphasizing a stronger alliance with the United States. The PACOM Commander estimated the completion of the Marines' move to Guam by 2020 and to Hawaii by 2026. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced an agreement with Japan on a plan to return areas on Okinawa, with a relocation of marines to Guam and Hawaii. President Obama's visit to Japan in April 2014 also highlighted the realignment of forces. During his visit to Japan in April 2014, President Obama discussed the realignment of US forces, including the closure of the Futenma facility in Okinawa and the relocation of forces to Guam and Hawaii. Japan and the US reaffirmed their commitment to a geographically distributed and politically sustainable force posture in the Asia Pacific region. Japan has allocated funds for the Marines' relocation and buildup on Guam, with direct contributions of $336 million. Japan allocated funds for the Marines' relocation and buildup on Guam, with direct contributions of $336 million in the 2009 defense budget and $497 million in the 2010 budget. The FY2013 NDAA noted $725 million unobligated in the U.S. Treasury. Japan's 2013 defense budget included $7.4 million for the relocation of marines from Okinawa to Guam, while the 2014 budget had $13.8 million for necessary projects. The rationale for the military buildup on Guam is its status as a U.S. territory, allowing the U.S. to avoid negotiating with sovereign countries on force deployments. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed support for building up Guam during a visit in November 2003. In November 2003, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expressed support for building up Guam as a staging area for U.S. forces. Guam offers advantages such as avoiding political sensitivities over nuclear vessels and providing options for joint operations. Admiral William Fallon envisioned Guam as a strategic location for surging ships, aircraft, and troops to the Asian theater during crises. Guam serves as a strategic staging area for U.S. forces to surge ships, aircraft, and troops to the Asian theater during emergencies. The Valiant Shield exercises, held in Guam in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014, demonstrate the importance of flexibility and readiness for disaster relief. Additionally, Guam helps counter the \"tyranny of distance\" for PACOM headquartered in Honolulu. PACOM, headquartered in Honolulu, covers a vast area of responsibility including the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with U.S. forces on Guam strategically located closer to East Asia. Guam's proximity allows combat aircraft to reach key locations in Asia within a few hours. The shorter sailing distance from Guam to East Asia compared to other U.S. locations like Honolulu, Seattle, and San Diego is highlighted. Under President Obama, the U.S. has increased focus on Southeast Asia due to concerns over China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. The military strategy now includes investing resources in Southeast and South Asia, in addition to Northeast Asia. Guam's infrastructure is a concern as U.S. forces relocate there for strategic purposes. Guam's infrastructure has raised concerns among policy makers and political leaders due to the impact of additional deployments on utilities, roads, and water supplies. The location of Guam in the Western Pacific also necessitates construction for protection against typhoons. Other issues include hosting military dependents, training logistics, and costs. A former Marine Forces Pacific commander emphasized the need to develop human capital and communities alongside infrastructure. The Defense Department requested funding for water and wastewater projects in FY2014. Guam's infrastructure concerns include the need for funding for water and wastewater projects in FY2014 and FY2015. There are worries about Guam becoming a strategic target for terrorists and adversaries, especially with potential missile attacks from China and North Korea. Hardening facilities, including hangars and selective hardening, may be necessary for protection against missile threats targeting forces on or near Guam. China sees Guam as part of the \"Second Island Chain\" that it needs to break out of perceived U.S.-led \"encirclement.\" China has deployed a variety of missiles, including DF-3A MRBMs, DH-10 LACMs, and DF-21D ASBMs, to target Guam and break out of perceived U.S.-led encirclement. The PLA has a large force of ground-launched LACMs and has developed intermediate-range ballistic missiles with ranges up to 4,000 km. Additionally, the PLA Navy has conducted military activities in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. North Korea has developed an IRBM with a range of over 3,000 miles, potentially capable of reaching Guam. There are reports of North Korea deploying this IRBM, with evidence of a new IRBM (Musudan) being showcased at a military parade without flight testing. The U.S. National Intelligence Council reported ongoing development of a mobile IRBM in 2010, while the Defense Intelligence Agency confirmed North Korea's efforts to upgrade deployed missiles, including IRBMs. In 2011, North Korea attempted to upgrade deployed missiles, including IRBMs. By 2012, they claimed to have missiles capable of striking South Korea, Japan, Guam, and the U.S. mainland. In 2013, they conducted a third nuclear test. The Defense Department flew B-52 strategic bombers to South Korea for exercises and extended deterrence. North Korea threatened Guam's Andersen base, and Kim Jong Un ordered preparation to hit military bases in Guam, Hawaii, and South Korea. North Korea also moved two Musudan IRBMs to its east coast. North Korea moved two Musudan IRBMs to its east coast, which could be launched from mobile TELs. The Defense Department deployed a THAAD ballistic missile defense system to Guam as a precautionary measure against the DPRK's missile threat. The DPRK later removed the Musudan missiles from the launch position. There were concerns about Guam's distance from Asian flash points and suggestions for closer cooperation with allies and partners like Singapore, Australia, the Philippines, and Japan to enhance alliances, increase interoperability, and reduce costs for the United States. In 2010, Defense Secretary Gates called for \"building partner capacity\" to help other countries defend themselves or fight alongside U.S. forces. Australia proposed increased use of their bases by the U.S. military. In 2011, PACOM's Commander testified to expanding U.S. presence in Southeast Asia beyond Singapore, with potential support from Australia. In 2011, the United States and Australia agreed to strengthen defense cooperation, including greater U.S. access to Australian ranges and facilities, prepositioning of U.S. equipment, and deploying 2,500 marines on a rotational basis to Australia's Darwin base. The United States and Australia agreed to deploy 2,500 marines on a rotational basis to Australia's Darwin base and rotate more aircraft to Australia, dispersing U.S. forward presence beyond Guam. Concerns include the impact on deterrence and logistical challenges of sustaining forces over vast distances. Some in the Marine Corps consider closer cooperation with the Philippines for training. Talks are ongoing with the Philippines to explore opportunities to enhance mutual capabilities. The United States is in talks with the Philippines to enhance mutual capabilities, including sending U.S. forces on a rotational basis to strengthen maritime security. President Obama announced an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement in 2014 to bolster the U.S.-Philippine alliance and support military modernization. The U.S. Navy issued an Environmental Impact Statement in 2010 regarding the implications of the buildup on Guam. The Environmental Impact Statement in 2010 estimated a total military population increase on Guam, including 9,182 permanent military personnel, 9,950 dependents, 9,222 transient military personnel, and 1,836 civilian workers. The peak population increase in 2014 was projected to be around 79,000, with additional construction workers and others. The study completed in 2010 found that Guam cannot accommodate all training for relocated marines, suggesting Tinian as a potential training site. Challenges include sustaining operational readiness while minimizing travel expenses. Existing training ranges on Guam and Tinian only replicate individual-skills training, lacking collective, combined arms, live, and maneuver training essential for Marine Corps forces. Marines relocating from Okinawa to Guam would need to use alternate locations for core competency training. After a visit to Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in February 2010, concerns were raised about placing live-fire ranges on Guam for Marine Corps training. Senator James Webb and Guam's Delegate Madeleine Bordallo urged greater use of Tinian as an alternative. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy emphasized the need for certain Marine training to be on Guam, while the Army planned to relocate personnel to establish an Air and Missile Defense Task Force. Additionally, a new deep-draft wharf at Apra Harbor would be needed to support a transient aircraft carrier. The Record of Decision for the EIS of 2010 deferred decisions on the Marines' live-fire training range, transient aircraft carrier berth, and AMDTF on Guam. It projected a peak of 59,173 population growth in 2015 and 10,552 more marines on Guam in 2017. The Draft SEIS of 2014 adjusted force posture in 2012. The Department of the Navy issued a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) in 2014 for the relocation of 5,000 marines and 1,300 dependents to Guam over 12 years. Construction would be spread over 13 years with fewer than 10,000 new residents at the peak. The Navy's preferred alternative for the live-fire training range was indicated at Northwest Field on Andersen Air Force Base. The Final SEIS for the relocation of Marines to Guam was completed in 2015, along with the Master Plan of 2014. The Defense Department made progress in August 2014 with the submission of the Master Plan to Congress for the Marine Corps Distributed Laydown on Guam. Guam Delegate Bordallo announced a $44.5 million contract for infrastructure improvements at Andersen Air Force Base to support Marine Corps aviation realignment from Okinawa to Guam. Funding included contributions from Japan. Core Tech International and AMEC won the contract. In fall 2006, PACOM officials briefed Guam on an undisclosed draft plan for military expansion, the Integrated Military Development Plan, with potential projects worth $15 billion. Congress expressed concerns about increasing costs for moving more marines, Army soldiers, and civilian military workers, leading to a potential increase of 13,018 personnel. Additionally, there could be expanded costs for schools, health care, housing, and transportation if personnel are accompanied by dependents. The estimate of additional dependents increased from 9,000 to 11,695 under the U.S.-Japan agreement. The U.S.-Japan agreement saw an increase in dependents from 9,000 to 11,695, including Marine Corps, Army, and civilian military dependents. Total personnel and dependent growth was estimated at 24,713 after construction completion. Concerns were raised about delays in realignment potentially increasing costs significantly, with investments for new bases on Okinawa and Guam reaching $30 billion. Delays and new requirements on Guam raised uncertainty about costs, which could exceed $10.3 billion. Senators urged for greater clarity and attention to the realignment process. Senators Levin, McCain, and Webb raised concerns about the costs of realigning bases on Okinawa and Guam, citing estimates of over $27 billion. The U.S.-Japan Joint Statement in April 2012 revised the cost to $8.6 billion for the Marines' move. Defense Secretary Panetta called for near-term investments in Guam to facilitate the early movement of marines from Okinawa. Additionally, he emphasized the need for investment in training ranges in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and potentially other areas. Congress was urged to have confidence in the Defense Department's force planning. Webb emphasized the importance of realistic and affordable force planning in the Defense Department. Guam's Delegate Bordallo highlighted the need to start investments in military and infrastructure projects for the realignment on Guam to maintain allies' confidence. The Master Plan for Guam estimated the total cost of completing 124 projects by FY2028 at $8.7 billion. Concerns were raised about the need for naval assets for the Marines on Guam, including options like basing another Amphibious Ready Group in Guam. The Defense Department is considering homeporting the new non-combatant sealift Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) in Guam to support the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). Additional lift will be required to support dispersed Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (MAGTFs) in the Pacific region, with plans for a more distributed realignment of Marine Corps units in Guam, Okinawa, Australia, and other locations. Defense Secretary Panetta disagreed with the assessment that fewer than 5,000 marines could rotate to Guam. The Defense Department is considering enhancing the posture with Guam as a strategic hub by adding SSNs, deploying additional ARG, increasing roll-on/roll-off ships and aerial tankers, deploying missile defense assets, repairing runways, dispersing tanker aircraft, and adding assets for the Contingency Response Group and fuel pipelines at Andersen Air Force Base. Defense officials acknowledged the potential for Guam to serve as a strategic hub but cautioned on the need for further consideration. Some concerns have been raised about the potential introduction of temporary outside workers to Guam during construction for the defense buildup, with a preference for American workers expressed. Security considerations have been raised regarding the country of origin of foreign workers, with concerns about workers from China due to security reasons related to work on military bases. Governor Felix Camacho mentioned the likelihood of foreign workers coming from skilled labor in the Philippines if local labor is insufficient. Some concerns have been raised about hiring workers from outside Guam due to security concerns related to work on military bases. Workers could be hired from various locations, including Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, and other places. The House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness discussed military readiness in the Pacific, focusing on the realignment on Guam. Testimonies highlighted the need for adequate land for training Marines and concerns about the vulnerability of above-ground stored fuel on Guam. Delegate Bordallo expressed concerns about readiness and budget cuts during a hearing on the strategic \"rebalance\" to Asia. Vice Admiral Frank Pandolfe highlighted the consequences of budget cuts on force readiness. Senator James Webb called for more attention to the realignment in the region, while Senator Levin emphasized the complexity of plans for Okinawa and the military buildup on Guam. These actions will have long-term effects on the U.S. military's strategic positioning. Senator Webb emphasized the importance of discussing and resolving issues that will impact the U.S. military's strategic positioning in the future. He called for a re-examination of plans to restructure military forces in South Korea, Japan, and Guam, criticizing the planned realignment as \"unrealistic, unworkable, and unaffordable.\" Senators Levin, McCain, and Webb are working towards clarifying the matter and moving forward with the necessary changes. The Senators criticized the planned military realignment as \"unrealistic, unworkable, and unaffordable.\" They aimed to reassure Japan, Korea, and other countries of strong U.S. support in the region and emphasized the importance of strong bilateral alliances. Additionally, they proposed reviewing basing plans to address concerns, cut costs, and make progress in the Asian-Pacific region. The Senators also suggested basing a permanently assigned Marine Corps headquarters in Guam. The Senators criticized the military realignment plan as unrealistic and unaffordable. They recommended rotating combat troops from home bases like Hawaii or California to Guam to reduce infrastructure costs. They also suggested moving Marine Corps assets from Futenma to Kadena Air Base and dispersing Air Force assets to other Pacific regions. Guam's Delegate Madeleine Bordallo issued a press release in response. Madeleine Bordallo issued a press release focusing on the Senators' re-examination of plans for bases in Guam and the island's strategic importance. She raised concerns about consolidating Marine Corps assets from Futenma to Kadena Air Base and moving air assets to Andersen Air Force Base, emphasizing the need for careful consideration to avoid straining Guam's infrastructure. Delegate Bordallo expressed concerns about the impact of a \"transient presence\" of marines on Guam, including reduced family housing and funds. She emphasized the need for the Defense Department to certify a national security requirement for firing ranges and highlighted Guam's need for federal funds to improve infrastructure. Bordallo proposed giving the Defense Department authority to transfer funds for local infrastructure support. Delegate Bordallo expressed concerns about the impact of a \"transient presence\" of marines on Guam, including reduced family housing and funds. She emphasized the need for the Defense Department to certify a national security requirement for firing ranges and highlighted Guam's need for federal funds to improve local infrastructure. In response, Representative Randy Forbes and Delegate Bordallo wrote to Secretary Panetta expressing concerns about the realignment of forces, particularly to Guam, and sought a master plan and senior-level attention to the realignment as a top priority. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy acknowledged the Pentagon was re-examining options for Guam. The Obama Administration reached an agreement with Japan to \"adjust\" the Realignment Roadmap in February 2012. Local concerns about policy makers addressing Guam's concerns were also raised. At a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee on February 3, 2010, Guam's Delegate Madeleine Bordallo and Senator Webb expressed concerns about the U.S. realignment in the region. They urged Secretary Gates to consider the local community's concerns about the environmental impact and realistic timeline for the buildup on Guam by 2014. Senators James Webb and Carl Levin visited Guam in April 2011 to address issues of stress, space limitations, and the military's land usage on the island. In April 2011, Senators James Webb and Carl Levin visited Guam to discuss local support for the defense buildup, emphasizing the need for local gains and improved communication from the Defense Department. Guam offers valuable airspace and bombing ranges for training with allies like Japan, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, and Australia. Exercises with fighters from Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni were moved to Guam in October 2011, showcasing improved interoperability. Andersen Air Force Base hosted a joint air exercise (Cope North 2012) with the U.S., Japanese, and Australian Air Forces in February 2012. In August-September 2012, Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force joined U.S. marines in exercises in Guam and Tinian. South Korea's Air Force observed the Cope North exercise in February 2013. The U.S. Navy and Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force held the first Guam Exercise (GUAMEX) in July 2014. Taiwan has asked to fly to Guam for training with the U.S. military. Taiwan's F-16 fighter pilots train at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Taiwan has options for training and operations in the western Pacific. The Guam Integrated Military Development Plan in 2006 indicated that U.S. Army units withdrawn from South Korea were not likely to be stationed on Guam. The Pentagon planned to maintain U.S. air power in South Korea, with F-16 fighters based at Osan Air Base. In 2011, PACAF planned to use Guam as a hub for Air Force assets in the Asian-Pacific region. PACAF is involved in strike and refueling missions in the Asian-Pacific region and is building projects for the Pacific Regional Training Center at Guam. South Korea may contribute to the defense buildup on Guam, which is linked to North Korea's threat. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia mentioned that the Realignment Roadmap would address security challenges, including those posed by North Korea. After North Korea's attack on South Korea in 2010, Guam's Delegate emphasized the importance of the U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Senator Jim Webb emphasized the importance of the United States maintaining a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in light of regional tensions. He highlighted the need for strategic stability and collaboration between Japan, the United States, and South Korea. Concerns over potential conflicts between China and Japan, as well as Taiwan's claims to the Senkaku islands, were also addressed. The Senkaku Islands, administered by the United States post-World War II and later turned over to Japanese control in 1972, are a point of contention between Japan and China. The U.S. has affirmed its support for Japan through various administrations, with tensions escalating in 2005 and 2010 over territorial and oil disputes. In 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reiterated the U.S.'s commitment to its defense treaty obligations with Japan regarding the Senkaku Islands. The United States reaffirms its treaty obligations with Japan regarding the Senkaku Islands, stating that they fall under Article 5 of the mutual security treaty. President Obama emphasized the absolute commitment to Japan's security, including all territories under Japan's administration. In response to China's ADIZ declaration over the Senkaku Islands, the U.S. Air Force flew B-52 bombers through the claimed zone in defiance of China's rules. The U.S. Air Force flew unarmed B-52 bombers through China's claimed \"East China Sea ADIZ\" in defiance of China's rules. Secretary of Defense Hagel reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty's application to the Senkaku Islands and emphasized resolving issues in the realignment of forces with Japan. The Senate passed S.Res. 412 reaffirming U.S. support for freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. The House passed H.Res. 714 rejecting China's declared \"ADIZ\" and calling for restraint in the South China Sea. Guam's role as a strategic hub is crucial for balancing U.S. security interests in relation to China. The Obama Administration's strategy aims to shape China's rise as a peaceful and responsible power, but China's military commentators suspect U.S. defense buildup on Guam is targeting China. Critics question U.S. strategy for countering China's challenges and worry about raising tensions. Washington and Beijing disagree on China's threats against Taiwan, governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. Concerns persist over PLA's modernization since the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996. The PLA's accelerated modernization post the Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1995-1996 has raised concerns beyond Taiwan to include preparations for conflicts with the US, Japan, and others. China claims territory in the South China Sea and has been building up its submarine force. The PLA's rising power has implications in space, cyberspace, and various sea regions. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DNI) testified to Congress about Beijing's impressive military capabilities and ongoing modernization efforts of the PLA. PACOM Commander Admiral Timothy Keating acknowledged Guam's defense buildup due to concerns over Taiwan and North Korea, emphasizing U.S. transparency in the process. Keating also mentioned a proposal by the PLA Navy during his visit to China in 2007 regarding the division of the Pacific Ocean with the U.S. Navy as they acquire aircraft carriers. The U.S. Navy would cover east of Hawaii while the implementation of the 2006 Realignment Roadmap would help meet shared security challenges, including the threat posed by North Korea and PLA's modernization. PACOM's Commander cited the PLA Air Force's fighters for U.S. deployment of F-22 fighters in the Pacific. U.S. forces needed to watch China's \"expansive claims\" in the South China Sea, with Global Hawk reconnaissance drones based at Guam. The impasse with Japan over the realignment to Guam raised concerns. The impasse with Japan over the realignment to Guam raised concerns about PRC misperceptions of weakened U.S. alliances and potential instability in the region. Senator James Webb highlighted the importance of the U.S.-Japan relationship for regional stability and expressed caution in handling the realignment of bases to avoid giving the wrong impression to China. Senator James Webb emphasized the significance of the U.S.-Japan relationship for regional stability and urged careful handling of base realignment to avoid sending wrong signals to China. A retired rear admiral welcomed the delinking of the Marines' move to Guam from the Futenma dispute, allowing focus on the strategic balance in Asia. The Pentagon's 2010 QDR introduced the Air-Sea Battle Concept to counter PLA's anti-access and area-denial capabilities. The Air-Sea Battle Concept was introduced by the Pentagon in 2010 to counter the PLA's anti-access and area-denial capabilities. In 2011, the Defense Department included the Marine Corps in the study of the new doctrine to address emerging asymmetric threats from countries like China, North Korea, and Iran. The concept aims to leverage the capabilities of the Air Force and Navy to overcome future A2/AD threats. The Air-Sea Battle Concept, introduced in 2010 to counter anti-access and area-denial capabilities, addresses security situations globally. The concept integrates air and naval combat capabilities of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to disrupt adversary forces. The 2014 QDR assessed that countries like China will counter U.S. strengths with A2/AD approaches and develop integrated air defenses. The Marines' move to Guam was reaffirmed as part of the \"rebalancing\" strategy to prioritize Asia and the Middle East. The 2014 QDR highlighted concerns about China's military power and A2/AD challenges in Asia. The new Joint Operational Access Concept expanded to cover all services, with a focus on the Pacific. Defense Secretary Panetta outlined plans for the Navy's vessels in the region by 2020. Budget constraints may limit the total number of available assets for this strategy. President Obama's \"pivot\" to Asia emphasizes the United States as a Pacific power, with a focus on a peaceful Pacific region and shifting capacity to Guam. Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work highlighted Guam's central role in Navy plans and the rebalancing of forces to the Pacific. Guam has become a key part of the Defense Department's planning, with 60% of the Navy and Air Force now stationed in the region. In his remarks, Panetta highlighted the rebalancing strategy's focus on investments in special operation forces (SOF), with SOCPAC commanding Naval Special Warfare Unit 1 (SEALS) on Guam. The strategy involves expanding engagements and SOF rotational presence, including a Marines Special Operations Company rotating to Guam in 2014 to work with Navy SEALS. The policy challenge is to avoid conflict with China, deter aggression, and cooperate with China as a peaceful, responsible, and rules-based country. China has acknowledged the U.S. role in preserving peace and prosperity in the region. The PRC leadership acknowledged China's welcoming of the United States as an Asia-Pacific nation contributing to peace and stability in the region. The Administration aimed to build a positive relationship with Beijing, despite concerns about the PLA's modernization. Guam became a focal point for improving military-to-military relations with China, with efforts to involve PLA observers in joint exercises. In 2006, the PLA Navy sent a Deputy Chief of Staff and specialist in submarine operations to lead observers who visited Guam's air and naval bases. In 2008, two C-17 transport aircraft flew supplies from Guam to China for earthquake relief. The Deputy PACOM Commander addressed concerns about China's military buildup but stated that basing forces in Guam was not related to that. Defense Secretary Gates mentioned in 2010 that strengthening the U.S. military presence in the region was more about relationships with Asia than about China. The Obama Administration clarified aspects of the strategy. The Chief of Naval Operations clarified that the new strategy focuses on the Asian-Pacific region without a large naval buildup in the Western Pacific. The U.S. Navy will engage with the PLA and allies to promote a rules-based order and freedom of navigation. General Dempsey testified that the strategy offers the opportunity to expand engagement with the PLA, while Defense Secretary Panetta addressed concerns about adversarial military competition. Representative Hank Johnson emphasized the need for the U.S. military to engage with the PLA from a position of strength in the Pacific. Secretary Panetta highlighted the importance of defense policy in the overall \"rebalancing\" of the U.S. Government towards the Asia-Pacific region. General Dempsey stressed the strategy's focus on more attention, engagement, and quality rather than just repositioning forces. Secretary Panetta's independent assessment to Congress called for a comprehensive rebalancing of defense, diplomatic, and economic resources in the region. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon aimed to build a constructive relationship with China through the rebalancing strategy. The Administration's \"rebalancing\" aims to build a constructive relationship with China, including military contacts. There are concerns about the strategy's comprehensiveness, whether it conveys cooperation or countering China, and if the U.S. can sustain its intentions amid budget constraints. Tensions in the East and South China Seas have raised the urgency of implementing the rebalance by supporting a forward presence and commitment to allies. Representative Randy Forbes and three other House Members have been involved in discussions on this issue. The State Department responded to Congress regarding the Administration's strategy on the Asia-Pacific, emphasizing the focus on strengthening regional institutions, alliances, economic institutions, relationships with emerging partners, and a constructive relationship with China. Members of the House, led by Representative Randy Forbes, requested clear inter-agency guidance to carry out the strategy and communicate with U.S. allies and partners. DNI James Clapper testified to Congress in 2014 about Beijing's efforts to undermine the U.S. 'rebalance' to the Asia-Pacific. Legislation like H.R. 4495 and H.R. 4435 aimed to prioritize the region. Concerns about escalating tensions with China and mistrust in the PLA were raised, impacting cooperation on common security issues. The PRC's defensive policy of deterrence has been criticized by the U.S., leading to concerns about escalating tensions and mistrust. China perceives U.S. defense adjustments as Cold War-like threats and has warned of counter-measures. Some in China view American militarism as a zero-sum pursuit that undermines PRC security interests. The PLA's spokesman criticized U.S. announcements about deploying marines to Australia in 2011. In 2011, the PLA's spokesman criticized U.S. announcements about deploying marines to Australia and the Air-Sea Battle Concept as \"Cold War thinking.\" In 2012, China's defense budget increased to $106.4 billion, showing sustained growth since 1997. The PRC defense minister chose not to attend the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore in June 2012. The PRC defense minister did not attend the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore to engage with Secretary Panetta and other defense ministers. A lower-level PLA representative warned China to stay calm and not over-react to the U.S. \"pivot\" to the Pacific. The Defense Ministry criticized the U.S. rebalancing strategy as an \"eastward shift\" in military deployments. Some in China acknowledged that the U.S. strategy is not solely directed against China. Views in the United States have advocated for accommodation with China to avoid a more adversarial relationship. The U.S. defense faces challenges in rebalancing security interests with a rising China, while mitigating risks of hostility and planning for crisis management. Being forward is critical for deterring aggression and containing conflict. Budget reductions pose additional challenges. The Committee expressed concerns about a construction program on Guam costing $10.3 billion, with Japan paying 60%.

Congress emphasized that Marine Corps training expansion should not hinder the U.S.-Japan agreement on relocation. The Oversight Council required a report on threats to realigned forces on Guam and facilities needed. Concern was raised by Congress on the lack of detailed plans for realignment projects and deferred decisions by the Navy. Recommendations were made to defer authorizations for construction pending updated information from the Defense Department, leading to a reduction of $320 million in requested appropriations. The NDAA for FY2012 authorized $303,521,000 for Marine Corps and Air Force projects in Guam, with reductions made by the Senate Armed Services Committee due to lack of necessity and detailed plans. $156 million was cut for Marine Corps realignment projects and $33 million for grants related to relocation to Guam.

The Secretary of the Navy must provide a plan for investments to restore infrastructure at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. Congress allows exceptions for funding restrictions, such as environmental studies and planning for construction projects at Andersen Air Force Base. The NDAA for FY2014 authorizes funding for construction projects at Andersen Air Force Base and Andersen South, as well as certain military construction projects. Section 1068 requires the Defense Secretary to report to Congress on the strategy, force structure, and budget for executing the U.S. force posture in the Asia-Pacific region, including Guam's operational needs.
