DARPA envisions integrating these tools into a Total Information Awareness (TIA) system to support senior government officials. Funding for TIA in FY2003 is $10 million. The Total Information Awareness System (TIA) received $10 million in funding for FY2003, with additional funding of $20 million for FY2004. Alternative calculations suggest TIA-related programs received over $200 million in funding over three years. Funding for TIA programs managed by the Information Awareness Office includes R&D efforts for developing technologies. The Information Awareness Office manages R&D efforts for developing technologies to improve data mining, analyze patterns in vast amounts of information, translate foreign language materials, strengthen DOD's information infrastructure, and devise tools for decision makers anticipating terrorist attacks. Proponents see TIA R&D as promising for detecting and reacting to potential attacks, while opponents fear privacy violations and misidentification of individuals. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution requires a detailed report on TIA by May 20, 2003 from the Secretary of Defense, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Attorney General. DARPA has obligated $7.4 million for TIA system integration in FY2003. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Security stated that DOD did not anticipate using TIA technology once developed. The TIA system, developed by DARPA, was not expected to be used by the military but rather transferred to civilian law enforcement agencies for oversight. DARPA's FY2003 budget included $137.5 million for R&D efforts, with $10 million specifically for the Total Information Awareness System. Technology from 8 of the 16 R&D efforts was planned to be integrated into the TIA system. The TIA system, developed by DARPA, will integrate technology and components from at least 8 out of 16 R&D efforts managed by the Information Awareness Office. Funding for these efforts totals $110.6 million in FY2003, $83.8 million in FY2002, and $65.0 million in FY2001. Additionally, three follow-on machine translation efforts under the Information Awareness Office may also be incorporated into the TIA system. DARPA's Information Awareness Office manages various R&D efforts, including TIA-related projects. Funding for these projects totaled $317.0 million from FY2001 to FY2003, with new starts in FY2003 for data mining, database contamination prevention, wargaming, and decision-making tools. DARPA aims to leverage commercial data mining technology and R&D from other agencies like the NSA.

DARPA aims to leverage commercial data mining technology and R&D from other agencies like the NSA. The Information Awareness Office manages R&D efforts including TIA-related projects with funding totaling $317.0 million from FY2001 to FY2003. Some R&D efforts, such as Project Genoa and machine translation of languages, received funds in 1996 and 1997. Funding for DARPA and RDT&E programs is detailed in tables for FY2001 through FY2003. Funding for DARPA and RDT&E programs is authorized annually at the account level. The TIA system, along with other R&D efforts, is not specifically mentioned in FY2003 DOD authorization or appropriation acts. Congressional intent on funding levels for R&D efforts may be found in committee reports. The FY2003 DOD authorization and appropriation conference reports did not mention the TIA system specifically. Individual R&D efforts managed by the Information Awareness Office are grouped into four categories based on their primary purpose. The Information Awareness Office's R&D efforts are categorized into four groups, including Data Mining and Analysis Technologies and Machine Translation Technologies. Funding for these efforts increased over the years, with concerns raised about privacy. The R&D efforts aim to develop technologies for detecting patterns associated with terrorists' activities and translating large volumes of data. The Information Awareness Office's R&D efforts focus on developing new software technology for translating foreign language material, protecting DOD's information infrastructure, and providing tools for high-level decision makers. Funding for these efforts increased over the years, with specific allocations for each area of research. Funding for high-level decision makers to anticipate, train for, pre-empt, or react to terrorist acts increased from $14.4 million to $39.5 million in FY2002 with the initiation of Total Information Awareness System. DARPA and Total Information Awareness Office program received funding for R&D efforts in developing new software technology. DARPA's FY2003 budget justification includes DefenseNet transfers, funding for GenoaII, and Total Information Awareness program. DARPA is requesting $169.2 million for TIA programs in FY2004 and $170.3 million in FY2005. Past funding trends suggest DARPA could spend about $600 million on TIA-related R&D in the next four years, in addition to the $317 million spent from FY2001-FY2003. DARPA is seeking additional funding for TIA programs to enhance information sharing among various agencies and decision makers. Collaboration with agencies outside DOD has been informal, including a memorandum of understanding with the FBI and meetings with Office of Homeland Security officials. DARPA has established a site at the Army's Information Dominance Center to test elements of the TIA system. DARPA is testing potential TIA components like Genisys using fictitious data and mock terrorist scenarios. They are experimenting with linking intelligence information with commercially available data mining systems and tools developed by other government agencies. DARPA hopes to test the utility of data mining tools in identifying potential terrorists, including using information from prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution includes a provision requiring a joint report on TIA programs by the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and Director of Central Intelligence. The report must detail planned spending, deployment schedules, effectiveness in predicting terrorist activities, impact on privacy and civil liberties, laws governing collection efforts, and recommendations for minimizing any negative effects. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution includes a provision requiring a joint report on TIA programs by the Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and Director of Central Intelligence. The report must detail planned spending, deployment schedules, effectiveness in predicting terrorist activities, impact on privacy and civil liberties, laws governing collection efforts, and recommendations for minimizing any negative effects. If no report is submitted, the funding cutoff can be avoided if the President certifies in writing to Congress that submitting the report is not practicable and that ending R&D on Total Information Awareness programs would endanger national security. DOD must notify Congress and receive specific appropriations and authorization for any deployment or transfer to another federal agency of any TIA component unless the component is to be used for overseas military operations or for foreign intelligence activities conducted against non-U.S. persons. Senator Feingold and others introduced S. 188, the Data Mining Moratorium Act of 2003 to place restrictions on data mining activities. The Data Mining Moratorium Act of 2003 aims to restrict data mining activities in DOD and other agencies. Senator Grassley requested an audit of TIA programs and information from the Department of Justice and FBI. Concerns about privacy and oversight continue to be raised by Congress and public interest groups. DARPA's involvement in developing prototype technologies for a TIA system is seen as consistent with its mission. The DARPA-developed TIA system has potential users inside and outside DOD, with collaboration between federal agencies being a key part of the approach. Concerns have been raised about the roles of different agencies in gathering and sharing intelligence on potential threats from terrorists in the US. DARPA collaborates with various agencies to develop tools for predicting terrorist threats, including the Counterterrorist Center, FBI's Joint Terrorist Task Forces, and the Department of Homeland Security. President Bush's proposed Terrorist Threat Integration Center aims to integrate all U.S. government information on potential threats. DARPA envisions working with users to design its tools. DARPA is working on developing tools to protect intelligence sources and individuals' privacy while sharing information among users. They are researching 'fire walls' to prevent leakage and collaborating with potential users to address privacy concerns. The distributed system they are envisioning could pose challenges in ensuring privacy and preventing misuse of data. Developing tools to ensure privacy for sources and individuals is a technical challenge and policy issue. DARPA's Genisys program includes R&D on tools like \"partitioning\" and filters to protect privacy. The Information Science and Technology panel highlighted difficulties in developing privacy tools and protocols, calling for more research resources and a citizen advisory board. DARPA established two boards to monitor TIA programs on February 7, 2003. The Department of Defense established two boards on February 7, 2003, to monitor TIA programs. The internal oversight board sets policies for TIA tools within DOD, while an advisory board advises on privacy issues. Senator Wyden and the ACLU suggested that Congressional oversight is still necessary. P.L. 108-7 requires DOD to inform and get Congressional authorization for any transfers or deployment of TIA capabilities. DARPA's technology efforts in data mining and model development may require the use of real data, raising privacy concerns. Extensive testing is needed to reduce errors in prototype models. Some see potential in DARPA's TIA proposals to utilize various data sources and develop detection models. DARPA's TIA proposals aim to exploit data bases and develop models to identify terrorists, but skeptics doubt the effectiveness of algorithms in large data sets. The TIA system will use data mining techniques and analyst-developed models. Data mining involves extracting predictive information from large data bases. Technical challenges include accessing appropriate data bases, cleaning inaccurate data, integrating disparate data, and developing algorithms to identify terrorists. Integrating disparate data bases, developing algorithms to identify terrorists, mis-identifying suspects due to false leads, and dealing with timing and cost dilemmas are challenges in developing a TIA system. Accessing, cleaning, and integrating large data bases pose significant challenges, with errors being a routine problem. Linking large and disparate data bases could compound errors, reducing the effectiveness of searching through them. DARPA plans to use data mining techniques to develop tools for identifying terrorists, which could be hindered by errors in large databases and the linking of disparate databases. The quality of data may be compromised by both inadvertent and intentional errors, posing challenges for technical and privacy experts. Statisticians refine algorithms to improve accuracy in detecting patterns, such as credit card fraud. DARPA's TIA components use statistically-based algorithms to detect patterns in various data sources for terrorist behavior analysis. Analysts speculate on scenarios of terrorist attacks to anticipate necessary activities. Observers have suggested that anticipating terrorist acts is difficult, with limited success in the past. DARPA sees new opportunities in data mining techniques to exploit information sources for detecting potential terrorists. However, experts question the effectiveness of data mining in predicting terrorist behavior, especially with the small number of Al Qaeda members in the U.S. DARPA defends its approach despite skepticism. DARPA's research aims to develop templates for focused searches in databases to identify potential terrorists based on past attacks and captured documents. The accuracy of the technologies developed is crucial to minimize false leads and avoid misidentifying individuals as suspects, which could impact the timeliness of warnings and follow-up checks in a TIA system. Some concerns about DARPA's TIA system include the potential for false leads and violations of individuals' rights due to time pressures. DARPA argues that false alarms can be avoided by using multiple means to identify suspects, such as models developed by \"Red Teams\" and data mining techniques. Critics question the effectiveness of these techniques in reducing false leads. Some observers question if DARPA's techniques can reduce the number of suspects, but capturing false leads is common in statistical methods. The credit card industry has successfully used statistical tools to detect fraud, as shown in a trial with 500,000 transactions, including 100,000 fraudulent ones. Researchers found that by combining statistical tools, they could detect 50% of fraudulent transactions with a 20% false alarm rate. This means investigating 130,000 cases to catch 50,000 wrongdoers, with algorithms for credit card fraud being refined using real data. The incidence of credit card fraud is typically below 20%, making it challenging to identify wrongdoers. Press reports initially overestimated the number of Al Qaeda operatives in the U.S., highlighting the difficulty in catching a relatively small number of terrorists. The use of statistical algorithms to improve the effectiveness of identifying terrorists in a TIA system is crucial. The TIA system aims to identify terrorists by assuming a database limited to 1,000,000 transactions with 5,000 terrorists (1/2% incidence rate). Data mining tools could potentially identify 1,500 terrorists, but with a 30% false alarm rate. Investigators would need to check 300,000 cases to catch the 1,500 terrorists, requiring investigation of 200 other suspects for each terrorist identified. Some experts believe this scenario is optimistic. The TIA system aims to identify terrorists with a limited database. Computer experts warn of potential false alarms, with estimates of 3 million annually if applied to the entire U.S. population. This would pose challenges for investigators and require substantial resources to eliminate false leads. The Human Identification at a Distance project uses sensor data to identify individuals based on characteristics like gait or face. The EELD project aims to identify terrorist groups by analyzing patterns in intelligence messages and law enforcement records. Genisys is a project to create a large information repository including data on potential terrorists, supporters, and security measures. Bio-surveillance project aims to collect and analyze non-traditional health data to detect biological warfare attacks. TIDES project focuses on quickly finding, summarizing, and translating key information in foreign languages. EARS project aims to increase the speed of translation from oral sources by ten to 100-fold. EARS project aims to increase translation speed from oral sources by ten to 100-fold for military, intelligence, and law enforcement. Successor programs MUSE and GALE focus on producing transcripts and detecting key intelligence in foreign language transmissions. Communicator is a \"smart phone\" for military personnel in the field, while Babylon translates foreign phrases for service members. DefenseNet (DNET) focuses on protecting critical information infrastructure. DefenseNet (DNET) aims to enhance the security and performance of DOD's information infrastructure. Mis-Information Detection and Generation (MIDGET) project detects and reduces DOD's vulnerability to misinformation. Rapid Analytic Wargaming (RAW) develops gaming technologies for training against asymmetric threats. War Gaming the Asymmetric Environment (WAE) creates tools to predict terrorist behavior. GENOA/GENOA II improves collaborative reasoning and estimates plausible futures. Project Genoa and Genoa II aim to enhance collaboration between intelligence analysts and machines to support policy makers in dealing with terrorist threats. Total Information Awareness (TIA) integrates efforts to create large-scale counter-terrorist databases and develop analytical techniques to improve detection and response to terrorist attacks. R&D efforts in FY2003 include Human ID at a Distance, EELD, Genisys, Bio-surveillance, TIDES, WAE, and the TIA system. R&D efforts in FY2003 include Human ID at a Distance, EELD, Genisys, Bio-surveillance, TIDES, WAE, Project Genoa and Genoa II, and the TIA integrative effort."
