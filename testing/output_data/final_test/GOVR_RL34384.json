    "content": "Congress has enacted laws to protect environmental quality and public health by limiting harmful emissions and discharges, and remediating damage. Enforcement of federal pollution control laws in the United States is complex and diverse, with multiple statutes addressing issues like air emissions, water discharges, hazardous wastes, and toxic substances. Regulators and citizens enforce these laws in various ways to ensure compliance, deter violations, and clean up contamination. Implementation and enforcement provisions vary between statutes and are driven by specific circumstances. Enforcement of federal environmental pollution control requirements under statutes like the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund is complex and diverse. Various actors, including federal, state, tribal, and local governments, as well as regulated entities and the courts, are responsible for implementing and enforcing these laws to ensure compliance and address violations. The environmental pollution control enforcement/compliance framework involves various federal, state, tribal, and local entities, as well as regulated entities, courts, interest groups, and the general public. A range of regulatory approaches and enforcement tools are used to ensure compliance. The report discusses enforcement monitoring and response tools, federal funding levels for enforcement activities, available data sources, and trends in enforcement activities. It does not cover every aspect and statute in detail. The report provides a broad perspective on environmental enforcement, highlighting key elements and congressional concerns since the establishment of the EPA in 1970. Oversight has been conducted through hearings on organizational infrastructure and operations for pollution control statutes, with investigations by the GAO and EPA-OIG. The federal government's oversight and coordination with states in implementing pollution control laws have been a focus for Congress. State autonomy versus federal oversight is a key debate in environmental enforcement, often leading to disagreements among enforcement players. Enforcing national pollution control laws involves balancing compliance assistance with enforcement, amidst increasing regulatory requirements and limited resources. Variability in statutes and interpretations leads to debates on consistency in enforcement actions. Some argue for flexibility, while others highlight the need for more uniformity. The GAO and EPA OIG reports highlighted inconsistencies in state environmental enforcement programs, calling for greater efforts to achieve more consistency and effectiveness. Concerns were raised about unequal environmental benefits and an unlevel playing field for regulated industries. Federal funding allocation to states and tribes for pollution control enforcement was also a congressional concern. The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) reported concerns among state environmental agencies regarding reductions in federal funding for state environmental protection activities. States expected spending to double while federal appropriations declined. Despite a marginal increase in federal funding for enforcement allocated to states from FY2009 to FY2010, overall reductions in state budget revenue are impacting their ability to maintain viable environmental enforcement programs. Total funding from the federal government decreased between FY2011 and FY2012, with further decreases expected for FY2013. The GAO reported that federal enforcement funding and personnel, primarily within EPA and DOJ, have not kept pace with increasing mandates and regulations. Concerns about funding priorities and regulatory actions have been central in debates on EPA's appropriations during the 113th Congress. During the 113th Congress, debates on EPA's appropriations focused on restrictions on funding for regulatory actions across environmental pollution control programs. Despite no separate bills for FY2013 and FY2014, these actions remained prominent. Other areas of interest included compliance monitoring, impacts of enforcement on federal budgets, and debates on pollution control enforcement. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of environmental enforcement and penalties on federal facilities' budgets, how to measure enforcement effectiveness, the balance between punishment and deterrence, the effect of pollutant trading programs, and the funding needed for enforcement. These issues stem from differing stakeholder values and perspectives. The discussion focuses on the statutory framework, key players, enforcement tools, and evolving regulatory structures in environmental enforcement. Congress has enacted numerous environmental laws, leading to increased responsibilities for regulators and the regulated community. Regulatory agencies have adapted their organizational structures to meet expanding enforcement obligations in an integrated system of administrative and judicial enforcement. Regulators must adapt to an evolving system of enforcement and compliance tools based on federal pollution control laws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the primary implementing agency for these laws, created by Congress since 1970 to protect human health and the environment from pollution harm. The statutes authorize various actions for enforcement, forming a diverse set of regulatory requirements. Enforcement of diverse statutory and regulatory requirements is complicated by varying environmental problems, affected media, public risks, pollutant sources, and control technologies. Regulatory requirements include numeric standards, technology-based performance requirements, and emission/discharge permit limits. Permits are crucial for monitoring and enforcing compliance, with recent trends favoring incentive-based regulatory approaches. Enforcement response and compliance assistance programs are established by regulating authorities to address violations of federal pollution control statutes. Various statutes like the CWA, CAA, and SDWA provide enforcement provisions, allowing regulators discretion in determining appropriate sanctions for violations. EPA regulatory program offices establish detailed criteria for enforcement actions. The enforcement of environmental laws involves a coordinated process between federal, state, tribal, and local governments, with citizens also playing a role in ensuring compliance. EPA promulgates national regulations through its program offices, while other federal agencies are involved in enforcement. EPA promulgates national regulations and standards, involving input from various stakeholders. The agency informs the regulated community of their responsibilities and enforces compliance through permitting, monitoring, and reporting requirements. EPA also provides technical assistance and employs enforcement tools to ensure compliance with environmental laws. EPA's enforcement organization has been modified over time and continues to evolve. The EPA's enforcement organization, including the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) at headquarters and in regional offices, sets the framework for federal enforcement activities. OECA develops and implements national compliance and enforcement policies, coordinates with states, tribes, and other agencies, and oversees the National Enforcement Initiatives (NEI) and National Program Managers (NPM) Guidance. Regional offices, in collaboration with states, play a significant role in environmental enforcement and compliance activities. The EPA's regional offices, in cooperation with states, are responsible for federal enforcement activities. The NEI is developed every three years with input from EPA regions and states/tribes, setting program directions and priorities. OECA NPM Guidance is issued annually, guiding resource allocation and enforcement agreements with regional offices, states, and tribes. The EPA operates under the FY2014 OECA NPM Guidance and released an FY2015 draft NPM Guidance Addendum. The NEIC provides technical expertise and assigns investigators to regional offices as needed. NETI offers environmental enforcement training online to various personnel. OECA headquarters personnel conduct investigations and participate in national enforcement cases. The EPA and Department of Justice (DOJ) collaborate on federal enforcement actions of environmental regulations. DOJ determines whether to file cases in federal court and represents EPA in civil and criminal actions. They work closely with EPA, states, and tribes during litigation stages. DOJ also defends environmental laws and regulations, representing EPA when necessary. The EPA and DOJ collaborate on federal enforcement actions of environmental regulations. EPA-OECA reported 138 civil cases referred to DOJ and 297 criminal cases opened in FY2013. DOJ's ENRD handles many of these cases. EPA and DOJ work with other federal agencies, such as FBI, DOT, DHS, Coast Guard, ICE, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, and SEC, particularly in criminal actions. The EPA collaborates with federal agencies like FBI, DOT, DHS, Coast Guard, ICE, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, IRS, and SEC in enforcing environmental regulations. States can be delegated authority by EPA to implement and enforce federal environmental programs, subject to approval and demonstrating capability. There is variability in states assuming primary enforcement responsibilities under federal pollution control laws. Some federal pollution control laws allow states to assume primary oversight and enforcement responsibilities, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. States can also participate in waste cleanup under CERCLA and have responsibilities under FIFRA. Under FIFRA, states may have primacy for enforcing compliance requirements on registered pesticides but not for registering pesticides or pesticide establishments. EPA can authorize state officials to conduct environmental compliance inspections on its behalf, even without specific delegation authority. States may choose not to seek delegation for certain environmental programs or only implement select requirements under federal laws. States have the authority to implement federal pollution control laws by enacting their own legislation and issuing permits. They must ensure their permits are as stringent as federal standards. States approve permits, monitor compliance, provide assistance, conduct inspections, and enforce regulations. Local government authorities also have a role in environmental oversight. Local government authorities play a role in permitting, monitoring, inspections, and enforcement actions related to environmental regulations. EPA delegates authority to implement the Clean Air Act to some county governments. Local authorities may consider land use, code requirements, and other issues when issuing permits. States conduct a significant proportion of inspections and enforcement actions, but data for direct comparison with EPA is not readily available. The EPA does not include state-specific activities in its enforcement action reports, citing limitations in states' data retention and reporting consistency. To address this, the agency has implemented the State Review Framework tool to evaluate state enforcement programs. This tool aims to enhance oversight and improve reporting on state enforcement efforts. In February 2013, EPA released interactive dashboards and comparative maps on its ECHO website, providing state-level enforcement data for the past five years. The information includes completed inspections, violations, enforcement actions, and penalties by state. EPA conducts reviews and provides feedback to states, offering recommendations for improvement. Full implementation of the State Review Framework (SRF) began in 2005, with reviews completed for all states and territories by 2007. Round 2 of reviews started in 2008, with most states reviewed by the end of 2012. OECA and partners evaluated the first implementation. OECA and partners evaluated the implementation of the first cycle of SRF recommendations and revised SRF guidance. Despite efforts to improve coordination, perceived differences remain between states, EPA regions, and headquarters. ECOS serves as a forum for joint strategic planning between states and EPA, with the National Environmental Performance Partnership System established in 1995 to enhance EPA-state environmental management effectiveness. EPA and states enter into performance partnership agreements under this system. States and EPA enter into performance partnership agreements to address priorities based on localized environmental conditions. These agreements serve as work plans for funding through EPA grants. EPA enforces federal law in states, but states can enforce their own laws where not preempted. EPA retains authority to take enforcement measures, especially in cases of violation of orders or consent decrees. In emergencies or matters of national concern, EPA may intervene if a state fails to respond appropriately. When states fail to address issues of national concern, the federal government may intervene, either at the request of states or on its own initiative through \"overfiling.\" Overfiling, which is rare according to the EPA, involves federal intervention in state enforcement actions or settlements. While overfiling has occurred under various pollution control statutes, it has been a contentious issue, particularly in cases of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) violations. States have objected to overfiling, leading to debates and litigation over its utility and extent. The utility and extent of overfiling in environmental enforcement have been debated and litigated. Tribal governments are increasingly recognized for their role in environmental enforcement, with tribes needing EPA approval to administer federal programs on their land. Tribes can establish and enforce their own environmental programs under their laws, and some federal statutes allow tribes to assume responsibility for certain pollution control programs with EPA approval. EPA may directly implement programs in areas without approved tribal programs. The EPA exercises federal authority and may implement programs directly. EPA may still be involved in compliance and enforcement, especially in cases of criminal violations, even with approved tribal programs. Tribal environmental protection authority can stem from federal executive orders, treaties, and agreements. EPA follows the American Indian policy statement for environmental issues on tribal lands. Few tribes have authority to implement federal pollution control laws, with tribal environmental compliance being a national priority. The EPA prioritized environmental compliance in tribal governments' capabilities to implement federal environmental statutes, focusing on public drinking water systems, pollution control statutes for schools, and solid waste dumping. Indian Country was not designated as a national enforcement initiative, but enforcement and regulatory guidance are provided through the Tribal Compliance Assistance Center. Private individuals play a crucial role in enforcing federal pollution control laws, as authorized by Congress. They can identify violations, comment on settlements, initiate enforcement proceedings, and even take legal action against the EPA for failing to fulfill duties. The EPA-OECA introduced the \"National Report a Violation\" website in 2006 to enhance public participation in reporting environmental violations. The EPA-OECA website allows citizens to report tips and complaints, with a significant increase in reports from FY2005 to FY2006. Over 18,000 tips have been received to date, with a peak of 7,800 in FY2008. In FY2009, the \"EPA Fugitives\" website was launched to locate environmental criminal fugitives. The regulated community is diverse, including various industrial and nonindustrial entities of all sizes. The regulated community consists of a wide range of entities and operations, including utilities, refineries, manufacturing facilities, agriculture producers, mobile sources, and government agencies. These entities are required to comply with multiple pollution control statutes due to the nature of their activities. Regulated entities, ranging from small businesses to large corporations, are categorized as minor or major emitters/dischargers based on factors like earnings and emissions. Major entities have a significant environmental impact and are subject to stricter regulations and potential exemptions. The EPA has been criticized for not adequately defining the regulated universe under pollution control statutes, hindering the evaluation of enforcement effectiveness. In 2001, EPA estimated a total universe of over 41 million regulated entities, but this estimate has not been updated since. Data and information provide some indications of the size and diversity of this regulated community. The EPA's databases, such as ECHO and FRS, contain data on over 800,000 facilities for compliance with pollution control laws. The FRS database includes more than 2.5 million facility records based on permit information for various statutes. States reported that over 3 million regulated facilities required state agency oversight. In 2003, states reported that over 3 million regulated facilities required state agency oversight for environmental compliance. The EPA's program offices maintain information on regulated entities, including emissions and discharges data. EPA's Office of Air and Radiation has a national database of air emissions estimates for different categories of sources. The data does not reflect 100% accuracy. The EPA's \"Sector Notebooks\" define sectors as parts of the economy with similar operations and compliance issues. These notebooks provide comprehensive characterizations of key sectors within the regulated community, although some may be outdated. Table 2 lists industry and government sectors for which the agency has completed sector notebooks and compliance assistance tools. During FY2013, EPA enforced 61 actions against federal agencies for pollution control violations, resulting in $866.5 million in penalties. This is compared to 57 actions in FY2011 and 52 in FY2010. Federal facilities must comply with federal pollution control laws and state regulations, with violators also investing $128.0 million in cleanup and operations improvements. In FY2013, violators agreed to invest over $128.0 million in cleanup and operations to comply with environmental laws, compared to higher amounts in previous years. EPA no longer provides aggregated summaries of federal facility enforcement actions but offers an interactive mapping tool for concluded cases. Regulating federal facilities under pollution control laws poses unique challenges, with DOD and DOE facilities making up a significant portion of major federal facilities. Facilities operated by DOD and DOE are a significant part of major federal facilities that can impact the environment. Compliance/enforcement information for DOD and DOE is reported individually, while other federal agencies are grouped as Civilian Federal Agencies. The major federal pollution control laws give EPA authority to enforce requirements and penalties at federal facilities. The Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 amended RCRA to subject DOD and other federal facilities to penalties, fines, and inspections for non-compliance with waste regulations. The SDWA has similar provisions. The SDWA and CERCLA have specific provisions for federal facilities, with Section 120 of CERCLA requiring investigation and cleanup of NPL sites. There is ongoing debate in Congress about amending other pollution control laws for federal facilities. EPA and states use enforcement tools to address noncompliance with pollution control laws, including compliance assistance, civil enforcement, and criminal enforcement. The environmental statutes authorize a range of enforcement tools, from guidance and assistance to strong enforcement actions. Critics argue enforcement is either too litigious or not rigorous enough, while EPA officials defend their approach of balancing guidance and penalties to achieve compliance. The EPA and states have flexibility in responding to violations, using monitoring, inspections, and citizen reports. They may issue warnings for minor violations and grant time for compliance before taking civil administrative action. Sanctions for environmental violations can be initiated by the EPA or states through civil administrative actions or court proceedings. These sanctions may include required actions for compliance, environmental damage correction, monetary penalties, and even incarceration for criminal violations. Settlements in the past decade have also involved environmentally beneficial projects. Authorities have discretion in determining sanctions on a case-by-case basis. During FY2013, a majority of environmental violations were addressed administratively by states and EPA through negotiations. EPA issued 873 compliance orders and filed 1,440 penalty order complaints. Civil judicial cases constituted the second-largest category of enforcement actions, focusing on single or multiple environmental statutes. Enforcement actions and penalties fluctuate significantly from year to year. In FY2013, EPA reported fluctuations in enforcement actions and penalties, with the number of administrative penalty order complaints increasing and decreasing over the years. The combined civil penalties assessed in FY2013 reached an all-time high of $1.15 billion, primarily due to a record settlement of $1.0 billion. In FY2013, the total dollar amount of penalties assessed was at an all-time high of $1.15 billion, mainly attributed to a record settlement of $1.0 billion with the Transocean defendants for violations related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The settlement with Transocean entities accounted for nearly 90% of the civil penalties assessed for that year. Enforcement actions involve monitoring data compilation, inspection, and evaluation to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and permit conditions. Compliance monitoring, evaluations, and investigations help identify violations and priority issue areas. Data collected enables EPA and states to determine compliance and potential enforcement actions. Monitoring can be program-based (e.g., air, water, waste) or sector-based (e.g., industrial, mobile source, utilities), often included in permit requirements. Inspections create awareness and encourage compliance. EPA uses various forms of compliance monitoring. EPA and states use various forms of compliance monitoring, including self-monitoring/reporting, review of records, and inspections/evaluations to ensure regulated entities comply with environmental laws. Compliance monitoring helps regulators assess compliance status, identify violations, and prioritize enforcement actions. Compliance monitoring involves inspections and evaluations conducted by regulators to assess environmental conditions at facilities and determine compliance with specific requirements. Area monitoring, such as ambient monitoring and remote sensing, is used to examine environmental conditions in the vicinity of a facility or across a geographic area. In FY2013, a total of 18,000 EPA enforcement inspections and evaluations were conducted under various statutes, with most inspections carried out by the states. Annual data for the total number of inspections conducted by states are not readily available due to data-reporting variability and other limitations. ECOS reported that roughly 136,000 compliance inspections were conducted by states in 2003 for major federal environmental programs. Inspections under FIFRA are not included in the total number reported by ECOS. States reported between 90,000 and 100,000 FIFRA inspections each fiscal year for FY2006 through FY2008. These activities are typically administered by states' departments of agriculture and are not reflected in EPA or ECOS reports. In 2003, ECOS identified 440,000 regulated facilities under major environmental programs. EPA's FRS contains records for over 2.5 million facilities. Most pollution control violations are resolved administratively by states and EPA. They may informally address issues or initiate formal actions. An environmental problem may lead to formal administrative action such as a notice of violation or an Administrative Order for compliance. The Order sets requirements for compliance within a specified time frame and may include sanctions. Initial enforcement steps often involve a Notice of Violation or a warning letter for first-time violations. These notifications aim to prompt regulated entities to correct issues and comply promptly. EPA and states may require corrective actions through administrative enforcement actions. During FY2013, EPA initiated 873 administrative compliance orders and 1,407 administrative penalty order complaints, imposing penalties totaling $48.0 million. Federal administrative orders are handled through an adjudicatory process before an administrative law judge or EPA's regional judicial officers. The EPA Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) and regional judicial officers (RJOs) appointed by the EPA Administrator handle adjudicatory functions and render decisions in proceedings related to enforcing environmental laws. Decisions by ALJs and RJOs can be reviewed and appealed to the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB), which operates independently of the EPA. EAB decisions involve reviews of federal environmental issues. Civil judicial cases are the next-largest category of environmental enforcement after administrative actions. These cases are filed in federal district court by the DOJ on behalf of the EPA or by State Attorneys General for the states. The length of a civil case can vary greatly, sometimes spanning several years and different presidential administrations. During FY2013, EPA-OECA referred 138 civil judicial cases to DOJ, resulting in 137 civil judicial complaints filed with the court and 176 cases concluded. Criminal enforcement actions may be initiated for deliberate violations of pollution control laws, leading to monetary fines, corrective actions, and restoration of damages. Conviction of a criminal environmental violation can lead to imprisonment. In FY2013, EPA opened 297 new environmental crime cases, a 7% decrease from FY2012. Different statutes have varying authorities for pursuing criminal actions, such as willful violations under the SDWA and criminal sanctions for knowing or negligent violations under the CWA. Examples of criminal actions include illegal disposal of hazardous waste and export of hazardous waste without permission. The EPA enforces regulations on asbestos removal, tampering with drinking water, and negligent maintenance leading to hazardous material discharge. The agency's criminal investigators are overseen by the EPA-OECA Office of Criminal Enforcement, Forensics, and Training (OCEFT), which works closely with DOJ's U.S. Attorneys Offices and ENRD's Environmental Crimes Section (ECS) to prosecute criminal cases. State and local law enforcement agencies, as well as other federal agencies, also play a role in environmental protection enforcement. Environmental crime task forces, composed of representatives from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, as well as environmental regulatory enforcement, facilitate investigations and cases. Various federal agencies such as the FBI, DOT, Coast Guard, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, SEC, and IRS also play significant roles in criminal enforcement of pollution control laws. The emphasis on criminal enforcement increased in the mid-1970s with the issuance of guidelines for criminal cases and in 1981 with the creation of an Office of Criminal Enforcement in EPA's regional offices. In the late 1980s, Congress granted full law enforcement powers to EPA criminal investigators under the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988. The Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990 authorized the establishment of a new Office of Criminal Investigations within EPA and mandated the hiring of 200 criminal investigators by FY1996. Congressional interest in staffing levels of criminal investigators at EPA has been evident during appropriations deliberations. For example, the 1990 Pollution Prosecution Act required EPA to maintain 200 criminal investigators. The EPA is required by law to have 200 criminal investigators, but this provision was not included in the FY2008 appropriations. Congressional concerns about staffing and funding for EPA's criminal enforcement have been ongoing, with a focus on investigating environmental crimes and violations of the U.S. Criminal Code. Congress has been concerned about the number of EPA investigators assigned to the criminal enforcement program. The number of EPA special agents increased from about 50 in 1990 to more than 200 by 1998. As of September 2007, the number of EPA investigators had dropped to 168, but increased to 206 in FY2010. However, the total number of criminal investigators declined to 202 in FY2011. As of September 30, 2013, EPA had 177 special agents working on environmental crime investigations. In FY2009, EPA launched the \"EPA Fugitives\" website to help locate individuals accused of environmental crimes. The site solicited public and law enforcement assistance, leading to the arrest of three fugitives and the surrender of two others. Information on \"EPA Fugitives\" was not reported in subsequent years, but tips received through the website aided in investigations. In FY2010, tips from the \"Report a Violation\" website led to seven criminal investigations, with one resulting in an indictment. EPA did not see similar results in FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013. Sanctions for violating environmental laws can include compliance measures, monetary penalties, facility closures, increased monitoring, and more. The settlement-required corrective and compliance actions, along with monetary penalties, are meant to correspond with specific violations and their gravity. Penalties collected are deposited with the U.S. Treasury, except under CERCLA and CWA where funds are used to restore natural resources. EPA revised civil violation penalties in 2013 to adjust for inflation every four years. The EPA revised civil violation penalties in 2013 to adjust for inflation every four years, as required by a federal law. The adjusted penalty amounts for various statutes are listed in Table 1 of 40 C.F.R. 19.4. States may also have the authority to impose penalties under federal statutes. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires administrative penalty authority for states to obtain and retain primacy for the PWSS program. As of February 2014, most states and territories had this authority. EPA has not mandated administrative penalty authority under all federal pollution control laws. In some states, penalties from environmental enforcement actions can directly fund state environmental agencies and programs. The federal government may share civil monetary penalties with states involved in enforcement actions, based on factors like state participation and authority to collect penalties. EPA guidance emphasizes the need for an agreement on penalty division with states before final settlement. Various factors, such as environmental harm and economic gain to violators, are considered in determining penalties. The federal pollution control statutes consider factors such as noncompliance, violation history, and ability to pay when determining penalties. Cooperation, self-reporting, and immediate action by the violator may also be taken into account. Precedents from previous cases are considered, and penalties can include civil administrative, civil judicial, and criminal penalties assessed by the EPA. The EPA assessed significant civil administrative, civil judicial, and criminal penalties from FY1993-FY2013. A few cases accounted for a large portion of the penalties, such as a major RCRA case in FY2006 and a settlement with Transocean defendants in FY2013. The Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico case in FY2013 attributed to the majority of criminal fines, restitution, and court-ordered projects. The EPA and DOJ have established policies and guidelines for negotiating agreements and setting penalties in the Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico FY2013 criminal case. EPA-OECA has developed computer models for calculating economic advantage, costs of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), and measuring the ability to afford compliance requirements and penalties. These models vary depending on the violator's entity type and can be used in conjunction with the policies and guidelines. The EPA and DOJ have established policies and guidelines for negotiating agreements and setting penalties in the Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico FY2013 criminal case. EPA-OECA has developed computer models for calculating economic advantage, costs of Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs), and measuring the ability to afford compliance requirements and penalties. These models vary depending on the violator's entity type and can be used in conjunction with the policies and guidelines. The available models include ABEL, BEN, INDIPAY, MUNIPAY, and PROJECT for assessing compliance costs, economic advantage, and penalties for noncompliant entities. The EPA and DOJ have policies for negotiating penalties in environmental cases. Federal agencies can be sued for violating environmental regulations. DOJ limits EPA's authority to assess penalties against federal facilities. States can enforce penalties against federal agencies, despite DOJ's objections. The Constitution may not allow states and nonfederal entities to use citizen suits to enforce federal environmental laws against federal facilities. In FY2013, EPA took 61 enforcement actions against federal facilities, imposing penalties totaling $866.5 million. Federal agencies committed over $128.0 million for facility improvements and compliance with federal laws. Additionally, $5.4 million was allocated for environmental projects. EPA no longer provides aggregated summaries of federal facility enforcement actions but offers an interactive mapping tool for concluded cases. The EPA provides an interactive mapping tool for concluded enforcement cases against federal facilities. Enforcement settlements may include Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) that violators can undertake to mitigate penalties. SEPs must be related to the violation and cannot be legally required for compliance. EPA has specified eight categories of acceptable projects for SEPs. The EPA has specified eight categories of acceptable projects for Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) in enforcement actions. SEPs have become more common in the last decade, with federal regulators and some states using them to provide direct environmental benefits in settlements. While SEPs are meant to be supplemental, some argue that they may lead to lower monetary fines. The impact of specific SEPs on reducing fines is difficult to determine. Environmental justice (EJ) has been a topic of debate, with concerns raised in congressional hearings and legislation. For instance, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, prohibits the use of funds to contravene Executive Order No. 12898 on environmental justice. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by 17 federal agencies to enhance the Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice. The discussion highlights environmental justice in the context of enforcement and compliance, focusing on the perceived fairness in the distribution of environmental quality among different groups of people. The terms \"environmental justice\" and \"environmental equity\" broadly describe this distribution of environmental amenities and risks based on population characteristics. The 1994 Executive Order 12898 directs federal agencies to address environmental justice in minority and low-income populations, with the EPA leading implementation efforts through its Office of Environmental Justice. EPA's Office of Environmental Justice (OEJ) provides information and technical assistance to federal agencies, engages stakeholders, and administers grants. The agency integrated Environmental Justice into its strategic plan from FY2014-FY2018 and initiated \"Plan EJ 2014\" to improve environmental conditions in overburdened communities. Annual reports track progress on Plan EJ 2014 commitments, and EPA also released a publication on advancing smart growth and environmental justice. EPA's OEJ developed the Environmental Justice Strategic Enforcement Assessment Tool (EJSEAT) to identify possible environmental justice areas of concern and assist in fair enforcement decisions. OEJ also published a toolkit for assessing allegations of environmental injustice and citizens can use EPA's EJView to evaluate overlap between environmental conditions and demographic characteristics. Since the 1990s, EPA and states have shifted towards compliance assistance programs to help the regulated community understand environmental obligations and prevent violations. States have also developed local assistance programs, and EPA's Office of Compliance has introduced various programs in collaboration with regions, states, and tribes. Each EPA region has a Compliance Assistance Coordinator to prioritize compliance assistance efforts. The Compliance Assistance Coordinator serves as an expert in the region on compliance assistance priorities, strategies, and performance measurement. They work with subject-matter experts to develop guides and workshops, conduct visits, and provide sector-based assistance through National Compliance Assistance Centers. These centers, developed in partnership with various stakeholders, offer sector-specific assistance through web-based resources. The use of compliance incentive approaches has been evolving, with policies and programs that reduce penalties for voluntary actions to address noncompliance. Examples include self-disclosure programs and environmental audit protocols. The EPA Audit Policy, in effect since 1995, allows for the elimination of civil penalties for voluntarily reported violations. In early 2007, EPA sought comments on providing incentives for new facility owners to disclose environmental violations. EPA promotes compliance through incentive approaches in its program guidance. The National Performance Track Program was discontinued in March 2009. The EPA's Performance Track program, which encouraged facilities to voluntarily work towards environmental goals beyond legal requirements, was terminated in May 2009. The program had nearly 547 facilities as members, with concerns raised about the reliance on incentive approaches over traditional enforcement methods. EPA aimed to refine concepts for a stronger environmental protection system. Incentive and voluntary approaches in environmental enforcement are supported by EPA and others for cost savings, reducing burdens on investigators, achieving environmental improvements, and leveraging resources through partnerships. Reviews by EPA-OIG and GAO have examined aspects of EPA's incentive approaches. Congressional debates on appropriations highlight the need for adequate resources for EPA, DOJ, and states to enforce federal environmental laws effectively. Congress has historically specified funding levels for EPA enforcement activities. The House-passed FY2008 Interior and Environmental Agencies Appropriations bill (H.R. 2643) aimed to increase EPA's criminal investigators to meet statutory requirements. The President's FY2015 budget requested $583.0 million for EPA's enforcement program activities. No regular appropriations for FY2015 had been enacted as of the report date. President Obama signed the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 (P.L. 113-164) to continue funding at FY2014 levels with a slight rescission. The continuing resolution authorizes funding for federal departments and agencies at FY2014 levels with a 0.0554% rescission until December 11, 2014, or until FY2015 appropriations are enacted. Funding for EPA is subject to conditions from the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2014. Continuing funding cannot be used for new projects without FY2014 appropriations. Table 5 shows funding distribution for enforcement activities over the past fiscal years. The Department of Justice's resource requirements for litigation activities under federal pollution control statutes are mainly funded through the Environment and Natural Resources Division's budget justifications. ENRD handles support for pollution control laws, natural resources, public lands, real property acquisition, and other legal matters. Comparisons between fiscal years are challenging due to changes in program activities and organizational restructuring. The President's FY2015 budget request for DOJ included $112.5 million for ENRD and an estimated 526 FTEs. An additional $21.8 million for up to 115 FTEs was included in the President's FY2015 request for EPA to be transferred by EPA to DOJ/ENRD through a reimbursable agreement for Superfund work. The FY2014 enacted levels for DOJ included $107.6 million and 526 FTEs for ENRD, plus an additional $23.1 million for up to 115 FTEs transferred from EPA for Superfund work. Of the FY2014 enacted amount, roughly $67.0 million and 312 FTEs were for environmental litigation activities; $9.9 million and 46 FTEs were for criminal litigation conducted by DOJ's Environmental Crimes Section; and $57.1 million. The DOJ's Environmental Crimes Section received $9.9 million for criminal litigation, while $57.1 million and 266 FTEs were allocated for civil environmental enforcement and defensive litigation by the Environmental Enforcement and Environmental Defense Sections. State funding for pollution control enforcement is not extensively reported, but ECOS tracks state environmental and natural resource spending, providing a national perspective on state funding contributions. In March 2008, ECOS analyzed state expenditures on regulatory environmental agency work, projecting a total expenditure of $12.65 billion for FY2008. Only $3.06 billion, less than 25%, was from federal funding. A survey in February 2010 found 2,112 positions eliminated or vacant in state agencies due to budget limitations. By August 2010, state environmental agencies' budgets had decreased from FY2009 to FY2011. State environmental agencies' budgets decreased from FY2009 to FY2011, with a slight increase in FY2010 for states with SRF/ARRA administrative funds. Federal funds have marginally increased, while state general funds have slightly dropped. Other funding sources like permitting fees have remained constant. Federal appropriations for staffing and enforcement of environmental statutes are a continuing concern. Evaluating pollution control enforcement effectiveness is complex, as discussed in the report. The report discusses the challenges of characterizing environmental enforcement at a macro level and factors contributing to its successes and shortcomings. It highlights the complexities of enforcement, including the diversity of the regulated community, activities across regulating entities, and variability across statutes. Congressional interest in environmental legislation and enforcement issues has been ongoing since the establishment of the EPA in 1970. The 113th Congress is considering various legislative approaches to address EPA-state relations and fiscal requirements, including oversight hearings and appropriations legislation. Congressional interest may focus on statutory changes to refine the EPA-states' partnership and address concerns related to enforcement/compliance activities under pollution control laws. The regulated community, public interest groups, federal and state officials, and Congress are divided on expanding or constraining enforcement/compliance legislation under pollution control laws. Views on expanding states' authority for enforcement are also divided. Congressional involvement in these issues is expected to evolve. Compliance monitoring data is used to manage enforcement programs and inform the public of actions taken. EPA and states collect and maintain compliance/enforcement data in various forms. According to EPA's OECA FY2006 Accomplishments Report, states collect about 94% of environmental quality data from state-issued permits and monitoring programs. EPA has been working to integrate databases for better cross-referencing of compliance data. Data is compiled into annual reports focusing on statute-by-statute results and penalties assessed. The reliability of EPA and state databases for environmental enforcement has been debated, with concerns raised about the effectiveness of reported information. Critics argue that counting enforcement actions alone does not fully measure the national environmental compliance program's effectiveness. EPA has expanded reporting to include estimates of environmental benefits and developed a new tool for public access to detailed environmental information by location. The EPA has developed interactive maps on its Annual Results website to provide detailed information about environmental pollution control enforcement actions at 4,600 facilities in the United States. These maps do not include actions taken by state or local governments. Additionally, the EPA has modernized its Enforcement and Compliance History Online database to include state-level enforcement data for the past five years. The EPA launched the modernized ECHO database in December 2013, replacing the original website. Updates have been ongoing, with the latest upgrade \"ECHO 2.3\" in September 2014 adding new search capabilities. The database now includes data from EPA's Online Tracking Information System (OTIS), which was retired in 2013. The EPA launched the modernized ECHO website in December 2013, replacing the original website. The Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database provides a snapshot of a facility's environmental compliance record, primarily focusing on requirements under the CAA, CWA, and RCRA. EPA continues to expand the integration and capabilities of ECHO and other databases. The EPA's Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database, launched in 2002 and modernized in 2013, allows users to access permit, inspection, violation, enforcement action, and penalty information for facilities. The database provides detailed reports on facility compliance with environmental regulations. The ECHO database provides information on enforcement actions and penalties for facilities under EPA jurisdiction, focusing on specific environmental laws. It does not cover all violations, such as those related to CWA minor facilities, mobile sources, asbestos, TSCA, FIFRA, Superfund, wetlands, and pretreatment. ECHO 2.0 is a modernized version of the website. The ECHO 2.0 website was launched on December 3, 2013, replacing the original ECHO website. EPA has been gradually adding enhancements and features to ECHO 2.0 since January 2014, with updates released periodically throughout 2014. These updates are detailed on the ECHO \"What's New\" website. The EPA has been updating its ECHO website with enhancements and upgrades since January 2014. The modernization process may cause some searches to be unavailable at times. The proposed schedule for completing additional capabilities includes a Clean Air Act facility and pollution search in February 2015. Prior to the modernization, interactive dashboards and comparative maps were released in February 2013, which remain available on the updated ECHO website. These features provide state-level enforcement data for the past five years, including completed inspections, violations, enforcement actions, and penalties by state. Users can customize the presentation to view state activity and comparisons. Envirofacts provides public access to information about environmental activities, such as releases, permit compliance, hazardous waste handling processes, and the status of Superfund sites in the United States. Users can develop online queries, create reports, and map results. The Facility Registry System (FRS) is a companion to Envirofacts and can be used to create facility identification records and locate sites subject to environmental regulations. The Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) integrates data on federal environmental cases and compliance activities under various statutes. It allows access to enforcement and compliance information for states and EPA. The public can access some federal enforcement and compliance data through the EPA Enforcement Cases. The EPA's Integrated Data for Enforcement Analysis (IDEA) maintains copies of air, water, hazardous waste, and enforcement data systems, providing a historical profile of inspections, enforcement actions, penalties, and toxic chemicals released by EPA-regulated facilities. The Online Tracking Information System (OTIS) web link is no longer updated and was retired in December 2013 with the release of the modernized ECHO website. Former OTIS content and features are now accessible only to federal, state, and tribal government staff. The modernized ECHO website replaced the Online Tracking Information System (OTIS) in December 2013. Former OTIS content and \"government-only features\" are now accessible internally to government staff via EPA LAN ID and password or through an EPA Portal ID log-in on the \"ECHO Gov\" section of echo.epa.gov. OTIS was a collection of search engines that allowed access to enforcement and compliance data for EPA, state/local/tribal governments, and certain federal agencies. The web interface application sent queries and drew data from the IDEA system, which integrates facility data from various EPA databases. The databases used for compliance/enforcement data were not directly available to the public and were integrated into various EPA databases like IDEA and OTIS. These databases included AFS, PCS, RCRAInfo, NCDB/FTTS, and SDWIS/FED. The information on the integrated systems was updated monthly by OECA. EPA regularly improved OTIS, IDEA, and ECHO by adding new search capabilities and tools. In December 2012, EPA completed a major multi-year enhancement to the system. In December 2012, EPA completed a major database modernization for searching Clean Water Act actions, replacing the previous Permit Compliance System with the new Integrated Compliance Information System for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Additionally, in September 2012, EPA started adding greenhouse gas emission data to the OTIS database. The EPA has refined terms and definitions in data elements from year to year, leading to variability in reported enforcement actions. Results are presented by action type (administrative, civil judicial, criminal judicial) over a longer-term period (15 to 20 years) through FY2013. The tables generally provide data for the most recent five years, depending on data availability for the most recent fiscal year. The data on enforcement actions by the EPA have been compiled from various sources including annual fiscal year reports, National Enforcement Trends charts, and data provided directly to CRS. The actions are categorized by type (administrative, civil judicial, criminal judicial) and by statute (e.g., Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act)."
