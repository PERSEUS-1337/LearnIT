    "content": "The \"Preserve Access to Care in the Home (PATCH) Act of 1999\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and purposes. The \"PATCH Act of 1999\" acknowledges the importance of home health services under the Medicare program, highlighting their role in allowing homebound individuals to remain in their own homes. It also recognizes the unintended payment disparities for home health services between regions, affecting both efficient, low-cost agencies in rural areas and the care of medically complex patients. The frequency and volume of prepayment medical reviews and administrative changes have devastated smaller home health agencies, leading to closures and service limitations. The upcoming 15 percent payment reduction will further restrict access to home health services, especially in rural areas. The Act aims to ensure access to care for high medical needs patients by allowing home health agencies to exclude complex patients from payment limits and receive cost-based reimbursement. It also seeks to eliminate the 15 percent payment reduction for home health services under Medicare and provide relief from administrative requirements for agencies with good compliance records and low claim denial rates. SEC. 3 eliminates the automatic 15 percent reduction in home health payments. It amends Section 4603 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and Section 1895(b)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act. SEC. 4 introduces outlier payments for home health services. Waiver of home health payment limits for outliers is amended to allow providers to exceed cost limits for individuals requiring specialized care. The Secretary may pay providers for individuals requiring specialized care whose costs significantly exceed limits due to unusual variations. Criteria for payment will be established, using data from provider cost reports. Providers can apply for payment at the end of the fiscal year reporting period. The Secretary may pay providers for individuals requiring specialized care with costs exceeding limits. Providers can apply for payment on a quarterly basis, effective September 30, 1999, for cost reporting periods ending after that date. SEC. 5 amends the definition of homebound in the Social Security Act, allowing individuals to leave home and clarifying absences. The amendments apply to items and services provided after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6 involves a review of claims submitted by home health agencies. Amendment to Section 1816(c)(2) of the Social Security Act requires home health agencies with a denial rate below 5% to have limited prepayment and post-payment reviews on claims submitted during the next cost reporting period. The amendment to Section 1816(c)(2) of the Social Security Act imposes a limit on the denial rate for home health agencies. The denial rate should not exceed 10% of the dollar value of services provided by the agency for which reimbursement claims are filed. The amendment sets a 10% limit on denial rates for home health agencies seeking reimbursement. It applies to agreements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 7 repeals Section 4603(b) of Public Law 105-33. SEC. 8 expresses Congress's view on implementing PPS for home health services. The Congress urges the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate payment for home health services, incentivize efficient service provision, and avoid discrimination against beneficiaries with complex medical conditions in the prospective payment system. Establish a nationally uniform process for fiscal intermediaries to provide timely and accurate coverage and payment information to home health agencies under the Medicare program. Assess the costs to home health agencies of implementing new regulations and interpretations associated with the prospective payment system for home health services. The government will assess the costs to home health agencies of implementing the prospective payment system for home health services and provide updates to Congress and agencies on the progress of implementation."
