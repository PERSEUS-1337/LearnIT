    "content": "The Act titled \"Safe Communities and Safe Schools Mercury Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 outlines the findings of the Act. The Congress finds that mercury is a bioaccumulative toxin with increased concentrations due to human activities, posing a significant public health threat. Common sources of mercury release include breakage and manufacturing of mercury-containing products. Mercury exposure poses a significant public health threat in the United States, particularly to fetuses, infants, and young children. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of women of childbearing age have mercury levels exceeding safe limits, putting approximately 60,000 babies at risk of developmental harm each year. Elevated mercury exposure from seafood is also linked to increased infertility risk in both men and women. Mercury pollution is widespread, with various sources contributing to its release. Mercury pollution is widespread in the United States, with 43 states issuing fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination. The number of mercury advisories has increased by 138% from 1994 to 2002, covering 12,000,000 lake acres and 470,000 river miles. Mercury from thermometers contributes 17 tons to solid waste annually, and mercury spills in schools have led to costly clean-ups. Mercury spill in Washington, D.C. in September 2003 cost over $1,000,000 to clean up and led to a temporary school closure. Mercury-containing thermostats typically contain 3 grams of mercury, enough to poison a 60-acre lake for a year. The grant program is outlined in Section 3. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will establish a program to provide renewable grants for projects aimed at reducing mercury pollution, educating communities about mercury's harmful effects, and eliminating mercury from schools. The program will also include a mercury thermometer exchange program. The Administrator will establish procedures for selecting grant recipients based on project strengths, design, staff competency, resources, project duration, and budget. Grant funds can be used for recycling programs if over 50% of materials recycled. The program allows for recycling of materials, with over 50% being mercury. Administrative expenses are limited to 10% of the appropriated amount. $75,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2008, with 40% reserved for specific projects in the first 3 years. SEC. 4. SALE OF THERMOMETERS; THERMOSTAT REPLACEMENT AND RECYCLING. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to include regulations on the sale of thermometers and thermostat replacement and recycling, specifically addressing mercury. Effective 180 days after enactment, the sale of mercury fever thermometers to consumers is restricted to prescription only. Manufacturers must provide clear instructions on handling and cleanup. Two years after enactment, contractors replacing building thermostats must recycle the old thermostats through an established program. Manufacturers of building thermostats must establish recycling programs for old thermostats and educate sellers and installers about the program. A conforming amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act requires this action. The Administrator will publish guidance to help schools remove mercury within a year of the Act's enactment. Thermostats, computers, and vehicles are not included in this guidance. The Administrator will provide annual reports to Congress on the progress of mercury reduction efforts, including State-by-State summaries, grant information, and successful programs. The annual reports to Congress will include State-by-State summaries of mercury reduction efforts, grant information, successful programs, detailed financial reporting of administration costs, coordination progress between Federal and State Governments, and recommendations for improving the administration of the Act. The Administrator must issue regulations within 3 years requiring dentists to install devices capturing 90% of mercury-laden amalgam during procedures, with possible waivers for obstacles or financial harm."
