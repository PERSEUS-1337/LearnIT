    "content": "The Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) program offers long-term, low-interest loans to railroad operators for improving rail infrastructure. Congress has authorized $35 billion in loan authority for the program, but freight railroads have been relatively unenthusiastic. RRIF has made 37 loans to 29 operators totaling $5.4 billion since 2000. Private railroads' total investment in structures and equipment from 2000 to 2015 was approximately $154 billion, with RRIF supplying less than 1% of their capital expenditures. Sponsors of intercity passenger rail projects have shown increasing interest in the program. The RRIF program primarily funds passenger rail projects, with loans to Amtrak representing almost 60% of the total nominal loan amount. Changes in the FAST Act aimed to make the program more attractive, but the elimination of the requirement for the U.S. Department of Transportation to refund borrowers' credit risk premiums may deter potential applicants. The RRIF program has undergone changes to make it more attractive for funding passenger rail and transit projects. However, the prospect of large loans for private projects raises concerns about potential risks, as these projects may not generate revenue to service their loans. The railroad industry has evolved significantly since the program's inception in 1976, with deregulation leading to mergers and consolidation of carriers. The railroad industry has evolved significantly since deregulation in 1976, leading to mergers and consolidation of carriers. This resulted in a handful of Class I carriers operating across many states, while smaller short line railroads, classified as Class II and Class III carriers, have increased to over 560. The Class I railroads focus on main lines, selling off unprofitable routes, while short line railroads work closely with shippers to build business. Short line railroads have limited financing options compared to Class I railroads, but some have easier access to private financing through holding companies or relationships with Class I railroads. Amtrak operates at a loss and relies on federal grants to continue operations. Amtrak relies on federal grants to operate, with a primary service corridor in the Northeast Corridor. There is a $38 billion backlog in infrastructure investment needed for the aging NEC. The RRIF program provides credit assistance for rail infrastructure projects. The RRIF program offers credit assistance for rail infrastructure projects, including direct loans and loan guarantees. It replaced a program from 1976 and has a total debt cap of $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for smaller freight railroads. The RRIF program offers credit assistance for rail infrastructure projects, including direct loans and loan guarantees. Projects eligible for RRIF assistance include acquiring, improving, and rehabilitating track, bridges, rail yards, buildings, and shops; preconstruction activities; positive train control; transit-oriented development projects; and new rail or intermodal facilities. Loans can be for up to 100% of the project cost, with repayment periods up to 35 years. The program had issued less than $1 billion in loans at one point, and in 2015, new types of security were added to reduce credit risk premiums. The RRIF program offers credit assistance for rail infrastructure projects, including direct loans and loan guarantees. Applicants are charged a fee of 0.5% of the amount requested for processing. Borrowers also pay a credit risk premium based on factors like financial condition and collateral. Congress raised the maximum loan amount from $3.5 billion to $35 billion in 2005. The upfront costs of a RRIF loan may deter applicants compared to the TIFIA program, which covers the credit risk premium for loan recipients. The RRIF program, part of the DOT's credit programs, offers low-interest loans for rail infrastructure projects. Applicants pay a processing fee and credit risk premium, with loan approval granted by the Secretary of Transportation. Borrowers can defer repayment for six years, with interest accruing during this period. The program allows borrowing at the lowest federal government rate for an extended period. The Build America Bureau can guarantee private loans at a reasonable rate determined by DOT, with no guarantees provided so far. Congress has imposed restrictions on the program, favoring projects that enhance public safety, promote economic development, and more. The RRIF program aims to enhance rail service, increase transit-oriented development, and alleviate rail capacity problems. It has a lending authority of up to $35 billion, with only 11% currently committed. As of January 2018, 37 loans totaling $5.4 billion have been issued, with $4.02 billion outstanding. Two-thirds of the loans were executed before 2008, and four have been approved since 2012. The RRIF program has a lending authority of up to $35 billion, with 37 loans totaling $5.4 billion issued as of January 2018. Two-thirds of the loans were executed before 2008, and four have been approved since 2012. Public-sector entities are the largest borrowers, with most loans intended for passenger rail projects. The RRIF program provides long-term, low-cost financing for railroad companies, especially small ones. FRA found that short line railroads have improved safety records, with a significant decrease in infrastructure-related accidents between 2001 and 2013. The FRA reported a positive trend in decreasing accident rates for short line railroads, indicating improved maintenance and investment. Short line infrastructure has been upgraded to handle 286,000-pound rail cars, with 57% of total route-miles capable of accommodating these heavier loads in 2010. This shows that carriers are enhancing their systems to meet customer needs. Short line railroads estimated $6.9 billion investment needs for infrastructure and equipment from 2013 to 2017. They expected to cover 70-75% of costs from revenues, with the rest from state and federal grants. There was a yearly gap of $265 million in funding. RRIF and other programs help reduce investment costs for railroads. The tax credit for short line railroads, enacted in 2004, allows them to reduce taxes by 50% of track maintenance expenses, up to a certain limit. The cost to the federal government is estimated at $165-$202 million per year. Unlike the RRIF program, this tax credit is exclusive to short line railroads and expired in 2016. Legislation to extend the credit has been introduced in Congress. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend the tax credit for short line railroads, which allows them to reduce taxes by 50% of track maintenance expenses. The National Infrastructure Investment discretionary grant program, known as the TIGER grant program, has made over $5 billion in grants through FY2017. Grants require a 20% match in urbanized areas and no local match in rural areas. Passenger and freight rail infrastructure projects are eligible for TIGER funds, with freight rail projects receiving nearly $810 million in grants. The TIFIA loan program, authorized by Congress in 1998, has assisted 56 projects with a total value of over $82 billion as of the end of 2016. The program has provided more than $20 billion in federal credit assistance at a cost of over $1 billion. Eligible projects include rail and intermodal freight transfer facilities, with no TIFIA loans approved for pure rail projects. Congress appropriates funding to cover the program's costs. In the FAST Act, Congress authorized $1.435 billion through FY2020 to administer the TIFIA program and cover the credit risk premium. This funding allowed for about $14 billion in TIFIA loans or loan guarantees from FY2016 through FY2020. States have also established programs to assist short line railroads with financing infrastructure or equipment purchases. FRA reported on funding sources for Class II and Class III railroads, noting that short line railroads expected to fund their needs through various means. Short line railroads expect to receive more funding for infrastructure and equipment investments from state programs (9%) than from federal programs (8%). The primary competition for these railroads is the trucking industry, influenced by regulations and taxation. Trucks use publicly provided infrastructure, causing more damage to highways than they pay in fuel taxes. Congress exemptions on truck weights increase trucking productivity over railroads. Congress could help short line and regional railroads by increasing fuel taxes on heavy trucks to cover the damage they cause to highways and limiting exemptions on truck weight restrictions. These changes may benefit Class I railroads but could raise shipping costs for trucks, impacting industry employment. Higher truck rates could also allow railroads to raise their own rates, affecting rail shippers. The effectiveness of the RRIF program is questioned, as railroads have utilized only a small portion of the available loans. The RRIF program has not been very effective, with only a small portion of the $35 billion loan authority being used. Congress wants the program to be utilized more, especially by short line railroads. The program's unattractiveness may be due to the uncertain loan review process, high applicant costs, and compliance requirements for loan recipients. The RRIF program's unattractiveness may be due to compliance requirements like the National Environmental Protection Act and \"Buy America\" requirements, leading to incomplete loan applications and a lengthy review process, discouraging potential applicants. The RRIF program's management was transferred to the Build America Bureau, which published a guide to its credit programs in January 2017. As of January 1, 2018, the Bureau had five draft loan applications under review for 5 to 19 months. Despite efforts to shorten the review process, it may still be lengthy. Federal law mandates that federal credit programs operate at no cost to the government, with primary costs being program administration and potential borrower defaults. The RRIF program charges a nonrefundable fee to loan applicants for program administration. A credit risk premium is required to cover potential defaults, calculated based on borrower's financial soundness and collateral. Amtrak paid 4.424% and 5.8% credit risk premiums for its RRIF loans. Amtrak paid a 4.424% credit risk premium for its 2011 RRIF loan and 5.8% for its 2016 RRIF loan. Some short line railroads were discouraged from applying to the RRIF program due to the credit risk premium. FRA stated it cannot subsidize the premium without congressional action. Congress has included provisions in DOT appropriations bills barring the use of federal funds to pay the credit risk premium. Prior to the FAST Act, DOT was required to refund the premium to borrowers after all loans in their cohort had been repaid. As of January 2018, DOT has not defined a \"cohort of loans,\" resulting in 21 RRIF loans being repaid without returning credit risk premiums to borrowers. The FAST Act repealed the requirement for DOT to repay credit risk premiums for future loans, leaving it up to DOT's discretion. DOT has decided not to refund premiums for loans made after the FAST Act, but borrowers who repaid their RRIF loans before the Act may be eligible for refunds according to the conference committee report. The DOT will refund credit risk premiums to borrowers who have repaid their RRIF loans, regardless of whether the loan was part of a cohort. This provision aims for the Secretary to repay the premium with interest within three months of enactment. However, despite being two years since the report adoption, no refunds have been issued yet. Loan applicants must adhere to federal laws like NEPA, Buy America requirements, and prevailing wage regulations. The RRIF program was established to primarily support projects with government loans. The RRIF program was created to support freight rail service, but a significant portion of assistance has gone to passenger rail projects. The largest recipients of assistance have been Amtrak and the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Administration. Over four-fifths of the total assistance has gone to passenger rail projects. Larger loan amounts for passenger projects may be due to smaller projects by short line railroads and a lack of alternative funding sources for intercity passenger rail projects. The lack of alternative funding sources for intercity passenger rail projects led to significant interest in grants for high-speed and intercity passenger rail projects. Congress provided minimal funding for intercity passenger rail service expansion from 2010 to 2017, prompting organizations to turn to RRIF as a supplemental funding source. However, lending to intercity passenger rail projects poses challenges as these projects often do not generate enough operating profit to cover their capital costs. Amtrak, the federally owned intercity passenger railroad operator, has received over half of the funds loaned by the RRIF program. Amtrak has repaid two loans and is scheduled to begin repaying the 2016 loan in 2022. The railroad relies on an annual appropriation of approximately $1.4 billion from Congress to continue operating, despite earning an operating profit on its Northeast Corridor operations. The ability to repay the RRIF loan depends on receiving other federal funds. RRIF also extended a $155 million loan to the Denver Union Station Project Authority in 2010 for the reconstruction of Denver Union Station. The Denver Union Station Project Authority received a $155 million RRIF loan in 2010 for station reconstruction, repaid in 2017 with tax-increment revenue. Private entities have shown interest in RRIF loans for passenger rail projects, with All Aboard Florida applying for a $1.87 billion loan for Miami to Orlando service but later seeking alternative financing. The Florida Development Finance Corporation issued $1.75 billion in private activity bonds to a company for rail upgrades and a new high-speed line from Miami to Orlando. XpressWest applied for a $5.5 billion RRIF loan but faced difficulties meeting requirements and the loan was suspended. The Texas Central Railway is considering seeking a loan from the RRIF or TIFIA programs for a high-speed line between Dallas and Houston, but is currently ineligible. FRA has not approved any RRIF loans to private passenger rail operators yet. RRIF loans for freight projects typically improve existing revenue-generating railroads, while private passenger rail projects may involve new services on new tracks. Rail projects under development involve new services on unbuilt tracks, posing a risk of loss if not completed."
