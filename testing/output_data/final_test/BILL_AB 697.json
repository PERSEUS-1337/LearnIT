    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature finds that California's seniors have the highest poverty rate in the nation, with 20% of adults over 65 living below the poverty threshold. Homelessness among seniors is projected to increase significantly, and Los Angeles County saw a 29.1% rise in homeless individuals aged 62 and older. California is ranked as the second least affordable state for housing. According to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, fair market rent in California for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,341 a month. Three out of the 10 most expensive metropolitan areas and six out of the 10 most expensive counties nationally are in California. To address the growing numbers of homeless senior citizens being priced out of their homes, California is exploring a personal income tax credit as a potential solution. A new section, 17053, is added to the Revenue and Taxation Code, allowing a tax credit for qualified taxpayers aged 62 or older who rent a residence with an increase in rent compared to the previous year. The taxpayer must have an annual household income of $50,000 or less, with over one-third spent on rent. A tax credit is available for qualified taxpayers aged 62 or older who rent a residence in specific counties. The credit can be carried over if it exceeds the net tax and will expire on December 1, 2019. This act amends Section 1101.5 of the Civil Code. Section 1101.5 of the Civil Code requires the replacement of noncompliant plumbing fixtures in multifamily residential and commercial properties with water-conserving fixtures by January 1, 2019. Owners or their agents can enter the property to install, repair, test, and maintain these fixtures as needed. On and after January 1, 2019, water-conserving plumbing fixtures must be operating at the manufacturer's rated water consumption when the tenant takes possession. Tenants must notify the owner if fixtures are not operating correctly. Noncompliant plumbing fixtures in multifamily and commercial properties must be replaced with water-conserving fixtures by January 1, 2014. For building additions increasing floor area by over 10%, all noncompliant plumbing fixtures must be replaced. For alterations exceeding $150,000, noncompliant fixtures in the specific area must be replaced. Any room alterations requiring a permit with noncompliant fixtures necessitate replacement of all fixtures in that room. On and after January 1, 2019, sellers of multifamily or commercial properties must disclose noncompliant plumbing fixtures to buyers in writing. This disclosure is required for final permit approval by the local building department."
