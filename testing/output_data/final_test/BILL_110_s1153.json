    "content": "The Act titled \"Small Business Regulatory Review Act of 2007\" includes findings. Congress finds that a vibrant small business sector is crucial for job creation in the economy. Federal regulations have imposed unnecessary burdens on small businesses, despite requirements to consider their scale and resources. A report in 2004 highlighted the high per-employee cost of Federal regulations for small firms. The per-employee cost of Federal regulations for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees is $7,647, 44.8% higher than businesses with 500 or more workers. Federal agencies have not explored less costly regulatory approaches as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The regulatory environment for small businesses should be made more manageable. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Board,\" \"Commission,\" and \"small business concern.\" SEC. 4. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS REQUIRED. Before approving any final rule of the Board, the Commission must conduct an analysis in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. SEC. 5. SMALL BUSINESS COMPLIANCE GUIDE REQUIRED. The Commission is required to publish a small business compliance guide in conjunction with the final rule issued to implement section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, a study and report on the effects on small business concerns is mandated. The Comptroller General of the United States will assess the impact of regulatory and auditing requirements on small businesses two years after the final rules for section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are published. The assessment will quantify the effects on small business concerns and be modeled on a previous investigation into regulatory burdens. The Comptroller General of the United States will evaluate the regulatory burdens on small businesses, including costs, time commitments, and compliance assistance from the Commission and the Board. Recommendations for simplifying compliance with regulatory requirements will be provided. The Comptroller General will evaluate regulatory burdens on small businesses and provide recommendations for simplifying compliance. The report will be submitted to relevant committees and made available to the public."
