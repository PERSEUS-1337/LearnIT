TRANSFER OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE ENTITLEMENT: Members of the Armed Forces with at least six years of service can transfer a portion of their educational assistance to dependents. Members of the Armed Forces with at least six years of service can transfer a portion of their educational assistance to eligible dependents, including their spouse, children, or a combination of both. The total number of months transferable cannot exceed one quarter of the aggregate number of months of basic educational assistance. Members of the Armed Forces can transfer their educational assistance to eligible dependents by designating the number of months to be transferred and specifying the recipients. The transfer must not exceed one quarter of the total months of educational assistance available. An individual entitled to transfer basic educational assistance can do so at any time, regardless of their current military status. They also have the ability to modify or revoke the transfer of unused entitlement. The use of transferred educational assistance will be deducted from the individual's entitlement. The transfer of educational entitlement allows an individual to transfer their benefits to a dependent, who will receive the same rate of educational assistance as the transferor. The monthly rate of assistance for the dependent is based on the current rate at the time of use. The death of the transferor does not impact the dependent's use of the transferred entitlement. The transfer of educational entitlement allows a dependent to use the benefits until the age of 26. The administrative provisions apply, and the dependent is treated as the eligible veteran. The entitlement can be used for pursuing a secondary school diploma. Overpayment may occur in certain circumstances. When educational entitlement is transferred, the dependent and the transferring individual are jointly liable for any overpayment. If the transferring individual fails to complete the agreed service, the transferred entitlement used by a dependent will be considered an overpayment. This does not apply if the individual fails to complete the agreed service. The Secretary of Defense will prescribe regulations for transferring educational entitlement, specifying the process for modifying or revoking a transfer and the administrative provisions applicable to dependents. The term 'Secretary concerned' is defined in this section, specifying the responsibilities of the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense. Additionally, funds for increased usage are sourced from section 3035(b)(4) of title 38, United States Code. Title 38, United States Code, is amended to include \"3020A\" after \"section 3020\". Section 2006(b)(2)(D) of title 10, United States Code, is also amended in a similar manner. The table of sections in chapter 30 of title 38, United States Code, is updated to reflect these changes. Transfer of entitlement to basic educational assistance is expanded for certain members of the Armed Forces who agree to additional service, as well as for members with critical military skills."
