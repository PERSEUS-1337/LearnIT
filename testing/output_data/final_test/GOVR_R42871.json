    "content": "The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was passed in 2005 to shield federally licensed manufacturers, dealers, and sellers of firearms or ammunition from civil actions related to criminal misuse. The act includes exceptions for maintaining civil suits but requires immediate dismissal of lawsuits brought by shooting victims and municipalities. It was enacted to address the tactic of inhibiting the flow of firearms into illegal markets through civil suits against out-of-state manufacturers and sellers. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) was passed in 2005 to shield firearms industry from lawsuits related to criminal misuse. Senator Larry E. Craig sponsored the legislation to stop politically-motivated lawsuits against the industry, while opponents like Dennis Henigan argued against it. The Brady Legal Action Project opposes the PLCAA, stating it protects irresponsible gun dealers and makers of defective guns from liability. The main provision of the PLCAA prohibits qualified civil liability actions in Federal or State courts. Such actions are defined as lawsuits against manufacturers or sellers of firearms for damages resulting from criminal or unlawful misuse of their products. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) prohibits qualified civil liability actions in courts, but it is unclear if it applies to administrative proceedings. The statute lists exceptions, including lawsuits against transferors convicted under specific laws. The PLCAA prohibits civil liability actions against firearm transferors convicted of specific crimes, with unclear requirements for the transferee's conviction. The second exception may exclude some manufacturers from liability for negligent entrustment or negligence per se. The PLCAA provides immunity from suits for negligent entrustment or negligence per se to firearm sellers, including dealers engaged in the business of selling firearms. Federal regulations exempt firearms manufacturers from obtaining a dealer's license under certain conditions, potentially excluding them from the definition of \"seller.\" The PLCAA provides immunity for firearm sellers from negligent entrustment suits. State law allows claims of negligent entrustment against both retail dealers and manufacturers. However, federal definitions may exclude manufacturers from liability if they are exempt from obtaining a dealer's license. Manufacturers exempt from federal dealer's license requirements are not considered sellers under PLCAA, remaining immune from negligent entrustment suits. Licensed manufacturers may be subject to such suits. \"Negligence per se\" could apply, where violation of legislation or regulation automatically deems one negligent. The second exception of the PLCAA allows a plaintiff to proceed if the seller violated a statute that holds one strictly liable. The third exception, known as the \"predicate exception,\" requires the plaintiff to claim that the manufacturer or seller knowingly committed an act. The PLCAA's third exception allows a plaintiff to proceed if they claim the manufacturer or seller knowingly violated a statute. In City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., the court ruled that the criminal nuisance law cited by the city did not meet the Act's predicate exception criteria. The Second Circuit ruled that the New York criminal nuisance law cited by the City did not meet the PLCAA's predicate exception criteria for lawsuits against firearms suppliers. The court clarified that the exception includes statutes that expressly regulate firearms or have been declared by courts to apply to the sale and marketing of firearms. The Ninth Circuit in Ileto v. Glock rejected the claim that California's public nuisance statutes can be predicate statutes under the PLCAA's third exception. The court found that the term \"'applicable' has a spectrum of meanings, including the two poles identified by the parties.\" The PLCAA preempts common law claims, such as general tort theories of liability, even if codified by state law. The Ninth Circuit in Ileto v. Glock rejected the claim that California's public nuisance statutes can be predicate statutes under the PLCAA's third exception. The court declined to outline the types of laws that might be acceptable as predicate statutes under the exception, and federal courts have rejected criminal and public nuisance laws as statutes that would be encompassed by the predicate exception. However, the State of Indiana court of appeals in Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City of Gary, Indiana reached the opposite conclusion, finding that the term \"applicable\" is not limited to statutes regulating the sale or marketing of firearms. The court in City of Gary v. Smith & Wesson Corp. found that Indiana's public nuisance statute could apply to the sale or marketing of firearms, even without requiring an underlying violation of a statute directly applicable to firearms sales. The Ninth Circuit in Ileto v. Glock disagreed with this interpretation, stating that the City of Gary case was of limited persuasive value due to differences in the alleged violations of state firearms regulations. The New York State appellate division in Williams v. Beemiller, Inc. allowed a civil suit against a manufacturer, distributor, and dealer to proceed under the predicate exception, based on allegations of intentional violations of firearms laws. The court held that the claims were not barred by the PLCAA because the plaintiffs had alleged facts supporting a finding that the defendants knowingly violated the Gun Control Act. The court in Williams v. Beemiller, Inc. allowed a civil suit to proceed under the predicate exception, alleging intentional violations of firearms laws. The plaintiffs must demonstrate that the defendants knowingly violated the Gun Control Act and that it was the \"proximate cause\" of their injuries. If successful, this case could open the door to more civil litigation against licensed firearms suppliers. The fourth and fifth exceptions allow breach of contract or warranty actions against a seller and tort actions for design or manufacturing defects. There is an exception to the fifth exception, barring suits if a criminal act caused the product discharge, being the sole cause of injuries or damages. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) includes exceptions for breach of contract or warranty actions against a seller and tort actions for design or manufacturing defects. One exception bars suits if a criminal act caused the product discharge, being the sole cause of injuries or damages. Questions arise regarding whether committing the offense constitutes a \"volitional act\" immunizing the manufacturer from suit and the standard of proof required in civil suits for proving a criminal offense. The last exception allows the Attorney General to enforce the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act against federal firearms licensees. In the past year, at least one court has allowed a lawsuit to proceed under the Gun Control Act as a predicate statute for a state tort law claim against a federal firearms licensee. The success of the plaintiffs in proving their claims will depend on the discovery process and potential procedural obstacles they may face.
