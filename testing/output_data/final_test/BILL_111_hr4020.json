    "content": "The \"Guaranteed Access to Health Insurance Act of 2009\" ensures affordability for all through special pooling of the cost of high-risk individuals. The \"Guaranteed Access to Health Insurance Act of 2009\" encourages states to establish financial backstops for high-risk individuals through reinsurance programs or high-risk pools. States with programs meeting certain requirements will receive preference for competitive grants. The \"Qualified State Reinsurance Program\" is a state-operated or authorized program that provides reinsurance for health insurance coverage in the individual and small group markets. It can offer reinsurance on a prospective or retrospective basis, protect health insurance issuers against annual spending of enrollees, and provide purchase protection against individual catastrophic costs. Additionally, a \"Qualifying State High Risk Pool\" is a section 2745 qualified program for high-risk individuals. A section 2745 qualified high risk pool must meet requirements such as no lifetime coverage cap, incorporating Federal or State programs for low-income individuals, offering various coverage types including a high deductible health plan with a health savings account, and eliminating waiting lists and pre-existing condition exclusions. The high risk pool provides coverage for individuals who would be eligible for Medicare but for a disability waiting period. It must not charge more than 150 percent of the average premium in the state's individual market. Education and outreach initiatives are conducted to inform residents and insurance brokers about the pool's availability. States can use funds for the transition. A State can use existing funding sources to transition from a high-risk pool to a reinsurance program. The high-risk pool should have a stable funding source not solely reliant on state legislature appropriations. Section 2745 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to adjust funding allocations. The Public Health Service Act is amended to adjust funding allocations among qualifying States applying for grants to support high-risk pools. The definition in subsection (g)(1) is updated to ensure stable funding for transitioning to a reinsurance program. The enactment of the Guaranteed Access to Health Insurance Act of 2009 defines a qualified high risk pool as meeting specific requirements. The Secretary has the authority to waive certain requirements for innovative programs and coverage of high-risk individuals. The Secretary may waive requirements for coverage of high-risk individuals if a State provides a financial backstop. Seed grants of up to $5,000,000 are given to States without a high-risk pool. Verification of citizenship or alien qualification is required. Verification of citizenship or alien qualification is required for participation in State high risk pools or reinsurance programs funded under this section. States must certify that applicants provide documentation of citizenship or nationality and identity. The Secretary must maintain records for determining citizenship or nationality once for each individual. Definitions include terms like \"health insurance coverage\" and \"health insurance issuer\" as defined in the Public Health Service Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out the requirements. Authorization of Appropriations: $20,000,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated starting in 2010 for carrying out section 2745 of the Public Health Service Act. Funds allocated for this purpose must adhere to the proportions required under subsection (d)(2) of such section."
