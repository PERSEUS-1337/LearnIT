    "content": "The Act titled \"Animal Disease Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001\" is established for the purpose of addressing findings related to animal diseases. Congress finds that it is crucial to maintain healthy livestock herds in the United States to prevent devastating financial losses in the agriculture industry and other economic sectors due to diseases like foot and mouth disease. Foot and mouth disease can be eradicated by slaughtering affected animals. The virus can be reintroduced through infected animals, animal products, or acts of terrorism. The disease spreads quickly through aerosols, direct contact, and contaminated items. It is endemic to more than two-thirds of the world. Foot and mouth disease is widespread in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America, with over 7 serotypes and 60 subtypes. The United States has banned imports from affected countries and recent outbreaks in Argentina, the European Union, and Taiwan are straining exclusion programs that have kept the disease out since 1929. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a neuro-degenerative disease in cattle, was first widely found in 1986 in the United Kingdom. The disease is fatal to cattle within weeks of onset and has been found in several countries in Europe. Since 1989, the importation of live grazing animals from countries with bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been prohibited by the Secretary of Agriculture. Other products derived from grazing animals are also restricted, with exceptions for scientific purposes. These restrictions were extended to all European countries in 1997. The Secretary of Agriculture extended restrictions to all European countries due to concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, a human spongiform encephalopathy, was identified in 10 cases in the UK in 1996. The possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is being studied by various organizations. From October 1996 to December 2000, cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported in the UK, France, and Ireland. Measures have been taken in the US to reduce the risk of human spongiform encephalopathies, including banning blood donations from individuals who lived in Great Britain for at least 180 days since 1980 and prohibiting the feeding of animal-derived proteins to grazing animals. The purpose of this Act is to provide information on actions by Federal agencies to prevent foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases, legislative authority to control these diseases, economic impacts, and risks to public health. The Act aims to report to Congress on actions taken by Federal agencies to prevent foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases, as well as the legislative authority, economic impacts, and risks to public health. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a preliminary report within 30 days of the Act's enactment to assess and prevent foot and mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the US, provide public information sources, and identify any immediate legislative needs. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a preliminary report within 30 days to assess and prevent foot and mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the US. The final report must be submitted to specific committees in Congress within 180 days. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a final report within 180 days to Congress on the economic impacts and risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the US, along with recommendations for protection. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a final report to Congress within 180 days on the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in domestic and imported livestock, along with recommendations to reduce and manage these risks. The final report to Congress must include a description of the incidence and prevalence of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and related diseases in other countries, as well as an analysis of the effectiveness of measures taken to assess and control these risks globally. The final report to Congress must include measures taken to prevent and control foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United States, including controls at ports of entry and other conveyances. Additionally, it should describe measures to prevent transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease through blood collection and transfusion, as well as any planning or managerial initiatives by Federal agencies to assess, prevent, and control these risks. The report must include plans by Federal agencies to monitor and assess the transmission of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, and related diseases in the United States. Plans by Federal agencies to conduct research programs into the causes and transmission of foot and mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy, as well as develop diagnostic tools and preventive measures for these diseases. The curr_chunk discusses plans for compensation for animals affected by foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the US. It also includes recommendations to Congress for legislation to improve efforts in assessing, preventing, and controlling these diseases. The Secretary consults with various federal agencies and experts in preparing reports on compensation for animals affected by diseases like foot and mouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The Secretary consults with private and nonprofit sector experts in infectious disease, research, prevention, and control, international, State, and local governmental animal health officials, private, nonprofit, and public sector livestock experts, representatives of blood collection and distribution entities, and representatives of consumer and patient organizations."
