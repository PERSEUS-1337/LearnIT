    "content": "Medicaid is a jointly funded program by the federal government and states that provides medical services, including long-term care. States have the flexibility to design their own versions of Medicaid, leading to variability in eligibility levels and covered services. Recent changes will expand coverage to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government and states jointly fund Medicaid, providing medical services including long-term care. Recent changes expand coverage for individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The federal government pays a share of Medicaid costs, with states contributing the rest to qualify for federal funds. The FMAP rate determines the federal share of Medicaid expenditures, varying by state and set by statute. Other FMAP-related issues include changes in the ACA, deficit reduction proposals, and disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment. The FMAP rate reimburses states for most Medicaid expenditures, with exceptions for certain states, situations, populations, providers, and services. An enhanced FMAP rate is provided for services and administration under CHIP, funded by a state's federal allotment. When a state expands Medicaid using CHIP funds, the E-FMAP rate applies, calculated by reducing the state share under the regular FMAP rate by 30%. The FMAP rate is also used for Medicare Part D clawback, child support enforcement collections, TANF funds, and CCDF. The FMAP formula determines reimbursement rates for states based on per capita income relative to the U.S. average. It ensures higher reimbursement for states with lower incomes and lower reimbursement for states with higher incomes. The formula includes a 0.45 factor to maintain a 55% FMAP rate for states with average income. The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) publishes FMAP rates. The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) publishes FMAP rates for states based on per capita income data from previous years. The lag between announcement and implementation allows states to adjust to rate changes. The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides per capita personal income data for 2009-2011, using a three-year average to moderate fluctuations in FMAP rates. BEA revises income estimates annually and undergoes comprehensive data revisions every few years. Components of personal income include earnings, dividends, interest, rent, and transfer receipts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) provides per capita personal income data, including earnings, dividends, interest, rent, and transfer receipts. Annual revisions may cause changes in state per capita personal income values over time. NIPA definition of personal income used by BEA differs from the definition for personal income tax purposes, excluding capital gains and including transfer receipts. The FMAP formula for states' funding rates is influenced by factors like state economy structure and response to economic changes. National economic shifts impact states differently based on their industries, such as automobile manufacturing. Per capita personal income compared to the U.S. average is also a key factor in the FMAP formula. The FMAP formula for states' funding rates is affected by state responses to economic changes. National economic shifts impact states differently based on their industries. Per capita personal income compared to the U.S. average plays a significant role in determining FMAP rates, with state FMAP rates potentially changing significantly due to these comparisons. Annual revisions of income data and comprehensive NIPA revisions every four to five years can also influence FMAP rates. The impact of changes in personal income definitions on FMAP rates varies depending on their scope. Regular FMAP rates for FY2014 were published in the Federal Register on November 30, 2012. Table A-1 in the report's Appendix shows rates for each state from FY2006 to FY2014. In FY2014, 15 states will have the minimum FMAP rate of 50.00%, while Mississippi will have the highest rate at 73.05%. Changes in FMAP rates will affect 36 states from FY2013 to FY2014. In FY2014, FMAP rates for 15 states will remain the same, with most changes being less than one percentage point. 12 states will see an increase of up to one percentage point, while 16 states will see a decrease of up to one percentage point. Two states will have an increase greater than one percentage point, and six states will have a decrease greater than one percentage point. Nevada will have the largest increase at 3.36 percentage points, and South Dakota will have the largest decrease at 2.65 percentage points. Two states will have FY2014 FMAP rates calculated differently. In FY2014, FMAP rates for 15 states will remain the same, with minor changes. Some states will see slight increases or decreases, while Nevada will have the largest increase at 3.36 percentage points and South Dakota will have the largest decrease at 2.65 percentage points. The District of Columbia and Louisiana have FMAP rates set differently from the regular formula. Recent issues related to FMAP rates include changes in the ACA, federal deficit reduction proposals, and disaster-related FMAP adjustments. The ACA represents a significant reform to Medicaid, expanding coverage to all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. States were initially required to implement this expansion to receive federal Medicaid funding, but a Supreme Court decision in 2012 allowed states to opt out without losing existing funding. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows states to receive federal funding for expanding coverage to all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. States can refuse to implement the expansion without losing current federal Medicaid matching funds. The expansion is expected to increase Medicaid enrollment by 7 million in FY2014, leading to a significant increase in Medicaid expenditures covered mostly by the federal government. The ACA Medicaid expansion allows states to receive federal funding for expanding coverage to all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Newly eligible individuals will receive increased FMAP rates, starting at 100% and phasing down to 90% after 2019. The ACA's Medicaid expansion allows states to expand coverage to all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Newly eligible individuals will receive increased FMAP rates, starting at 100% and phasing down to 90% after 2019. Some states, known as \"Expansion States,\" already provide coverage to low-income individuals and will receive a higher FMAP rate. These states include Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. The ACA's Medicaid expansion allows states to cover all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. \"Expansion states\" like New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin will receive higher FMAP rates until 2019, when rates will equal those for newly eligible individuals. The ACA's Medicaid expansion allows states to cover all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. \"Expansion states\" will receive the higher FMAP rate for newly eligible individuals, including those previously covered by state-funded health benefits. Additionally, during CY2014 and CY2015, an FMAP rate increase of 2.2 percentage points is available for certain \"expansion states.\" The ACA allows states to expand Medicaid to cover all adults under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Vermont qualifies for an FMAP rate increase for non-newly eligible individuals. Other Medicaid changes include primary care payment rate increases, preventive services, smoking cessation services for pregnant women, and home and community-based services. The ACA implemented various provisions for Medicaid, including primary care payment rate increases, preventive services, and smoking cessation services for pregnant women. The E-FMAP rate for CHIP expenditures was increased by 23 percentage points, up to 100% for FY2016-FY2019. Federal government funds roughly 57% of Medicaid costs, with federal Medicaid expenditures accounting for almost 8% of all federal spending. Federal Medicaid expenditures make up almost 8% of all federal spending, with payments to states estimated at $276 billion in FY2013. The expansion of Medicaid eligibility under the ACA is expected to significantly increase federal Medicaid payments starting in FY2014. As a percentage of GDP, federal Medicaid expenditures are projected to rise from 1.7% in FY2013 to 2.4% in FY2022. Controlling federal Medicaid spending is a focus of deficit reduction proposals, with potential changes to the FMAP structure to reduce spending. The FMAP has a statutory maximum of 83% and a minimum of 50%. The CBO has provided estimates for deficit reduction options related to Medicaid spending. One deficit reduction option for Congress is to reduce federal Medicaid spending by lowering the statutory FMAP floor, potentially saving $20 billion in FY2020. This would impact states with FMAP rates of 50%, while the other states would not be affected. The ACA also introduced a disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment for states that have experienced major disasters. The disaster-recovery adjusted FMAP rate is available to states that have experienced a major disaster under the Stafford Act. The rate is determined based on the decline in the state's regular FMAP rate from the prior year. Initially, the FMAP rate includes a 50% increase for the first year and a 25% increase for subsequent years. The FMAP increase for disaster-recovery was revised by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, applying it to the regular FMAP rate for the second year onwards. Louisiana was the only state to qualify for the adjusted FMAP rate for FY2011 to FY2014. Louisiana's disaster-recovery adjusted FMAP rate for FY2011 was 68.04%, and for FY2012 it was 61.09%. The state qualified for the adjusted rate due to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Gustav. Louisiana's FY2012 disaster-recovery FMAP adjustment increased the total FMAP rate to 69.78%. In FY2013, the regular FMAP rate was 61.24%, lower than the adjusted rate for FY2012. The FMAP rate for FY2013 was increased to 65.51%. For FY2014, the regular FMAP rate was 60.98%, lower than the adjusted rate for FY2012, and increased to 62.11%. The FMAP rate for FY2014 will be 62.11%, with Mississippi having the highest rate at 73.05%. Changes in regular FMAP rates will occur for 36 states, while 15 states will remain the same. Exceptions to the regular FMAP rate have been made for certain states and populations, including newly eligible individuals, expansion states, and specified services. Federal Medicaid spending is a focus of deficit reduction proposals, with amending the FMAP structure as a way to reduce spending. In FY2014, FMAP rates range from 50% to 73%, with changes in rates for different states. All states with unchanged rates have the statutory minimum FMAP rate. In FY2014, FMAP rates range from 50% to 73% for different states. The 14 states with unchanged rates have a minimum FMAP rate of 50%, while the District of Columbia has a statutorily set rate of 70%."
