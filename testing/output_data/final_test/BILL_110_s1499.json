    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction Act of 2008\". Congress finds that emissions from marine vessels significantly contribute to air pollution in the US, current control levels are inadequate, federal intervention is needed to protect air quality, EPA must establish stricter emission standards for marine vessels entering US ports. The Environmental Protection Agency must set emission standards for marine vessels to reduce air pollutants and meet air quality standards nationwide. SEC. 3. MARINE VESSEL FUEL SULFUR. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to require marine vessels to use fuel with no more than 1,000 parts per million of sulfur in their engines by December 31, 2010. Marine vessels entering or leaving a port in the United States must comply with regulations on sulfur content in fuel within certain distances of the coastlines to protect public health and the environment. The Administrator may issue interim regulations to permit compliance with these requirements. The Administrator may issue regulations allowing marine vessels to exceed 1,000 parts per million sulfur content in fuel if compliance is not feasible by December 31, 2010. If this determination is made, vessels must use the lowest feasible sulfur quantity in fuel starting from that date. The Administrator may allow marine vessels to exceed 1,000 parts per million sulfur content in fuel if compliance is not feasible by December 31, 2010. In such cases, vessels must use a sulfur quantity not exceeding 2,000 parts per million and comply with the requirement as soon as technically feasible. An alternative compliance mechanism may be provided for vessels using control technology that reduces emissions to the same extent as sulfur reduction. The vessel must achieve emission reductions by complying with fuel sulfur content limitations. These reductions are additional to those required to meet engine emission standards. This subsection does not limit the Administrator's authority to regulate fuels for marine vessels or other nonroad vehicles. SEC. 4. ADVANCED MARINE VESSEL EMISSION CONTROLS. Section 213 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include regulations for emissions from oceangoing marine vessels, including standards for oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. The Administrator is required to establish these standards by December 15, 2008. The Clean Air Act amendment requires engines to achieve emission reduction through technology determined by the Administrator starting January 1, 2012. Factors considered include whether the engine is newly manufactured or in-use, and the age of the engine. The Clean Air Act amendment requires engines to achieve emission reduction through technology determined by the Administrator starting January 1, 2012. Factors considered include cost, noise, energy, safety, feasibility, benefits, and maximum control levels for on-road, nonroad, and stationary engines. The Clean Air Act amendment mandates engines to meet emission reduction standards using technology determined by the Administrator by January 1, 2012. Factors considered include cost, noise, energy, safety, feasibility, benefits, and maximum control levels for various types of engines. If the Administrator finds that the maximum control level specified will not be achievable by the deadline, adjustments may be made. The Administrator must establish emission reduction standards by January 1, 2012, that represent the highest level of control achievable. If this level is deemed unattainable, additional standards must be implemented by January 1, 2016. The Administrator must establish emission reduction standards by January 1, 2012, representing the highest achievable level of control. If not attainable, additional standards must be implemented by January 1, 2016, based on technical feasibility. The emission reduction standards must be technically achievable by the specified dates and enforced for vessels entering or leaving US ports, regardless of flag country. Enforcement will be carried out according to subsection (f) and may target owners or operators of in-use engines. The emission reduction standards apply to owners or operators of in-use engines, including those who rebuild or maintain them, as determined by the Administrator. This does not limit the Administrator's authority to regulate emissions from engines in marine vessels."
