    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 999.2 of the Military and Veterans Code is amended to require contracts awarded by state agencies to have statewide participation goals of at least 3 percent for disabled veteran business enterprises. This applies to various expenditures including construction, professional services, materials, supplies, equipment, alteration, repair, or improvement. In section 999.2 of the Military and Veterans Code, a \"broker\" or \"agent\" is defined as an individual or entity that does not have ownership of materials, supplies, services, or equipment provided to a state department unless certified disabled veterans have 51 percent ownership. \"Equipment\" refers to any equipment used or rented to state agencies, including those with operators provided. An \"equipment broker\" is a broker or agent who rents equipment to a state department. A disabled veteran business enterprise renting equipment to an awarding department will be considered an equipment broker unless disabled veterans own 51% of each piece of equipment. Disabled veteran owners must submit a declaration confirming their status and provide necessary information. Failure to submit tax returns will result in the disabled veteran business enterprise being classified as an equipment broker. A disabled veteran business enterprise renting equipment to an awarding department must submit a declaration signed by each disabled veteran owner and manager, confirming their status and providing necessary information. State funds spent on equipment rented from brokers under contracts awarded in this section will not count towards the 3-percent goal. A disabled veteran business enterprise acting as a broker or agent must disclose this information to the awarding department before performing the contract. The disclosure should be in a signed declaration by each disabled veteran owner and manager, identifying the principal. Additionally, at the time of certification, the enterprise and its owners must submit complete copies of federal income tax returns for the previous three years. A disabled veteran business enterprise and its owners must submit complete copies of federal income tax returns to the administering agency by the due date, including extensions. If the returns for the previous three years or postcertification years are missing, they have 90 days to submit them. A disabled veteran business enterprise must comply with certification requirements or face consequences, including being prohibited from state contracts until compliance is met. Failure to maintain certification must be reported promptly to the awarding department and administering agency."
