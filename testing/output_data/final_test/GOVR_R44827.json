    "content": "Law enforcement has been using keylogging programs to obtain encryption keys and access devices. In a 1999 case, the FBI physically installed a keylogger on a mob boss's computer to capture his encryption key. They later used a more advanced keylogger called Magic Lantern, which could be installed remotely and record browsing histories and passwords. Recently, authorities have been exploiting vulnerabilities in software like Tor to bypass protections and access encrypted data. The FBI has utilized exploits and malware in investigations, including using Network Investigative Techniques (NITs) to exploit vulnerabilities. In a specific case, the FBI traced a server hosting a child pornography website to Aaron McGrath in Nebraska and used a NIT in their investigation. The FBI used a Network Investigative Technique (NIT) to collect IP addresses of U.S. visitors to child pornography websites without hindering the functionality of their computers. The FBI used a Network Investigative Technique (NIT) to collect IP addresses of visitors to child pornography websites. They subpoenaed Internet Service Providers for physical addresses of the computers associated with the IP addresses, leading to arrests nationwide. In 2013, the FBI seized Freedom Hosting, a website hosting service on the Tor network with child pornography sites. The FBI infected the site with custom malware to identify visitors and reveal their real IP addresses. The FBI targeted users of specific Tor Mail email accounts linked to child pornography crimes and accessed 23 websites on Freedom Hosting. The exploit impacted both illegal and legitimate website visitors, with unknown innocent individuals affected. The FBI investigated a child pornography website called Playpen on the Dark Web with nearly 215,000 members. The FBI seized the server hosting Playpen in North Carolina and ran the website for two weeks from a server in Virginia. A search warrant allowed the use of a NIT to uncover 1,300 IP addresses, leading to criminal charges against over 185 individuals. The FBI conducted Operation Onymous to investigate Dark Web markets trading in illicit goods, leading to the takedown of Silk Road 2. Over 185 individuals faced criminal charges, with the FBI withholding details of the NIT used on the Playpen website. The DOJ seized 400 online user addresses and computer servers through legal processes and Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty Requests. Authorities did not disclose how they bypassed Tor's security and anonymity protections, keeping that information secret. Speculation suggests the FBI may have paid Carnegie Mellon researchers for an exploit technique to target dark websites, but the FBI denies this. Law enforcement has exploited vulnerabilities in websites, networks, hardware, and software to access information on devices, particularly after the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015. After the San Bernardino terrorist attack in 2015, the FBI recovered an iPhone belonging to one of the shooters. Despite Apple's refusal to assist, the FBI ultimately gained access to the phone's contents with the help of hackers, leading to the dropping of the case with Apple. The FBI did not disclose vulnerabilities to Apple that were used to access the San Bernardino iPhone. They cited not purchasing rights to the technical details. The Obama Administration established the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) to decide on disclosing discovered vulnerabilities. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) was initiated in 2008 by a presidential directive and is overseen by the White House's National Security Council. It is activated when a new hardware or software vulnerability is discovered by a federal government entity. The VEP requires the entity to classify the vulnerability and notify all participating entities. Subject matter experts then provide recommendations to the Executive Review Board, which ultimately decides how to handle the vulnerability. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) is overseen by the Executive Review Board, which decides how the government responds to vulnerabilities. There is an appeals process for entities with stakes in the vulnerability. Benefits and challenges arise from retaining and disclosing vulnerabilities, as noted by Michael Daniel. Daniel outlined factors considered when deciding to retain or disclose vulnerabilities, such as the system's importance, potential risks, harm adversaries could cause, likelihood of exploitation detection, intelligence necessity, alternative acquisition methods, temporary exploitation feasibility, and vulnerability discovery probability. In 2014, President Obama emphasized the importance of disclosing vulnerabilities for patching, except in cases of national security or law enforcement needs. The Trump Administration's stance on vulnerability disclosure remains uncertain. The federal government has a process for deciding whether to disclose vulnerabilities but lacks transparency on its frequency and the number of vulnerabilities retained. The NSA historically releases over 91% of discovered vulnerabilities after internal review. The NSA historically releases over 91% of vulnerabilities discovered in products that have gone through its internal review process in the United States. The remaining 9% of vulnerabilities were either patched by vendors or retained for national security purposes. It is unclear if the establishment of the interagency VEP has changed the proportion of disclosed vulnerabilities. Law enforcement's disclosure rate and process for vetting vulnerabilities are also uncertain. RAND researchers analyzed a dataset of over 200 zero-day software exploits to understand the vulnerabilities that a \"private use group\" may possess. Their findings suggest that about 5.7% of these vulnerabilities are discovered by outside entities after a year, indicating potential risks for government stockpiles of vulnerabilities. RAND researchers found that vulnerabilities held by a \"private use group\" may be discovered by outside entities, including other nations, after about a year. The average lifespan of a vulnerability in their dataset was 6.9 years before being patched or publicly disclosed, with 25% lasting 1.5 years or less and 25% lasting at least 9.5 years. This suggests that law enforcement or government entities could potentially exploit a vulnerability for up to 9.5 years before it is addressed. The debate around law enforcement use of vulnerabilities often focuses on zero-day exploits. The exploitation of known vulnerabilities by law enforcement is a significant issue, with some experts estimating that up to 3/4 of hacking incidents involve these vulnerabilities. Congress has even mandated certain vulnerabilities to exist for legal exploitation by law enforcement. This raises concerns about the use of outdated, unpatched technology by users, allowing for potential security breaches. Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA; P.L. 103-414) to help law enforcement maintain its ability to execute authorized electronic surveillance in a changing technology environment. CALEA requires that telecommunications carriers assist law enforcement in intercepting electronic communications with a valid legal order. The carriers must design systems that allow law enforcement to intercept wire and electronic communications and access call-identifying information. This ensures that content and call-identifying information can be accessed by law enforcement with a lawful court order. Officials and policymakers have largely moved away from the idea of introducing exploitable vulnerabilities into technology for law enforcement access. Research has not shown that granting exceptional access, which could introduce vulnerabilities only accessible by authorized actors, can be effectively controlled. One group of experts argues that providing exceptional access for law enforcement could lead to vulnerabilities that criminals and malicious actors could exploit. The debate on whether law enforcement should disclose zero-day vulnerabilities they discover lacks key data points. One key question is the effectiveness of using these vulnerabilities in developing law enforcement cases. The debate on whether law enforcement should retain knowledge of vulnerabilities and their exploits lacks quantitative analysis. Key questions include the reliance on technology vulnerabilities for evidence, the importance of evidence obtained through NITs, alternative tools for evidence collection, and the financial cost of developing exploits. The debate on the use of NITs in law enforcement raises concerns about the frequency of exploit usage, impact on innocent bystanders, narrow deployment of NITs, unintended weaknesses introduced, and unintentional collection of information. Some experts suggest supporting encryption while enhancing law enforcement capabilities for investigations in a technologically advanced environment. The debate on the use of NITs in law enforcement raises concerns about the impact of evolving technology and strong encryption. If law enforcement is unable to develop lawful hacking tools, there may be a push for legislative solutions mandating exceptional access to communications. This includes exploiting both publicly known and zero-day vulnerabilities, which could affect the ability of law enforcement to combat the challenges posed by advancing technology. Law enforcement's use of zero-day vulnerabilities is a different issue from the debate on NITs. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) could impact law enforcement's ability to combat going dark challenges. Disclosure of vulnerabilities through the VEP may limit law enforcement's timeframe to develop exploits, but it could also prevent malicious actors from exploiting the vulnerabilities. Law enforcement acquires vulnerability knowledge from various sources, including public databases, hackers, and vulnerabilities marketplaces. Law enforcement acquires zero-day vulnerabilities or exploits from various sources, including hackers, vulnerabilities marketplaces, and by developing tailored exploits. There is a concern that other entities may also discover the same vulnerabilities, making it crucial for law enforcement to act quickly. Acquiring knowledge of vulnerabilities and their exploits can be costly, with prices reaching $1 million on the black or grey markets. The federal government may spend more on assessing products for vulnerabilities than on purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities. Speculation surrounds the FBI's payment of around $1 million for an exploit to access data from a phone in the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Some speculate that federal law enforcement may spend around $1 million on acquiring information about vulnerabilities and their exploits. Policymakers are urged to consider allocating budgets for this purpose and focus on preventing exploits by strengthening security measures. FBI Director Comey emphasizes the need to be proactive in reducing vulnerabilities to prevent cyber incidents. Some suggest creating incentives for finding software vulnerabilities to prevent cyber incidents, such as establishing bug bounty programs. This approach, similar to law enforcement's Most Wanted program, could lead to information on vulnerabilities and their exploits. Policymakers may debate the cost-effectiveness of formalizing this process. Bug bounty programs offer rewards for identifying software vulnerabilities, with companies like Apple offering up to $200,000. The federal government has piloted bug bounty programs, such as the \"Hack the Pentagon\" initiative by the Department of Defense in 2016. This approach incentivizes hackers to report vulnerabilities directly to vendors or affected companies, rather than law enforcement. The government may support private sector bug bounty programs through federal grants, such as DOJ grants, to assist entities in sharing vulnerability information with law enforcement. Financial limitations could hinder the success of this initiative compared to private sector rewards. Grants could also help establish internal bug bounty programs to enhance cybersecurity against hackers and criminals. Two types of information sharing on vulnerabilities are of interest to law enforcement. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) is a key method for law enforcement to share information on zero-day vulnerabilities with technology companies and the public. Policymakers may need to assess if this is the best way for law enforcement to disclose unknown vulnerabilities. Additionally, the issue of law enforcement sharing details about NITs used to exploit vulnerabilities lacks a formal evaluation process. Law enforcement may consider these details sensitive and classify the tools used. The FBI has declined to reveal details of the NIT used against the Playpen website, opting to dismiss charges rather than disclose source code. Classification of NIT elements hinders criminal discovery and public disclosure. Concerns arise about revealing NIT details impacting law enforcement practices and software vulnerabilities. The NDCAC, led by the FBI, facilitates information sharing on vulnerabilities and exploits among law enforcement agencies. Policymakers debate who should determine the disclosure of NIT details - law enforcement, courts, or Congress. The Encryption Working Group recommended authorizing and modernizing the NDCAC to enhance law enforcement's technical expertise."
