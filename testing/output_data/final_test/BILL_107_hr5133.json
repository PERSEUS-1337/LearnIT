    "content": "The \"Teacher Recruitment Act of 2002\" is also known as the Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program, which expands loan forgiveness opportunities for teachers. The purpose of this section is to expand loan forgiveness eligibility for teachers in economically disadvantaged areas. The Secretary will assume the obligation to repay qualified loan amounts for new borrowers who are full-time teachers in public schools. The Secretary will repay qualified loan amounts for full-time teachers in economically disadvantaged or underserved rural areas who have state certification and are not in default on a loan. Recipients will be selected based on a formula ensuring fairness and equality. The Secretary will repay a percentage of the loan obligation for teachers in economically disadvantaged areas after each school year of teaching. The repayment percentage varies based on the years of service. Consolidation loans may also qualify for repayment. A loan made under section 428C may be a qualified loan amount if used to repay specific federal loans for a borrower meeting certain requirements. The year of service for continuing education loans is determined based on the academic year the borrower began teaching full-time. The service determination for loan repayment is based on the academic year following the year the loan obligation was incurred. The Secretary can issue regulations for implementation. No refunding of loan repayments is allowed. If the list of eligible schools is not available before May 1, the previous year's list can be used. Teachers can remain eligible if they serve in a qualifying school and meet certain requirements. For loan forgiveness, teachers in qualifying schools must meet requirements and can't receive benefits from other programs.
