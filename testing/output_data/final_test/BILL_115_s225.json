    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act\" and includes amendments related to the Cooper Spur land exchange. Section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 is amended to adjust acreage and include improvements in buildings. Additionally, a timeline is set for the Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows to select land exchanges within 120 days of the Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act's enactment. The Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows will jointly select land exchanges within 120 days. An appraisal will assign separate values to each tax lot for equalization. Final appraised values of Federal and non-Federal land will be determined. The Secretary is not required to reappraise the final appraised value of non-Federal land for up to 3 years after approval, unless the condition of the land is significantly altered by certain events. Before completing the land exchange, the Secretary must make appraisals available for public review. The Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows may agree to reserve a conservation easement to protect identified wetlands before exchanging Federal and non-Federal land. The conservation easement must be consistent with a mediation agreement between the Secretary and Mt. Hood Meadows, finalized within 120 days of the Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act enactment. The Secretary must also reserve a 24-foot-wide nonexclusive trail easement. The curr_chunk describes a foot-wide nonexclusive trail easement on Federal land, allowing for the construction, maintenance, and nonmotorized use of existing trails while retaining the rights of the Federal land owner to cross the trails with roads, utilities, and infrastructure facilities, as well as improve or relocate the trails. The curr_chunk discusses the possibility of conveying a lesser area of Federal or non-Federal land to equalize appraised values in property exchanges, subject to approval. The appraised value of the land conveyed by Mt. Hood Meadows exceeding the appraised value of the land conveyed by the Secretary will be considered a donation to the United States."
