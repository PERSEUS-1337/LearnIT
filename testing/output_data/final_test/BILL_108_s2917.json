    "content": "Title III of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 316, which authorizes a competitive prize award program to encourage the development of advanced space and aeronautical technologies. The Administrator is authorized to carry out the Centennial Challenge Program to award prizes for innovation in research, technology development, and prototype demonstration related to space and aeronautical activities. Recipients are selected through competitions advertised by the Administrator, and potential recipients must register for the competition. In registering for a competition, recipients assume all risks and waive claims against the US Government and related entities for any injury, damage, or loss arising from participation. Funds appropriated for this program remain available until expended. The Centennial Challenge Trust Fund allows funding to remain available for up to 4 fiscal years. When a prize is offered, the total amount is deposited in the fund, with additional funds added if needed. If a competition expires without meeting its goals, funds can be redesignated for a new challenge. The Administrator is limited to depositing $25,000,000 annually in the fund. The Centennial Challenge Trust Fund allows up to $25,000,000 annually to be deposited for competitions. The maximum cash prize for a competition is $1,000,000 without Administrator approval. The Administrator can use this authority in conjunction with other research and technology development initiatives. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 is amended to include the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Foundation. The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 is amended to establish the National Aeronautics and Space Foundation, a charitable corporation with the purpose of encouraging private donations for NASA and promoting public knowledge and inspiration about space. The Foundation will be governed by a board of directors appointed by the Administrator in consultation with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Administrator, with members serving for 6-year terms, staggered initially from 1 to 6 years. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation's board of directors is appointed by the Administrator, with members serving 6-year terms. Vacancies are filled for the remainder of the former member's term. Membership on the Board is not considered an office, and the Administrator serves ex officio without voting rights. Upon appointment of all members, the board can adopt by-laws and establish meeting schedules. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation's board of directors, appointed by the Administrator, sets meeting schedules and quorum requirements. Members serve without compensation but can be reimbursed for expenses. The board's powers and duties are outlined, with the Administrator serving ex officio. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation, appointed by the Administrator, operates as a charitable and nonprofit corporation with perpetual succession. The Foundation can enter contracts, grants, and execute lawful instruments. Members of the Board are not personally liable, except for malfeasance. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation, appointed by the Administrator, can accept gifts, devises, and bequests for the benefit of NASA, its activities, or services, including encumbered or restricted donations. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation can accept gifts, devises, or bequests for the benefit of NASA, including interests in real property for preservation and conservation. The Foundation is limited to accepting gifts that do not require expenditures beyond its resources and is tax-exempt at the federal, state, and local levels. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation is tax-exempt from Federal, State, and local taxation. It can make in-lieu-of payments to local government and accept contributions for property transferred to it. Contributions to the Foundation are deductible. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation can contract with NASA for support but cannot provide funds to NASA. The Foundation cannot use its funds to supplement NASA's activities unless specified by statute. The National Aeronautics and Space Foundation, established by subsection (a), defines key terms such as Administrator, Board, Foundation, and NASA."
