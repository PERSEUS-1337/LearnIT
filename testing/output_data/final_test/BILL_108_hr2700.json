    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Patient Access to Drugs for Rare Diseases Act of 2003\" is abbreviated as such. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 incentivized research for rare diseases, leading to the development of over 240 new orphan drugs in the US. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 led to the development of over 240 new drugs in the US, with more than 800 additional drugs in the research pipeline. Patient access to expensive orphan drugs remains a challenge, and there is a need for more research on rare diseases without effective therapies. Congress defined orphan drugs under the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to ensure continued access for rare disease patients. The HOPPS regulation for 2003 does not provide sufficient reimbursement for orphan drugs, leading to lower availability for rare disease patients like those with cervical dystonia, rare cancers, and cystic fibrosis. Medicare needs to ensure adequate reimbursement to maintain access to these drugs. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with rare diseases have continued access to orphan drugs in the hospital outpatient setting, using the FFD&C Act definition of rare diseases. Payment for orphan drugs and biologicals under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services. Payment for orphan drugs and biologicals under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services does not include drugs designated as orphan drugs or those described under specific product codes before January 1, 2007. The exemption rules for payment under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services do not cover certain drugs, including blood clotting factors for individuals with hemophilia before January 1, 2007. The exemption rules for payment under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services do not consider drugs or biologicals that have uses not designated as orphan drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The exemption rules for payment under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services do not consider drugs or biologicals that have uses not designated as orphan drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If the number of claims for covered OPD services exceeds 30,000, the exclusion applies only to designated indications under specific acts or on the Rare Diseases List. The amendment exempts drugs or biologicals with over 30,000 claims for covered OPD services from certain payment rules. Payment for these drugs will be made under a specific section of the Social Security Act. Additionally, these drugs are exempt from inherent reasonableness authority. The amendment to U.S.C. 1395u(b)(8)(A)(i)(I) excludes drugs, biologicals, and blood clotting factors for individuals with hemophilia from the prospective payment system for covered OPD services. A report on payment for these items must be submitted by the Secretary by July 1, 2006, with recommendations on their payment under section 1833(t) of the Social Security Act. The report must include recommendations for reflecting actual costs of orphan drugs, biologicals, and blood clotting factors for individuals with hemophilia. It should also address the impact of payment on access to these drugs for patients with rare diseases. The Secretary will consult with various stakeholders in preparing the report. The Secretary may not decrease reimbursement rates for orphan drugs, biologicals, and blood clotting factors for individuals with hemophilia furnished by hospital outpatient departments before six months after submitting a report to Congress. The report must include recommendations on reflecting actual costs and access to these drugs for patients with rare diseases. Effective Date: The amendments made by subsection (a) will apply to items furnished on or after January 1, 2004."
