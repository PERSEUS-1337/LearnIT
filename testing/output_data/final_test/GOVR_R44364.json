    "content": "Cybersecurity is a broad concept with varying definitions. DHS defines it as protecting information systems from damage or unauthorized use. The focus on federal cybersecurity has increased in recent years, especially after the OPM data breach. The focus on federal cybersecurity has increased since the OPM data breach in June 2015. Federal agencies like DHS and DOD have key roles in protecting systems and networks, with DHS responsible for civilian systems and DOD for defending against cyberattacks. The federal cybersecurity workforce is crucial in this effort. The federal cybersecurity workforce is essential for maintaining and improving government cybersecurity. Cybersecurity professionals design secure networks, address vulnerabilities, and analyze data to respond to cyberattacks. Developing and maintaining this workforce has been a challenge, with skills gaps identified government-wide. The Obama Administration created a Cross-Agency Priority to reduce these gaps by half by the end of FY2013. The report examines congressional oversight of strategies to strengthen the federal cybersecurity workforce, focusing on initiatives to define the workforce and hiring flexibilities at DOD and DHS. Cybersecurity functions are spread across various federal positions, with efforts to close gaps in cybersecurity identified as being in an early stage of maturity. The cybersecurity functions within federal positions vary by agency, with challenges in accurately defining and measuring the cybersecurity workforce. Disparities in counts of DOD cybersecurity employees have been reported, highlighting the difficulty in assessing the full range of federal positions undertaking cybersecurity responsibilities. The GAO and OPM reported inconsistent counts of cybersecurity employees in the federal government, attributing it to the lack of a standard definition. Challenges in developing and maintaining a robust federal cybersecurity workforce include demand exceeding supply, difficulty filling vacant positions, skills gaps, and agency workforce plans not addressing cybersecurity needs. DOD and DHS face recruitment and retention challenges due to a shortage of qualified professionals. The challenges faced by DOD and DHS in recruiting cybersecurity professionals include the length and complexity of the federal hiring process, the competitive disadvantage of the General Schedule pay system, and the time-consuming security clearance process. Initiatives such as the national cybersecurity workforce framework aim to define and identify the federal cybersecurity workforce. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) released the national cybersecurity workforce framework in November 2011. This framework categorizes cybersecurity work into specialty areas and provides standard duties and competencies for professionals. In October 2012, OPM and NIST published a coding structure for federal cybersecurity positions based on this framework. The coding structure for federal cybersecurity positions is based on the national cybersecurity workforce framework. It assigns unique numeric codes to categories and specialty areas, including three new categories. The codes help OPM and agencies identify and categorize federal cybersecurity positions for a consistent government-wide count. In June 2013, OPM launched the Special Cybersecurity Workforce Project to support closing cybersecurity workforce skills gaps. The Special Cybersecurity Workforce Project aims to close skills gaps in the federal cybersecurity workforce. It involves building a dataset of federal cybersecurity positions, assessing data accuracy, and addressing workforce needs. OPM directed agencies to assign cybersecurity data codes to positions, with 95% of federal positions and 96% in the 2210 occupation series having codes. The dataset and government-wide count of the cybersecurity workforce have not been made public yet. OMB issued the Cybersecurity Strategy on October 30, 2015. The Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan (CSIP) issued by OMB on October 30, 2015 directs agencies to identify skills gaps in the federal cybersecurity workforce. OPM's cybersecurity dataset initiative involves completing phases to map the cyber workforce landscape and identify talent gaps. Phase 1 has been completed, Phase 2 is expected to finish by March 31, 2016, and Phase 3 will begin later in FY2016. These activities may accelerate the implementation of Phase 3 by requiring agencies to use the dataset for workforce planning. The Border Patrol Pay Agent Reform Act of 2013 and The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 require agencies to use the national cybersecurity workforce framework to define and identify federal cybersecurity positions. Agencies must assign data codes, conduct critical needs assessments, and submit progress reports on completing these tasks. These laws enhance OPM and OMB's efforts to assess agencies' cybersecurity workforce capabilities. Congress has authorized hiring and pay flexibilities for DOD and DHS to enhance recruitment and retention of cybersecurity professionals. OPM has also provided similar hiring flexibilities for certain DOD and DHS cybersecurity positions. Three laws authorize hiring and pay flexibilities for cybersecurity positions at DOD and DHS: P.L. 104-201, P.L. 113-277, and P.L. 114-92. The hiring flexibilities authorized in P.L. 104-201, P.L. 113-277, and P.L. 114-92 have been used to fill cybersecurity positions at DOD and DHS. OPM has issued temporary hiring flexibilities for specific cybersecurity positions requiring unique skills and knowledge. The DOD and DHS have different hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions. The DHS flexibility is an interim solution until regulations under P.L. 113-277 are effective. The flexibilities aim to enhance recruitment and retention by designating cybersecurity positions as excepted service and allowing for additional compensation. The OPM-issued flexibilities do not explicitly authorize pay flexibilities. The DOD and DHS have hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, designating them as excepted service. This allows for alternative recruitment methods, such as waiving public notice requirements, to expedite the hiring process. The DOD and DHS have hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, allowing them to offer additional compensation to attract top talent. These laws provide significant latitude in setting pay and benefits for cybersecurity positions, enabling the departments to compete effectively for skilled professionals. The DOD and DHS have hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, allowing them to offer additional compensation to attract top talent. These flexibilities enable the departments to establish alternative pay systems outside of the GS system and provide monetary incentives to individuals filling cybersecurity positions. Agencies argue that non-GS systems can increase their ability to attract and retain cybersecurity professionals. Incentives for federal employees can be performance or non-performance based, with agencies having discretion to provide recruitment and performance-based cash awards. Some incentives are only available to employees covered under specific laws, allowing them to earn higher base salaries than their GS counterparts. For example, cybersecurity professionals under the DCIPS can receive awards that exceed the maximum pay. DCIPS allows employees to receive awards exceeding maximum pay, unlike GS employees. It is a DOD-specific system for intelligence positions with a GG salary structure aligned with the GS system. Analysis of laws authorizing flexibilities for DOD and DHS cybersecurity positions is included, with a focus on key structural differences. New hires in cybersecurity positions are subject to a three-year probationary period. Employees hired into DOD or DHS cybersecurity positions are subject to a three-year probationary period, while DOD intelligence personnel have a two-year \"trial period.\" Existing cybersecurity employees can refuse conversion to the excepted service, unlike DOD intelligence positions. Excepted service employees cannot apply for certain federal jobs. Laws for cybersecurity positions require an implementation plan, unlike laws for DOD intelligence positions. The implementation plan for DOD cybersecurity positions requires specific content and submission requirements, with a 30-day waiting period before flexibilities become effective. Annual reports on hiring and pay flexibilities must be submitted by DOD and DHS, with identical content requirements. The annual reports for cybersecurity positions at DOD and DHS have identical content requirements but differ in submission timelines and responsible agencies. Congress is interested in defining the federal cybersecurity workforce and ensuring proper implementation of hiring and pay flexibilities. The annual reports for cybersecurity positions at DOD and DHS have similar content requirements but vary in submission timelines and responsible agencies. Congress is interested in defining the federal cybersecurity workforce and ensuring proper implementation of hiring and pay flexibilities. Efforts to define and identify federal cybersecurity workforce positions have largely been undertaken by OPM, but there is a lack of reporting to Congress on progress and skills gaps. The OMB's CSIP does not require agencies to report identified skills gaps in their cybersecurity workforces to Congress, limiting Congressional knowledge of evolving efforts and potentially conflicting assessments between OMB, OPM, and Congress. This lack of progress reports may hinder Congress in identifying conflicting efforts in identifying cybersecurity workforce gaps. OPM guidance requires DHS and executive branch agencies to identify critical cybersecurity specialty areas and top five cyber talent gaps. Lack of access to OPM's dataset may hinder Congress's knowledge of agencies' cybersecurity workforce needs. The CSIP identified skills gaps, making it challenging for Congress to determine the need for hiring and pay flexibilities. This could result in unnecessary flexibilities or existing ones not addressing specific agency components' needs. For example, if a federal department authorizes flexibilities for cybersecurity skills gaps without accurate workforce data, it may not help if a different component faces gaps. The laws governing flexibilities for DOD and DHS cybersecurity positions require reporting to Congress, but there are no such requirements for DOD intelligence positions. Existing reporting requirements do not include identifying challenges or measuring effectiveness. DOD and DHS have discretion in implementing hiring and pay flexibilities, which could lead to discrepancies in their use. Congress may need to enhance oversight to address potential discrepancies and assess the effectiveness of these flexibilities in recruiting and retaining cybersecurity professionals. The laws governing flexibilities for DOD and DHS cybersecurity positions require reporting to Congress, but there are no such requirements for DOD intelligence positions. Lack of data on the use of hiring and pay flexibilities could hinder Congress's ability to assess their effectiveness. Congress may need to enhance oversight to address potential discrepancies in the implementation of these flexibilities. Without data on the use of flexibilities for DOD intelligence positions, Congress may struggle to ensure appropriate filling of positions. Concerns exist that past flexibilities may have been used for non-cybersecurity roles. This lack of information could impact future decisions on authorizing additional flexibilities. Without data on the use of flexibilities for DOD intelligence positions, Congress may struggle to ensure appropriate filling of positions. Concerns exist that past flexibilities may have been used for non-cybersecurity roles. The lack of data on the frequency of flexibilities for DOD intelligence positions being used for U.S. Cyber Command positions makes it difficult for Congress to assess the utility of new flexibilities authorized for Command positions. Some positions affiliated with the Command are being filled using existing flexibilities for DOD intelligence positions. The flexibilities for hiring and pay in cybersecurity positions are being used by the Navy and DHS, but their effectiveness is not well measured. Reporting requirements focus on usage but not on how these flexibilities improve recruitment and retention of qualified professionals. This lack of data makes it challenging for Congress to assess the utility of new flexibilities for Command positions. The laws governing flexibilities for DOD intelligence, DHS cybersecurity, and DOD cybersecurity positions do not require training for human resources staff on cybersecurity hiring and pay flexibilities. Lack of staff training may impact effective use of these flexibilities. Untrained staff may not know about the flexibilities, how to implement them properly, and which positions they apply to. The text discusses oversight policy options for enhancing knowledge and awareness of federal cybersecurity workforce recruitment efforts. It mentions monitoring OPM and OMB initiatives for defining federal cybersecurity positions and monitoring hiring and pay flexibilities for DOD and DHS cybersecurity positions. Seven options are presented, with no endorsement of their advisability. OPM could be required to notify congressional committees about the cybersecurity dataset's status and brief them on its structure and functions upon release. Congress may mandate these notifications on a regular basis. Congressional committees may be informed about the cybersecurity dataset's structure, functions, and updates upon release. GAO could be directed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of the dataset one year after its implementation. The codes aim to identify cybersecurity positions, assess workforce capabilities, address skills gaps, and facilitate recruitment and training. Congress could expand reporting requirements to include DOD intelligence positions and mandate information sharing by DOD and DHS. The reporting requirements for DOD and DHS could be expanded to include information on challenges faced in implementing hiring and pay flexibilities for intelligence positions. This would enhance congressional oversight and allow for comparison between the two departments. Including specific metrics in annual reports could provide clarity on the use of flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, helping Congress determine their effectiveness and the need for additional flexibilities. The DOD and DHS may need to report their use of hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, including the number of positions filled and the percentage affiliated with the U.S. Cyber Command. This could enhance congressional oversight and determine the effectiveness of current flexibilities. The DOD and DHS may need to report their use of hiring flexibilities for cybersecurity positions, including the number of positions filled and the percentage affiliated with the U.S. Cyber Command. This data could help Congress assess the effectiveness of current flexibilities and address any barriers to their use. Training on proper implementation of hiring and pay flexibilities for cybersecurity positions could be required for hiring managers and human resources staff. Training on the existing authorities for cybersecurity positions is recommended for Department-level HR staff, those developing implementing guidance, and component-level supervisors and hiring managers at DHS and DOD. The Inspectors General at DOD and DHS could be required to report on the effectiveness of hiring and pay flexibilities for recruiting cybersecurity professionals. Reports could analyze if flexibilities reduced time to hire, attracted qualified professionals, and which monetary incentives were most effective.
