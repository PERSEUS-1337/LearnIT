    "content": "The Information bottleneck (IB) method extracts relevant information from one random variable X to predict another variable Y by identifying an intermediate \"bottleneck\" variable T with low I(X;T) and high I(Y;T). The IB curve maximizes I(Y;T) for a given I(X;T) by maximizing the IB Lagrangian, I(Y;T) - \u03b2I(X;T). When Y is a deterministic function of X, such as in classification problems, three caveats arise: the IB curve cannot be recovered by varying \u03b2, there are trivial solutions along the curve, and multi-layer classifiers may achieve low performance. The Information bottleneck (IB) method extracts relevant information from X to predict Y using a bottleneck variable T. Three caveats arise when Y is a small perturbation away from being deterministic of X. A new functional is proposed to address these issues and recover the IB curve in all cases. The IB method is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset. The Information bottleneck (IB) method involves choosing a bottleneck variable T to maximize prediction while compressing X. The IB curve is explored by finding optimal T for different values of r, where the curve is concave but not strictly concave. This non-strict concavity is crucial in the analysis of the IB method. The IB curve is often explored by maximizing the IB Lagrangian, connecting IB with supervised learning and neural networks. Papers have modified neural network training algorithms to optimize the IB Lagrangian for high-dimensional random variables. Controlling compression can tune characteristics like generalization error, robustness, and detection of out-of-distribution data. Research has suggested that stochastic gradient descent training dynamics may favor hidden layer mappings that balance compression and prediction. Intermediate representations optimal in the Information Bottleneck sense correspond to useful compressions of input vectors. The Information Bottleneck has applications beyond supervised learning, including clustering, coding theory, quantization, and cognitive science. Solutions at different points on the Information Bottleneck curve are explored in these applications. The Information Bottleneck (IB) curve can be influenced by various factors, such as the relationship between input X and output Y. When Y is a deterministic function of X, the IB curve may not have a one-to-one mapping with maximizers of the IB Lagrangian L \u03b2 IB for different \u03b2 values. This is due to the piecewise linear shape of the IB curve when Y = f(X), making it not strictly concave. This limitation has implications for exploring the IB curve by maximizing L \u03b2 IB while varying \u03b2. The implications of the Information Bottleneck (IB) curve when Y = f(X) have not been fully recognized. An alternative objective function is proposed to explore the IB curve. Points on the IB curve may contain uninteresting solutions, and IB-optimality may not guarantee an interesting compression of input data. In neural networks, hidden layers may not show a strict trade-off between compression and prediction. These caveats also apply to the deterministic IB. In the deterministic IB variant of IB BID26, an alternative objective function is proposed to address certain caveats. Results apply when Y is close to being a deterministic function of X. Optimization of the IB Lagrangian may lead to uninteresting solutions on the IB curve. IB analysis in neural networks may face difficulties in analyzing intermediate layers. The paper discusses difficulties in using IB to analyze intermediate representations in supervised learning, particularly in deterministic settings. Issues arise when Y is a deterministic function of X, and when T is continuous-valued. The caveats analyzed are orthogonal to other discussed caveats in previous papers. The paper discusses challenges in using IB for analyzing intermediate representations in supervised learning, especially in deterministic scenarios. The results are based on analytically-provable properties of the IB curve and do not address practical optimization issues. The theoretical findings are also independent of estimating mutual information between neural network layers and issues related to IB, finite data sampling, and generalization error. In Sections 4, 5, and 6, the paper discusses three caveats related to using IB for analyzing intermediate representations in supervised learning. Section 7 demonstrates these caveats using a neural-network implementation on the MNIST dataset. The goal of supervised learning is to select a conditional distribution q \u03b8 (\u0177|x) that approximates the true distribution w(y|x) using a training dataset {x i , y i } i=1.. N. Supervised learning involves classification with finite output values. Many architectures use intermediate representations like hidden layers in neural networks. The random variable T represents the activity of a hidden layer, determined by a parameterized conditional distribution. The mapping from inputs to hidden layer activity in neural networks can be deterministic or stochastic. The overall mapping from inputs to predicted outputs involves a parameterized conditional distribution. The random variable T can represent the activity of a hidden layer or a set of neurons separating inputs from predicted outputs. The random variable T in neural networks can be an intermediate representation in supervised learning, with a focus on minimizing cross-entropy loss. The relationship between supervised learning and Information Bottleneck (IB) involves finding a bottleneck variable T given a joint distribution p(x, y). In supervised learning, the goal is to minimize cross-entropy loss by defining an intermediate representation T that follows the Markov condition Y \u2212 X \u2212 T. This is analogous to the Information Bottleneck approach, where one seeks a bottleneck variable T that minimizes I(X; T) and maximizes I(Y; T) given a joint distribution p(x, y). In supervised learning, the relationship between X and Y can be represented as Y = f(X) based on the empirical training dataset distribution. This connection may be due to the true distribution w(y|x) or the uniqueness of input vectors in the training data. The classification problems may not always be deterministic, with noise or non-deterministic factors affecting the mapping from X to Y. In supervised learning, the relationship between X and Y can be represented as Y = f(X) based on the training dataset distribution. The classification problems may not always be deterministic, with noise or non-deterministic factors affecting the mapping from X to Y. Noise may be intentionally added as a regularization technique, but real-world problems often exhibit a deterministic relation between X and Y. The bounds on mutual information I(Y; T) can be visualized based on the relationship between X and Y. The information plane diagrams illustrate bounds on mutual information between variables X and Y. When Y = f(X), the information bottleneck curve saturates both bounds and is piece-wise linear. By defining a manifold of bottleneck variables T\u03b1 parameterized by \u03b1, the curve obeys specific constraints. The information bottleneck curve is monotonically increasing and achieves the DPI bound. When Y = f(X), the curve is piecewise linear and not strictly concave. The bottleneck variable T copy corresponds to the \"corner point\" of the IB curve. The IB Lagrangian provides a robust way to find the corner point H(Y) for maximum compression without prediction loss. Solutions at different points on the IB curve can be recovered in a closed-form way via T\u03b1. Exploring the IB curve can be done by solving the constrained optimization problem for different values of r, but it is challenging due to the non-linear constraint on I(X; T). The squared-IB functional, L \u03b2 sq-IB, is proposed as an alternative objective function to explore the IB curve. By maximizing L \u03b2 sq-IB while varying \u03b2, the IB curve can be recovered, whether strictly concave or not. The IB Lagrangian fails when Y = f(X) or when the IB curve is piecewise linear. Maximize L \u03b2 IB by replacing the inequality constraint with an equality constraint over the increasing region of the IB curve. This allows for exploration of the IB curve by finding points where F(r) = \u03b2 to maximize L \u03b2 IB. The IB curve can be explored by maximizing the squared-IB functional, L \u03b2 sq-IB, which allows for finding points where F(r) = \u03b2 to maximize L \u03b2 IB. The derivative of F(r) - \u03b2r^2 is 0 when F(r)/(2r) = \u03b2, leading to only one point that maximizes L \u03b2 sq-IB for a given \u03b2. The IB curve can be explored by maximizing the squared-IB functional, L \u03b2 sq-IB, which allows for finding points where F(r) = \u03b2 to maximize L \u03b2 IB. Unlike L \u03b2 IB, there can be non-trivial maximizers of L \u03b2 sq-IB for \u03b2 > 1. The IB curve is the Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization problem. The IB curve is the Pareto front of the multi-objective optimization problem, allowing exploration of a nonstrictly-concave Pareto front. Other modifications are possible. IB optimal variables are assumed to provide useful representations of information. In the ImageNet task, exploring the IB curve can lead to identifying compressed representations of images. The IB curve allows exploration of a nonstrictly-concave Pareto front, aiming to find useful compressed representations of images. However, the bottleneck variables on the manifold do not offer interesting or useful representations of the input data, as they do not perform any useful hard-clustering. When Y is a deterministic function of X, variables on the IB curve may not necessarily provide interesting compressed representations. The IB curve does not distinguish between \"interesting\" and \"uninteresting\" variables that achieve the same compression and prediction values. Therefore, identifying useful compressed representations may require the use of quality functions other than just IB. Recent research in machine learning has focused on \"deep\" neural networks with multiple hidden layers. BID24 suggested a trade-off between compression and prediction in different layers due to SGD dynamics. Early layers prioritize good prediction over compression, while latter layers prioritize compression over prediction. This trade-off was demonstrated using an artificial classification dataset. In real-world deep neural networks, achieving 0 probability of error on training data implies Y is a deterministic function of X. This leads to a weak trade-off between compression and prediction in different layers, with latter layers showing better compression but not worse prediction than earlier layers. In real-world deep neural networks, achieving 0 error on training data implies Y is a deterministic function of X. Consider a neural network with k hidden layers, where each layer is a function of the preceding one. Given the predicted output distribution, one can make a point prediction by choosing the class with the highest probability. The architecture obeys the Markov condition, and applying Fano's inequality to the chain Y - Tk - Y\u0302 gives the probability of error and the binary entropy function. In real-world deep neural networks, achieving 0 error on training data implies Y is a deterministic function of X. For classifiers with 0 prediction error, a strict compression/prediction trade-off is not possible. However, later layers may have more compression while maintaining the same prediction level. This results in different layers being on the flat part of the Information Bottleneck curve. The activity of each layer in deep neural networks is influenced by the previous layer, allowing information to flow in parallel across different channels or skip layers. This analysis applies to cases where groups of neurons satisfy the Markov condition. Using the MNIST dataset, the \"nonlinear IB\" method is used to minimize cross-entropy loss and estimate I(X; T). The bottleneck variable T corresponds to a hidden layer with two units, enabling easy visual analysis. The \"nonlinear IB\" method uses a two-dimensional bottleneck variable T = a \u03b8 (X)+Z, with stochastic mapping from X to T, making I(X; T) well-defined. The decoding map q \u03b8 (\u0177|t) uses a fully-connected layer with 800 ReLU units. Nonlinear IB may not find globally optimal bottleneck variables due to various factors. The nonlinear IB method uses a two-dimensional bottleneck variable T = a \u03b8 (X) + Z, with stochastic mapping from X to T. The IB curve cannot be explored by maximizing the IB Lagrangian but can be explored by maximizing the squared-IB functional. The solutions discovered by nonlinear IB were very close to IB-optimal, demonstrating three caveats discussed earlier. The nonlinear IB method utilizes a two-dimensional bottleneck variable T = a \u03b8 (X) + Z, with a stochastic mapping from X to T. By maximizing the squared-IB functional, solutions located along different points on the IB curve for various values of \u03b2 are discovered. The identified solutions closely align with the theoretically-predicted IB-curve, with a deviation at \u03b2 \u2248 0.45 instead of the expected \u03b2 = 1.0. The switch between regimes of compression and prediction occurs at different points than theoretically predicted, likely due to practical optimization details. The IB Lagrangian experiments revealed three types of bottleneck variables: noncompressed variables, compressed variables with compact clusters for each class, and a trivial solution with all activity collapsed into a single cluster. The squared-IB functional showed a different behavior, grouping multiple classes together as \u03b2 increased, leading to a decrease in the total number of clusters. This nonlinear IB approach explored the trade-off between compression and prediction by learning to group X into varying clusters. The IB Lagrangian experiments identified different bottleneck variables: noncompressed, compressed with compact clusters per class, and a trivial solution with all activity in one cluster. The squared-IB functional grouped classes together as \u03b2 increased, reducing the total number of clusters. This nonlinear approach explores the balance between compression and prediction by grouping X into different clusters. In the IB Lagrangian experiments, different bottleneck variables were identified, including noncompressed, compressed with compact clusters per class, and a trivial solution with all activity in one cluster. The squared-IB functional grouped classes together as \u03b2 increased, reducing the total number of clusters. The classes were not clustered in a meaningful or useful way, with different combinations of classes in clusters for different solutions. The neural network experiments with \u03b2 = 0 showed nearly perfect prediction but hidden layer activations were spread out, indicating lack of compression. The architecture had three hidden layers before T and one after it, with earlier layers having less compression than T. The information bottleneck principle is a key concept in various fields, including information theory and machine learning. In scenarios where Y is a deterministic function of X, the behavior of the hidden layers in neural networks differs when \u03b2 = 0, showing a lack of trade-off between prediction and compression. The information bottleneck principle in deterministic scenarios shows that the IB curve cannot be recovered by maximizing the IB Lagrangian, and all points on the curve contain uninteresting representations of inputs. This challenges the trade-off between prediction and compression in multi-layer classifiers. However, the application of IB to supervised learning still holds merit for controlling compression during training to improve generalization or robustness. Our experiments on the MNIST dataset using the \"nonlinear IB\" method showed that different objective functions than the IB Lagrangian are needed to achieve varying compression rates. The neural network was trained with the Adam algorithm, using a mini-batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 10^-4. Training involved estimating gradients for both I\u03b8(X; T) and the cross-entropy term using the same mini-batch. The neural network was trained with the Adam algorithm on the MNIST dataset for 200 epochs. Training examples were randomized at the beginning of each epoch. Results for a range of \u03b2 values are shown in FIG7 and FIG8, with solutions found by the squared-IB functional exploring the trade-off continuously. The TensorFlow code is available at https://github.com/artemyk/ibcurve. The analysis explores the trade-off in a continuous manner, focusing on a variant of Information Bottleneck called deterministic IB (dIB). dIB replaces the standard IB compression cost with the entropy of the bottleneck variable. The Lagrangian for dIB is maximized for \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1], ensuring a well-defined compression cost. The inequality constraint in F dIB (r) can be replaced by an equality constraint by showing that F dIB (r) is monotonically increasing in r. This is achieved by maximizing I(Y ; T ) subject to H(T ) = r and obeying the Markov condition Y \u2212 X \u2212 T. By introducing a new bottleneck variable T := (T, D), it is shown that there are always random variables T that achieve at least I(Y ; T ) = max T :H(T )=r I(Y ; T ) and have H(T ) > r, leading to the conclusion that F dIB (r) is monotonically increasing in r. This allows for replacing the inequality constraint in Eq. (A14) with an equality constraint. The Legendre-Fenchel transform of F dIB allows for maximization of L \u03b2 dIB with equality constraints, leading to optimizers lying on the concave envelope F * dIB. The dIB curve, with bounds determined by H(T), replaces I(X; T) on the horizontal axis. When Y is a deterministic function of X, T copy = f(X) achieves equality for the equations. The dIB curve is flat and achieves equality for deterministic functions of Y. When Y is a deterministic function of X, the dIB curve saturates the bounds. It cannot be composed entirely of hard-clustering due to the discrete nature of Y. The dIB curve contains bottleneck variables that are not deterministic functions of Y, resulting in a \"step-like\" structure when Y is a deterministic function of X. Optimizers of L \u03b2 dIB must lie on the concave envelope of F dIB, with only hard-clusterings of Y achieving this. The dIB curve's bottleneck variables create a step-like structure when Y is a deterministic function of X. Optimizers of L \u03b2 dIB must lie on the concave envelope of F dIB, with only hard-clusterings of Y achieving this. The dIB Lagrangian cannot be explored using the dIB Lagrangian, as shown by the analysis in Section 4. The dIB curve's bottleneck variables create a step-like structure when Y is a deterministic function of X. Optimizers of L \u03b2 dIB must lie on the concave envelope of F dIB, with only hard-clusterings of Y achieving this. The dIB Lagrangian cannot be explored using the dIB Lagrangian, as shown by the analysis in Section 4. This means there is no direct mapping between points on the dIB curve and optimizers of the dIB Lagrangian for different \u03b2. To address this, we introduce the squared-dIB functional and demonstrate its relationship with the dIB Lagrangian. The squared-dIB functional optimizes different hard-clusterings of Y for various values of \u03b2, exploring the dIB curve by maximizing L \u03b2 sq-dIB while varying \u03b2. Each point on the dIB curve is a unique maximizer of L \u03b2 sq-dIB for the corresponding \u03b2, illustrated in FIG10. The family of bottleneck variables T \u03b1 has \"uninteresting\" solutions on the dIB curve. The family of bottleneck variables T \u03b1, defined in Eq. (6), are no longer optimal from the perspective of dIB. Any hard-clustering of Y achieves the bound of Eq. (A17) and lies on the dIB curve. However, there is no guarantee that clusters will reflect semantic or perceptual similarities between classes. Different clusterings may require a similarity or distortion measure between classes, not provided by standard information theoretic measures. For a neural network with many hidden layers and zero error probability, the activity of the layers will lie along the flat part of the dIB curve, showing no strict trade-off between compression and prediction. This implies that the bottleneck variable will have certain information properties, such as I(X; T) \u2265 H(Y) and I(Y; T) = H(Y). The text discusses the trade-off between compression and prediction in neural networks with many hidden layers and zero error probability. It mentions that when Y is close to being a deterministic function of X, certain caveats persist. The text also references the use of theorems to derive results related to distributions over outcomes Y. The text discusses the trade-off between compression and prediction in neural networks with many hidden layers and zero error probability. It mentions the use of theorems to derive results related to distributions over outcomes Y. The proof assumes Z is continuous-valued, with a probability distribution q(z) that is absolutely continuous with respect to p(z). The difference in conditional entropies is bounded. The text presents the upper bounding of integrals in equations using various mathematical techniques. It discusses mutual information between random variables Z and Y under different joint distributions. Theorems are used to analyze the trade-off between compression and prediction in neural networks with many hidden layers and zero error probability. The proof involves bounding the 1 distance between two distributions. The text bounds the difference of mutual informations between joint distributions, emphasizing the trade-off between compression and prediction in neural networks. The proof involves optimal bottleneck variables and the inequality Ip(Y ;T) + 2 log |Y| 2 \u2264 I p (Y ; T). The text discusses the importance of small distances between joint distributions p XY and p XY, even if conditional distributions p Y |X=x can be arbitrarily different for some x. It demonstrates how when Y is close to being a deterministic function of X, certain caveats apply approximately. The IB curve cannot be explored using the IB Lagrangian in this scenario. The text discusses the relationship between distributions of X and Y, showing that when Y is close to being a deterministic function of X, optimizers of the IB Lagrangian must still be close to H(Y). The maximum distance from H(Y) scales as O(-log), making it difficult to find solutions substantially different from H(Y) for small values of beta. The text discusses optimizing the IB Lagrangian for distributions of X and Y, where the IB curve must fall below a certain line on the information plane. The maximum distance from H(Y) scales as O(-log), making it challenging to find solutions significantly different from H(Y) for small beta values. In the context of optimizing the IB Lagrangian for X and Y distributions, the text explores the prediction/compression trade-off in neural networks with k layers. It shows that when Y is a deterministic function of X, there is no strict trade-off between layers. The discussion then shifts to cases where the joint distribution of X and Y is close to Y being deterministic. The classifier predicts based on the deterministic input-output mapping f(X) for optimal error probability. The optimal prediction strategy for a classifier is based on minimizing the probability of error. Fano's inequality is restated for the last layer's activity, showing a trade-off between prediction and compression in neural networks with multiple layers. When Y is close to being a deterministic function of X, the trade-off between layers is limited."
