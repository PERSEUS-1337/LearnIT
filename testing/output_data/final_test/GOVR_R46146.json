    "content": "Election security is a major policy challenge for Congress, with federal agencies warning of threats from Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign actors in the 2020 election cycle. These threats include interference in the voting process through social media campaigns, disinformation operations, and cyber-attacks on state and local infrastructure. The focus of election administration is on ensuring eligible voters can register and vote, ballots are counted correctly, and the process is viewed as secure by the public. Preserving election continuity is a top concern for election officials, who have long prepared contingency plans for various risks like equipment malfunctions and natural disasters. Amid foreign interference in U.S. elections, managing security concerns about infrastructure and countering external threats to information accuracy from foreign sources are new challenges for political campaigns and election administrators. This involves complex practical challenges and requires coordination between different levels of government and agencies. Election security poses complex challenges regarding government levels and interactions with political campaigns and the private sector. Technical complexity, cybersecurity, and shared responsibilities among federal, state, and local governments make election security challenging. Debate in Congress revolves around the federal government's role in election security, with state and local governments primarily responsible for administration. This report offers an overview of how campaign and election security policies have evolved. Election security involves ensuring fair, accurate, and safe elections through various activities before, during, and after voting. There is no single definition of election security, and debates revolve around federal, state, and local government roles. Election security encompasses protecting election infrastructure like voter databases, voting machines, and polling places. It can also involve regulating political advertising, providing cybersecurity for campaigns, and combating misinformation. Security concerns for campaigns differ from those for elections, as campaigns focus on persuading voters and are subject to less regulation than elections. The report discusses the regulation of elections at state and local levels, focusing on voter access and security issues. It provides background information for congressional debate on campaign and election security policy without definitively resolving ongoing debates. This report focuses on federal agencies, statutes, and policies related to safeguarding American campaigns, elections, and voting from security threats, including deliberate domestic or foreign interference. Legislation cited in the report specifically addresses campaign and election security, using terms like campaign, election, vote, interference, and security. The concepts discussed also have implications for unintentional threats like natural disasters or emergencies affecting campaigns, elections, or voting. The report focuses on federal agencies, statutes, and policies related to safeguarding American campaigns, elections, and voting from security threats. It addresses campaign and election security using terms like interference and security. The report does not cover traditional aspects of campaign finance, election administration, or voter mobilization. It briefly discusses provisions related to the Help America Vote Act and Voting Rights Act but does not delve into other federal statutes aimed at facilitating registration and voting. Additionally, it mentions lobbying statutes relevant for regulating certain corporate or foreign activities. The report focuses on federal agencies, statutes, and policies related to safeguarding American campaigns, elections, and voting from security threats. It emphasizes protections for U.S. campaigns and elections from foreign disinformation efforts. The Appendix includes sanctions or immigration legislation related to interference in U.S. elections during the 116th Congress. Foreign policy implications and offensive operations against adversaries are beyond the report's scope due to complex policy challenges in campaign and election security. The report focuses on federal agencies, statutes, and policies related to safeguarding American campaigns, elections, and voting from security threats. It highlights recent legislative activity, including appropriations for improvements to election technology and security by the 115th and 116th Congresses. The report does not provide legal or constitutional analysis, catalog all instances of interference, or independently evaluate allegations. The report discusses recent legislative activity related to campaign and election security, including bills passed by the 116th Congress. Committees in both chambers have held hearings on these topics, with primary jurisdiction over federal elections held by the Committee on House Administration and Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. The federal government's role in securing elections primarily focuses on access and voting rights, with the Voting Rights Act protecting against discrimination and intimidation in voting. The Department of Justice enforces these laws, while physical security measures aim to protect voters, ballots, and vote counts. The federal government, through agencies like the FBI, supports states and localities in investigating election crimes and providing security at the polls. After the 2000 presidential election, Congress expanded the federal role in election administration by authorizing funding for improvements and creating the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee voting system testing and certification. The federal government's role in election security expanded after the 2000 presidential election, with agencies like the FBI supporting states and localities in investigating election crimes. The 2016 election cycle saw significant changes in policy focus due to Russian interference, targeting technology firms, government entities, and political parties. Despite investigations not determining the interference as a decisive factor in the election outcome, concerns remain about potential future efforts to influence political attitudes or participation. In July 2018, the Intelligence Community reported aggressive attempts to manipulate social media and spread propaganda focused on divisive issues in elections. Campaign finance laws, including the Federal Election Campaign Act, aim to regulate foreign involvement in U.S. elections and ensure transparency in fundraising. Election security is a rapidly evolving policy issue facing Congress and the federal government. Legislation has been passed during the 116th Congress, with multiple investigative hearings held by House and Senate committees. Federal agencies have been tasked with new responsibilities to support states and prevent future interference. The Intelligence Community has warned that countering foreign interference in U.S. elections will require a whole-of-society approach. The U.S. Constitution and federal statutes regulate governmental responsibility for elections, with states setting the \"Times, Places and Manner\" for House and Senate elections. The federal government plays a supporting role in election administration and security, with two important election-specific statutes. Two election-specific statutes, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and FECA, are crucial for campaign and election security. HAVA assists states with election administration and provides federal funding for election security. FECA's provisions on disclaimer, disclosure, and foreign national fundraising are relevant for preventing foreign interference in U.S. elections. Table 2 below offers a summary of other relevant statutes. No single federal agency is solely responsible for election or campaign security. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) are the two federal agencies dedicated to campaigns and elections. The EAC manages federal funding, voting system testing, and election administration guidance. The FEC enforces FECA. Other agencies also support campaign and election security, with some roles stemming from a 2017 \"critical infrastructure\" designation. The EAC is the primary federal agency focused on assisting with election security. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is the only federal agency dedicated to assisting states with election administration, administering funding, providing election administration assistance, adopting voting system guidelines, conducting research, and sharing best practices. The EAC also participates in activities related to the designation of election systems as critical infrastructure. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces campaign finance laws and regulations, focusing on fundraising, spending, advertising disclaimers, and financial disclosure reports. It does not regulate election administration or voting matters. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assists states and localities in securing their election systems, particularly in cybersecurity. DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is responsible for election security within the department. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) oversees election security activities, including the Election Security Initiative (ESI). The Department of Justice enforces federal statutes relevant to campaign and election security, with the FBI leading investigations on foreign influence campaigns. Multiple agencies provide intelligence on election security threats, such as the 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. The Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections included information from the CIA, FBI, and NSA. The State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC) coordinates efforts to counter foreign propaganda. Various agencies, including DHS and the DNI, were assigned additional campaign roles via the FY2020 NDAA bill. In response to the 2016 election interference, Congress assigned additional campaign and election security responsibilities to various agencies, including DHS and the DNI. Coordination among agencies and state governments is crucial due to the shared responsibility for election security. Government agencies both support and regulate private actors like political campaigns, adding complexity to the security challenge. Federal coordination issues are a key concern for Congress. The federal coordination issues surrounding campaign and election security are a key concern for Congress. DHS plays a lead role in coordinating federal support for election security, following a critical infrastructure designation in January 2017. Coordination among intelligence-gathering agencies is not fully disclosed in the public record. The Facilities Sector, including government buildings and equipment, is designated as critical infrastructure by DHS. This designation prioritizes support for state and local election jurisdictions, sharing threat information, conducting cyber assessments, and coordinating with public and private entities. DHS does not have regulatory authority over federal elections but serves as the Sector-Specific Agency for the Election Infrastructure Subsector (EIS). DHS plays a key role in coordinating election security efforts among governmental and nongovernmental entities. This includes working with the EIS Government Coordinating Council and Sector Coordinating Council, funding the EI-ISAC for information sharing, and facilitating communication between election administrators and federal agencies through the EAC. The IC plays a crucial role in coordinating campaign and election security, with the DNI appointing an IC Election Threats Executive and directing agencies to assign senior executives for election security work. U.S. Cyber Command and NSA monitor foreign threats, including through an Election Security Group. The FY2020 NDAA bill mandates the DNI to appoint a national coordinator for election security. The FY2020 NDAA bill mandates the DNI to appoint a national counterintelligence officer within the National Counterintelligence and Security Center to coordinate election security counterintelligence, particularly regarding foreign interference and equipment issues. Multiple federal agencies have collaborated on campaign and election security educational resources and issued joint warnings. The State Department's Global Engagement Center coordinates federal efforts to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation, working with other departments to administer sanctions for election interference. The FY2020 NDAA bill mandates the DNI to develop a strategy for countering Russian cyberattacks on US election systems in coordination with other federal agencies. No specific agency is responsible for coordinating security for political campaigns, but federal law enforcement, especially the FBI, can receive reports and act on them. The FBI and other federal agencies investigate suspected criminal activity, including cyberattacks and foreign influence campaigns during elections. The \"Protected Voices\" program provides guidance on guarding against such threats. Federal election law focuses on voluntary security measures, with some requirements set by Congress for technological security in voter registration lists. Most election security standards are determined at the state or local levels. The federal government provides voluntary election security guidance, including research, best practices, and technical assistance. The EAC, with assistance from advisory bodies and NIST, develops voluntary voting system guidelines and certifies systems as meeting these guidelines. Participation in the federal voting system testing and certification program is voluntary. The proposed update to the guidelines includes security-related principles such as ensuring auditable voting systems and preventing unauthorized access. The federal government's voluntary election security guidance includes testing and certification programs for voting systems under HAVA. Changes to voting systems may require recertification, and updates to guidelines need approval from the EAC commissioners. Congress has provided funding for securing election systems since the 2016 elections. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $425 million and $380 million for election security purposes under HAVA, including replacing voting equipment, implementing post-election audits, upgrading computer systems for cybersecurity, providing training, and implementing best practices. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated funds for election security purposes, including implementing cybersecurity best practices, providing training, and improving election systems. States and territories were eligible for funding based on a formula tied to voting-age population, with a minimum payment guaranteed. Recipients must provide a match for the funds received. The Election Assistance Commission administered the payments, with all FY2018 funds requested by July 16, 2018. The FY2018 funds for election security were disbursed to states by September 20, 2018, with each state having five years to spend the funds and report on their spending annually. Various federal agencies, including DHS and FBI, received designated funding for election system security. The FY2018 spending bill directed funding towards countering threats to democratic institutions and processes, including election system security. The FBI and other agencies received funding for these purposes, with initiatives like DARPA's SSITH program for secure voting systems. State and local systems used in elections are vulnerable to intentional interference, errors, and natural disasters. States and localities have primary responsibility for securing election systems, including funding security measures and replacing voting machines if needed. The federal government provides some support, but the main responsibility lies with states and localities to ensure the physical and technological security of their election systems. States and localities bear the main responsibility for election system security, including funding ongoing costs and making decisions on securing election systems within federal standards. States and localities have the responsibility of securing election systems within federal standards. They make decisions on using electronic devices, conducting audits, setting security standards for vendors, training officials, securing materials, and combating misinformation. States can work with professional associations and social media companies to combat election disinformation and educate the public on safeguarding the electoral process. This includes partnering with social media companies to remove false posts and implementing disclosure requirements for digital political advertising. Selected policy issues and options shaping recent debates in Congress are summarized in Table 4. The Appendix summarizes legislation on campaign and election security in the 116th Congress, reflecting recent policy debates. Campaign and election security involve various statutes, agencies, and congressional committees. Congressional readers can use questions to decide on maintaining the status quo, appropriating funds, or pursuing changes. The federal government plays a key role in campaign and election security, with Congress deciding on involvement and defining policy areas. States and localities also have responsibilities in making security decisions, while debates on federal influence continue primarily below the federal level. The federal government can influence campaign and election security, but decisions are primarily made at the state and local levels. Examples include voter access, voter identification requirements, alleged vote fraud, and funding allocation. Communication between federal and nonfederal agencies, as well as clear points of contact, are important considerations for improving security measures. Congress may need to consider improving coordination among various agencies involved in campaign and election security. This includes determining if current coordinating mechanisms are sufficient or if additional resources are needed. Additionally, attention is given to outreach efforts to election sectors within the federal government. The government's focus on campaign and election security involves outreach to election administrators at all levels. The question arises about the adequacy of federal agency support for the private sector, like political campaigns. Congress may need to address information-sharing practices between federal agencies, the private sector, and voters. Consideration is also given to enhancing federal support for nongovernmental entities in election security and public education campaigns for voters. The federal government's focus on campaign and election security involves communication among government agencies and the private sector. Congress is considering additional responsibilities for educating voters and providing funding for nongovernmental organizations in response to evolving threats, particularly foreign interference highlighted during the 2016 election cycle. The issue of campaign and election security policy is likely to remain prominent for the foreseeable future."
