    "content": "The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their rules on small entities, including small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and certain not-for-profit organizations. Agencies must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) for proposed rules and a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) for final rules. The analyses must describe the regulatory action's objectives and the small entities affected. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their rules on small entities, including small businesses, governmental jurisdictions, and certain not-for-profit organizations. Agencies must prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) for proposed rules and a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA) for final rules. The analyses must describe the regulatory action's objectives and the small entities affected. The RFA does not define \"significant economic impact\" or \"substantial number of small entities,\" giving federal agencies discretion on when the act's analytical requirements are initiated. The RFA's analytical requirements do not apply to final rules without a proposed rule. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires federal agencies to assess the impact of their rules on small entities. It includes provisions such as publishing a regulatory flexibility agenda, monitoring agencies' compliance, and allowing judicial review of agency actions. Amendments in 1996 permitted judicial review under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 allowed judicial review of agencies' regulatory flexibility analyses for final rules. This strengthened the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and improved agencies' compliance. President George W. Bush's Executive Order 13272 in 2002 aimed to promote RFA compliance by requiring agencies to issue written guidelines. The executive order requires agencies to issue written procedures and policies to ensure that the potential impacts of their draft rules on small entities are properly considered. It also mandates agencies to notify the Office of Advocacy of any draft rules with a significant economic impact on small entities. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy is responsible for notifying agency heads of the requirements of the RFA and providing training on RFA compliance. Additionally, the Chief Counsel can provide comments on draft rules to the issuing agency and OIRA. The Office of Advocacy has published guidance on the RFA and trained over 20 agencies on compliance in FY2005. A rule with a significant economic impact on small entities can trigger various actions beyond regulatory flexibility analysis. When a rule has a SEISNSE, agencies must review it within 10 years of publication to determine if it should be amended or rescinded to minimize impact on small entities. Some agencies focus on rules with a regulatory flexibility analysis, while others review all rules to comply with Section 610 of the RFA. Section 610 of the RFA requires agencies to review all rules to determine if they have a significant economic impact on small entities. Agencies have discretion in defining \"significant\" impact. SBREFA also mandates compliance guides and advocacy review panels for rules affecting small entities. Compliance guides must be easily accessible on agency websites and distributed to industry contacts. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) requires agencies to provide \"small entity compliance guides\" to explain actions needed for compliance with final rules. Agencies may skip preparing guides if the rule has no significant economic impact on small entities. SBREFA also mandates advocacy review panels for proposed rules by EPA, OSHA, and CFPB. The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) mandates advocacy review panels for proposed rules by EPA, OSHA, and CFPB. The agencies must notify the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy and gather advice from representatives of affected small entities within 15 days. The review panel, consisting of federal employees, must report on recommendations within 60 days, which will be made public as part of the rulemaking record. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has noted a lack of clarity in the implementation of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) over the past 20 years. Different federal agencies have interpreted key provisions of the act differently, such as what constitutes a \"significant\" economic impact or a \"substantial\" number of small entities. Compliance with the act has varied widely among agencies, leading to different interpretations of the statute. In reports from 1999 and 2000, the GAO found that agencies had broad discretion in interpreting the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA). The GAO recommended that Congress clarify the act's requirements and define terms like \"significant economic impact\" and \"substantial number of small entities\" to improve implementation. In 2002, the GAO testified about the challenges in implementing the RFA and raised questions about interpreting the statute. They questioned whether agencies should consider the cumulative impact of similar rules on small entities and if the RFA should be triggered by rules with positive impacts on small entities. These unanswered questions have led agencies to develop their own interpretations, resulting in differing approaches to providing regulatory relief. In 2006, GAO testified that the full promise of RFA may never be realized until Congress clarifies key terms and definitions in the Act or provides an agency with clear authority. Numerous unresolved issues include how the economic impact of a rule should be measured and whether Congress believes in compliance costs as a percentage of businesses' annual revenues. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested that Congress review the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) to determine if changes are needed to better achieve its intended purposes. GAO also highlighted the importance of considering the impact of underlying statutes when determining the significance of agency rules and the need to review all rules with a significant economic impact. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently called for greater clarity in the Regulatory Flexibility Act's (RFA) requirements. The Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Advocacy emphasized the need for flexible definitions of key terms due to differences in agency operating environments. SBA stated that the lack of clear definitions in the act does not mean terms are completely ambiguous. In 1980, the SBA highlighted the challenges in defining \"significant economic impact\" under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The guidance provided examples of varying impact levels, from $500 in costs to a 2% revenue reduction. The bill H.R. 527 in the 112th Congress aimed to improve the analysis of rule impacts on small entities. Section 2(a) of the bill proposes changes to the definition of a \"rule\" to include a broader range of regulations. It also requires economic impact assessments to consider both direct and indirect effects on small entities, and mandates the inclusion of alternatives to maximize beneficial economic effects. Additionally, the bill calls for more detailed and quantifiable descriptions in the assessments. Section 4 of H.R. 527 mandates the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy to issue rules for agency compliance with the RFA within 270 days of enactment. Agencies must consult with the chief counsel before issuing their own rules on RFA compliance. The chief counsel can intervene in agency adjudications and file comments on proposed rules. Section 5 amends Section 609(b) of title 5, requiring agencies to notify the chief counsel about proposed rules impacting small entities. The SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy issues rules for agency compliance with the RFA. Agencies must consult with the chief counsel before issuing rules on RFA compliance. The chief counsel can intervene in agency adjudications and file comments on proposed rules. Agencies must notify the chief counsel about proposed rules impacting small entities with significant economic effects. The issuing agency must provide the Chief Counsel for Advocacy with all materials used in developing a proposed rule, including information on economic impacts on small entities. The Chief Counsel then identifies affected small entities and convenes a review panel within 60 days to submit a report to the agency and OIRA. Section 6 of H.R. 527 would require agencies to publish a plan for the periodic review of rules that have a significant economic impact on small entities. The review would include existing rules within 10 years of enactment and subsequent rules within 10 years of publication. Agencies must publish a list of rules to be reviewed and explain actions taken in response to the review report. The Federal Register would require agencies to publish a list of rules to be reviewed and request comments from the public, the chief counsel for advocacy, and the regulatory enforcement ombudsman. H.R. 527 addresses long-standing issues regarding the implementation of the RFA, including the inclusion of \"indirect\" effects in the definition of \"economic impact\" and clarifying review requirements for rules with a significant economic impact. The bill also adds analytical and notification requirements for rulemaking agencies. The SBA chief counsel for advocacy is required to issue rules governing agency compliance. The SBA chief counsel for advocacy is required to issue rules governing agency compliance with the RFA, potentially improving implementation. H.R. 527 widens the scope of the RFA by including agency guidance documents and policy statements as covered \"rules.\" Amendments to Section 609 of title 5 would broaden advocacy review panels beyond just EPA and OSHA to include the CFPB. H.R. 527 would expand panel requirements to all agencies and apply to \"major\" rules, regardless of SEISNSE. Some \"major\" rules involve over $100 million in federal transfer payments, government service fees, or consumer spending. Changes to the RFA could impact agencies' ability to issue regulations, with differing opinions on the amendments' effects. If enacted, the amendments would significantly alter the RFA's reach and requirements. H.R. 527 may result in more agency rules being seen as requiring an expanded regulatory flexibility analysis, including indirect effects that are \"reasonably foreseeable and result from the rule.\" H.R. 527 could lead to more agency rules being considered for an expanded regulatory flexibility analysis, including indirect effects that are \"reasonably foreseeable.\" The proposed legislation does not clearly define what constitutes \"reasonably foreseeable\" indirect effects, giving agencies discretion. Additionally, agencies may struggle to provide detailed information on indirect effects in their analyses, especially when implementation details are left to states or local governments. If enacted, H.R. 527 would also require agencies to review all their rules to determine if they have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (SEISNE) under Section 610 of the RFA, rather than relying on previous determinations. This change could result in a significant increase in Section 610 reviews. The proposed legislation, H.R. 527, could lead to more agency rules being considered for an expanded regulatory flexibility analysis, including \"reasonably foreseeable\" indirect effects. This change may result in more Section 610 reviews, but it is unclear how it will interact with requirements for retrospective analysis under Executive Order 13563. A report by GAO suggested that statutorily required regulatory reviews may be less effective than discretionary reviews by agencies, raising questions about the value of statutory review requirements like Section 610 of the RFA. The GAO report highlighted that discretionary retrospective reviews of agency rules were more effective and involved the public, while statutorily required reviews were more likely to have standards and documentation. Agencies were recommended to improve transparency in their policies and procedures for regulatory reviews."
