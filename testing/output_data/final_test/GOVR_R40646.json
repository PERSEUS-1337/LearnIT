    "content": "Derivatives are financial instruments whose value changes with the price of an underlying asset. They include futures contracts, options, and swap agreements. Traders predict price movements to profit, creating a zero-sum game where winners gain at the expense of losers. Derivatives trading involves predicting price trends to make profits or losses without owning the underlying asset. It raises questions about the difference between derivatives and gambling and the public interest served. Two benefits of derivatives trading are hedging against price risk and price discovery. Hedgers use the market to protect against falling prices, such as a cattle producer locking in today's price for future livestock sales. Hedging with futures contracts allows producers to offset potential losses from price fluctuations. Credit default swaps can also be used to hedge risk, such as a company protecting against a customer's default by purchasing a CDS on their bond. The use of credit default swaps allows firms to manage risk by receiving a lump sum in the event of a credit event. Speculators often take on the price risk that hedgers eliminate, with most trading in derivatives being speculative. The advantage of a large volume of trading is that hedgers can quickly find someone to take the opposite side of their trade. Centralized marketplaces like futures exchanges enable firms to hedge against risks by quickly finding counterparties. Price discovery is facilitated by incorporating all available information about supply and demand into the price. Traders base their decisions on various factors such as inventories, consumption, supply and demand trends, macroeconomic conditions, and market psychology. A competitive market is essential for determining prices fairly. The futures exchanges dictate prices to ensure efficient resource allocation. During extreme volatility, policymakers may scrutinize derivatives markets closely. Derivatives markets are divided into regulated exchange markets and the OTC market. In the United States, major derivatives exchanges are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Both agencies oversee fair and orderly trading, require registration of market professionals, and ensure public access to price and trading volume data. The OTC market was largely unregulated until the Dodd-Frank Act. The OTC derivatives market, unlike exchanges, is largely unregulated with dealers, mainly large banks, facilitating contracts for hedging or speculation. There is minimal transparency in OTC transactions compared to exchange trading, with little information available to the public or regulators. Despite different legal environments, exchange-traded and OTC contracts are economically interchangeable. The OTC derivatives market is largely unregulated, with minimal transparency compared to exchange trading. Exchange-traded and OTC contracts are economically interchangeable, with traders often using both as part of a single investment strategy. Both markets have seen significant growth in recent years, with OTC contracts outstanding rising by 522% and financial futures contracts traded on exchanges rising by 425% between 2000 and 2008. The OTC market's size is measured by notional value, which does not reflect actual swap payments but is used in their calculation. A single contract may involve multiple transactions over its life, making the number of transactions an inadequate measure. Exchange-traded futures can also have a notional value, such as an oil future representing 1,000 barrels of oil. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) publishes data on the notional value of exchange-traded futures based on financial variables. In 2008, the notional value of such contracts was $2.245 quadrillion. The growth of all categories of derivatives since 2000 has been remarkable, although it has not received much attention. The expansion of derivatives since 2000 has been remarkable, with little attention in the press and academia. The financial turmoil since 2007 led to a sharp downturn in derivatives activity, with CME Group reporting a decrease in trading contracts. Speculative losses and increased risk aversion may have contributed to these declines. Despite rapid growth in trading volumes, there has not been a proliferation of derivatives markets since 2000. Since 2000, there has been extensive consolidation among derivatives and securities exchanges globally. The top 10 global futures exchanges in 2000 have mostly merged with other exchanges, including the three largest U.S. futures exchanges forming the CME Group. Factors driving consolidation may include increased competition, shifting the framework from U.S. versus UK versus continental European markets to a broader battle. The battle for market share among global conglomerates through mergers is driven by the need for cost savings to invest in new electronic trading technology. Exchanges transitioning to for-profit corporations are adapting to a customer base dominated by hedge funds, money managers, and institutional investors with global portfolios. The shift towards a single, global monopoly marketplace for securities and derivatives is seen as inevitable, with the erosion of barriers to entry due to cheap computing power. The rise of electronic trading technology has diminished the monopoly of major exchanges, leading to the acquisition of small regional exchanges by high-tech start-ups for regulatory purposes. Market convergence includes OTC participants, with larger exchanges now offering clearing services for OTC contracts. Further consolidation is expected as clearing of OTC derivatives becomes more common. Major OTC dealers like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are involved in these developments. Major OTC dealers, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, are participating in new clearinghouse ventures for credit swaps and other OTC contracts. They could potentially launch takeover bids for even the largest publicly traded exchanges. Ten years ago, U.S. financial regulators viewed OTC derivatives as a beneficial innovation that expanded the range of financial products available and improved risk management. Private counterparty credit risk management was deemed effective by both regulated and unregulated dealers of OTC derivatives. In 1999, Alan Greenspan argued against regulation of OTC derivatives, stating that even CFTC supervision of exchange-traded financial futures and options might not be in the public interest. By 2009, views on OTC derivatives had shifted due to the oil price shock of 2008. In 1999, Alan Greenspan opposed regulating OTC derivatives, including financial futures and options. By 2009, concerns arose about derivatives' role in the 2008 oil price shock and financial crisis, with speculation and lack of transparency contributing to market volatility and systemic fragility. Derivatives played a part in transmitting financial shocks between firms and markets due to their complexity. During the housing boom, complex securities were created by packaging and repackaging home mortgage loans with derivatives to increase yield and obtain AAA ratings. The uncertainty of the securities' real value led to banks' financial condition becoming uncertain, slowing interbank lending and creating panic conditions. The interconnected nature of derivatives markets amplified fears of insolvency in financial institutions, as default by a single derivatives dealer could trigger widespread consequences. The post-2000 low interest rate environment led to market participants using leverage to boost investment returns through debt or derivatives, magnifying losses in U.S. mortgage lending globally. Excessive speculation and large speculative derivatives positions at firms like AIG resulted in catastrophic losses. The financial crisis was exacerbated by firms like AIG with large speculative derivatives positions. The price of crude oil surged to $145 in July 2008, then plummeted to $30 by December, with no clear explanation for the drastic fluctuations. The price of crude oil surged to $145 in July 2008, then plummeted to $30 by December, with no clear explanation for the drastic fluctuations. Many questioned if derivatives trading was responsible for the price movements, with concerns about manipulation and speculation. The CFTC testified that there was no evidence of broad-based manipulation, attributing the market behavior to traders' expectations. Despite this, soaring prices were seen as evidence of excessive speculation by some. The House passed H.R. 6377 (110 th Congress) in response to these concerns. The House passed H.R. 6377 (110 th Congress) in June 2008 to curb excessive speculation in energy markets, but the measure was not enacted due to concerns about drying up liquidity. Other bills aimed to increase oversight of OTC energy derivatives in response to price fluctuations. The CFTC announced initiatives to increase oversight of energy commodities, including setting federal speculative position limits and enhancing the weekly Commitments of Traders report. Bills aimed at regulating OTC energy derivatives failed to pass in Congress. The CFTC is using special call authority to collect data from swaps dealers and index investors in the OTC market. Legislation may mandate these steps, but the association of derivatives with market volatility is not causally established. The impact of derivatives on market volatility remains unresolved, especially during the rapid growth of derivatives trading in 2007 and 2008. The rapid growth in derivatives trading from 2000 to 2008 was driven by low returns on traditional investments, leading investors to seek higher yields through derivatives. This increased leverage and complexity in the financial system, potentially contributing to systemic fragility. The residential mortgage boom further incentivized the use of derivatives as mortgages were refinanced at low rates. The use of derivatives increased from 2000 to 2008 due to low returns on traditional investments and the refinancing of mortgages at low rates. Derivatives were used to hedge risks, boost yields, and create synthetic instruments. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted OTC financial and non-agricultural commodity derivatives from CFTC regulation, stimulating trading in OTC contracts. The CFMA of 2000 exempted OTC financial and non-agricultural commodity derivatives from regulation, leading to increased trading. Financial innovation enabled rapid trading of exotic derivatives, potentially causing a lag in risk assessment by market participants and regulators. This, combined with rising speculation and the proliferation of complex, unregulated derivatives, may have contributed to the financial crisis and commodity price bubble. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted sweeping derivatives reforms, with provisions not summarized here. The Commodity Exchange Act provides exemptions for off-exchange derivatives trading. Several bills contain provisions related to derivatives trading. Several bills aim to narrow or eliminate exemptions from CFTC regulation for OTC derivatives trading. S. 272 repeals CEA sections exempting OTC derivatives and removes CFTC's authority to issue regulatory exemptions. This would abolish OTC markets in the US, allowing derivatives trading only on CFTC-regulated exchanges. Other bills target the statutory exemption for OTC contracts based on energy commodities, introducing new definitions for \"energy commodity\" to remove them from the exempt commodities category. Energy commodities would lose their exempt status under the CEA, requiring them to be traded OTC only with a specific exemption from the CFTC. Bills propose settling and clearing OTC derivative contracts through clearing organizations to ensure payment guarantees and prevent credit risks. The clearing organization ensures payment on all contracts, preventing fraud and manipulation. Clearing of OTC contracts would bring self-regulation and centralize trade data. Regulators receive daily reports on large positions to monitor market activity. In the OTC market, large financial intermediaries act as dealers, taking the other side of trades and bearing the risk of customer default. Current law does not require OTC dealers to disclose market data to regulators, limiting information availability. Proposed bills would require clearing through a regulated organization to be exempt from CFTC regulation, with exemptions possible for highly customized contracts. The bills propose clearing OTC contracts through regulated organizations to be exempt from CFTC regulation, with exemptions for customized contracts. Clearinghouses would manage risk by offsetting contracts, subject to financial integrity standards. Credit swaps would be cleared through a designated clearinghouse, capitalized by traders to ensure payment guarantees. Position and trading data disclosure would be required by clearing organizations to regulators or the public. Several bills propose new reporting and oversight requirements for OTC contracts. S. 961 would allow federal regulators to regulate swaps and impose disclosure, reporting, or recordkeeping requirements on financial institutions. The bill includes a definition of \"swap agreement\" and requires agencies to consult with each other before taking action. The bills propose new reporting and oversight requirements for OTC contracts. H.R. 977 extends the large trader reporting system to the OTC market and directs the CFTC to establish recordkeeping standards. S. 447 and S. 807 apply recordkeeping and reporting requirements to energy and agricultural OTC contracts. S. 807 and S. 447 authorize the CFTC to collect information on large OTC transactions in energy or agricultural commodities to prevent manipulation and excessive speculation. The CFTC can issue \"special calls\" for information and impose limits on OTC positions if necessary to ensure market integrity and prevent market disruptions. H.R. 977 would authorize the CFTC to impose position limits on fungible OTC contracts to prevent market manipulation, ensure liquidity, and maintain price discovery in all OTC markets. S. 807 would require the CFTC to study establishing limits on OTC positions in energy and agricultural commodities. H.R. 3153 proposes a tax on over-the-counter derivatives transactions. H.R. 977 grants the CFTC authority to suspend trading in credit default swaps (CDS) if deemed necessary for public interest and investor protection. H.R. 1754 and S. 664 require all CDS to be cleared through a designated clearinghouse, with SEC rules to prevent fraudulent practices and ensure adequate capitalization. The bills propose new eligibility requirements for trading credit default swaps, limiting participation to those who own the credit instrument being insured, would suffer financial loss from a credit event, or meet capital adequacy standards set by the CFTC. H.R. 3145 aims to prohibit credit default swaps and give the SEC authority to regulate swap agreements based on securities. Following the 2008 oil price surge, legislative focus shifted to CFTC oversight of futures markets. Bills like S. 1225 and H.R. 2869 aim to curb excessive speculation in energy markets and eliminate unlawful activities hindering accurate market reflection. These bills also address conflicts of interest in trading. The CFTC aims to eliminate conflicts of interest in trading energy derivatives, issue forecasts about oil prices, and operate oil assets. Current law allows the CFTC to set position limits for speculators on futures exchanges, but limits are only established for a few agricultural contracts. Bills propose directing the CFTC to set position limits for futures contracts based on physically deliverable commodities or energy and agricultural commodities. H.R. 977, H.R. 2448 / H.R. 2454, S. 447, S. 807, S. 1225, H.R. 2869, and S. 1412 propose various measures for the CFTC to set position limits for energy and agricultural commodities, convene advisory groups, and impose speculative position limits on bank holding companies and hedge funds engaged in energy futures trading. The CFTC's concerns about excessive speculation in oil markets led to a focus on published statistics on futures positions. Institutional investors, like pension funds, invest in commodities through OTC contracts tied to commodity price indexes, which may involve offsetting risks with futures positions. Several bills aim to require the CFTC to disaggregate its Commitments of Traders reporting by distinguishing positions held by swap dealers and index traders in the futures markets. This is in response to concerns that swap dealers are hedging speculative bets made by institutional investors, rather than true commercial hedging. The definition of hedging is also a related issue being discussed. Several bills propose to narrow the definition of hedging in futures markets to exclude intermediaries hedging risk from someone else's financial speculation. They introduce a new definition of \"bona fide hedging,\" requiring at least one party to face risks from physical commodity dealings for a transaction to qualify. This means that positions taken by investment banks to hedge OTC contract risks with financial speculators would not qualify, subjecting them to speculative position limits. H.R. 2869 aims to classify bank holding companies and hedge funds engaged in energy futures trading as non-commercial traders, subject to position limits. The \"London loophole\" pertains to differences in oversight of regulated markets in different countries, with ICE Futures Europe in the UK offering energy futures contracts in the US without registering with the CFTC due to regulatory waivers. The UK market is already regulated at home, so requiring registration with the CFTC would be duplicative. There is scrutiny over ICE Futures Europe's activities in the US, with questions about speculative position limits and information sharing. Proposed bills aim to close the \"London loophole\" by ensuring the CFTC receives comparable information from foreign markets. The proposed bills aim to regulate foreign exchanges and the foreign market under anti-manipulation rules similar to the CFTC's regulations. Various provisions target commodities, energy, and agriculture, with calls for increased CFTC staffing, authorization for fee collection from clearing organizations, and the creation of an international regulatory working group. Additionally, there are measures to revoke CFTC staff no-action letters for foreign board of trades operating in the US. H.R. 977, S. 807, and H.R. 2454 propose regulations for energy commodity futures, greenhouse gas emissions, and derivatives trading. A derivatives market for emission allowances is expected to emerge in the US, similar to Europe. The bills address the oversight of carbon allowance derivatives under CFTC jurisdiction. The bills H.R. 977, S. 807, and H.R. 2454 propose regulations for energy commodity futures, greenhouse gas emissions, and derivatives trading. Emission derivatives would be treated like agricultural contracts, with specific exemptions from the CFTC. The CFTC would regulate the allowance derivatives market, while FERC would oversee trading in physical allowances. Coordination between the CFTC and the Secretary of Agriculture is required to ensure the proper development of market-based greenhouse gas programs. The bill H.R. 2448 proposes regulations for the allowance derivatives market, with recommendations from an interagency working group. The CFTC would regulate trading of derivatives contracts based on carbon or greenhouse gas emissions. The bill specifies that regulated allowance derivatives should be subject to the same degree of regulation. The bill H.R. 2448 proposes regulations for allowance derivatives, subjecting them to the same level of regulation as energy transactions. This differs from H.R. 2454, with provisions for OTC and exchange-based derivatives. S. 1399 would have the CFTC regulate carbon allowance and derivative markets, with measures against manipulation and fraud. Trading would occur on registered carbon trading facilities and be cleared by CFTC-regulated clearinghouses. S. 1399 proposes regulations for carbon trading facilities, requiring registration with the CFTC for traders and brokers. The bill includes self-regulatory duties for registered facilities, position limits, and oversight through a centralized electronic system. The CFTC would collect trading fees to cover oversight costs. The Obama Administration proposed a revamp of financial regulations, including OTC derivatives oversight. The plan aims to enhance transparency and market discipline by clearing standardized OTC derivatives through regulated central counterparties, increasing market transparency, and implementing reporting and record-keeping requirements. The Obama Administration proposed a revamp of financial regulations, including OTC derivatives oversight to prevent market manipulation, fraud, and other abuses. The plan focuses on increasing transparency, standardization, and monitoring activities in the OTC derivatives markets to prevent systemic risks to the financial system. It also aims to strengthen regulation of OTC derivatives dealers and ensure appropriate sales practices. The Obama Administration proposed a plan to regulate OTC derivatives, aiming to increase transparency and prevent market manipulation. The plan calls for clearing of all standardized OTC derivatives through regulated central counterparties, but does not specify the distinction between standardized and customized derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act incorporated some of the proposals with significant changes. The Obama Administration's plan for OTC derivatives regulation aims to improve transparency by making aggregated market data public and enhancing price transparency. CCPs and trade repositories would need to disclose aggregate data on open positions and trading volumes, report trades timely, and share prices. Individual counterparty data would be available confidentially to regulatory bodies. Some industry players oppose price transparency to avoid losing money due to wider bid-ask spreads. The Wall Street Journal reported that efforts to improve price transparency in the corporate bond market reduced bank fees by over $1 billion annually. The DTCC collects data on CDS trades and releases aggregate information weekly. Markit publishes end-of-day prices on CDS linked to 400 bonds and is under investigation for antitrust violations. The Administration urges regulated financial institutions to use exchange-traded derivatives instead of OTC derivatives for transparency and oversight. They propose amending laws to allow SEC and CFTC to impose record-keeping and reporting requirements on all OTC derivatives trades. Record-keeping requirements can be satisfied through clearing standardized transactions or reporting customized transactions to a regulated trade repository. The Administration plan aims to reduce fraud and manipulation in the OTC market by urging Congress to make necessary changes to the Commodities Exchange Act and federal securities laws. It calls for clear authority for the CFTC and SEC to police fraud and market abuses, and for the CFTC to set position limits on OTC derivatives. The plan also highlights the need for stricter limits on counterparties participating in OTC derivatives. The Administration plan proposes stricter limits on counterparties participating in OTC derivatives, including possible changes such as tightening limits, imposing additional disclosure requirements, and introducing conservative capital and initial margin requirements to hedge counterparty credit exposures. Regulatory capital requirements for OTC derivatives not cleared through a CCP may also be increased for banks. The Administration plan aims to increase regulatory capital requirements for OTC derivatives not cleared through a CCP for banks and bank holding companies. It also seeks to eliminate jurisdictional uncertainties between the SEC and the CFTC regarding the regulation of different types of derivatives products. This includes addressing overlapping and competing jurisdiction issues that have hindered the growth of new products. The Administration's plan aims to eliminate jurisdictional uncertainty between the SEC and the CFTC in regulating derivatives products. It calls for consistent procedures for reviewing new products and rulemakings by SROs, harmonizing regulatory approaches, and expanding the types of filings accepted by the SEC. The Administration's plan calls for tougher standards at the CFTC, requiring prior approval for more types of rules. It also urges the CFTC and SEC to identify conflicts in statutes and regulations regarding financial instruments by September 30, 2009. If disagreements persist, they should be referred to the Financial Services Oversight Council for resolution. The Administration's plan calls for tougher standards at the CFTC and SEC to identify conflicts in statutes and regulations regarding financial instruments. The Administration has not yet clarified its position on the extent of SEC or other regulators' involvement in regulating OTC derivatives. Some view this as encroaching on the CFTC's jurisdiction, while others question the CFTC's ability to supervise the OTC markets in financial derivatives. The Dodd-Frank Act allows for joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking, but the agencies will operate independently. The Administration's plan gives the Federal Reserve more powers over the derivatives market, especially in overseeing payments systems for previously unregulated OTC derivatives transactions. The Administration's plan aims to address systematic risks in settlement arrangements for OTC derivatives and tri-party repurchase agreements. Progress in reducing backlogs of unconfirmed trades in credit swaps has been slow, prompting the need for legislation to define systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement systems. The Federal Reserve has relied on moral suasion rather than federal authority to encourage reforms in these areas. Legislation is needed to define systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement systems. The Federal Reserve would have the power to collect information and impose risk management on these systems to ensure timely settlement. Regular safety and soundness examinations would be conducted by the CFTC or SEC, with the Federal Reserve having the right to participate. The Administration plan proposes to give the Federal Reserve authority to conduct examinations and compel corrective action for risk management in payment, clearing, and settlement systems. It also suggests extending access to the Federal Reserve's discount window for emergency purposes. The Administration's plan aims to reduce systemic risk in financial systems by addressing liquidity issues during times of financial stress. Extending access to Reserve Bank accounts and financial services for derivatives payment systems is part of this effort. Additionally, Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act grants the Federal Reserve more authority over systemically important financial utilities, including clearinghouses. An oil futures contract represents 1,000 barrels of oil, with parties agreeing to buy or sell at a future date. Contracts are settled in cash, with prices based on current market prices. The Dodd-Frank Act grants the Federal Reserve more authority over systemically important financial utilities, including clearinghouses. The long trader benefits from a price increase in oil futures, making a profit of $5,000 when the price goes up to $60/barrel and another $5,000 if it goes up to $65/barrel. The short trader, who is obligated to sell at a lower price, may exit the market by entering into an offsetting transaction to neutralize her position. The short trader can exit the market by entering an offsetting transaction, which will zero out the effect of the two transactions. The exchange's clearinghouse guarantees payment and assumes all contracts, allowing traders to enter and exit the market without physical delivery of the commodity. Trading strategies can be based on short-term price expectations, with some traders holding positions for weeks or months while others trade within minutes or seconds. Traders are required to deposit an initial margin payment before entering a trade. When trading futures contracts, traders must deposit an initial margin payment set by the exchange. Contracts are marked-to-market daily, with gains credited to the margin account and losses requiring additional margin payments. Exiting the market results in any remaining funds in the margin account being returned. Options on futures contracts are also available, giving the holder the right to enter into a long or short futures contract. Options give the holder the right to enter into a long or short futures contract, with the option only being exercised if price movements are favorable. The seller receives a premium and profits if the option is not exercised. Options trading allows traders to limit potential losses, unlike futures trading which is a zero-sum game. One key distinction is that with options, one party has the right but not the obligation to buy an asset in the future at a predetermined price. Options are contracts that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price in the future. The buyer pays a premium to the seller for this right, and the seller is obligated to buy or sell the asset at the agreed-upon price. If prices move unfavorably, the buyer can simply let the option expire without exercising it. The buyer pays a premium for the option, which gives them the right to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price in the future. If the option expires unexercised, the seller keeps the premium. The option buyer's profit potential is unlimited, as the option writer is obligated to buy or sell at the specified strike price. Option prices are influenced by factors like the relationship between the strike price and the current market price, known as the intrinsic value. If an option is \"in the money,\" the holder can exercise at a profit. Options are traded on securities and futures exchanges and over-the-counter. Underlying assets include stocks, stock indexes, futures contracts, currencies, interest rates, and physical commodities. OTC contracts may include option-like features such as swaps. Time value depends on expiration time and asset price volatility, affecting the probability of the option being profitable. The OTC derivatives market includes swap agreements where two counterparties exchange payments periodically based on a notional principal and economic variable like interest rates or currency exchange rates. Swaps help manage financial obligations, such as hedging against currency exchange rate fluctuations. Sallie Mae uses currency and interest rate swaps to manage risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes. Currency swaps involve exchanging pounds for dollars at a fixed rate to eliminate exchange rate risk, while interest rate swaps involve exchanging a fixed rate obligation for a floating rate to avoid interest rate risk. Sallie Mae swaps fixed rate pound obligations for a floating rate in an interest rate swap. Payments are based on LIBOR, with Sallie Mae receiving a fixed interest payment to cover bondholders. This swap protects against potential discrepancies between LIBOR and the U.S. Treasury bill rate. Sallie Mae converts fixed-rate pound obligations into floating-rate dollar obligations through basic swap deals, protecting against discrepancies between LIBOR and the U.S. Treasury bill rate. Derivatives in swap agreements can become more complex with options characteristics, such as setting upper or lower payment limits. The universe of derivative contracts is constantly evolving with new contracts and exotic variations. Glossary of Terms includes definitions like Arbitrage - a strategy involving simultaneous purchase and sale of instruments in different markets to benefit from price discrepancies. Artificial Price refers to futures price affected by manipulation. An At-the-Market order is to buy or sell a futures contract at the obtainable price.

A Corner involves controlling a commodity's price or obtaining contracts for more commodities than available. Counterparty refers to the opposite party in a bilateral agreement, with Counterparty Risk being the financial stability risk associated with the party. Forward contracts carry default risks, while futures contracts on designated markets are guaranteed against default. Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a tradeable contract where one party pays another in case of a credit event like default, bankruptcy, or credit rating downgrade. Credit Event refers to events like debt default or bankruptcy affecting credit derivative payoff. Credit Rating is a rating by agencies like Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Moody's indicating borrower's repayment likelihood. Credit Risk is the risk of borrower or derivatives counterparty default. Day Trader is a trader who takes and offsets positions on the same day. A day trader is a person with exchange trading privileges who takes positions and offsets them within the same trading session. Dealers are individuals or financial firms that buy and sell securities and commodities for their own account. Delta is the expected change in an option's price based on the underlying futures contract or commodity price movement. Derivatives are financial contracts linked to underlying commodities or financial variables. Derivatives are financial contracts used by hedgers and speculators to shift risk or profit from price trends. Examples include futures contracts, options, and swaps. A Derivatives Clearing Organization enables parties to substitute credit and provides clearing services to mutualize credit risk. A Derivatives Transaction Execution Facility is a registered board of trade subject to CFTC regulations. A DTEF is a board of trade registered with the CFTC subject to fewer regulatory requirements than a contract market. To qualify, an exchange can only trade certain commodities and generally must exclude retail participants. Designated Contract Market is the CEA term for a futures exchange. Eligible Contract Participant is an entity classified by the Commodity Exchange Act based on regulated status or assets, allowing them to engage in OTC and other transactions. Eligible Contract Participants are entities classified based on regulated status or assets, allowing them to engage in OTC and other transactions not available to retail customers. Exchanges are central marketplaces where buyers and sellers trade futures, options contracts, or securities. Excluded commodities are financial instruments like securities, currencies, or interest rates, while exempt commodities are any commodities other than excluded or agricultural commodities. The curr_chunk discusses commodity trading terms such as Exercise Price, Forward Contract, and Functional Regulation. It explains how forward contracts involve personalized agreements between buyers and sellers for future delivery of goods. Functional Regulation refers to regulatory arrangements based on activity rather than organizational structure. The curr_chunk focuses on the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act's call for functional regulation in commodity trading. It defines terms like Futures Commission Merchant, Futures Contract, Gamma, and Haircut. Hedge funds are essentially unregulated mutual funds limited to qualified investors with high net worth. They invest in various assets to reduce the impact of adverse movements in interest rates, commodities, or securities. Haircut is a percentage reduction from the stated value to account for possible declines in value before assets can be liquidated. Hedge Exemption allows exemptions from speculative position limits for bona fide hedgers and certain other persons meeting exchange and CFTC rules. The intention of hedging is to reduce the impact of adverse movements in interest rates, commodities, or securities prices. Hedging instruments gain value as the hedged item loses value. Initial Margin is customers' funds put up as security for contract fulfillment in futures markets. Interest Rate Swap involves exchanging interest rate flows between counterparties. International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a New York-based group. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) is a New York-based group that publishes the Swaps Code for interest rate swaps. In-the-Money refers to an option contract with positive value if exercised. Investment Bank is a financial intermediary involved in securities business. Leverage is the ability to control large dollar amounts. Leverage allows control of large amounts with small capital through borrowing or derivatives. Liquidity is the ability to trade assets quickly without affecting prices. Liquidity risk is the possibility of assets becoming illiquid. Manipulation involves artificial price maintenance through planned operations or transactions. Margin is the amount of money deposited with a broker for trading. Initial margin is required when opening a futures position, while maintenance margin must be maintained at all times. If equity drops below maintenance margin, a margin call is issued. Exchanges set margin levels for futures contracts, but brokers may require additional margin from customers. Market Risk is the potential for a tradeable security or asset to decrease in value, resulting in a loss for the holder. A Market Maker is a professional dealer on an exchange who is obligated to buy when there are more sell orders and sell when there are more buy orders. They manage risk by maintaining offering prices higher than their buying prices. In the futures industry, market makers provide liquidity by speculating for their own account. They are compensated for the risk involved in maintaining inventory to balance order imbalances. Mark-to-Market is used to calculate daily gains or losses in futures or options contracts. Netting in derivatives markets involves payment netting and closeout netting to reduce credit and settlement risks. Payment netting consolidates multiple cash flows into one payment per currency, reducing settlement risk and streamlining processing. Closeout netting mitigates pre-settlement risk by offsetting multiple obligations between counterparties. Closeout netting reduces pre-settlement risk by offsetting multiple obligations between counterparties in derivatives markets. If a counterparty defaults, outstanding contracts are terminated, marked to market, and settled with a net payment. Notional Principal is the amount to which interest rates are applied in derivative instruments. Open Interest is the total number of futures contracts not yet liquidated. Operational Risk is the possibility of financial losses from transaction processing failures.
