    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting Religious Minorities Persecuted by ISIS Act of 2015\" outlines processing mechanisms. The Act titled \"Protecting Religious Minorities Persecuted by ISIS Act of 2015\" mandates the establishment of refugee processing mechanisms within 60 days. These mechanisms will allow aliens to apply for admission to the United States as refugees, with thorough background and security checks using biographic and biometric data. SEC. 3. UNITED STATES REFUGEE PROGRAM PROCESSING PRIORITIES. Refugees eligible for Priority 2 processing under the refugee resettlement system include those from Iraq or Syria who have been persecuted by groups like ISIS based on minority status, gender, or other characteristics identified by the Secretary of State. No alien shall be denied admission solely because they qualify as an immediate relative. Aliens who qualify as immediate relatives, are eligible for other immigrant classifications, or were referred by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization for refugee status, may reapply for refugee status if previously denied. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will protect and consider these reapplications. If an alien described in subsection (a) and applying for refugee status is in imminent danger, the Secretary will make efforts to protect or remove them from the country. SEC. 4. DETERMINATIONS OF REFUGEE APPLICATIONS. The adjudicator of a refugee application must consider all evidence and maintain a record. The applicant may have legal representation at no cost, and any decision to deny the application must be in writing. The denial of refugee status must be in writing and include reasons such as facts, credibility findings, and waiver availability. Applicants can request a review of the denial within 120 days. Refugee officers trained to review denials must do so within 90 days of the request. The Secretary will publish the standard for review online. The officer can affirm, reverse, or reopen the application for further review. Refugee officers must review denials within 90 days of the request. They can affirm, reverse, or reopen the application for further investigation and interviews to determine the denial outcome. If the denial is affirmed, a written decision must be provided with information on the reason for the denial. SEC. 5. EXPEDITED SYSTEM FOR PRIORITY 2 REFUGEE PROCESSING. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must submit a report to specific congressional committees within 120 days of this Act's enactment. The report will detail a plan to expedite the processing of refugee applications for admission to the United States under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This includes measures such as temporarily expanding the Refugee Corps of USCIS to facilitate resettlement. The plan includes increasing personnel for processing refugee applications, streamlining background checks, establishing processing facilities in Iraq, and projecting the number of refugee interviews for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, will implement a plan to increase refugee interviews within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 6. REPORTS. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must submit an annual unclassified report to Congress, including an assessment of resources needed, the number of specified aliens, their refugee applications, and reasons for delays in processing. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must submit a report to Congress on video-conference refugee interviews, including the number of applicants awaiting interviews in inaccessible locations, locations where Refugee Corps Officer circuit rides were suspended in 2014, and a proposal for implementing video-conference interviews for aliens applying for admission to the United States. Aliens who applied for refugee admission in the United States and currently reside in locations where Refugee Corps circuit rides have been suspended will attend a conference. The United States government's policy is outlined in Section 7. The United States government's policy is to protect local populations during conflicts, provide safe environments for displaced populations in host countries, encourage integration of refugees in host countries, and support vulnerable refugees facing challenges during or after conflicts. The United States should facilitate third country resettlement for vulnerable refugees, including resettlement in the US for those of special humanitarian concern."
