    "content": "The aggregate student loan debt in the United States has significantly increased over time, with average tuition prices doubling at colleges and universities. The total outstanding federal student loan debt is estimated to be over $1.37 trillion. Many borrowers are struggling to repay their loans, facing a debt burden that exceeds a manageable percentage of income. Declaring bankruptcy is a way to potentially relieve oneself from a student loan that cannot be repaid. However, the Bankruptcy Code limits the discharge of student loans to cases where the debtor proves undue hardship. Congress aimed to balance providing relief to debtors in financial distress with preventing abuse of the student loan program. The report discusses the debate over amending the Bankruptcy Code to address the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy. Some support the current law, while others propose bills in Congress to modify how student loans are handled in bankruptcy. The report provides an overview of legal issues surrounding discharging student loans in bankruptcy, starting with general background on bankruptcy law and debt discharge principles. The report discusses bankruptcy law and the discharge of debt, focusing on student loans and the \"undue hardship\" standard. It outlines legal standards for determining eligibility for discharge and suggests potential changes to the Bankruptcy Code by Congress. Bankruptcy offers a way for insolvent debtors to reorganize their finances and start anew. The Bankruptcy Code allows debtors to start fresh by forgiving existing debts and restoring them to economic productivity in exchange for giving up assets or future income. By filing a bankruptcy petition in a federal court and meeting certain requirements, debtors may receive a discharge from many outstanding debts, providing relief from financial obligations. Some debts arising before bankruptcy filing may not be fully repaid. Certain debts, like domestic support obligations or those from drunk driving, are generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy due to public policy. Student loans are also typically nondischargeable unless undue hardship is proven. Student loans are usually nondischargeable in bankruptcy unless undue hardship is proven. This exception applies to educational benefit overpayments, obligations to repay educational funds, and qualified education loans. The discharge a debtor receives at the end of bankruptcy does not include student loan debt unless a hardship determination is secured. In bankruptcy cases, student loans typically cannot be discharged unless undue hardship is proven. The debtor must file a separate complaint and prove that repaying the loan would impose undue hardship. Congress has made it increasingly difficult to discharge student loans since the 1970s. The report discusses the history of statutes making it harder to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, focusing on the \"undue hardship\" standard and potential changes by Congress. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 first made student loans presumptively nondischargeable, citing reasons like preserving student loan programs. Several Members cited the country's interest in preserving student loan programs as a reason for making student loans presumptively nondischargeable under Section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. This was to ensure that future students would have access to federal student loans and prevent abuse of the system. The concern addressed is that student borrowers may abuse student loan programs by filing bankruptcy after graduation to avoid repayment. Despite the large debt compared to assets post-graduation, the education obtained should lead to increased income in the future, allowing for repayment over time. If loans could be discharged immediately after graduation, recent graduates could obtain debt relief before benefiting from their education. Congress intended Section 523(a)(8) to prevent recent graduates from abusing the system by declaring bankruptcy immediately after graduation to discharge their student loans. This would be seen as fraud and unfair to taxpayers who funded their education. Unlike other forms of debt, student loans cannot be repossessed if the debtor defaults, making it crucial to prevent easy discharge of debts at the expense of taxpayers. Members supporting Section 523(a)(8) argued that student loans should be treated differently in bankruptcy due to their unique nature compared to other consumer debts. Congress has made it increasingly difficult for debtors to discharge student loans since 1978, with amendments focusing on proving undue hardship or a loan being at least five years old for discharge. In 1998, Congress eliminated the option for debtors to discharge student loans without proving undue hardship. Demonstrating undue hardship is now the only way to discharge a student loan in bankruptcy. Private educational loans, like federal student loans, are commonly used to fund education. While federal student loan defaults shift the cost to taxpayers, private loan defaults do not directly impact taxpayers. In 2005, Congress expanded the definition of student loans covered under bankruptcy laws to include private loans, making all student loans essentially non-dischargeable without proving undue hardship. This change aimed to create a fair system for both debtors and creditors. The Bankruptcy Code expanded to include private education loans, making them subject to the undue hardship requirement. The interpretation of \"undue hardship\" has been left to the federal judiciary as the Supreme Court has not directly addressed it. Lower courts have developed various legal standards to determine if a student loan can be discharged. The majority of courts have set three criteria to prove \"undue hardship\" for discharging student loans: inability to maintain a minimal standard of living, likelihood of continued inability to pay, and good faith efforts to repay. The \"Brunner\" test, derived from the Second Circuit case, sets a standard for proving undue hardship in discharging student loans. Courts have varying interpretations of the test, leading to splits on factors such as permissible expenses, future inability to repay, medical evidence requirements, income maximization efforts, and other considerations. The Brunner test sets a standard for proving undue hardship in discharging student loans. Courts consider factors like employment opportunities, education value, and pre-loan circumstances. To qualify for discharge, the debtor must show inability to maintain a minimal standard of living based on current income and expenses. The court evaluates the debtor's budget to determine their capability to repay student loans without undue hardship. It focuses on the reasonableness of the budget and may disregard unnecessary expenses to see if funds can be directed towards loan repayment. The court examines the debtor's expense budget as a whole rather than scrutinizing individual items. The court evaluates the debtor's expense budget as a whole to determine if it is reasonable. A minimal standard of living includes shelter, utilities, food, and personal hygiene. People need basic necessities like food, clothing, shelter, and communication tools. They also require transportation, health insurance, and some form of recreation. The debtor may need to make personal and financial sacrifices to repay debt, as courts may deny undue hardship discharges if expenses are deemed excessive. Courts use common sense and general experience to determine if expenses are necessary or unreasonable. Courts often disagree on what expenses are necessary for maintaining a minimal standard of living in bankruptcy cases. Some courts have ruled that tithing to a religious institution cannot be done at the expense of repaying student loans, while others have allowed it. Some courts debate whether tithing and cigarette expenses should be considered in bankruptcy cases. Tithing may be evaluated under the reasonableness standard, while cigarette expenses may or may not count towards a minimal standard of living. Courts have differing opinions on whether a debtor's cigarette expenses and retirement contributions should be considered in bankruptcy cases. While some courts view retirement contributions as available income that could be used to repay a student loan, others allow for retirement expenses, especially for debtors close to retirement age. Courts have differing opinions on whether a debtor's retirement contributions should be considered in bankruptcy cases, especially for debtors close to retirement age. Some courts believe it is unreasonable for debtors seeking to discharge educational loans to support adult children at the expense of creditors, while others allow voluntary payments on behalf of adult children in cases of undue hardship. Some courts allow undue hardship discharge for debtors prioritizing support for minor children over creditors, but not for nondependent adult children. Courts are divided on whether caring for a disabled parent can be considered a necessary expense for maintaining a minimal standard of living in bankruptcy cases. Some courts consider the economics of the debtor and their family unit when determining ability to pay for student loans. Courts also take into account the income of a spouse or live-in companion when assessing undue hardship discharge. The debtor must prove that his inability to maintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the loans is likely to persist into the future. This requires showing that additional circumstances exist that illustrate he will not be able to repay the loans for a substantial part of the repayment period. Courts apply different legal standards and consider various factors for this inquiry. Debtors seeking undue hardship discharge in bankruptcy cases may face varying standards in different courts. While most courts require debtors to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" in repaying loans, some argue against this strict requirement, emphasizing the importance of a fresh start for honest debtors. This discrepancy in standards can impact debtors' decisions on seeking bankruptcy relief. Courts vary in their standards for determining undue hardship discharge in bankruptcy cases. While some require debtors to prove a \"certainty of hopelessness\" in repaying loans, others consider the debtor's circumstances and ability to provide for basic needs. The Supreme Court has not yet clarified the requirement of demonstrating \"a 'certainty of hopelessness,\" and the Ninth Circuit has a more lenient approach, focusing on the inability to pay rather than exceptional circumstances. Some courts have developed factors to consider when determining if a debtor's inability to repay a student loan will persist, such as serious disabilities, lack of education or job skills, underemployment, and limited work years remaining. Some courts have developed factors to consider when determining if a debtor's inability to repay a student loan will persist, such as serious disabilities, lack of education or job skills, underemployment, and limited work years remaining. Factors considered include debt amount, interest rate, minimizing expenses, income, earning ability, health, education, dependents, age, wealth, professional degree, and maximizing income through suitable employment. Various courts have differing opinions on these factors and how to apply them in cases like Brunner. Several courts have differing opinions on how to apply Brunner's second prong for determining undue hardship in student loan discharge cases. While a medical condition is not a prerequisite for establishing undue hardship, it must impair the debtor's ability to work to support a discharge. The debtor must identify their problems and explain how their condition would affect their future work ability to qualify for an undue hardship discharge. Some courts disagree on the evidence required to prove inability to repay student loans due to a medical condition. Testimony alone may be sufficient if credible and detailed, without the need for additional medical evidence. This is based on the second prong of the Brunner test for hardship discharge of student loans. Courts differ on the evidence needed to prove medical hardship for student loan discharge. Some require corroborating medical evidence like records or a doctor's letter, stating debtor testimony alone is insufficient. This contrasts with other courts that accept detailed and credible testimony without additional medical proof, based on the Brunner test's second prong. Courts are divided on whether a debtor must switch careers to obtain a higher paying job to satisfy the second prong of the Brunner test for student loan discharge. Some courts allow debtors to demonstrate they cannot advance in their chosen field, while others require debtors to maximize income by pursuing a career outside their field. Courts may require debtors with low-paying education to seek higher-paying employment opportunities before claiming undue hardship for student loan discharge. Debtors cannot purposefully choose lower-paying work if they are qualified for higher-paying jobs in their field of expertise. Some courts disagree on whether the value of the education financed by a student loan should impact the ability to discharge the loan. They argue that considering the education's value goes against the purpose of the loan program and turns the government into an educational value insurer, leading to unfair outcomes for students. These courts have concluded that the Brunner test does not allow discharge based on the education's value. Some courts have ruled that the Brunner test does not allow discharge of a student loan based on a poor career choice in selecting the curriculum financed by the loan. They have also denied discharge on the basis of school misleading the debtor in selecting the curriculum. These courts argue against considering the educational value received when determining undue hardship discharge. Some courts have ruled against granting discharge of student loans based on poor career choices or school misleading debtors in selecting the curriculum. They argue that the educational value received should not be considered when determining undue hardship discharge. The objective is to punish institutions for forcing students into loans not in their best interests, as taxpayers bear the cost of defaults. In a notable case, a debtor was granted discharge because the school provided education of dubious value, such as showing films of \"Batman\" in a marketing course. Some courts consider if the school closed before the debtor completed their education financed by student loans for undue hardship discharge. Age can be a factor, with some courts allowing it as a reason for undue hardship due to its impact on job prospects and work years. However, other courts may not consider age alone as a reason for undue hardship without serious illness or disability. Some courts do not consider age alone as a reason for undue hardship without serious illness or disability. The debtor's age standing alone is not sufficient to satisfy the second prong of the Brunner test when incurring student loans later in life. Some courts do not require \"additional circumstances\" to postdate the loan issuance. Courts focus on the debtor's good faith efforts to repay loans, including seeking employment, maximizing income, and minimizing expenses. Good faith may also involve making payments when possible or renegotiating payment plans. \"In determining good faith effort to repay student loans, courts consider if payments were made, the total amount of payments, and the time between loan due date and seeking discharge. Lack of funds to make payments alone does not establish lack of good faith. Section 523(a)(8) was enacted to prevent immediate bankruptcy filings post-graduation.\" When evaluating a debtor's good faith in seeking to discharge a student loan, courts consider the time since the loan became due and the percentage of the loan debt compared to total indebtedness. High student loan debt relative to total debt may indicate a lack of good faith effort to repay the loan. Some courts caution against placing too much emphasis on this ratio. Some courts caution against emphasizing the percentage of student loan debt when evaluating a debtor's good faith in seeking discharge. Courts may consider if the debtor has maximized income by pursuing full-time employment opportunities. If capable of full-time work but only working part-time without justification, a court may deny an undue hardship discharge. Working a full-time job typically exempts the debtor from needing additional part-time employment for discharge eligibility. Courts generally do not require debtors to secure additional part-time employment to qualify for an undue hardship discharge, even if increased child care costs from having children may hinder repayment of student loans. The Brunner test is commonly used to assess undue hardship, but some circuits have not adopted this standard. The Eighth Circuit has rejected the Brunner standard for assessing undue hardship in student loan discharge cases. Instead, they use the \"totality-of-the-circumstances test\" or the \"Andrews standard,\" which considers the debtor's financial resources, necessary living expenses, and other relevant factors. This approach allows for a broader evaluation of facts and circumstances to determine undue hardship. The Eighth Circuit uses the \"totality-of-the-circumstances test\" to assess undue hardship in student loan discharge cases, considering factors like the debtor's financial resources, living expenses, and other relevant details. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation, including factors such as incapacity to pay debts, good faith efforts to negotiate payment deferment, long-term hardship, disability, employment prospects, income maximization, and the purpose of the bankruptcy petition. The court is not required to address each factor in every case. The Eighth Circuit uses the \"totality-of-the-circumstances test\" to assess undue hardship in student loan discharge cases, considering factors like the debtor's financial resources, living expenses, and other relevant details. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation, including incapacity to pay debts, good faith efforts to negotiate payment deferment, long-term hardship, disability, employment prospects, income maximization, and the purpose of the bankruptcy petition. The court is not required to address each factor in every case. In the First Circuit, bankruptcy courts use a totality-of-the-circumstances approach to determine undue hardship in student loan discharge cases. Factors considered include the debtor's income, expenses, health, age, education, dependents, monthly payment amount, impact of discharge, and job prospects. This approach ensures a fair balance between extreme abuse cases and the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code. The Brunner test in student loan discharge cases requires debtors to demonstrate good faith efforts to repay their loans, making it more restrictive than the totality-of-the-circumstances approach used in bankruptcy courts. Failure to satisfy any one of the three prongs of the Brunner test results in the inability to obtain a discharge. The Brunner test is considered more restrictive than the totality-of-the-circumstances standard in student loan discharge cases. Supporters argue that the totality-of-the-circumstances test gives judges too much discretion, while opponents believe it aligns better with the Bankruptcy Code. Courts and commentators debate the practical differences between the two tests, with some noting modest distinctions and overlapping criteria. Some statistical evidence suggests student loan debtors fare similarly in Brunner and totality-of-the-circumstances jurisdictions. However, there are occasional outcome-determinative differences between the two tests. Litigants are debating whether the Supreme Court should decide which test should govern undue hardship determinations under Section 523. The debate between the Brunner and 'totality of the circumstances' tests for student loan discharge creates inconsistency in outcomes across different courts. Opponents argue that despite verbal differences, both tests use similar information and lead to similar results. The Supreme Court has not yet resolved this dispute. Additionally, courts disagree on various issues related to undue hardship cases. Courts are divided on whether a bankruptcy court can partially discharge a student loan or if it must discharge all or none of it, citing lack of statutory language for partial discharge. This issue is relevant in both Brunner and totality-of-the-circumstances jurisdictions. Some courts allow partial discharge of student loans based on ability to repay, while others follow an \"all-or-nothing approach.\" Most jurisdictions requiring satisfaction of undue hardship standard for partial discharge. Some courts allow partial discharge of student loans based on ability to repay, while others follow an \"all-or-nothing approach.\" Courts may apply \u00a7 523(a)(8) on a loan-by-loan basis, allowing some student loans to be discharged while others remain nondischargeable. This approach is said to align with the statutory language of \u00a7 523(a)(8) despite not explicitly authorizing partial discharges. Some courts allow partial discharge of student loans based on ability to repay, aligning with the statutory language of \u00a7 523(a)(8) despite not explicitly authorizing partial discharges. Eligibility for debt relief programs and utilization of income-driven repayment plans may influence loan discharge decisions. The outstanding balance of a borrower's loans can be forgiven if monthly payments are made over a set repayment period, relieving the debtor of further responsibility. Participation in an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan can impact eligibility for student loan discharge based on undue hardship. Courts have considered IDR plan participation when determining discharge eligibility, with some denying discharge if the debtor could have utilized an IDR plan but chose not to. Participation in an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan may lead to adverse tax consequences for debtors, as forgiveness of unpaid debt under the plan could result in a taxable event. Some debtors may end up exchanging a nondischargeable student loan debt for a nondischargeable tax debt, providing little relief. Negative amortization of debt over time and tax implications after debt cancellation make IDR plans unsuitable for some debtors. Participation in an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan may result in significant tax consequences for debtors, especially for those near retirement age. Debtors with little time left to pay down their debt may face a large tax bill at the end of the repayment period, leading to potential financial harm. Participating in an IDR plan may not prevent a debtor from obtaining an undue hardship discharge, as canceled debt may not always result in a taxable event due to exceptions in the Internal Revenue Code. Some courts argue that considering potential tax liability at the end of the repayment period is speculative, especially since the repayment period can extend for decades. Participating in an IDR plan may not prevent a debtor from obtaining an undue hardship discharge, as canceled debt may not always result in a taxable event. Courts vary in their views on whether a debtor's failure to participate in an IDR plan affects eligibility for discharge, especially if monthly payments would be zero. Some courts have held that excluding student loans from discharge is permissible. Some courts believe that a $0.00 monthly payment under an IDR plan does not prevent a debtor from receiving a discharge for student loans. However, others argue that even with no payments, a student loan may still impose an undue hardship due to potential tax consequences and long-term financial burden. The U.S. Department of Education regulations allow debtors to discharge certain student loans outside of bankruptcy in cases of disability or school closure. Pursuing administrative discharge is not always required for an undue hardship discharge in bankruptcy, but failure to explore available options may impact good faith under the Brunner test. Lenders may require a non-student co-signer for credit assurance. Courts have debated whether a nonstudent debtor who cosigns a student loan must meet the undue hardship standard to discharge the debt in bankruptcy. Most courts require a showing of undue hardship for nonstudent debtors to discharge student loans they are obligated for. Most courts require nonstudent debtors, like parents who cosign student loans, to meet the undue hardship standard to discharge the debt in bankruptcy. The statutory language draws no distinction between student and nonstudent obligors, with the rationale being that limiting discharge helps preserve the financial integrity of the student loan program. Some courts allow parents who co-sign student loans to discharge the debt in bankruptcy without proving undue hardship. They argue that the purpose of the law is to protect student loans, not loans taken on by parents who are in a different financial situation. Parents have other debts and are less likely to abuse the system compared to students. This doctrinal split may not have a significant impact in practice. Some believe that bankruptcy judges should have the freedom to determine hardship without strict definitions, leading to varying court decisions on student loan discharge. Studies suggest that those truly in need can obtain discharge under current laws. Congress may choose to maintain the status quo or consider changes to the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy. Congress has options to modify the legal framework for discharging student loans in bankruptcy, including codifying a definition of \"undue hardship\" in the Bankruptcy Code to provide more guidance to courts. Currently, the lack of interpretive guidance has led to inconsistent application of the \"undue hardship\" standard. The lack of interpretive guidance has led to inconsistent application of the \"undue hardship\" standard in bankruptcy cases, where judges define the standard differently and impose varying tests on debtors. Advocates suggest codifying a definition in the Bankruptcy Code to specify legal standards for determining discharge of student loans. The lack of interpretive guidance has led to inconsistent application of the \"undue hardship\" standard in bankruptcy cases. Advocates suggest codifying a definition in the Bankruptcy Code to specify legal standards for determining discharge of student loans, resolving doctrinal splits in federal courts. The debate over defining \"undue hardship\" in bankruptcy cases involving student loans continues, with some advocating for a textual definition in the Bankruptcy Code to ensure consistency in court rulings. Critics question whether such guidance would prevent disparities in interpretation given the unique circumstances of each debtor. Some argue for a clear definition of \"undue hardship\" in bankruptcy cases involving student loans to ensure consistency in court rulings, while others believe that defining it rigidly may limit judges' discretion to assess each case individually. Legislation and public input are being considered to potentially alter the interpretation of \"undue hardship\" under Section 523(a)(8). Some argue for a clear definition of \"undue hardship\" in bankruptcy cases involving student loans to ensure consistency in court rulings. The existence of two tests for evaluation of undue hardship claims may result in inequities among borrowers seeking discharge. Congress could consider making the standard for discharging a student loan less demanding. Congress could potentially make the standard for discharging student loans more lenient by eliminating certain requirements, such as the need to prove future inability to repay or demonstrate \"certainty of hopelessness.\" Additionally, there is a suggestion to reevaluate the Brunner test, which was established in 1987, in light of changes in legislation, economics, and regulations over the past thirty years. Since 1987, developments in loan repayment and forgiveness programs, including IDR plans, have occurred. Changes such as Congress's elimination of the temporal discharge option and the 2005 amendment to the Bankruptcy Code have made private education loans presumptively nondischargeable. There has been a significant increase in student loan debt and borrowing limits, leading to calls for updating the undue hardship standard in bankruptcy law. Several Members of the 115th Congress have introduced bills to repeal Section 523(a)(8) and make student loans freely dischargeable in bankruptcy. Congress could also consider making private education loans dischargeable while keeping federal student loans unaffected. In 2005, Congress amended Section 523(a)(8) to make private education loans presumptively nondischargeable like federal loans. Some Members of Congress have introduced bills to revert to the pre-2005 version, making private nonfederal student loans presumptively dischargeable without proving undue hardship. In 1998, Congress eliminated the option for debtors to discharge student loans based on the number of years since the loan became due. Currently, the only way to discharge a student loan in bankruptcy is by proving undue hardship. Some suggest reinstating the temporal discharge option to allow older student loans to be discharged without proving undue hardship. Undue hardship litigation for discharging student loan debt can be costly and complex, requiring debtors to prove they are unable to pay due to medical conditions. Some suggest shifting the burden of proof from debtors to creditors or treating student loan debt as presumptively dischargeable in bankruptcy. The proposed amendment aims to shift the burden of proof in student loan debt dischargeability cases from debtors to creditors. This change would make it easier for debtors to have their student loans discharged in bankruptcy. Additionally, there is a suggestion to provide for the payment of a debtor's attorney's fees if a creditor unsuccessfully challenges dischargeability without substantial justification, making legal representation more accessible to debtors. The proposed reforms aim to make legal representation more accessible to debtors in dischargeability actions by shifting the fee burden onto lenders and protecting debtors from aggressive litigation tactics. Legislation has been introduced to implement these changes, including fee-shifting provisions for debtors who receive an undue hardship discharge. The proposed reforms aim to make legal representation more accessible to debtors in dischargeability actions by shifting the fee burden onto lenders. The federal government, holding the majority of student loan debt, would be the main creditor potentially subject to penalties under this bill."
