    "content": "The \"Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2004\" is also known as the Three-Share Programs under the Social Security Act. This program aims to provide for the uninsured. The Secretary will award grants for 50 three-share pilot programs for a 5-year period. Grants will be given to establish three-share programs, contribute to premiums, and establish risk pools. Entities must develop a plan meeting specific requirements to qualify for a grant. Entities seeking grants for three-share pilot programs must submit an application to the Administrator, including a three-share program plan and assurances of various responsibilities such as determining benefit packages, recruiting businesses and employees, managing health providers, and handling administrative needs. The Secretary gives priority to existing or eligible three-share programs with community support or in states allowing program expansion. The Secretary will establish eligibility regulations for three-share programs to participate in the pilot program. To be eligible for the pilot program, a three-share program must be a non-profit or local governmental entity, define its service region, and have the capacity to manage health plans and administrative functions. The three-share program must cover costs by charging a monthly premium, with a portion paid by the employee and employer. The three-share program requires the qualified employer to pay a premium for the qualified employee, with at least 40 percent covered by a grant and the remaining amount from other sources. The program can set income eligibility guidelines and must provide physician services to be eligible. The three-share program covers various medical services including physician services, in-patient and out-patient hospital services, emergency room visits, ambulance services, lab fees, x-rays, and prescription drugs. Coverage is limited to services within a specified region and preexisting conditions cannot be used to exclude individuals from coverage. The Administrator may award grants to existing three-share programs to meet certification requirements. Eligible entities must submit an application containing required information. State laws are not preempted by this section. The Administrator will develop a distressed business formula within 60 days of enactment. The Health Resources and Services Administration will create a formula to determine distressed businesses for eligibility. Granting eligibility using this formula will not impact the insurance market. Businesses reducing benefits to qualify as distressed will not be eligible for the three-share program. Definitions include the Administrator and covered individuals as qualified employees. The term 'distressed business' refers to a business facing economic hardship. A 'qualified employee' or their spouse/child lacking access to healthcare coverage and not eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP are considered eligible for benefits. A distressed business may have to reduce health care coverage due to economic hardship. An eligible entity is one that meets specific requirements. A qualified employee is someone without access to health coverage through family or government programs like Medicare or Medicaid. A qualified employer under title XIX must agree to pay fees through payroll deductions. They must be a small business in a specific region and either not provided health benefits for 12 months or be classified as a distressed business. The General Accounting Office will evaluate the effectiveness of programs established under this section for distressed businesses. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2005 through 2010."
