    "content": "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government-sponsored enterprises that purchase mortgages and create mortgage-backed securities. They have special ties to the federal government and aim to promote homeownership. In 2008, their financial condition weakened, leading to the Federal Housing Finance Agency taking control in conservatorship. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 gave FHFA the power to control Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, allowing them to take actions to stabilize the entities and preserve their assets. Conflicts may arise between the need to comply with regulations and addressing fundamental problems, potentially prolonging the conservatorship. Congressional interest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has grown due to doubts about their future under federal conservatorship. Concerns include the GSEs' role in the mortgage market and Treasury's purchase of preferred stock. Bills have been introduced for reform, reflecting oversight hearings and potential conflicts in ending conservatorship. Since entering conservatorship in September 2008, Fannie Mae reported a cumulative loss of $1.7 billion, while Freddie Mac reported a cumulative profit of $9.0 billion. Both GSEs have been profitable since 2012, with Fannie Mae showing an $11 billion profit in 2015 and Freddie Mac showing a $6 billion profit. Prior to 2006, both GSEs had been consistently profitable, with Fannie Mae not reporting a full-year loss since 1985 and Freddie Mac never reporting a full-year loss since going public in 1989. In 2013, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were extremely profitable, with profits of nearly $84 billion and $49 billion, respectively. Factors contributing to these profits included the reversal of loss reserves and increased value of deferred tax assets. In 2013, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported profits of $84 billion and $49 billion, respectively. Factors contributing to these profits included negotiated agreements with certain companies, mortgage repurchase requests, and loss reserves. Without these factors, Fannie Mae would have reported a profit of $6.0 billion, and Freddie Mac would have reported a profit of $5.2 billion. Freddie Mac reported a loss of $475 million in the third quarter of 2015 due to derivatives used for hedging interest rate risk. Despite the loss, Freddie Mac did not require additional financial support from Treasury. This was the first quarterly loss for Freddie Mac since 2011. In the first quarter of 2016, Freddie Mac reported a net loss of $354 million, mainly from losses in derivatives. Fannie Mae did not report any quarterly losses in 2015 or 2016. To expedite reducing assets, Treasury, FHFA, and the GSEs amended support contracts in 2012 so that each GSE pays Treasury all profits earned each quarter. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) gives the FHFA authority to set housing goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae had paid $148 billion in dividends, and Freddie Mac had paid $98 billion in dividends by the end of 2015. Under the dividend profit sweep, Fannie Mae has paid $148 billion and Freddie Mac has paid $98 billion in dividends to Treasury. If the profit sweep had not replaced paying dividends to Treasury at a 10% annual rate, Fannie Mae would have paid $69 billion and Freddie Mac would have paid $47 billion to Treasury in dividends. The goals of affordable housing require GSEs to purchase specified mortgages to meet single-family and multifamily goals. Single-family benchmarks are based on the number of mortgages purchased. GSEs can meet goals by meeting benchmark percentages or by exceeding market data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The FHFA sets single-family and multifamily housing goals for GSEs based on mortgage purchases. Fannie Mae usually purchases more mortgages than Freddie Mac. FHFA also sets multifamily housing goals based on affordable rental units. HERA requires GSEs to serve underserved markets like manufactured housing, affordable housing preservation, and rural housing. GSEs must submit drafts of an Underserved Markets Plan and contribute to the HOPE Reserve Fund and Housing Trust Fund. HERA mandates GSEs to contribute to the HOPE Reserve Fund, Housing Trust Fund, and Capital Magnet Fund. These funds support various housing programs for low-income families. FHFA reinstated contributions in 2015, requiring each GSE to set aside 4.2 basis points of mortgage purchases annually. In 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed funds to the HOPE Reserve Fund, Housing Trust Fund, and Capital Magnet Fund. Executive compensation at the GSEs decreased after entering conservatorship. The senior management at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was replaced, and the new managers received reduced compensation. HERA strengthened FHFA's oversight on executive compensation. The GSEs need approval for new compensation agreements with executives. The Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2015 limited raises for CEOs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac face various risks like other companies. They purchase home mortgages, package them into MBSs, and sell them to institutional investors. The GSEs finance long-term mortgages with short-term borrowing to increase profits. The GSEs finance long-term mortgages with short-term borrowing (three months to five years), increasing profits but also creating interest rate risk. Derivative contracts and longer-term borrowing are used to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates, but can result in losses if interest rates decline. For example, Freddie Mac experienced losses in 2015 and 2016 due to hedging strategies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must limit their mortgage portfolios to $250 billion each by 2018 under Treasury support agreements. The GSEs face credit risk but have seen improvements in mortgage foreclosure rates and losses. Losses post-2008 housing bust were from subprime and Alt-A loans. Fannie Mae reduced holdings of private-label MBSs backed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages by the end of 2015. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reduced their holdings of private-label MBSs backed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages. They have tightened lending standards, with higher average FICO scores for mortgages purchased. The GSEs increased loan loss reserves after entering conservatorship, anticipating continuing losses. The GSEs have reduced their loss reserves as foreclosure rates and average losses on foreclosures have decreased. They agreed to reduce capital reserves with Treasury from $3 billion in 2013 to zero in 2018, shifting some risk to Treasury. FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to share credit risk with the private sector to reduce government and taxpayer risk. Mortgage losses are categorized as expected, unexpected, and catastrophic. During stressful economic times, losses can occur, including catastrophic losses under extreme circumstances. To reduce credit risk, GSEs pay private investors to cover some losses. However, sharing catastrophic losses was found to be costly. GSEs issue bonds like CAS and STACRs, where investors are paid based on mortgage pool performance. If the pool performs poorly, investors receive lower returns. In response to poor pool performance, investors may receive lower returns or risk losing their investments. GSEs have shifted towards traditional insurance agreements to mitigate losses, reducing their portfolios to $250 billion each by 2018. Operational risks are being addressed by improving IT systems and internal controls, while model risk remains a concern for these financial corporations. The GSEs face model risk, especially with credit models, and are directed by FHFA to update their financial models. If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac incur quarterly losses exceeding reserves, they can sell preferred stock to Treasury to remain solvent. Treasury has remaining support of $117.6 billion for Fannie Mae and $140.5 billion for Freddie Mac. If all Treasury support is drawn, receivership could lead to dissolution, with MBSs having a senior claim. If a GSE were to go into receivership, the value of MBSs would depend on underlying mortgages, receivership rules, and government support. The value of MBSs could decline if the guarantee is questioned, but could increase with government backing. Bond value would be influenced by receivership cause. If a GSE were to go into receivership, the value of MBSs would depend on underlying mortgages, receivership rules, and government support. The eventual value of the bonds would be influenced by the cause of the receivership and the details of the liquidation process. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac created Common Securitization Solutions (CSS) to standardize the process of issuing and managing MBSs. FHFA determined that modernizing the GSEs' computer operations and creating one system for both enterprises would be more efficient. Technical differences between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's MBSs could result in differences in selling prices. The common securitization platform (CSP) aims to standardize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's MBSs. CSP will have two releases, with Release 1 for Freddie Mac in 2016 and Release 2 for both entities in 2018. Common stockholders own 100% of the GSEs, but their powers are transferred while the company is in conservatorship. The long-term goal is a common MBS. The boards of directors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were elected and certain actions were approved, transferring control to the conservator, FHFA. Treasury holds long-term options to purchase 80% of each GSE. New agreements with Treasury changed the quarterly dividend to be all profits earned, aiming to wind down the GSEs and benefit taxpayers. Stockholders are unable to regain control due to the inability to retain earnings. Stockholders are suing the federal government over the new agreement that prevents Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from returning to stockholder control. If the GSEs become financially viable, they could exit conservatorship, but this is unlikely due to the profit sweep in place. Treasury and FHFA would need to approve their exit. Treasury is prohibited from disposing of its senior preferred stock in the GSEs without enabling legislation before January 1, 2018. The federal government's agreement prevents Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from returning to stockholder control. If the GSEs become financially viable, they could exit conservatorship, but this is unlikely due to the profit sweep in place. Congress must approve any major change to the GSEs' status, and Treasury holds warrants to purchase 79.9% of each at a nominal cost. If the GSEs are unable to become financially viable, they could enter receivership, raising questions about the desirability of a monopoly GSE. It seems impossible for the GSEs to return to stockholder control without congressional or executive action. The GSEs must reduce their capital reserves annually until they reach zero in 2018, making them financially nonviable without reserves for large expenses like foreclosures. The profit sweep prevents them from accumulating capital, hindering their ability to meet capital requirements and potentially leading to receivership. At the end of 2014, Fannie Mae had a $142 billion deficit in minimum capital, and Freddie Mac had a $92 billion deficit. In 2007, Fannie Mae needed $25 billion and Freddie Mac needed $14 billion in risk-based capital. Shareholder lawsuits are seeking to reverse FHFA's actions as conservator. Congress has options for reorganizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including taking no action, repealing charters, or making them part of the government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could become part of the government or an agency like the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Congress may repeal their charters and establish new entities to take over their role in the mortgage market. Prior to the modern secondary mortgage market, mortgage markets were local with varying rates and lending activity. The secondary mortgage market was created to address credit shortages during economic downturns by combining regional mortgage markets into a single national market. This allowed for financing to be drawn from around the world, breaking down geographic barriers that prevented the law of supply and demand from operating on a national level in the home loan market. The National Housing Act of 1934 established national mortgage associations, leading to the creation of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). Originally a government agency, Fannie Mae was re-chartered in 1954 as a mixed government and private-sector entity. In 1968, Congress split Fannie Mae into two organizations, with the secondary market arm retaining the Fannie Mae name. In 1970, Fannie Mae completed its transition to become privately owned with no federal funding. The Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970 allowed Fannie Mae to buy conventional mortgages, mostly from mortgage bankers. To facilitate secondary market trading, the act created Freddie Mac as a subsidiary of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. In 1989, Congress re-chartered Freddie Mac to trade on the NYSE like Fannie Mae. The 1989 act merged the missions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, making them similar. Both entities purchase mortgages from lenders that meet their standards and do not exceed the conforming loan limit. These mortgages are pooled into MBSs, guaranteed by the GSE, and sold to investors or kept as investments. Conservatorship involves FHFA taking control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, transferring powers to FHFA. Since 2008, FHFA has not canceled certain contracts, as authorized by HERA. The goal of conservatorship is to preserve GSE assets and return them to financial health. FHFA has requested $116.1 billion for Fannie Mae and $71.3 billion for Freddie Mac from Treasury. Both GSEs have not needed Treasury support since 2012. Treasury support involves purchasing senior preferred stock, which is the only stock currently receiving dividends. Since 2008, FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship due to their financial deterioration. FHFA cited the critical importance of both companies to the residential financial markets. Congress had previously assisted GSEs facing financial difficulties. Subsequent audits revealed weaker financial positions than initially thought, leading to the need for conservatorship. In 2008, Congress assisted GSEs like Fannie Mae and the Farm Credit System during financial difficulties. The Treasury was authorized to purchase GSE securities to stabilize financial markets and prevent disruptions in mortgage credit availability. This authority expired in 2009. The federal government took various actions to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the financial crisis of 2008. This included interventions to prevent share price manipulation and granting authority to lend directly to the GSEs. The New York Fed was granted authority to lend directly to the GSEs during the financial crisis of 2008. The Fed conducted special programs to purchase over $1 trillion of GSE debt and MBSs in 2009 and 2010, aiming to increase liquidity and stabilize financial markets. The Fed purchased over $1 trillion in MBSs to increase liquidity and stabilize financial markets during the 2008 financial crisis. By March 2016, the Fed held $1.4 trillion of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's MBSs."
