    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Citizens' Protection in Federal Databases Act.\" It includes findings related to the protection of citizens' information. Congress finds that Federal agencies access large databases containing personal information of US citizens, posing privacy risks when data is aggregated and accessed by numerous personnel. The Federal Government lacks clear standards and accountability when accessing personal information from public and private databases, posing privacy risks for individuals. There is a need for clear guidelines and accountability measures to ensure civil liberties are protected. The Federal Government should only access personal information on US persons with a connection to suspected counterintelligence, terrorist, or illegal activity. Limitation on funds for procurement or access of commercial databases pending report on use of information. Limitation on funds for procurement or access of commercial databases by specified government departments and agencies unless a report is submitted to Congress within 60 days of the enactment of the Act. The Bureau of Investigation and other government agencies must report to Congress and the public on their use of databases obtained from non-Federal entities or other government departments for purposes other than national security, intelligence, or law enforcement. This report must include a list of all contracts and agreements related to database usage. The report to Congress and the public must include details on contracts related to the use of databases obtained from non-Federal entities or other government departments, including duration, dollar amount, types of data, purposes, extent of use, and retention of information. The report must include details on the retention of information by the department or agency, methodologies used to search databases, efficacy in identifying criminals or terrorists, and plans for database use. The report must include a discussion of personnel activities at the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and policies for accessing and using databases, including personnel access standards and minimum necessary information requirements. The report must discuss standards for accessing and using databases, including data retention, accuracy, security measures, redress mechanisms, and enforcement. The report must outline enforcement mechanisms for accountability to protect individuals and the public against unlawful access or use of databases. SEC. 4 prohibits conducting searches in federal databases based solely on hypothetical scenarios for national security, intelligence, or law enforcement purposes. This limitation does not endorse any other activities involving database use. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The term \"database\" includes personally identifiable information about individuals but excludes publicly available information on the Internet without a fee. The term \"United States person\" is defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978."
