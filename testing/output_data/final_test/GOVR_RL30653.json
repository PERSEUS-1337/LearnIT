These laws focus on individuals with disabilities as current or potential workers. Public policy evaluation is crucial due to the increasing incidence of disabling health conditions with age, potentially leading to higher costs for society. The report discusses federal actions related to the employment of people with disabilities in the 20th century, data sources covering disability and employment status, and the activities of the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities. It also examines trend statistics on the employment situation of working-age adults with disabilities and mentions relevant policies. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933-1935 addressed employment disadvantages of disabled individuals through a productivity-based sub-minimum wage system. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 established reduced wages for individuals with disabilities in certain employment situations. Section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) established reduced wages for individuals with disabilities, based on earning capacity. The wage floor for disabled workers in private for-profit firms was set at 75% of the federal minimum wage. In 1966, amendments set the wage rate for disabled persons at 50% of the FLSA minimum. In 1986, section 14(c) was amended to remove distinctions between workshops and work activity centers and eliminate the statutory minimum wage. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA, P.L. 101-336) prohibits discrimination in the workplace and other areas based on disability. It requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified workers with disabilities. The Act aims to ensure equal access to employment opportunities and bans discrimination by employers with at least 25 employees. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits workplace discrimination based on disability. It requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide accommodations for qualified workers with disabilities. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 allows for compensatory and punitive damages in discrimination suits. The Fair Labor Standards Act creates a lower wage rate for disabled individuals to make them more attractive to hire. The success of employment provisions is measured by the increase in employment rate for working-age adults with disabilities. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 aims to increase job opportunities for adults with disabilities by addressing barriers such as the dilemma faced by Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries. Legislation, along with other factors like economic conditions and job requirements, plays a role in improving employment prospects for this protected class. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 addresses barriers for SSDI and SSI beneficiaries, offering a choice between job with no health benefits or government-provided coverage. It also includes a voucher program for employment services. Initiatives like Executive Order 13078 focus on improving labor market outcomes for individuals with disabilities. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Labor requested applications for work incentive grants to assist states in providing employment and training services to people with disabilities. The Office on Disability Policy was established the following year within the DOL to enhance the employment prospects of persons with disabilities. The National Council on Disability highlighted the challenges in accurately measuring the employment prospects of individuals with disabilities due to varying definitions and lack of consistent data. Despite discussions and recommendations, little improvement has been made in addressing the data shortcomings related to the labor force status of persons with disabilities. The Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities was tasked with measuring the employment rate of adults with disabilities using a reliable method. Various organizations, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau, have been working towards this goal. Challenges include the lack of a universally agreed-upon definition of disability and data sources. The U.S. lacks a universally agreed-upon definition of disability and a reliable data source that combines labor force and disability questions. Various surveys collect self-reported disability information, but disability is not the main focus. Disability questions have varied over time, with the 1970 census asking about work disability and the 1980 census including questions on work disability. The 1970, 1980, and 1990 census forms included questions about work disability, ability to use public transportation, and self-care. The 2000 long-form revised disability questions based on expert judgment and testing, focusing on physical, mental, or emotional conditions affecting work, daily activities, and self-care. The Census Bureau replaced the long-form decennial census with the more frequently administered ACS, which revised disability questions to reduce over-reporting. The 2003 ACS questionnaire addressed issues from the 2000 census and earlier surveys to improve accuracy. The Census Bureau is conducting a national content test in 2006 to determine if new disability questions will be added to the 2008 ACS. Currently, neither the decennial census nor the ACS can provide data for analyzing changes in the employment status of persons with disabilities over time. The CPS enables the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide timely information on the labor force status and characteristics of the population. Respondents to the CPS sometimes report being disabled instead of answering about their work status. The Current Population Survey (CPS) includes supplementary questions about income and disability status. Respondents are asked if a health problem or disability limits their work, with follow-up questions on income sources. Researchers use this data to analyze employment rates for persons with work limitations. The Current Population Survey (CPS) includes supplementary questions about income and disability status, with a focus on employment rates for persons with disabilities. However, the survey questions were not specifically designed for this purpose, leading to concerns about the validity and reliability of the data. Despite limitations, some analysts argue that nationally representative employment-focused data sets like the CPS can still be used to monitor trends in the employment outcomes of the working-age population with disabilities. The SIPP and National Health Interview Survey use different approaches to define disability, focusing on limitations in functioning or activities. Some believe a functional limitations-based definition is superior. Both approaches rely on the medical model of disability, which may not consider environmental factors impacting survey responses. Respondents to the SIPP are considered to have a disability if they have difficulty with sensory or physical functions, ADLs, IADLs, or work limitations due to health conditions. This includes using assistive devices, specific conditions, or being under 65 and covered by certain benefit programs. The SIPP disability questions have been pre-tested for validity, but concerns remain about their face validity due to environmental factors influencing responses. To address this, a question was added to identify conditions that make finding or keeping a job difficult. The disability module in SIPP has been consistent since 1990, with recent additions to better capture disability meaning. The Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities noted significant fluctuations in disability reporting. The SIPP survey on Adults with Disabilities showed significant fluctuations in disability status within a year, indicating unreliable estimates. Attrition and time-in-sample bias affect the survey's quality over time. Changes in the work disability question administration led to noncomparable estimates. Analysts disagree on the survey's ability to measure employment status accurately. The National Center for Health Statistics' annual survey provides information on chronic health conditions, health status, health care utilization, and disability. A two-part disability supplement funded by federal agencies and a private foundation was conducted along with the 1994 and 1995 NHIS, containing a variety of definitions for disability. The supplement's questionnaire was reviewed by the disability community and pretested by households. The annual NHIS, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, includes consistent disability and labor force questions from 1982 to 1996. Results are available for analysis by the research community. Prior to 1997, individuals were considered to have disabilities if they reported a chronic condition or impairment limiting their ability to perform major life activities. The NHIS conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics includes disability and labor force questions. Prior to 1997, individuals were considered to have disabilities if they reported a chronic condition or impairment limiting their ability to perform major life activities. Respondents aged 18-69 with work limitations were identified based on impairments affecting their ability to work. The NHIS also asked about the need for assistance in performing activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Starting in 1997, changes were made to the questionnaire to determine work limitations related to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The NHIS includes disability and labor force questions, with changes made in 1997 to determine work limitations related to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The ACS was developed to provide more timely results compared to the population census, NHIS, and SIPP. Results from the March CPS supplement are released about six months after it is conducted. The labor force data from the monthly CPS are published the month after it is conducted. Samples in different surveys have varying age requirements and population coverage. SIPP includes civilian and military residents, while NHIS and CPS cover civilian noninstitutional population. Surveys have different reference periods that can impact labor force status. The SIPP, NHIS, and CPS surveys have different reference periods for determining labor force activity. The CPS is more precise in defining employment and unemployment status compared to SIPP and NHIS. The quality of survey estimates on labor force activity can be impacted by various factors, with the definition of work disability being a key issue. Disability is a complex concept influenced by individual attributes, the environment, and barriers to participation. Measurement of disability is challenging due to the changing nature of characteristics over time. The Presidential Task Force established the Employment Rate Measurement. The Presidential Task Force established the Employment Rate Measurement Methodology Work Group (ERMM) to develop timely, accurate labor force data for persons with disabilities. The ERMM aims to incorporate disability questions in the CPS to release labor force estimates for people with disabilities. Questions on disability and labor force status were tested in the National Comorbidity Survey in 2001 and 2002 to minimize respondent burden in the CPS. The ERMM selected seven disability questions after analysis by experts and further testing. Concerns raised were addressed through additional testing, with the final test in the February 2006 CPS supplement. If the questions perform well without affecting response rates, they may be added to the monthly CPS in 2007. Researchers have used multiple surveys to address data limitations on persons with disabilities and labor force status. The proportion of the population with disabilities in the labor force decreased during the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, while the participation rate of those without disabilities declined to a lesser extent. Conversely, during the economic expansion from 1983-1990, individuals with disabilities showed increased labor force activity. During an economic expansion, labor force activity of individuals with disabilities increased more than those without disabilities. This suggests that persons with disabilities are more affected by economic cycles. However, this relationship did not hold during the strong economic expansion after the 1990-1991 recession. The 1990s were a favorable time for working-age people with disabilities due to legislation, assistive technologies, and a tight labor market. Despite favorable economic conditions in the 1990s, the employment rate for adults with disabilities did not significantly change through 1996, according to data from the NHIS and CPS. This was unexpected given the tight labor market and potential opportunities for firms to hire and train individuals with disabilities. The employment rate for adults with disabilities did not improve from the mid-1990s through the remainder of the decade, despite favorable economic conditions. Data from NHIS and CPS show a worsening employment situation for individuals with disabilities compared to those without disabilities during the economic expansion of the 1990s. Unemployment decreased significantly for labor force participants according to NHIS and CPS data. The decrease in unemployment was more significant for persons with disabilities compared to those without disabilities. This is because the unemployment rate is based on a specific group actively seeking jobs, while the employment rate includes individuals uninterested or unable to work. An alternative employment rate for people with disabilities willing and able to work showed significant increases during the 1990s expansion, narrowing the employment gap between those with and without disabilities. The labor market performance of the population with disabilities during the 1990s expansion saw a shift towards more individuals reporting inability to work, supported by increased prevalence of poor health and functional limitations. This self-reporting may reflect a real worsening in work limitations among persons with disabilities. The 106th Congress passed the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 to increase work activity among adults with severe disabilities. Policy analysts have explored reasons for the poor labor market performance of this population. The poor labor market performance of the population with disabilities in the 1990s was attributed to factors such as expansion of disability programs, unintended consequences of the ADA, increased healthcare costs, and changes in the population's makeup. Suggestions for improving employment outcomes include subsidizing employer accommodations and assisting employed individuals with disabilities in retaining their jobs."
