    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Official Personnel File Enhancement Act\" and includes a provision for recording investigations of personnel actions in separated employees' official personnel files. The \"Official Personnel File Enhancement Act\" requires agencies to make a permanent notation in an employee's official personnel record file if they resign during a personnel investigation with an adverse finding. This notation must be made within 40 days of the investigation's resolution. The Act mandates agencies to notify employees of adverse findings, allow them to respond with evidence, and provide a written decision promptly. Employees can appeal the decision to make a permanent notation in their file. The agency must make a notation in an employee's file if an appeal is filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board. The agency head must remove the notation if they prevail on appeal, and if the employee prevails, the notation must also be removed. The agency head is required to remove any notations of adverse findings from an employee's official record file. This applies to personnel investigations conducted by an Inspector General or adverse personnel actions related to performance or misconduct. The amendment also applies to employees leaving the service after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. REVIEW OF OFFICIAL PERSONNEL FILE OF FORMER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES BEFORE REHIRING. Sec. 3330e requires appointing authorities to review former federal employees' official personnel files before rehiring them in the competitive or excepted service. The term 'former Government employee' refers to individuals whose last government position before reapplying was in these services. The Office of Personnel Management will provide guidelines for this process. The Office of Personnel Management will prescribe regulations for former Government employees appointed or reinstated after 180 days from the enactment of this Act. A clerical amendment will be made to the table of sections of title 5, United States Code. The House of Representatives passed a bill regarding the review of official personnel files of former Federal employees before rehiring on April 26, 2016."
