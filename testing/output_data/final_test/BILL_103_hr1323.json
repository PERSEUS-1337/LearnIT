    "content": "The \"National Economic Conversion and Environmental Restoration Act of 1993\" authorizes the Secretary of Labor to provide demonstration grants to institutions of higher education for training in environmental restoration for dislocated defense workers and young adults. Grants may extend for up to 3 fiscal years, subject to annual approval and availability of appropriations. The Secretary may provide a grant to an institution of higher education if the institution submits an application with required information. The application must assure that Federal funds will supplement, not replace, non-Federal funds for activities funded under the grant. An institution of higher education can use grant funds to establish a consortium with various entities to create a program for education and training in environmental restoration for eligible individuals. The entities involved include representatives of State and local agencies, private industry councils, community-based organizations, and businesses. Eligible individuals for education and training in environmental restoration include dislocated defense workers affected by defense expenditure reductions or military facility closures, and young adults aged 16 to 25. The consortium established under subsection (a)(1) must provide education and training in environmental restoration, including work-based learning, basic educational courses, on-site skills training, and mentor assistance to eligible individuals. This may lead to a certificate of completion or advanced degree at an institution of higher education. The consortium established under subsection (a)(1) provides education and training in environmental restoration, including work-based learning, basic educational courses, on-site skills training, and mentor assistance to eligible individuals. The consortium utilizes closed military installations for basic skills training and conducts outreach and recruitment efforts to encourage participation in the program. Eligible individuals are selected for the program based on specific criteria outlined in subsection (b). The consortium established under subsection (a)(1) provides education and training in environmental restoration, giving priority to young adults who have not attended or do not plan to attend a postsecondary educational institution, or have a family income below the official poverty line. The consortium provides education and training in environmental restoration, prioritizing young adults with low income or no plans for postsecondary education. Instructors are selected from higher education institutions, community programs, and industry. Job placement services are offered to eligible individuals, and coordination with federal, state, and local agencies is encouraged. Local agencies are involved in environmental restoration programs to coordinate with a consortium's established program. The Secretary will distribute grants to institutions of higher education across the US, with priority given to urban areas. Each institution will receive grants totaling up to one-third of the funds appropriated for that fiscal year. Additionally, the Secretary is required to provide reports on the grants. The Secretary may provide grants to institutions of higher education if they agree to submit annual reports containing program evaluations and other required information. An interim report compiling data from these reports must be submitted to the President and Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must submit a final report by January 1, 1997, to the President and Congress. The report will include a compilation of information on the effectiveness of demonstration grants and a recommendation on reauthorizing such grants. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
