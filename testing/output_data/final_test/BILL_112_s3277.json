Small businesses in the United States have great potential for growth through exporting goods and services to foreign markets. Despite the fact that only a small percentage currently engage in exports, those that do make up a significant portion of identified exporters and contribute significantly to total U.S. exports. Exporting also leads to the creation of higher-paying jobs compared to domestic sales. This highlights the opportunity for small businesses to expand their customer base and create new jobs by tapping into international markets. Title II of the document focuses on facilitating export opportunities for small businesses, specifically through the establishment of export finance specialists. Section 22(k)(1) of the Small Business Act is amended to allow the Administrator to employ additional export finance specialists, with a maximum limit of 50 specialists.

The President will reduce the capital paid to the North American Development Bank for fiscal years 2013-2016 by the amount received in 2012 under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
