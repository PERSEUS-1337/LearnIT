    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Imaging, and Men's Education Act\" or the \"PRIME Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant issue, especially among African-American men, with mortality rates comparable to breast cancer in women. Breakthroughs in breast cancer screening and treatment have been led by the Federal Government, and men should have access to similar screening and treatment options for prostate cancer. It is crucial for men to utilize current screening methods, as recent studies have shown limitations in detecting prostate cancer. Current methods of detecting prostate cancer, such as the PSA blood test and physical exams, are not always accurate, leading to false alarms and reassurances. The lack of advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer results in missed cancers, unnecessary medical procedures, and related complications. Prostate imaging tools could reduce physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for men and their families, while also saving billions of dollars in healthcare costs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will expand research on advanced imaging technologies for prostate cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Additionally, a public awareness and education campaign will be implemented. The Secretary will conduct a national campaign to raise awareness about prostate cancer screening and detection technologies. This campaign will involve various health organizations and include the distribution of educational materials and public service announcements targeting men. The Secretary will conduct a national campaign to raise awareness about prostate cancer screening, detection technologies, and racial disparities in incidences and mortality rates. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach strategies. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012. The Secretary will conduct research with the Secretary of Defense to develop an improved prostate cancer screening blood test using in-vitro detection. $20,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2008-2012. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress within 6 months detailing the implementation strategy of the Act and provide annual reports ensuring full compliance with the Act's provisions. Compliance certification is required, with explanations for any failures to comply."
