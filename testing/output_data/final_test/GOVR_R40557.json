    "content": "Foreign assistance law requires Congress to authorize funding for programs before appropriated funds are spent. Congress used to regularly update authorization legislation or amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to incorporate newer programs and authorities. However, after 1986, Congress started enacting freestanding authorities without amending the 1961 Act and waived the requirement to authorize funds before making them available in appropriations. The annual foreign operations appropriations bill funds foreign aid programs as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and other related Acts, with General Provisions guiding how funds may be spent. The General Provisions in foreign operations appropriations measures have become a legislative option for Congress to assert its views on foreign aid policy, put limits or conditions on assistance, or authorize new programs. This has increased the importance of General Provisions in shaping foreign aid policy. The General Provisions in foreign operations appropriations measures serve as a way for Congress to influence foreign aid policy, set limits on assistance, and establish new programs. These provisions play a significant role in shaping foreign aid policy. The legislative history of General Provisions in foreign operations appropriations measures is detailed in a joint committee print for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Most provisions have changed over the years, with limited codification in the U.S. Code or correspondence with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Some provisions lack detailed legislative history, such as those introduced in FY2009.
