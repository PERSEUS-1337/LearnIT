    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act of 2015, also known as Section 1, addresses the wage gap issue where women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. This gap is even wider for women of color, with African American women earning 64 cents and Latinas earning 56 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. The wage disparity resulted in a yearly average wage gap of $10,876 in 2013, totaling more than $490 billion in lost wages for working women every year. Disparities in pay for women have significant negative impacts, shortchanging them and their families by thousands of dollars annually and potentially hundreds of thousands over a lifetime. Pay equity is crucial for the economic security of families, with many mothers being primary breadwinners. Equal pay for equal work is a fundamental principle in the US and California, with laws prohibiting gender-based pay discrepancies. The United States Department of Labor proposed a rule for federal contractors with over 100 employees to submit an annual equal pay report. California state contractors must also comply with equal pay laws to promote pay equity and nondiscrimination. The legislation aims to address pay equity issues and improve data collection on pay disparities. Any employer seeking to contract with the state for public works or services must comply with nondiscrimination laws and regulations. Prior to contracting with the state, employers with 100 or more employees must submit a nondiscrimination program and periodic compliance reports. Employers with fewer than 100 employees may also be required to submit a program and comply with the same requirements. The department may require approval and certification of the program. An employee in the construction industry covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement with specific provisions is excluded from the employer's total number of employees for calculation purposes. Changes to this subdivision do not affect existing exemptions or require reinterpretation by the department. A nondiscrimination program must have policies for equal employment opportunities, analyze selection procedures, and conduct a workforce analysis by race, ethnicity, and sex for specific job categories. This analysis includes total workers, wages, and hours worked annually. Exempt employees are assumed to work 40 hours a week for reporting purposes. Every state contract and subcontract for public works or goods/services must include a nondiscrimination clause prohibiting discrimination based on specified factors. Contractors must notify labor organizations of their obligations under the clause. The clause does not apply to credit card purchases under $2,500, with a yearly exemption limit of $7,500 per company for state agency credit card purchases. State agencies must monitor and adhere to these restrictions on credit card purchases. The department will develop rules and regulations for implementing nondiscrimination programs in state contracts, including procedures for approval, monitoring, and enforcement. The rules will also specify the size of contracts exempt from certain provisions, circumstances where contractors are not subject to the rules, and criteria for determining the scope of a contractor's nondiscrimination program. The department will establish procedures for coordinating nondiscrimination requirements with state and federal laws, as well as develop principles and standards for administering this section. Where a contractor or subcontractor is required to prepare an affirmative action, equal employment, or nondiscrimination program subject to review and approval by a federal compliance agency, that program may be filed with the department. This program will serve as evidence of compliance with nondiscrimination requirements. Compliance with such a program will also satisfy local ordinances or regulations that require submission of a similar program to a local awarding agency. The department may recommend sanctions to the awarding agency for violations of the section or its rules. Recommendations consider the severity of the violation and any previous penalties imposed."
