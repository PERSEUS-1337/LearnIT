Operating principles of the agency should reflect a strong position of independence. The operating principles of the agency should include openness about data sources, wide dissemination of data, continual search for better data, regular evaluation of data collection programs, commitment to quality standards, and fair treatment of data providers. The agency's operating principles include fair treatment of data providers, maintenance of an active research program, and cooperation with other statistical agencies.
