Congress recognizes the oceans and coastal areas of the United States as valuable resources contributing to economic growth, quality of life, and national security. Oceans play a crucial role in driving global and regional climate, impacting agriculture, fishing, and severe weather prediction. Maintaining leadership in oceanography is essential for wise ocean use and resource protection. Ocean research and education activities are conducted by Federal agencies, academic institutions, and industry. The need for a formal mechanism to coordinate partnerships and share resources in ocean sciences and education is crucial for the well-being of Americans. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program is required by adding a new chapter to the United States Code, focusing on coordinating partnerships and sharing resources in ocean sciences and education. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program, established by the Secretary of the Navy, aims to promote national security, economic development, quality of life, and science education through improved ocean knowledge. It coordinates partnerships among Federal agencies, academia, industry, and others to support these goals. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Navy, includes members from various agencies like NOAA, NSF, and NASA. The Council aims to promote collaboration in oceanographic research and report annually to Congress on the program. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Navy, includes members from various agencies like NASA, EPA, Coast Guard, and others. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Navy, includes members representing ocean industries, State governments, academia, and other appropriate views. Members appointed under specific subsections have a two-year term, filling vacancies for the remainder of the predecessor's term. The Council's responsibilities are outlined. The National Ocean Research Leadership Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Navy, has responsibilities including establishing the Ocean Research Partnership Coordinating Group and the Ocean Research Advisory Panel. They are required to submit an annual report to Congress on the National Oceanographic Partnership Program by March 1 each year. The report must detail program activities from the previous fiscal year and list members of key groups involved. The Ocean Research Advisory Panel must submit an annual report to Congress detailing planned activities, ongoing projects, involvement with Federal entities, and budget requests for the following fiscal year. The Council establishes the Ocean Research Partnership Coordinating Group, consisting of members appointed from Federal departments with oceanographic research programs. The Coordinating Group is responsible for coordinating activities under the authority of the Council. The Coordinating Group, under the control of the Council, is responsible for prescribing policies and procedures for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. They review, select, and allocate funds for partnership projects based on criteria such as addressing research objectives, broad participation, long-term commitment, and resource support. The Coordinating Group oversees the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, including establishing a partnership program office to implement the program. This office is responsible for promoting participation in partnership projects, submitting annual reports to the Council, and establishing working groups for proposing initiatives. The partnership program office oversees working groups to propose projects, manages peer reviews and competitions, and submits annual reports on project status. The Coordinating Group can authorize departments to enter contracts and make grants for program implementation. The Coordinating Group selects partnership projects in various forms, such as memoranda of understanding and research agreements. An annual report on the National Oceanographic Partnership Program is submitted by the Coordinating Group to the Council. The Council appoints an Ocean Research Advisory Panel with 10 to 18 members. The Ocean Research Advisory Panel consists of members eminent in marine science or policy, representing government, academia, and industry. They review partnership projects over $500,000 and make recommendations to the Coordinating Group. They also advise on activities for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. The table of chapters in subtitle C of title 10, United States Code, is amended by inserting after chapter 663. \"665. National Oceanographic Partnership Program 7901\" The Secretary of the Navy must appoint council members by December 1, 1996, and the National Ocean Research Leadership Council must appoint advisory panel members by January 1, 1997. The first annual report of the Council is due to Congress by March 1, 1997, including information on terms of office and responsibilities. The Ocean Research Advisory Panel, established by the Council, has terms of office, procedures, and responsibilities. $30,000,000 is authorized for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program in fiscal year 1997, with at least $500,000 or 3% of the amount appropriated for the program office operations."
