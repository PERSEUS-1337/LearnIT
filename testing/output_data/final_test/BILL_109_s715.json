    "content": "The Wind Power Tax Incentives Act of 2005, also known as the Wind Power Tax Incentives Act, allows for the offset of passive activity losses and credits for eligible taxpayers from wind energy facilities. The Wind Power Tax Incentives Act of 2005 amends Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code to allow eligible taxpayers to offset passive activity losses and credits from wind energy facilities. The Wind Power Tax Incentives Act of 2005 defines an eligible taxpayer as someone with adjusted gross income not exceeding $1,000,000. Adjusted gross income is calculated as under subsection (i)(3)(F), and aggregation rules apply for single employers. For pass-thru entities, the credit is allocated at the person level. The amendments made by this section apply to facilities placed in service after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF CREDIT TO COOPERATIVES. Section 45(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow cooperative organizations to allocate a portion of the credit to shareholders based on their capital contributions. The amendment allows cooperative organizations to allocate a portion of the credit to shareholders based on their capital contributions. The election for the credit must be made on a timely filed return and is irrevocable for the taxable year. The amount of the credit apportioned to shareholders is not included in the organization's taxable income but is included in the shareholder's taxable income. The amendment allows cooperative organizations to allocate a portion of the credit to shareholders based on their capital contributions. If the credit amount for a taxable year is less than shown on the return, the excess is treated as an increase in tax on the organization. The amendment allows cooperative organizations to allocate a portion of the credit to shareholders based on their capital contributions. Any increase in tax due to this allocation is not considered a tax imposed for determining credits under certain subparts. The amendments apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
