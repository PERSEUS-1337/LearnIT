Congress finds that the national unemployment rates for college graduates are high, with individuals owing significant student loan debt. Additionally, there are over 26 million small businesses in the United States. Recent college graduates need workplace experience to develop skills and entrepreneurial qualities. Small businesses benefit from their information and technology skills, helping them compete in the global economy. Establishment of America Rising Program. The America Rising Program, established by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, provides grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates and grants to graduates for further postsecondary education in math, science, engineering, or technology. Grants are awarded based on terms set by the Secretary, including the deferral of federal student loan obligations for participants. The America Rising Program offers grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates and grants to graduates for further education in specific fields. Employers can use the grant to defray the cost of compensating recent college graduates participating in the program. The program provides grants to eligible employers to cover compensation for recent college graduates, with a maximum award of $25,000 per graduate. Recent college graduates receiving grants are eligible for Federal student aid without regard to their loan status. The program offers grants to eligible employers, including small businesses or major corporations in enterprise zones with high unemployment rates. An enterprise zone is defined as a HUBzone.

A \"recent college graduate\" is someone who has received a baccalaureate or associate degree within 24 months before being awarded a grant under this section, and has not previously obtained such a degree. In the Higher Education Act of 1965, an \"institution of higher education\" is defined. The Small Business Act defines a \"small business concern.\" $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2018-2020 for this Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
