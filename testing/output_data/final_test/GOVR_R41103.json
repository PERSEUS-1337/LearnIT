    "content": "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are considered \"air pollutants\" under the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA the authority to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA made an \"endangerment finding\" for greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in December 2009, leading to the promulgation of standards. This action also triggered duties for stationary sources of GHG emissions. The EPA adopted regulations requiring new stationary sources and modifications in PSD areas to undergo new source review based on CO2 emissions. This would trigger the installation of best available control technology to control GHG emissions, leading to Title V operating permitting requirements for sources emitting CO2 above a low threshold. The EPA's interpretation of the Clean Air Act led to a large number of stationary sources being subject to new source review, BACT, and Title V permitting requirements. The Supreme Court ruled that PSD new source review and BACT cannot be triggered solely by a source's GHG emissions, but applying CO2 BACT to sources based on their non-GHG emissions was deemed reasonable. The Court also voided EPA's tailoring rule. The report chronicles major climate change-related actions by federal agencies post-Massachusetts v. EPA, excluding executive orders. Actions were either directly or indirectly linked to the Massachusetts decision, with some included based on relevance to climate change. Analytical details can be found in other CRS reports. Dates cited are from Federal Register publications, although actions were often announced weeks earlier. The EPA denied California's request for a waiver of CAA preemption on March 6. The Clean Air Act preempts state controls on new motor vehicle emissions but allows California to request a waiver. Once granted, other states can adopt the same standards. California requested a waiver of CAA preemption for GHG emissions limits for 2009 and later model year vehicles, but EPA denied it, stating the state did not need the limits to meet \"compelling and extraordinary conditions.\" EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on GHG emissions from new motor vehicles on July 30. In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson issued a memorandum narrowly interpreting the Clean Air Act to only regulate pollutants with actual, not potential future, emission limits. This distinction was crucial for controlling pollutants in PSD areas, where expensive BACT requirements apply to new major emitting facilities or major modifications. In July 2009, EPA granted California's request for a waiver of Clean Air Act preemption, allowing GHG emissions limits for motor vehicles to go into effect. Additionally, in October 2009, EPA finalized a mandatory GHG monitoring rule. EPA finalized the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule as required by the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The rule mandated reporting of GHG emissions above certain thresholds in all sectors of the economy. Amendments and expansions to the rule have been made, including alternative verification approaches and confidentiality determinations. For updates, refer to http://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/reporters/notices/index.html. EPA also finalized an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles on December 15. On December 15, EPA finalized an endangerment finding for GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. This finding was based on two component endangerment findings required under CAA section 202(a). The first finding concluded that six GHGs are likely to endanger public health and welfare through climate change impacts. The second finding stated that four GHGs emitted by new motor vehicles in the US contribute to the endangering air pollution in the atmosphere. This compound endangerment finding triggers a duty under section. On February 18, the Council on Environmental Quality issued draft guidance under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) titled \"Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the Effects of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\" This guidance provides ways for federal agencies to improve their evaluation of proposals for federal actions under NEPA by considering the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. On April 2, EPA finalized its reconsideration of the Johnson memorandum regarding federal actions under NEPA. EPA clarified that \"subject to regulation\" in the Clean Air Act does not apply to newly regulated pollutants like GHGs until regulatory requirements are both promulgated and in effect. This delayed the implementation of PSD and Title V permitting requirements until January 2, 2011, or later under EPA's tailoring rule. The EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized rules setting GHG emission and fuel economy standards for 2012-2016 model year light-duty vehicles on May 7, 2010. The EPA emission standards were mandated under the Clean Air Act, while NHTSA was required to prescribe separate fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles starting in 2011. The White House brokered an agreement for EPA to develop GHG emissions standards that would be compatible with NHTSA's fuel economy standards. The EPA and NHTSA finalized GHG emissions and fuel economy standards for 2012-2016 model year vehicles, with EPA developing standards under the Clean Air Act compatible with NHTSA's fuel economy standards. Both standards apply to various vehicles and become more stringent each year, with a fleetwide average of 35.5 mpg for EPA and 34.1 mpg for NHTSA in model year 2016. EPA also finalized a \"tailoring rule\" on June 3. The EPA finalized a \"tailoring rule\" on June 3 to address overwhelming permitting burdens related to GHG emissions. The rule set higher thresholds for PSD new source review and Title V, with PSD requirements applying to projects increasing net GHG emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year CO2 equivalent. EPA denies petitions to reconsider endangerment finding for GHGs from new motor vehicles, citing well-supported evidence despite claims of bias among climate-change scientists. EPA issues \"PSD and Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\" on November 10 to assist with Clean Air Act requirements. The EPA issued \"PSD and Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases\" on November 10 to assist with Clean Air Act requirements for addressing GHGs in new major stationary sources and major modifications. Additionally, EPA finalized a rule on December 13, calling for 13 states to revise their SIPs to meet CAA requirements for GHG-emitting sources. Failure to do so by the deadline will result in EPA promulgating a federal plan. If the state fails to correct its State Implementation Plan (SIP) by the deadline, the EPA must implement a federal plan. EPA settled lawsuits to issue new standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants and petroleum refineries. The settlements were in response to petitions objecting to EPA's amendments to existing standards for GHG emissions. EPA agreed to propose NSPSs for GHG emissions from new/modified power plants by July 26, 2011. The EPA settled lawsuits to issue new standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from power plants and petroleum refineries. They agreed to propose NSPSs for GHG emissions from new/modified power plants by July 26, 2011, and finalized rules to narrow state Title V permitting programs for GHG-emitting stationary sources on December 30. EPA has made no proposal yet for petroleum refineries. On December 30, EPA finalized a rule to narrow the approval of state Title V operating permit programs for GHG-emitting stationary sources, aiming to reduce the number of sources requiring Title V permits and lessen permitting burdens for state agencies. The EPA finalized a rule to defer PSD and Title V permitting requirements for CO2 emissions from bioenergy and other biogenic stationary sources for three years to allow for further examination on how to account for such emissions. This rule aimed to reduce the number of new stationary sources requiring permits and lessen permitting burdens for state agencies. The EPA deferred PSD and Title V permitting requirements for CO2 emissions from bioenergy and other biogenic stationary sources for three years to allow for further examination. This deferral only applied to CO2 emissions and did not affect non-GHG pollutants or other GHGs emitted from biomass fuel combustion. EPA and NHTSA jointly finalized rules setting GHG emission standards and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for 2014 and later model years. The EPA and NHTSA set GHG emission and fuel economy standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for 2014 and later model years. EPA's emission standards for combination tractors and vocational vehicles began in 2014. NHTSA's fuel economy standards were voluntary in 2014 and 2015, becoming mandatory in 2016. EPA proposed CO2 emission standards for new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units on April 13. The EPA finalized GHG emission standards for 2017-2025 model year light-duty vehicles, while NHTSA set fuel economy standards for the same period. These rules build on previous standards and will become more stringent each year. The EPA and NHTSA finalized GHG emission and fuel economy standards for 2017-2025 model year light-duty vehicles. The standards will become more stringent each year, aiming for an industry fleetwide average of 54.5 mpg by 2025. NHTSA's CAFE standards for 2017-2021 require 40.3 to 41.0 mpg by 2021, with projections of 48.7-49.7 mpg by 2025 for the second phase. The \"social cost of carbon\" estimates in the interagency \"technical support document\" aim to help federal agencies factor in the benefits of reducing CO2 emissions in cost-benefit analyses of regulations under Executive Order 12866. The estimates in the current version are higher than those in the 2010 document. President Obama issued a memorandum setting deadlines for EPA to issue standards for GHG emissions from power plants. The EPA was directed to issue standards for carbon emissions from existing power plants with a proposed rule by June 1, 2014, and a final rule by June 1, 2015. The EPA withdrew the 2012 proposal for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electric generating units on January 8, 2014, and proposed revised standards. On September 20, 2013, the EPA proposed new source standards for fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units and natural gas-fired stationary combustion engines based on carbon capture and storage technology. Additionally, on June 18, 2014, the EPA proposed emission guidelines for CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. The EPA proposed emission guidelines for CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants under CAA section 111(d). The program includes state-specific CO2 reduction goals based on efficiency improvements, energy efficiency, and renewable power sources. States must develop plans to meet these goals. The EPA proposed performance standards for CO2 emissions from modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under CAA section 111(b). States can use various measures to reach the EPA goal for CO2 reductions by 2030, including energy efficiency programs and renewable portfolio standards. EPA proposes revised performance standards for emissions from new municipal solid waste landfills and an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding emissions from existing landfills. Landfill emissions are a key focus for EPA regulations. The EPA proposes revised standards for emissions from municipal solid waste landfills, with a focus on reducing methane emissions, which are 25 times more potent than CO2 in contributing to climate change. The Council on Environmental Quality denies a petition to explicitly address climate change in NEPA documents, stating that current regulations already consider climate effects. On November 4, EPA proposes emission guidelines for CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in Indian country and U.S. territories. EPA also seeks comments on allowing jurisdictions without such units to partner with those that do. On November 13, EPA issues a notice on translating state CO2 reduction goals to mass-based equivalents. On December 24, the Council on Environmental Quality issues revised draft guidance. The Council on Environmental Quality issues revised draft guidance on considering greenhouse gas emissions and climate change effects in federal actions. Agencies should evaluate both the impact of proposed actions on climate change and the impact of climate change on the environment. Disclosure of GHG emissions is not required if below 25,000 tons of CO2 equivalent annually. The United States aims to reduce GHG emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 to prevent dangerous interference with world climate as per the Convention's objective."
