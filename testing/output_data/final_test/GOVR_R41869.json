    "content": "Historically, transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along partisan lines. The debate over equitable distribution of federal highway aid shows donor states (mostly in the South, Midwest, and West) receiving less aid than their highway users contribute to the highway trust fund. Donee states, receiving more aid than they contribute, resist reducing their share. This issue has been a major challenge in surface transportation reauthorization since 1982. Surface transportation reauthorization has been an ongoing issue since 1982, with Congress ensuring each state receives a specified proportion of trust-fund contributions in highway grants. The most recent authorization, SAFETEA, expired in 2009 and has been extended through various acts. Federal monies for highway projects are not provided upfront, but rather through the Federal-Aid Highway Program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) distributes funds to states for road projects. Funds are allocated as formula (apportioned) or discretionary grants. Formula funds are distributed based on set formulas, while discretionary funds are competitive. Most funding has been earmarked by Congress since FY2000, except for FY2007 and FY2011. The distinction between formula and discretionary programs is important for equity programs. The Equity Bonus Program (EB) ensures states receive federal highway grants equal to a specified share of their tax payments. Discretionary programs may not guarantee this rate of return to all states while addressing federal highway needs like roads on federal lands and Interstate System maintenance. The Equity Bonus Program ensures states receive federal highway grants based on their tax payments. Congress has decided to leave some programs outside of the equity programs to address federal highway needs like roads on federal lands and Interstate System maintenance. The Infrastructure Improvement Program, including the Equity Bonus Program, guarantees and distributes funds for various programs. The scope of the program includes major formula programs and has changed under different transportation acts. The Highway Trust Fund is supported by fuel taxes and truck taxes, with revenues also going to the Mass Transit Account and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust. The Highway Trust Fund is funded by fuel taxes and truck taxes, with revenues also allocated to the Mass Transit Account and the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund. Fuel taxes are collected at the terminal level, leading to challenges in attributing tax revenue to each state. The FHWA estimates each state's share of payments to the highway account based on national revenue estimates provided by the Treasury Department. The FHWA uses state fuel tax data to estimate each state's share of national fuel consumption, which determines their payments to the Highway Trust Fund. Truck-related taxes are extrapolated from diesel fuel use estimates. Data compilation and review take over a year after each federal fiscal year. The Equity Bonus calculation for federal funding is based on two-year-old attribution estimates, leading to concerns by states about the distribution of funds. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin proposed $20 million for a national network of canals and roads, but the plan was never funded due to regional opposition, with Southern states fearing benefits would go to other regions and New England states worried about funds being spent outside their region. Gallatin suggested allocating only $16.6 million for the project. In 1808, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin recommended $20 million for a national network of roads and canals, with $16.6 million designated for the project. The remaining $3.4 million was to benefit states less interested in the plan. Despite this, the Gallatin plan failed to gain enough support. This debate foreshadowed modern donor-donee arguments. Senator Lippitt of Rhode Island later presented a table during the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 debate, showing each state's share of road aid funding. The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 established the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to fund the construction of the Interstate System (IS). Senator Lippitt's table showed that some states would receive smaller shares of road aid than they contributed in taxes, with Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania contributing over 50% of tax revenue but receiving only 11-12% of road spending. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 created the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to ensure an equal rate of return on each state's highway tax payments. The publication of Table FE-221 in 1972 highlighted concerns about states receiving their \"fair share\" from the HTF, sparking ongoing debates on the issue. The Highway Trust Fund was created in 1916 to ensure equal return on state highway tax payments. By the 1970s, disparities in federal aid received by states led to debates on fairness. Alaska received $8.34 for every dollar paid, while North Carolina only received $0.52. Construction on the Interstate Highway System varied by state, with completion nearing in the 1980s. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 aimed to address donor state dissatisfaction by providing a minimum core program allocation of 85% to each state. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 aimed to address donor state dissatisfaction by providing a minimum core program allocation of 85% to each state. The debate over equity among donor and donee states has influenced the balance of control and responsibility for highway spending between the federal government and the states. The federal matching share for non-Interstate projects increased from 50% to 80% between 1970 and 1992. Earmarking emerged as a major force in transportation funding, allowing Members of Congress to control spending and override project decisions made at the state or federal level. The tension between concentrating spending on projects with national benefits and spreading funding widely is evident in the donor-donee fight over equity. The donor state argument is for equity in federal highway funding, with each state receiving funding equal to what their highway users pay into the HTF. Donor state advocates feel they have been subsidizing the repair of donee state infrastructure, especially in the Northeast. They argue they are more road dependent and do not benefit from federal transit spending as much as some donee states. Southern and Western donor states also highlight their fast growth relative to most donee states. Certain Western donor states argue that their fast growth areas have needs as great or greater than donee states. Donee states counter that fairness should be tied to need, citing aging infrastructure and limited resources in some regions. They also argue for federal funding for national highway networks, emphasizing the importance of addressing needs beyond state boundaries. States often spend less local and state money on highways relative to federal funding, leading to debates between donor and donee states. The Federal-Aid Highway Program considers rate-of-return criteria, but objections arise due to complexities in federal tax and spending flows. Emphasis on each state's rate of return may hinder addressing national needs and making freight-related road improvements. The Highway Trust Fund (HTF) has received significant amounts of money from the Treasury's general fund over the years, including appropriations of $29.7 billion from 2008 to 2010. This funding, which came from general taxpayers, has benefited road improvements at a national level more than at the state level where the projects were carried out. The Highway Trust Fund has received funding from the Treasury's general fund, benefiting national road improvements more than state-level projects. Congress faces challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate of return and protecting the highway funding of donee states due to insufficient revenue. Legislatively, reducing the shares of donee states to increase donor states' shares may face difficulties in passing Congress. To address the challenge of balancing donor and donee state demands for highway funding, reauthorization bills have included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares. Increasing donor state shares to achieve equity has required a significant increase in the federal highway program size. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA was the largest at $41 billion over five years, highlighting the difficulty of finding sufficient funds for equity distribution mechanisms in reauthorization. This debate over equity remedies has broader implications for transportation issues. A guaranteed rate of return exceeding 95% could limit addressing additional transportation needs like the Federal Lands Highway Program or Interstate Maintenance Program. Approaching a 100% guarantee would result in the federal government collecting and redistributing HTF revenues to states, questioning the federal role in highway finance. The donor-donee debate focuses on the use of statistics to determine states' status based on dollars or shares contributed to the highway account compared to federal funding received. The donor-donee controversy revolves around two methods of determining states' status based on dollars or shares contributed to the highway account compared to federal funding received. The share-in/share-out method eliminates the impact of unexpended balances and treats general fund revenues the same as highway taxes. This calculation perpetuates the donor-donee debate, leading to significant differences in reported status. In FY2007, Arizona's donor or donee status varied depending on the method used. Using the dollar-in/dollar-out ratio, it was considered a donee state with a ratio of 1.03. However, using the share-in/share-out method, it was classified as a donor state with a ratio of 0.86. The controversy over donor-donee status persisted, with 27 states below the 1.0 ratio in the share-in/share-out method for the year. FHWA's Donor-Donee statistics for SAFETEA years FY2005-FY2009 show discrepancies in state classifications due to economic factors impacting HTF revenues. Annual figures are compiled with no inflation adjustment, leading to fluctuating state statuses. Economic downturns can shift states from donor to donee status, affecting transportation tax revenues. The impact of economic factors on HTF revenues can shift states from donor to donee status. Changes in fuel use and general fund transfers have influenced state classifications. SAFETEA aimed to draw down the unexpended balance of the highway account, leading to fluctuations in states' ratios. By FY2009, general fund transfers significantly affected rates of return for all 50 states. The impact of economic factors on Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues shifted states from donor to donee status. General fund transfers significantly affected rates of return for all 50 states, leading to a national ratio of 1.41. Donor state advocates have pressed for a guaranteed rate-of-return ratio of 0.95 instead of 1.0 during reauthorizations. Various methods exist to determine a state's donor or donee status, making it possible for concerned parties to cite discrepancies in highway funding. Since 1982, Congress has implemented measures to ensure each state receives a specified share of federal highway spending, with the Equity Bonus (EB) Program serving as the current equity mechanism. This program overlays on top of major programs authorized in SAFETEA, providing additional funding to states based on a formula that determines initial apportionment amounts. It is important to view rate of return figures cautiously, as advocates may selectively combine data or modify projections to show a particular state as disadvantaged. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program ensures each state receives a minimum return on its estimated payments to the highway account, based on specific federal-aid highway programs. The program allocates funds to bring donor states up to their guaranteed rate-of-return, with percentages increasing over FY2005-2009. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program guarantees a minimum return on state payments to the highway account through specific federal-aid highway programs. The program includes various programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program, Safe Routes to School Program, Highway Safety Improvement Program, and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program. Spending within these programs is categorized as \"below-the-line,\" while spending outside the scope is \"above-the-line.\" The EB percentage guarantee applies only to funding within the program's scope, making it a partial guarantee. For example, the 92% guarantee for FY2008 and FY2009 covered just over 90% of the total SAFETEA authorization for those years. Distribution to states was based on extending authorizations from FY2009 funding amounts, with \"hold harmless\" provisions ensuring certain states receive their share. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program guarantees a minimum return on state payments to the highway account through specific federal-aid highway programs. Certain states qualify for funding as hold harmless states under eligibility thresholds based on various criteria. These states include Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program guarantees minimum funding increases for certain states including Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The annual guaranteed funding levels range from 117% to 121% over TEA-21 levels. A nine-step calculation process is used to determine EB apportionments, with Step 1 involving estimating each state's minimum program share based on national highway account contributions. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program determines each state's minimum share based on national highway account contributions for FY2007. States are guaranteed a 92% share, with a dollar floor set at 121% of average annual TEA-21 apportionments. Funding needed to bring all states up to their required levels is estimated through a seven-step process. The Equity Bonus (EB) Program determines each state's minimum share based on national highway account contributions for FY2007. In FY2009, four iterations were needed to reach a total program size of $38,816,775,489 to bring all states up to their required share. The EB distribution for FY2009 was $9,594,053,923, roughly 25% of total apportionments, broken down into three categories. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to states based on national highway account contributions. In FY2009, $9.6 billion was distributed, with $2.6 billion going to the Surface Transportation Program and the rest to core formula programs based on each state's apportionment ratio. Donor-donee conflicts were resolved in TEA-21 and SAFETEA with large funding amounts. In a constrained budgetary environment, reauthorization bills are likely to limit spending to amounts flowing into the highway account or a percentage of SAFETEA baseline spending. Authorizers must work within anticipated budget constraints to resolve donor-donee conflicts without exceeding the total program size. Various options exist to address difficulties in producing a surface transportation reauthorization bill that adequately tackles the donor-donee debate. The transportation reauthorization bill may eliminate the equity provision and rely on program formulas to distribute highway funds. If SAFETEA baseline is extended, using general fund revenues to fill the gap weakens the case for a rate-of-return guarantee by donor states. Donor states may push for equity adjustments if spending is limited to amounts in the highway account. The current Federal-Aid Highway Program has been criticized for lacking a link to equity. The Federal-Aid Highway Program has faced criticism for not linking funding with performance measures. Increasing emphasis on performance may conflict with ensuring each state receives a certain share of funding. The use of contributions to the Highway Trust Fund and funding distribution weaken the link between funding and performance. Congress may struggle to balance performance measures with guaranteeing each state's rate of return on contributions. The discussion revolves around limiting highway programs to match trust fund revenues, with a rate-of-return guarantee. Donor states may favor this, but donee states would object due to loss of share. Balancing equity adjustments with lower program authorizations to match revenue projections poses a challenge. The discussion focuses on funding highway programs within trust fund revenues, with a rate-of-return guarantee. To address donor-donee state disparities, adjustments in program authorizations are needed to balance equity while meeting revenue projections. Ways to reduce costs in an equity program include making rate of return a key factor in all programs and adjusting funding formulas. Some methods to reduce costs in an equity program include adjusting the equity bonus calculation and using total annual payments to determine program size. However, funding would still be required to address concerns from states losing their hold harmless protections. Using total annual payments could set a spending ceiling based on outdated data and limit flexibility in funding decisions. Congress may need to decide on funding options for the highway program, including drawing from the general fund or the unexpended balance of the highway account. One suggestion is to base funding allocation solely on each state's percentage share of contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. This could streamline the process and ensure each state receives a certain rate of return. Additionally, discretionary program funds could also be distributed based on state contributions. One approach to funding the highway program is to allocate funds based on each state's contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. This method allows for flexibility in setting program sizes without being influenced by existing distribution programs. It can also be used to adjust the weighting of formula programs as needed, up to 100%. Integrating the guaranteed rate of return into all highway programs may not eliminate the need for an equity program to gain support from \"hold harmless\" states. Infusions of general fund monies into the Highway Trust Fund could raise objections from high-income states, limiting federal funding for policy priorities. This could result in states with fewer deficient bridges receiving more bridge program funds, or states with no air quality non-attainment areas getting more Congestion Mitigation and Air funds. States with no air quality non-attainment areas could receive more Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement funding than states with non-attainment areas. SAFETEA phased in the increase in each state's guaranteed rate of return from 90.5% to 92% over time, which could save money compared to an immediate raise. However, some large donor states may be unhappy with this phase-in approach. Adjustments to the \"hold harmless\" provisions that protect certain states from losing highway spending share could be made, but in a constrained budgetary environment, this could be problematic. One way to reduce the cost of the EB is to limit the number of programs covered by the guarantee to stay within budget. Adjustments to the \"hold harmless\" levels may be necessary to maintain support for a reauthorization bill. Donor states typically prefer a broad scope, but changes during the authorization process can have unforeseen consequences. Under SAFETEA, limiting the expense of the EB program could involve dropping states from the iterative process and providing them with guaranteed dollar amounts. This approach may raise objections as it does not protect the overall size of the highway program like the EB program does. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed devolving most federal highway program roles to states, limiting federal involvement to specific areas. It included a phase-out of the federal gasoline tax and allowed states to raise their own taxes for road and transit projects. The Transportation Empowerment Act proposed devolving federal highway program roles to states, allowing them to raise their own taxes for road and transit projects. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jeff Flake introduced the Highway Fairness and Reform Act of 2011, which would give states the option to receive their state contribution to the Highway Account instead of participating in the Federal-Aid Highway Program. This proposal faced mixed reactions from state officials concerned about political implications and equity issues. Restructuring the EB program to allocate federal highway grants based on states' road users' payments could strengthen the case for devolution. However, limited interest from states in changing the federal role in the highway program and general fund support for the Federal-Aid Highway Program may deter radical shifts. Devolution arguments lose appeal when the general fund contributes significantly to highway program costs. As long as the general fund supports the Highway Trust Fund, most states may prefer the status quo. The general fund infusions prop up the Highway Trust Fund, making the status quo attractive to most states. Arguments against devolution may be strong if the spending baseline continues, requiring a significant annual general fund contribution. States may not support devolution without receiving general funds. Alternatively, a smaller program size and aligned payments could make devolution more appealing to states. Increasing highway revenues through fuel taxes could make the Highway Trust Fund self-sufficient and resolve donor-donee issues. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 created a mass transit account within the Highway Trust Fund, receiving funding from gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. Eliminating this account and using all fuel taxes for highways could improve the fund's sufficiency. The Congressional Budget Office projects the mass transit account to receive billions annually, suggesting a need for alternative solutions to the donor-donee issue. One approach to resolving the donor-donee conflict is to eliminate the trust fund structure for surface transportation finance. Highway taxes could be deposited into the general fund, with Congress providing funding through the normal authorization and appropriations process. This restructuring would address the issue of money flow in highway funding, potentially removing the donor-donee problem as an obstacle to reauthorization. However, it would not solve the problem of federal spending adequacy for highways and mass transit, leading to internal issues within Congress. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 authorized increased funding for the Federal-Aid Highway system from FY1983-FY1986, addressing donor state dissatisfaction by providing a minimum allocation to each state. Flat-lining highway spending could be favorable for deficit reduction, extending funding levels from FY2009. Members may assume a more influential role in surface transportation bills, potentially resolving the donor-donee issue. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 increased funding for the Federal-Aid Highway system from FY1983-FY1986, addressing donor state concerns by providing a minimum allocation to each state. The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (STURAA) retained the 85% minimum allocation for FY1987-1991, altering the basis of its calculation. The Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 revised the calculation for funding allocation to include discretionary programs, except for federal lands and safety programs. Minor changes were made in the criteria for awarding discretionary program grants, while emergency relief and federal lands highways grants continued to be distributed based on project needs. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 reauthorized surface transportation programs for FY1992-FY1997, making significant changes. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) reauthorized surface transportation programs for FY1992-FY1997, with major changes in program structure, formulas, and provisions impacting state donor-donee ratios. ISTEA expanded the federal highway program's mission to include air quality, alternative transportation, and historic preservation, while retaining funding for the Interstate system and Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. Other formula programs were replaced by the National Highway System Program. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) replaced previous planning programs with new programs like the National Highway System Program and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. The distribution criteria for projects remained the same, with changes to the Interstate Construction Program and the Interstate 4R program. ISTEA also included provisions for more equitable distribution of federal funds to states, including raising the minimum allocation to 90% of estimated state contributions. The ISTEA included provisions for more equitable distribution of federal funds to states, with a new minimum payments guarantee and a donor state bonus to ensure each state received at least 90% of its estimated contributions. The ISTEA included provisions for more equitable distribution of federal funds to states, with a new minimum payments guarantee and a donor state bonus to ensure each state received at least 90% of its estimated contributions. Each state received additional funds to reach a set percentage, and reimbursement was provided for building Interstate segments without federal assistance. Despite these efforts, significant gaps remained among states in their share return on contributions to the Highway Trust Fund, leading to challenges to the effectiveness of the equity provisions. The reauthorization debate preceding the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) included various views on donor-donee state issues, federal government roles, Interstate Highway system completion, national highway needs criteria, and gas tax revenue influence on program structure. The reauthorization debate before TEA-21 involved views on donor-donee state issues, federal roles, Interstate Highway system completion, national highway needs criteria, and gas tax revenue impact on program structure. Regional conflicts arose over funding distribution under ISTEA, with donor states seeking a minimum 95% return on contributions to the HTF. Regional differences outweighed party affiliation on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The TEA-21 bill included equity provisions to address donor-donee state issues, with a minimum guarantee of funding for each state based on program shares. The equity changes were limited due to a significant increase in overall funding levels. The TEA-21 bill included various programs such as the National Highway System Program, Surface Transportation Program, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program. States were guaranteed a minimum of 90.5% return on their tax contributions to the highway account. For example, Ohio was guaranteed 90.5% of its share of contributions, ensuring a minimum share of funding for FY2003 apportionments. The TEA-21 bill guaranteed states a minimum of 90.5% return on their tax contributions to the highway account, including High Priority Projects and minimum guarantee funds. Each state was ensured at least $1 million in minimum guarantee funds as part of the compromise provision. The funding was adjusted to bring donor states up to the 90.5% minimum guarantee. The District needed over $6 billion in total program funding to retain its program percentage. Donor status meant more money for all states. The first $2.8 billion of minimum guarantee funds were administered as STP funds. TEA-21 distributed guarantee funds as STP funds, with set-asides for certain programs. Any funds above $2.8 million went to five core programs based on apportionment ratios. Formula changes were made to benefit donor states, including reducing weights for Interstate Maintenance Program. TEA-21 redistributed funds to benefit donor states through weighted formulas in various programs like the Surface Transportation Program and National Highway System Program. The distribution was based on factors such as state contributions to the Highway Trust Fund and diesel fuel usage on highways. The TEA-21 Donor-Donee Debate was resolved amicably with a 0.5% increase in the minimum guarantee percentage for donor states. Shifting revenues to the Highway Trust Fund in 1997 provided more funding for highways, easing donor state concerns. However, as TEA-21 neared expiration in FY2003, the donor-donee state issue resurfaced. The TEA-21 Act established a \"firewall\" around the highway account to prevent funds from being used for non-highway purposes. It also ensured that spending from the account matched the revenues annually. Changes impacted the availability of funds for the minimum guarantee program. An issue arose regarding a high rate of return percentage and broad program scope potentially limiting federal responses to needs. The debate around the program scope could impact federal responses to needs. Some federal programs are seen as inherently federal, while others lack consensus. One suggestion is for Congress to redefine scope to focus on programs serving clearly federal purposes. This would require consensus among Members of Congress from donor and donee states. The debate over the scope of federal programs could affect the distribution of federal funds. Earmarking of federal-aid highway funds has increased significantly, with almost 11% of funds in SAFETEA being earmarked. The issue of earmarking within and outside the scope of the EB has become a concern. The informal terms \"Below the Line\" and \"Above the Line\" emerged during the surface transportation reauthorization debate. Below the line refers to earmarks subject to provisions of the EB program, listed in SAFETEA section 1104 (a)(2). The only below the line earmark program in SAFETEA is the High Priority Project program (HPP), providing almost $15 billion. HPP earmarks allow Members of Congress to prioritize projects but do not add money to a state's total below the line funding. The Below the Line funding includes core formula funds and HPP funds, subject to the EB Program. States with fewer HPP earmarks receive larger distributions from the EB program, while states with more HPP earmarks receive smaller distributions. This results in a roughly equal total amount received by states under the line, regardless of their HPP funding levels. The distribution of HPP funds impacts the availability of funding for federal-aid highway core formula programs. Above the line programs in SAFETEA include earmarked programs like the National Corridor Infrastructure Improvement Program, Projects of National and Regional Significance, and Transportation Improvements. These programs do not directly affect the core formula programs' share of funding. The choice of programs and funding allocation, whether above or below the line, could be an issue during the reauthorization process. Penalties, like those for transferring Highway Bridge Program funds, are offset by Emergency Relief (EB) funds, ensuring that the lost funds are replenished."
