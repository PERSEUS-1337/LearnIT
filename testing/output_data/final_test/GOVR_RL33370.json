    "content": "The Andean Counterdrug Initiative aims to assist seven countries in the Andean region, including major drug-producing countries like Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. The program's objectives are to eliminate cocaine and opium production, strengthen law enforcement, and seize traffickers' assets. The region also includes oil-producing countries like Venezuela and Ecuador, which supply oil to the United States. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) supports Andean countries in combating drug production and trafficking. U.S. funding for ACI, managed by the State Department, totals about $5.7 billion from FY2000 to FY2007. Funds are used for eradication, interdiction, alternative crop development, and democratic institution building. Some funds are transferred to USAID for development programs. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI) focuses on alternative crop development, democratic institution building, and interdiction efforts. Programs train and support national police and military forces, provide communications and intelligence systems, and improve infrastructure for counternarcotics activities. Funds also support development programs in coca growing areas, assist internally displaced persons, promote the rule of law, and expand judicial capabilities. The Air Bridge Denial Program, operational in Colombia and temporarily suspended in Peru after a civilian aircraft was accidentally shot down in 2001, is also funded by ACI. The Air Bridge Denial Program, operational in Colombia and temporarily suspended in Peru after a civilian aircraft was accidentally shot down in 2001. The program supports aircraft fleet, pilot training, logistical and intelligence support, tracking and intercepting aircraft suspected of drug trafficking. The resumption of the program in Peru is pending safety enhancements. The Administration requested $721.5 million for FY2007 for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, including $65.7 million for a Critical Flight Safety Program to upgrade State Department aircraft. In FY2006, Congress appropriated $30 million for the Air Bridge Denial Program in Colombia, lower than the requested $40 million. Funding for the program was included in the Colombia allocation, with previous years seeing cuts in funding. The Administration proposed to fund the program from the Colombia allocation for FY2007, ensuring no reduction in funding for other Colombia programs. The Air Bridge Denial Program in Colombia received $30 million in FY2006, lower than the requested amount. Funding for the program was included in the Colombia allocation, with no reduction in funding for other programs. Additional funding for the Andean region is provided through the FMF and IMET programs. Recipients risk an aid cutoff if they haven't signed Article 98 agreements with the US, required by the American Services Members Protection Act of 2002. The President can waive the law if it's in the national interest. The President may waive the law if it is in the national interest. Colombia has signed an agreement, while other countries in Latin America could see their assistance withheld for not signing or ratifying such agreements. Counternarcotics funds are not affected. The Defense Department has a counternarcotics account for worldwide programs managed by the U.S. Army Southern Command. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) provides funding grants to foreign nations to purchase U.S. defense equipment and training to improve defense capabilities and strengthen military relationships. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) is provided to Colombia and the Andean region to support efforts to establish and strengthen national authority in remote areas used by guerrilla organizations, paramilitaries, and narcotics traffickers. Funding in FY2002 and FY2003 went towards protecting oil pipelines. The FY2006 estimate for the region is $90.1 million, with $89.1 million for Colombia. In FY2007, Congress provided $86.35 million, with $85.5 million for Colombia to support efforts against terrorism and narcotics trafficking. In FY2007, Congress provided $86.35 million for Colombia to combat terrorism and narcotics trafficking. The funds are allocated for interdiction boats, combat aircraft, training, infrastructure improvements, maintenance of military helicopters, intelligence sharing, and communications. The IMET program offers training to allied nations to enhance defense capabilities and promote democratic governance. Funding for the Andean region was estimated at $3.4 million. In FY2006, IMET funding for the Andean region was $3.4 million out of $13.4 million for all of Latin America. For FY2007, the request for the Andean countries was $2.56 million out of a total of $12.6 million. Colombia received $1.61 million in IMET funding. The Department of Defense has authority for counternarcotics programs worldwide, with up to $200 million allocated for Colombia in FY2005. For FY2006, DOD requested $896 million globally for counternarcotics programs, with $368 million estimated for Latin America and $122 million for Colombia. Activities include detection, monitoring, training, equipment, and intelligence sharing. FY2007 requested levels were similar, with Colombia receiving the largest portion of funds at $465 million for interdiction, eradication, alternative development, institution building, and rule of law programs. Interdiction funds would support Colombian military and police aviation programs, drug units, eradication and interdiction programs, and rule of law assistance. Assistance includes training, logistics support, equipment, and new base construction. Alternative development programs aim to introduce new licit crops, develop agribusiness and forestry activities, and create local and international markets for new products. Congress provided $465 million for FY2007, but allocation details are unclear. In FY2006, Congress allocated $469.5 million for Colombia, with $310.9 million for interdiction, $131.2 million for alternative development, and $27.4 million for rule of law programs. Colombia's challenging terrain facilitates drug cultivation, making it difficult for the government to exert control. The country also receives NADR funds to address arms trafficking. Colombia has a history of democracy but faces ongoing violence from guerrilla insurgency, drug trafficking, and paramilitaries. The main groups involved are FARC, ELN, and AUC, all designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the US. The AUC and Colombian military have been accused of collaborating against FARC and ELN. Peru, the second largest recipient of ACI funding, received $98.5 million in FY2007 for interdiction and alternative development. The funds aimed to improve Peruvian airlift operations, combat coca cultivation, and support demand reduction programs. Peru, a major cocaine producer, exports to various markets. The country has been successful in addressing drug-related issues. Peru has been successful in counternarcotics efforts with joint U.S.-Peru operations reducing coca production. However, resistance from indigenous communities persists due to cultural and economic reasons. Some regions have tried to decriminalize coca growing, which the government opposes. In FY2007, $66 million was approved for Bolivia, with funds allocated for interdiction and other programs. The requested amount for Bolivia would be divided between $35.0 million for interdiction and $31.0 million for alternative development and institution building. Interdiction funds would be used to eradicate illegal crops and disrupt trafficking operations, while alternative development would support licit crop production and establish justice centers in conflictive regions. U.S. relations with Bolivia have focused on controlling coca production for 20 years, with significant assistance provided for interdiction and alternative development. Growing public opposition in Bolivia to counternarcotics policy has fueled popular discontent and political instability. Critics believe U.S. support for forced drug crop eradication contributed to electoral support for left-of-center opposition figures like Evo Morales. Ecuador, the fourth largest recipient of ACI funds, received $17.3 million in FY2007 for interdiction and alternative development. The objective is to prevent drug trafficking and guerrilla activities from Colombia and stop the transit of drugs to the United States. Ecuador is highly exposed to drug trafficking and guerrilla activities from Colombia. Ecuador, neighboring Colombia, faces significant challenges with drug trafficking and guerrilla activities. Despite cooperation with the United States, weak institutions and corruption hinder counterdrug efforts. A 10-year agreement with the US established a forward operating location in Manta for aerial counterdrug operations. Brazil received $4 million for interdiction and law enforcement activities in its Amazon region. Brazil's Amazon region serves as a conduit for drug trafficking from Colombia to Europe and the US. To combat this, Brazil has implemented the Amazon Vigilance System (SIVAM) with a military base at Tabatinga. The country is also experiencing an increase in crack cocaine and heroin abuse. In 2000, Brazil launched COBRA, a border security program with air force and navy support to combat drug crime from Colombia. The program expanded to northern borders with Peru, Venezuela, and Bolivia in 2003, focusing on controlling land and air entry into Brazil from Tabatinga. Despite tensions, there is cooperation with the U.S. DEA for counternarcotics efforts in Venezuela, a major transit route for drugs to the United States. President Bush designated Venezuela for drug control certification in 2005. In 2005, Venezuela was designated as one of two countries failing to adhere to international narcotics agreements. Despite an increase in drug seizures, Venezuela has not addressed the use of its territory for drug transportation to the United States. This decision followed Venezuela's suspension of cooperation with the DEA in August 2005. Panama's geographic location makes it a major transit route for illicit drugs, with drug traffickers using various means to move drugs through the country. While security in the Darien region has improved, smuggling of weapons and drugs across the border continues. Panama cooperates well with the United States on counternarcotics efforts, but its fiscal situation hinders law enforcement abilities. The Department of State emphasizes the importance of U.S. assistance in enhancing Panamanian law enforcement due to the country's fiscal constraints. Congress has imposed conditions on assistance to Colombia for counternarcotics programs through various funding legislation, including the FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act maintains support for counternarcotics efforts in Colombia, focusing on alternative development and judicial reform. The cap on U.S. military and civilian contractors in Colombia was raised from 400 to 800 under the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act increased the cap on military personnel and civilian contractors in Colombia. The cap does not apply to foreign national contract employees or personnel at the U.S. embassy. The Act also requires a report from the Secretary of State before funds can be obligated for programs funded by ACI. Additionally, 75% of assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces can be obligated without a determination. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act increased the cap on military personnel and civilian contractors in Colombia. The Act also requires a report from the Secretary of State before funds can be obligated for programs funded by ACI. 75% of assistance to the Colombian Armed Forces can be obligated without a determination, while the remaining 25% requires certification from the Secretary of State regarding human rights and ties with paramilitary groups. The Colombian Armed Forces have made progress in cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities, severing links to paramilitary organizations, and dismantling paramilitary leadership and financial networks. The government is also ensuring the protection of land and property rights of indigenous communities. Certification from the Secretary of State is required to continue funding programs, with ongoing consultations every 90 days. The Secretary of State consults with human rights organizations every 90 days to assess progress in meeting conditions. Visas are denied to those who support guerrilla or paramilitary groups or commit human rights violations in Colombia. Exceptions can be made for peace efforts or humanitarian reasons. The Leahy amendment prohibits funding to security forces with evidence of human rights abuses. The Secretary of State must certify that foreign governments are addressing human rights violations to continue funding. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act sets conditions for the procurement of chemicals for aerial fumigation, including EPA compliance and fair compensation for harm caused. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act continues the prohibition on U.S. military personnel or U.S. civilian contractors participating in combat operations in Colombia. This provision has been in place since the original Plan Colombia law in 2000. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires the Secretary of State to certify that the Bolivian military is respecting human rights and cooperating with civilian judicial authorities in investigating and prosecuting military personnel involved in human rights violations before providing ACI funds. House and Senate versions of the bill differ on human rights and seizure of natural gas fields. The Act also allows funds for demobilization and disarmament of former members of foreign terrorist organizations in Colombia if certain conditions are met. The Colombian government is cooperating with the United States in extraditing FTO leaders indicted for various crimes. They are implementing a framework to dismantle FTO structures and funds will be used for activities like verification, reintegration, asset recovery for victims, and investigations. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative, FMF, and IMET are funded in the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill. The 109th Congress did not complete work on several appropriation bills. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 20 / P.L. 109-289, as amended by P.L. 110-5) was passed on February 15, 2007, setting funding for ACI at $721.5 million, equal to the President's request. Changes proposed by Congress were not maintained in the final version due to retention of many programs from the FY2006 spending bill. The House Appropriations Committee made significant changes to foreign aid to Colombia in the FY2007 spending bill. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution set funding for Colombia at $545.2 million, with changes in funding sources and the creation of a new Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund. Funding for alternative development and institution building was shifted to Economic Support Funds, while International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement funds were allocated for rule of law programs. Drug interdiction programs were maintained at $313.9 million. The Subcommittee maintained $545.2 million in funding for Colombia in the FY2007 Continuing Resolution. Changes included funds from non-ACI accounts to treat Colombia as a strategic partner. $70.2 million was allocated for the Critical Flight Safety Program in Colombia, $10.5 million more than requested. Peru received $46 million for alternative development and $63 million for interdiction programs, while Bolivia saw a $15 million cut in interdiction funding due to reports of decreased drug-fighting commitment. Funding for Brazil, Ecuador, and Panama remained unchanged. The Subcommittee allocated $522 million for trade assistance programs, creating a new Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund and position at USAID. $62.5 million of ACI funds were transferred to the new account. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $699.4 million for ACI, with a decrease of $22 million, transferring $9.8 million to a Democracy Fund. The House and Senate bills maintained reporting requirements from previous appropriations bills. An amendment added $26.3 million for drug interdiction aircraft in Colombia, which passed both chambers and was signed into law. Congress included provisions in the FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act relating to DOD's role in counter-narcotics and Colombia. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act re-authorized DOD's support for counterdrug activities in Colombia, including funding the ACI at $734.5 million. Both House and Senate versions included conditions on assistance, such as human rights requirements and a prohibition on combat. The legislation also authorized a unified counterdrug and counterterrorism campaign in Colombia. The FY2007 National Defense Authorization Act re-authorized DOD's support for counterdrug activities in Colombia, funding the ACI at $734.5 million. The final agreement allocated the funds differently than the House or Senate bills, with provisions for demobilization and $20 million for assisting Colombia with paramilitary groups. The conference report adjusted the human rights certification process, expecting the Secretary of State to consider the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Committees on Appropriations. The House International Relations Committee reported H.R. 2601, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, with a provision making U.S. assistance to Colombia contingent on a certification from the Secretary of State regarding demobilization efforts and cooperation on extradition requests. The bill also calls for a report on tax code enforcement in Colombia. The House approved a Burton amendment authorizing the transfer of marine patrol aircraft to the Colombian Navy for interdiction purposes. The bill passed the House on July 20, 2005. The bill authorizes funding for ACI and includes conditions on assistance consistent with current law, authorizing a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorist activities. It maintains the cap on military and civilian personnel in Colombia, prohibits U.S. personnel from combat operations, and maintains reporting requirements on human rights. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $901.7 million for global drug interdiction activities. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $901.7 million for DOD-wide global drug interdiction activities, excluding provisions related to Colombia or the Andean Counterdrug Initiative."
