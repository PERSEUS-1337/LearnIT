    "content": "The Republic of Cyprus gained independence from Great Britain in 1960 with a population of 77% Greek and 18% Turkish ethnic origin. The constitution established power-sharing arrangements between the two main Cypriot groups, with a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice president. Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance were signed by Britain, Greece, and Turkey to ensure the republic's territorial integrity and defense. The two communities had different aspirations for Cyprus's future, with most Greek Cypriots favoring union. After gaining independence in 1960, Cyprus faced differing aspirations between Greek Cypriots favoring union with Greece and Turkish Cypriots preferring partition. Tensions escalated in 1963 when constitutional changes favored Greek Cypriots, leading to Turkish Cypriots withdrawing from national institutions and violence escalating. Outside mediation, including by the United States, aimed to prevent further conflict. In 1964, the United Nations authorized the establishment of UNFICYP to control violence and act as a buffer between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Turkey intervened militarily in 1974, citing the Treaty of Guarantee, leading to the physical separation of the island. After the conflict in Cyprus in 1974, Turkish Cypriots pursued a solution to keep the two communities separate in two states under a confederation or a stronger central federal government. In 1983, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash declared the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), seen as a unilateral declaration of independence. Denktash argued that an independent state was necessary before a federation with Greek Cypriots could be considered. Negotiations between Turkish and Greek Cypriots from 1974 to 2002 focused on achieving a settlement but foundered on differing goals and implementation of a federal solution. Turkish Cypriots emphasized bizonality and political equality, while Greek Cypriots prioritized freedoms of movement and settlement throughout the island. They also disagreed on the means of achieving a federation. The Turkish Cypriots wanted power devolved to them to rejoin a Cypriot republic in a new federation. Differences in views affected property claims, citizenship, and legal issues, continuing to plague negotiations. The Annan Plan proposed a \"common state\" government for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus Problem. The Annan Plan aimed to establish a new federation in Cyprus with two politically equal component states. Negotiations ensued for 16 months, with key leaders being replaced by more pro-settlement figures. The plan was revised multiple times to address controversial issues, while the Republic of Cyprus signed an EU accession treaty in 2003. After negotiations and revisions, the Annan Plan was put to referenda in both north and south Cyprus on April 24, 2004. Greek Cypriot President Papadopoulos urged rejection, leading to 76% of Greek Cypriot voters rejecting the plan, while 65% of Turkish Cypriot voters supported it. Following the rejection of the Annan Plan by 76% of Greek Cypriot voters and its acceptance by 65% of Turkish Cypriot voters in 2004, efforts were made to resolve the Cyprus problem through a bicommunal, bizonal federation. Talat, as the Turkish Cypriot \"prime minister,\" played a key role in convincing Turkish Cypriots to support the plan. He was later elected as the \"president\" of the unrecognized TRNC in 2005. Demetris Christofias of the Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL) was elected president of the Republic of Cyprus in 2008, with the backing of the Democratic (DIKO) Party and the Socialist (EDEK) Party. He was educated in the Soviet Union, fluent in Russian, and had a long history with the AKEL party. Demetris Christofias, elected president of Cyprus in 2008, campaigned against the uncompromising approach towards Turkish Cypriots and aimed for a just settlement of the Cyprus problem. He sought to restore unity on the island as a federal, bizonal, bicommunal republic, excluding military intervention and aiming for the withdrawal of Turkish troops. Demetris Christofias, elected president of Cyprus in 2008, aimed for a just settlement of the Cyprus problem by seeking unity on the island as a federal, bizonal, bicommunal republic. He opposed the 2004 Annan Plan and emphasized the demilitarization of the island. Negotiations with Turkish Cypriot leader Talat initially showed promise but quickly stalled due to differences in positions regarding the old Annan Plan. As negotiations between Greek Cypriot leader Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Talat continued into 2009, impatience and frustration grew. By the end of the year, Greek Cypriots feared talks wouldn't yield results before the 2010 elections in the north, potentially leading to new negotiations with a different Turkish Cypriot leader. This caused hesitation in offering further concessions. Negotiations between Greek Cypriot leader Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Talat faced challenges as the window for a final settlement seemed to be closing fast in 2010. Despite 18 months of talks and close to 60 meetings, little progress had been made. Christofias hinted at some progress in his New Year message to Greek Cypriots. Negotiations between Greek Cypriot leader Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Talat faced challenges in 2010, with little progress made despite close to 60 meetings. Christofias suggested some progress in a message to Greek Cypriots, but talks seemed to reach a standstill with insurmountable differences. The last formal negotiating session concluded on March 30, 2010, with no new developments. Speculation arose about a joint statement assessing negotiations and potential convergences between the two leaders. Negotiations between Greek Cypriot leader Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Talat faced challenges in 2010. Despite close to 60 meetings, little progress was made. Christofias and Talat issued a short statement on March 30, 2010, suggesting progress in governance, power sharing, EU matters, and the economy. Talat held a press conference on April 1 to outline their achievements, but Christofias neither confirmed nor denied them. Talat lost his reelection bid on April 18 to Dervis Eroglu. Talat lost his reelection bid to Dervis Eroglu of the UBP due to his failure to secure a settlement of the Cyprus problem and inability to end economic isolation. Mainland Turks settled in the north supported Eroglu for his views aligned with theirs. Eroglu, a 72-year-old physician, won with over 50% of the vote and had a combative style similar to Rauf Denktash. Dervis Eroglu, the new president of TRNC, advocated for more autonomy for each community and suggested a \"soft divorce\" for Cyprus. He criticized Talat for making too many concessions to the Greek Cypriot side but expressed willingness to continue negotiations under his presidency. Eroglu wrote to the U.N. Secretary-General to resume negotiations where Talat and Christofias had left off. President Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Eroglu held their first formal negotiating session under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary-General's special adviser on Cyprus. A controversy arose when U.N. Secretary-General Ban's statement congratulating the parties for resuming talks from where they left off was read. After resuming talks, there was controversy over the interpretation of convergences reached by Christofias and Talat, with Greek Cypriot parties criticizing the U.N.'s stance. Eroglu clarified that Turkish Cypriots would not be bound by the U.N. Secretary-General's statement, causing concerns about the negotiation basis. In May 2010, negotiations between Christofias and Eroglu showed no progress. Eroglu expressed frustration with Greek Cypriots and emphasized the need for a solution involving pain on both sides. However, he was not willing to give up Northern Cyprus or its flag. In October 2010, Eroglu's frustration was evident in Turkish press reports. In October 2010, Turkish press reported Eroglu's frustration with the negotiations, suggesting Turkish Cypriots no longer believed in a mutually agreeable settlement. Christofias also expressed concerns to the U.N. Secretary-General about the lack of progress and Turkey's readiness to solve the Cyprus problem. Talks continued through December, but were suspended as Eroglu dealt with medical issues. Both sides pledged to seek a solution, but progress and compromises were uncertain. On January 1, 2011, Christofias expressed disappointment over the lack of progress in Cyprus settlement talks and accused Turkey of not making efforts. The Republic of Cyprus had parliamentary elections in mid-April 2011, with no significant changes in the negotiating position. The impact of the elections complicated the negotiations, while Cyprus was not a major issue in Turkey's national elections in June. After the 2011 elections in Cyprus, speculation arose that Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan might inject new energy into Cyprus negotiations to aid Turkey's EU accession talks. However, this was later deemed a misreading of his intentions. Throughout the year, negotiations between Christofias and Eroglu continued without progress, despite efforts by the UN Secretary-General. Plans were made for a meeting on October 30 to assess progress, with the possibility of an international conference to discuss security issues and referenda for a final solution in both north and south Cyprus. By the end of 2011, negotiations for a final solution in Cyprus had lost urgency, making it impractical to reach a settlement by October. Pessimism grew as the Republic of Cyprus prepared for its EU presidency, with doubts about achieving a breakthrough by early 2012. Talks were at risk of stalling further, potentially leading to a dramatic turn of events by the summer. Doubts about a solution acceptable to both sides were raised with a public opinion poll showing growing negative sentiment and public discontent on the island. Turkish Cypriots showed increased ambivalence, while Greek Cypriots leaned towards a no vote for reunification. Both sides needed to engage in a public discussion on negotiation parameters and implement confidence-building measures. Ban urged significant offers in governance, economy, and EU affairs for the upcoming meeting in New York. The \"Greentree 2\" meeting aimed to address key issues in governance, economy, and EU affairs to facilitate a final deal for a U.N. international conference. However, Christofias and Eroglu were hesitant to make necessary concessions on property rights, security, territory, settlers in the north, and citizenship. The lack of progress led to doubts about the meeting's success, with some suggesting its cancellation. The Greentree 2 meeting concluded without a new agreement to end the stalemate, leading Ban to wait for a progress report before deciding on an international conference. Christofias and Eroglu resumed negotiations, but breaking the stalemate seemed unlikely, delaying any potential agreement until after the EU presidency in 2012 or even until February 2013. In April 2012, the Turkish Cypriot side suggested ending U.N.-sponsored talks when the republic assumed the EU presidency in July. President Christofias believed talks could continue during the EU presidency, but U.N. special envoy Alexander Downer announced no international conference on Cyprus due to lack of agreement on core issues. The U.N. suspended talks on Cyprus in mid-2012 due to disagreements on core issues. Christofias wanted to focus on the EU presidency without divisive debates. Eroglu's refusal to meet directly with Christofias during the presidency also contributed to the suspension. The fiscal and budget crisis in Cyprus, stemming from the Eurozone crisis, led to the end of negotiations between Christofias and Eroglu. Christofias announced he would not seek reelection in 2013 due to the lack of progress in resolving the Cyprus problem. U.N.-sponsored talks were formally suspended in May 2012. The U.N.-sponsored talks between Christofias and Eroglu reached a stalemate and were formally suspended in May 2012. Both sides did not strongly object to the decision, with blame for the lack of progress on an agreement being placed on each other. The reaction to the talks being downgraded was muted among political leaders and the general public in both communities. Kudret Ozersay resigned as chief adviser to Eroglu, signaling a slowdown in negotiations, but was replaced by Osman Ertu\u011f. In January 2013, Nicos Anastasiades emerged as the leader in early public opinion polls for the Republic of Cyprus national elections. During the Republic of Cyprus national elections, Anastasiades faced a runoff against Malas from the AKEL party. The campaign focused on the fiscal crisis rather than concrete proposals for negotiations with the Turkish Cypriots. Anastasiades, who supported the 2004 Annan Plan, was cautious about revealing his intentions to avoid conflict with his allies who opposed the plan. Anastasiades, after being sworn in as president, suggested that future talks should be based on past agreements from 1977, 1979, and 2006. He plans to appoint a representative for negotiations with Turkish Cypriots but has not set a clear timetable. Omirou called for a new national policy to address the Cyprus problem as invasion, occupation, and violation of international law. Omirou proposed a new national policy to address the Cyprus problem as invasion, occupation, and violation of international law, aiming to use Cyprus's EU membership and Turkey's EU prospects to pressure Ankara to end the island's occupation and accept a solution in line with international and European law. Turkish Cypriots were cautious about the negotiating partner for future talks, whether it would be Anastasiades or a different negotiator critical of previous government positions. The Turkish Cypriots set a new standard for resuming talks, with Eroglu emphasizing the need for a \"new dynamic\" and \"new negotiating table.\" Anastasiades faced domestic banking and fiscal crises while pressured to restart settlement talks by Turkish leaders. However, Turkish Cypriots did not propose significant compromises, prompting Anastasiades to resist being forced into negotiations. Anastasiades resisted being pressured into negotiations due to economic turmoil, focusing on addressing the government's fiscal crisis first. Foreign Minister Kasoulides assured interest in resuming talks but emphasized the need to handle the economic crisis before committing to a definitive timetable. The idea of returning the abandoned town of Varosha as a confidence-building measure was floated. The Turkish Cypriots rejected the return of Verosha and emphasized the existence of two separate coequal states on the island. Ankara suggested a two-state option if talks could not produce a solution in a timely manner. Eroglu stated that \"the Cyprus problem\" persists. In December 2012, Eroglu acknowledged the existence of two separate people with different languages, religions, and states on the island, stating that the Cyprus problem cannot be solved under existing conditions. In May 2013, Anastasiades and Eroglu met, with talks delayed until October 2013. In July, the Greek Cypriot National Council took over negotiations from the president. In 2013, negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots stalled over the language of a proposed joint statement outlining negotiating goals. Ambassador Andreas Mavroyiannis was appointed as the Greek Cypriot negotiator, signaling a potential restart of formal negotiations. Negotiations between Mavroyiannis and Osman Ertu\u011f took almost six months to conclude, with an agreement on the language of a \"joint declaration\" reached in February 2014 after US intervention. The Declaration now serves as the basis for current negotiations on the Cyprus question. Anastasiades faced a political price for the agreement, with the leader of the government's coalition partner, DIKO, expressing concerns. Anastasiades faced political backlash from DIKO leader Papadopoulos for his handling of negotiations, leading to DIKO's departure from the government. Concerns arose over potential concessions to Turkish Cypriots, prompting speculation about autonomy. Ertu\u011f resigned as negotiator but remained Ero\u011flu's spokesperson, complicating the situation further. The Turkish Cypriots reappointed negotiator Kudret Ozersay, known for seeking accommodation, for talks with Mavroyiannis. Negotiations resumed with Anastasiades and Eroglu meeting periodically. Uncertainty surrounded the starting point for negotiations, with both sides not bound by past agreements. The February joint statement hinted at accepting some previous agreements, but disagreements over the statement language indicated challenges in reaching a final solution in 2014. In 2014, negotiations between Anastasiades and Eroglu continued, with a proposed roadmap for a settlement rejected by Anastasiades. Greek Cypriots presented a 17-point plan addressing their positions on the issue. Pessimism grew around the stalemate, leading to suggestions of a possible permanent separation of the two sides. The Greek Cypriots presented a 17-point plan for a future agreement, while the Turkish Cypriots submitted a 15-point counterproposal, both of which were rejected. Disagreements and reported backtracking led to a lack of progress in the negotiations, with tensions rising between the two sides. The United Nations appointed Espen Barth Eide as the new special envoy for the Secretary-General. The United Nations appointed Norwegian diplomat Espen Barth Eide as the Secretary-General's new special adviser on Cyprus. Talks hosted by Eide resumed in September, but tensions rose when Turkey moved its seismic exploration vessel into the Republic of Cyprus's exclusive economic zone, causing concerns over energy resources in the Eastern Mediterranean. In 2015, President Anastasiades withdrew from settlement negotiations with Turkish Cypriots due to Turkey's presence in Cyprus's EEZ. The seismic ship moved to Famagusta, but tensions remained over energy resources. Greek Cypriots viewed energy as a federal-level issue, while Turkish Cypriots demanded inclusion in discussions. In late October 2014, Turkish Cypriot negotiator Ozersay was replaced by Ergun Olgun as negotiations were suspended. The talks remained on hold in early 2015, with Anastasiades insisting on Turkey withdrawing its seismic ship and halting threats to energy exploration off Cyprus's southern coast. In April 2015, Turkey removed its seismic vessel from Cyprus and did not renew the NAVTEX. Negotiations were put on hold until after the national elections in the north, where Mustafa Akinci emerged as the runner up to Dervis Ergolu in the first round of voting. In the second round of voting on April 26, Mustafa Akinci of the Communal Democratic Party won the election to become the new leader of the Turkish Cypriots, defeating Eroglu with 60% of the votes. Akinci immediately announced that negotiations would resume in May with the aim of concluding a settlement agreement by the end of 2015. Anastasiades also expressed eagerness to restart negotiations. Akinci, who leads a small political party, was initially criticized for his inexperience but was seen as unencumbered by preconditions for the talks or settlement. Mustafa Akinci won the election to become the new leader of the Turkish Cypriots, with negotiations set to resume in May for a settlement agreement by the end of 2015. Akinci quickly named Ozdil Nami as the new negotiator and held a formal negotiating session with Anastasiades on May 17, 2015. They also walked together down Ledra Street in a show of solidarity and hope. Mustafa Akinci, the new leader of the Turkish Cypriots, walked down Ledra Street in solidarity with Anastasiades, the president of the republic, marking a significant moment in the peace negotiations. Akinci's more flexible approach was met with positive but cautious reactions from some Greek Cypriots, who were relieved to see a shift from Eroglu's hard-line stance. There were hopes that Akinci's willingness to compromise could lead to progress in the negotiations, although uncertainties remained about the sources of his support for a final deal. Akinci's support for a final deal was uncertain, with questions about his ability to compromise. Despite not being favored by Ankara, Akinci's victory surprised Turkey. He emphasized the need for a brotherly relationship between Turkey and Turkish Cyprus. Akinci's victory surprised Turkey as he emphasized a brotherly relationship between Turkey and Turkish Cyprus. However, his lack of experience in active politics and his team's unfamiliarity with the Cyprus problem raised concerns about the negotiations. If a deal favored the Greek Cypriots, it could risk the fundamental demands of the Turkish Cypriots, potentially derailing the process. In August 2015, Emine Colak, the former Turkish Cypriot \"foreign minister,\" mentioned that Turkey was not interfering in the peace talks, allowing the Turkish Cypriots to negotiate independently. This hands-off approach by Turkey contributed to a positive atmosphere in the talks, leading to some progress. New confidence-building measures were implemented, such as opening a new border crossing at Deryneia and restoring electricity connections between the two sides after 40 years. The issue of returning Verosha to the Greek Cypriots was endorsed by Anastasiades but deferred by Akinci. Despite positive atmosphere in peace talks, Greek Cypriot opposition expressed concerns about bizonal, bicommunal federation and Turkey's security role. Akinci outlined his \"wish list\" in late December 2015, drawing negative reactions from Greek Cypriot leaders. Several Greek Cypriot political leaders reacted negatively to Akinci's remarks, indicating underlying trouble in the peace talks. Former House Speaker Yiannakis Omirou criticized Akinci for supporting Turkey's intentions from the 1974 invasion, insisting on political equality and a rotating presidency. This raised concerns among the opposition, warning Anastasiades to reconsider his stance on these issues. In early 2016, internal disputes in the north complicated the negotiation process further. The collapse of the \"friendly-to-Akinci\" government coalition led to the formation of a new, more conservative Turkish Cypriot government under Prime Minister Huseyin Ozgurgun. Ozgurgun's support for negotiations wavered, and he emphasized the importance of Turkish security guarantees. Deputy Prime Minister Serdar Denktash, known for his hard-line stance, also played a role in the government. Some believed that if no agreement was reached by the end of 2016, a referendum should be held. In 2016, influential figures in the Turkish Cypriot government, including Foreign Minister Tashsin Ertugruloglu, posed challenges to President Akinci's negotiations for a tentative agreement. In the south, elections saw the entry of a nationalist/populist party, ELAM, into the Greek Cypriot House of Representatives. In 2016, ELAM, a nationalist/populist party, entered the Greek Cypriot House of Representatives. Despite internal political developments, negotiations between both sides continued positively, with support from world capitals indicating progress towards a settlement. Negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots showed optimism, with leaders aiming for a quick settlement. However, past deadlines were missed, raising doubts despite progress towards a resolution. In 2016, negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots aimed for a settlement by the end of the year, with hopes of holding referenda in both communities by spring 2017. Negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots accelerated in late August and early September 2016, aiming to make progress on basic issues before the U.N. General Assembly meeting in mid-September. The goal was to convene a five-party conference in December to discuss security guarantees. Despite no announcement at the U.N. meeting, the leaders agreed to further sessions in October and November to address territory and move towards a multiparty conference on security guarantees. Negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots accelerated in late August and early September 2016 to address territory and security guarantees. Progress was made on economic affairs, EU affairs, citizenship, and governance structures. Despite differences on rotating presidency and security guarantees, both sides agreed to travel to Mont Pelerin, Switzerland, to discuss territory and hold a five-party conference on security guarantees. Progress was reported on new boundaries for constituent states during the talks in Mont Pelerin. The talks in Mont Pelerin focused on territorial adjustments, with disagreement over the number of displaced persons to be allowed to return to new territories. Greek Cypriots wanted 90,000 to return under their administration, while Turkish Cypriots suggested 65,000. Akinci proposed discussing security guarantees before finalizing territorial changes, but Anastasiades rejected this, stating the talks were meant for territorial adjustments only. An agreement on territorial adjustment was sought, with discussions on security issues to follow. Meetings were suspended for a week as both sides consulted with advisers. When talks resumed, no agreement was reached as Turkish Cypriots insisted on a five-party conference for security guarantees, while Greek Cypriots refused to set a date for the conference. Talks ended, and both sides returned to Cyprus to reflect on negotiations. Cypriots wanted talks to resume where Mont Pelerin discussions on territory ended, with the presentation of maps defining new boundaries. Turkish Cypriots insisted on a formal date for a five-party conference on territory and guarantees. Anastasiades and Akinci agreed to meet in December 2016 and early January 2017 to bridge gaps and resolve disagreements. They set a timetable for additional meetings, with a plan to discuss pending issues in Geneva on January 9, 2017. On January 11, 2017, both sides would present proposed maps for territorial adjustment, followed by a five-party conference on January 12, 2017, to discuss territory and security guarantees. Anastasiades and Akinci aimed for a final agreement, instructing negotiators to meet regularly until negotiations resumed in Geneva on January 9, 2017. Anastasiades's decision to resume talks after the missed opportunity at Mont Pelerin was met with controversy. On January 9, 2017, Anastasiades and Akinci, along with their negotiating teams and EU representation, met in Geneva to begin the final phase of negotiations. The leaders of DIKO, EDEK, the Citizens Alliance, and the Greens criticized Anastasiades for accepting an international conference on guarantees before resolving other issues as promised. Turkey's presence at the negotiating table was seen as a historic development, with some questioning Ankara's motives. Turkey's agreement to attend the Geneva conference raised questions about its intentions, especially as it navigated domestic issues and international negotiations. Some viewed Ankara's presence as a strategic move to reinforce demands and prove its commitment to seeking a fair solution, while others speculated about potential weaknesses in its stance on security concessions. Turkey's apparent opposition to territorial concessions by Akinci complicated negotiations at a critical time in Geneva. Ankara's strategy may have been to stall negotiations and pressure Greek Cypriots to compromise on Turkish troops and guarantees. The meetings started positively with progress on a rotating presidency and discussions on a \"United Federal Cyprus.\" On January 11, 2017, negotiations between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots hit a roadblock when proposed territorial maps showed significant differences. The Greek Cypriot map included the return of Morphou, which the Turkish Cypriot map did not accept. Further complications arose on January 12, 2017, during five-party negotiations, with Ankara rejecting Greek Cypriot territorial demands and insisting on maintaining Turkey's security role in the north, while Greece pushed for an end to Turkey's security role. The Geneva talks ended with unresolved security issues and political equity concerns, leading to Turkey's departure. Despite the disappointment, Anastasiades and Akinci continued to push for progress. The leaders established a working group to address differences and prepare for future meetings in early 2017. Despite positive discussions, Anastasiades and Akinci still faced barriers to reaching a final agreement. Concerns arose over the involvement of Greece and Turkey in the negotiations, and political opposition to the leaders' positions began to grow. The negotiating positions of Anastasiades and Akinci faced opposition and challenges in reaching a final agreement. Concerns were raised about the Turkish military presence in the north and right of intervention. Both leaders faced criticism from their respective political parties, with objections to the presented maps. Despite efforts to make progress in Mont Pelerin and Geneva, a final solution remained elusive. The inability to make progress on territorial adjustments and security guarantees at Mont Pelerin and Geneva highlighted the challenges in reaching an agreement. Turkey's introduction of the four freedoms issue may have been a tactic to delay negotiations. Despite this, talks resumed on January 27, 2017, with a focus on the four freedoms and the possibility of a second Geneva conference. Both sides remained hopeful that negotiations could continue after a period of reflection. Anastasiades refused to discuss the four freedoms issue, insisting that only the EU could decide after an agreement was reached. Akinci suggested a new Geneva conference by March 2017, but negotiations stalled on February 13 when the Greek Cypriot parliament approved a proposal for an annual event marking the 1950 referendum on enosis. Akinci was upset with Anastasiades's stance. Akinci was angered by the Greek Cypriot parliament's approval of a proposal for an annual event commemorating the 1950 referendum on enosis. He demanded that Anastasiades retract the resolution, leading to a heated debate during their meeting. Anastasiades tried to downplay the significance of the legislation, resulting in Akinci leaving the meeting abruptly. Both sides blamed each other for the walkout. Over the following eight weeks, no meetings took place between Anastasiades and Akinci despite efforts to restart talks. Akinci refused to return to negotiations until the enosis issue was addressed. Anastasiades expressed hope for a resumption of talks but did not expect it before the April referendum in Turkey. Both sides continued to blame each other for the breakdown in negotiations, with Akinci possibly stalling on behalf of Turkey. After eight weeks of suspended negotiations, the Greek Cypriot parliament partially reversed the enosis requirement, leading to a resumption of talks between Akinci and Anastasiades. Both sides agreed to schedule additional meetings in May and discussed the possibility of a new conference on Cyprus in Geneva. The Greek Cypriot parliament partially reversed the enosis requirement, leading to talks between Akinci and Anastasiades. Discussions on a new conference in Geneva for Cyprus included disagreements over conditions and issues to be addressed. Turkish Cypriots wanted all outstanding issues tackled simultaneously, while Greek Cypriots proposed negotiations on territory and security guarantees first at a potential Geneva II conference. Both sides agreed to continue negotiations until all issues were resolved or until a solution was deemed impossible. U.N. Secretary-General Guterres invited Anastasiades and Akinci to New York for a dinner discussion on a second U.N.-hosted session in Geneva. Both sides agreed to a new conference starting on June 28 at Crans Montana to finalize an agreement on security guarantees and territory. U.N. Special Adviser Eide would prepare a document for discussions on security and guarantees. Anastasiades then traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with Vice President Pence and seek U.S. support for the upcoming conference. Anastasiades proposed creating an international police force to provide security guarantees for Turkish Cypriots until a final agreement is implemented. Suggestions included Greek, Turkish, or UK forces, or Turkish military police under the command of a third party like the U.N., U.S., or NATO. Following the announcement of a new conference in Crans Montana, U.N. Special Adviser Eide contacted officials of Greece, Turkey, the UK, and the two Cypriot parties to gather their positions on security guarantees and troop levels. Eide planned to discuss his findings with Anastasiades and Akinci, exploring potential compromises. He aimed to present a working roadmap for negotiations at Geneva, considering options like a multinational security force. Domestic issues would also be addressed, with observers relieved at the progress made by both sides and the guarantor parties. Negotiations at Crans Montana were set to resume with both sides and the guarantor parties, especially Turkey, showing willingness. However, skepticism remained regarding progress due to unchanged positions on security guarantees and troops. Anastasiades aimed to eliminate Turkish security guarantees and troops first, while Akinci sought concessions on political equality and a rotating presidency to be a coequal partner in Cyprus's future. Anastasiades faced criticism for potentially delegating the security issue to the U.N. and giving up Cypriot ownership of the negotiation process, which some felt favored Turkey. Controversy arose over the security-related \"roadmap\" prepared by U.N. Special Adviser Eide, with Anastasiades objecting to certain provisions. Anastasiades objected to certain provisions in a report, leading to the abandonment of the discussion paper. The Crans Montana conference opened with both sides presenting their positions on security and domestic issues. Talks quickly became deadlocked over security, prompting U.N. Secretary-General Guterres to issue a \"non-paper\" with six points for resolution. Both sides presented counterproposals on July 3, 2017, with Turkey offering to retain security guarantees but withdraw most military forces. Greek Cypriots demanded the abolition of the Treaty of Guarantee and immediate withdrawal of Turkish forces, with a provision for a small contingent of Greek and Turkish forces to be deployed initially, subject to a clear sunset date. After several days of talks, little movement was achieved between Turkey and Greek Cypriots on July 3-7, 2017. Turkey insisted on a larger permanent force, while Greek Cypriots withdrew their proposal for a limited contingency force. Disagreements also arose on governance issues such as the rotating presidency and property rights. U.N. Secretary-General Guterres acknowledged the negotiations' failure to reach an agreement on July 7, 2017. Secretary-General Guterres acknowledged the failure of negotiations and announced the closure of the conference. He proposed a \"framework\" with six points for discussion, including the need for a new security system in Cyprus and a reduction in troops according to the old Treaty of Alliance. The Turkish Cypriot side was urged to adjust the territory map. On September 28, 2017, Secretary-General Guterres issued a report outlining a framework for further discussions on the Cyprus negotiations. The framework addresses concerns on territory adjustment, equitable quotas for Turkish nationals, property rights, power sharing, and the rotating presidency. Guterres noted positive progress in convergences on the six negotiating chapters. Secretary-General Guterres noted positive progress in convergences on the six negotiating chapters for Cyprus negotiations. However, only the economic chapter may have been ready to be closed, while the others still had issues to be worked out. Guterres emphasized the need for strong political will, courage, determination, mutual trust, and readiness to take risks for successful negotiations. Despite a missed historic opportunity, the U.N. remains available to host future discussions when both sides are ready. Both Cypriot sides blamed each other for refusing to make concessions, with the Greek Cypriots and Greece also placing blame on Ankara. President Anastasiades indicated dissatisfaction with the outcome. President Anastasiades expressed readiness to resume negotiations, while Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu hinted at a shift away from the U.N. framework for a solution to the Cyprus problem. Turkish Cypriot government officials also suggested negotiations under the current U.N. structure were over, with Akinci proposing the possibility of two separate states coexisting in the EU. In a meeting in Washington, Turkish Cypriot \"foreign minister\" Tashsin Ertugruloglu proposed a new approach for future negotiations, advocating for two separate states and a confederation solution. He suggested the Turkish Cypriots could have an autonomous republic with Turkey handling foreign affairs and defense. This idea faced opposition in Cyprus, leading to a suspension of negotiations in 2017. The 2017 introduction of a controversial proposal in the Greek Cypriot parliament posed a challenge to Anastasiades and the negotiations. During the election campaign, negative views about the negotiation framework were expressed by several Greek Cypriot presidential candidates. Many in the north began to feel that the election campaign would leave Anastasiades little room to maneuver. Anastasiades was reelected president after a second round of voting. Turkish Cypriots, including Akinci, did not anticipate much change in Anastasiades' negotiation positions. Akinci demanded a deadline and changes to U.N. parameters for talks to resume, emphasizing political equality. The bizonal, bicommunal approach was still seen as valid, but it was unclear if a new framework was needed for a federal solution. After the elections, a new coalition government was formed in the north, potentially more supportive of renegotiating a solution with Anastasiades. The government included former Turkish Cypriot negotiators, but negotiations did not immediately resume. Anastasiades expressed readiness to restart talks. After the elections, Anastasiades expressed readiness to restart negotiations with Akinci. Akinci agreed to meet informally but wanted clarity on negotiation topics and timeframe. Tensions over energy resources caused a delay in meetings. Both sides considered starting negotiations with governance issues. Greek Cypriot negotiator Mavroyiannis acknowledged differences in negotiating chapters but accepted Turkish Cypriot participation in key government bodies. The Turkish Cypriots could participate in key government bodies like the council of ministers, parliament, senate, and judiciary. Discussions on a rotating presidency with weighted voting were inconclusive. In April 2018, leaders met but made no progress on changing positions or resuming negotiations. Akinci suggested talks could restart from where they left off at Crans Montana. Negotiations may resume from where they left off at Crans Montana if both sides agree on adopting the six-point framework proposed by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres. Anastasiades rejected a strategic agreement approach, leading to a disagreement over which Guterres document to use. Turkish Foreign Minister Cavusoglu suggested a \"confederation\" or \"two-state\" approach, complicating the talks' resumption. Akinci did not fully support this idea. In an attempt to break the stalemate in Cyprus negotiations, U.N. Secretary-General appointed Jane Holl Lute as a special adviser to consult with Cypriot leaders and other involved parties. This move aimed to assess the conditions for resuming negotiations, following disagreements over the proposed frameworks and approaches. Lute conducted consultations and presented her report to the Secretary-General in September 2018, finding some positive aspects but no clear indication of readiness to resume negotiations. Guterres met with Cypriot leaders at the U.N. General Assembly but found no changes from Lute's report. The Security Council recommended not abandoning negotiations, using Guterres' 2017 framework as a starting point. Observers believed neither Cypriot leader was willing to restart negotiations. In mid-October 2018, Anastasiades and Akinci agreed to meet informally to discuss the possible road ahead. Despite no common ground to restart talks, Secretary-General Guterres saw a new opportunity to move the process forward by ordering Lute to conduct further consultations with the Cypriot leaders and guarantor countries. The Secretary-General tasked Lute to determine if the two Cypriot leaders could accept a \"terms of reference\" document based on Guterres' 2017 framework and previous agreements. Lute had until December 2018 to construct this document, but some doubted the ambitious deadline due to uncertainties about the leaders' acceptance of the framework and convergences. Observers noted that Anastasiades and Eroglu took almost nine months in 2013-2014 to agree on a joint statement defining negotiating goals. Some suggested that the Cypriot leaders were hesitant to agree to the Guterres terms of reference process, fearing it could be seen as nearing an interim agreement. Finding agreement on the document's content was a major challenge for Lute. In fall 2018, Anastasiades surprised many by proposing a \"loose\" or \"decentralized\" federation with more power for constituent states. Anastasiades proposed a decentralized federation with increased powers for constituent states, sparking discussions on a possible confederation or even a two-state solution. Turkish Cypriots expressed skepticism, viewing it as a delaying tactic. Lute's consultations in December highlighted the challenges, leading to further discussions scheduled for January 2019. Lute's return to Cyprus in early January 2019 for consultations on a terms of reference document did not result in an agreement. In April, she found Akinci adamant about Turkish Cypriots achieving political equality before restarting negotiations, which Anastasiades rejected. Anastasiades rejected the idea of requiring a positive Turkish Cypriot vote for all issues, but was open to considering it for certain issues. He proposed a mixed presidential/parliamentary system with a rotating prime minister, which Akinci criticized. Lute's attempts to have both sides agree on terms of reference failed. The Cyprus negotiations have seen four failed attempts to agree on terms of reference for resuming talks. Both sides have reported reaching convergences on EU affairs, governance, economics, citizenship, and property disputes. The meaning of \"convergences\" in these agreements remains unclear. The negotiations operate on the principle of \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.\" In April 2010, former Turkish Cypriot leader Talat mentioned 31 \"joint documents\" prepared for negotiations, covering various issues. Both sides agreed in principle on the new federal government's powers, including external relations, EU policies, citizenship, budget matters, and economic coordination. The 2014 joint statement included these convergences in governance issues. The 2014 joint statement between Anastasiades and Akinci outlined agreements on governance issues, including a Senate and House representation based on population. There was also consensus on a new judicial court with equal Turkish and Greek Cypriot representation, Cyprus representation in the European Parliament, and a federal supreme court. Negotiator Mavroyiannis confirmed these convergences in an interview in April 2018. In 2014, a joint statement between Anastasiades and Akinci outlined agreements on governance issues. Reports in 2016 indicated that 90% of issues had convergences, but technical issues remained. UN Secretary-General Guterres reaffirmed these convergences in September 2017. One unresolved issue was how a new, united Cyprus would be created, with Greek Cypriots assuming evolution from the existing Republic of Cyprus and Turkish Cypriots wanting a new state based on two. The Turkish Cypriots wanted a new state based on two equal \"founding states\" separate from the existing Republic of Cyprus. Eroglu reiterated that he was not willing to give up the TRNC. They also preferred the new entity to be called something other than the \"Republic of Cyprus.\" Anastasiades stated that the aim was to evolve the Republic of Cyprus into a bizonal, bicommunal federation. In summer 2016, Turkish Cypriot \"foreign minister\" Ertugruloglu stated that no agreement could be signed unless it was between two equal sovereign leaders, implying recognition of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Greek Cypriot government spokesman Christodoulides rejected upgrading the regime in the occupied areas. Controversy arose over the representation of Greek Cypriots in a proposed five-party conference to settle security issues and sign a new agreement. Controversy erupted over the representation of Greek Cypriots in the proposed five-party conference to settle security issues and sign a new agreement. During the Geneva talks in January 2017, the term \"United Federal Cyprus\" was mentioned in reference to the federal entity that would be created. Turkish Cypriots insisted on political equality and effective participation in decision-making at the new federal level. Anastasiades emphasized the need for the Republic of Cyprus to be represented at the conference as a signatory to the Treaty of Guarantee. Anastasiades and Akinci's disagreement over political equality and effective participation at the Crans Montana conference led to unresolved issues. The proposal for a rotating president and vice president with weighted cross-community voting remains a sensitive topic. Greek Cypriots suggested direct election of a president and vice president on the same ticket for a six-year term. The proposal for a rotating president and vice president with weighted cross-community voting was a sensitive topic at the Crans Montana conference. Turkish Cypriots initially suggested two alternating presidents elected by the Senate to address concerns over Greek Cypriot majority influence. Former Turkish Cypriot leader Talat made a concession by agreeing to a weighted cross-community system for the election of a president and vice president. The Greek Cypriot majority's concerns about electing a Turkish Cypriot candidate led to debates over a rotating presidency. Despite opposition from Greek Cypriots, the idea of a rotating presidency with weighted voting was proposed by Akinci for political equality. Several Greek Cypriot political parties oppose the concept of a rotating presidency, with Archbishop Chrysostomos stating his opposition due to the population size. At the Geneva conference, a five-year rotating presidency was proposed, with Greek Cypriots holding office for over three years and Turkish Cypriots for under two years. The issue of a rotating presidency remains unresolved as of April 2018. In April 2018, Akinci emphasized the unresolved issue of a rotating presidency as a 2:1 requirement, highlighting disagreements with Anastasiades on this matter. Other contentious points included the allocation of the foreign minister portfolio and external policy decisions, with differing views on Turkey. The challenge of maintaining ties with Ankara and Athens due to historical hostilities was also raised. Property disputes stemming from past ethnic conflicts and military interventions further complicated the negotiations between the two leaders. Following the deployment of Turkish military forces on the island in 1974, a significant number of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots were displaced, leaving behind vacated properties. Greek Cypriots advocate for the original owners to decide on property matters, while Turkish Cypriots prioritize current inhabitants and suggest resolving issues through compensation or property exchange. The Immovable Property Commission (IPC) was established by Turkish Cypriots to address Greek Cypriot property claims in the north, initially rejected by Greek Cypriots. The Greek Cypriots initially rejected the Immovable Property Commission (IPC) established by Turkish Cypriots to address property claims in the north. Positive movement was achieved by 2017, with former property owners offered various choices for compensation. However, only a limited number of Greek Cypriots would be allowed to return or take ownership of their properties. The potential settlement could cost between \u20ac25 billion and \u20ac30 billion, which the new \"federal\" entity might not be able to afford. Secretary-General Guterres proposed a six-point framework for the Cyprus issue, emphasizing preferential treatment for rightful owners in areas to be returned to Greek Cypriot administration and current users in areas under Turkish Cypriot administration. The dispute over overall territory allocation between the two states remains unresolved, with the Turkish Cypriot side currently controlling about 37% of the island. Greek Cypriots seek the return of territories like Varosha, Morphou, and Karpas, while a proposal to exchange Varosha for access to Famagusta's seaport was discussed. The proposal to exchange the uninhabited city of Varosha to Greek Cyprus for access to Famagusta's seaport for Turkish Cypriots to conduct international trade was resurrected by President Anastasiades as a \"confidence-building\" measure. Anastasiades later suggested that no agreement could be reached unless the town of Morphou was also returned to the republic. The Turkish Cypriots rejected the return of the town of Morphou to the republic, despite President Anastasiades including it as a confidence-building measure. Turkish Cypriot leader Akinci also rejected the return of Morphou as part of a final settlement. Discussions on territorial adjustments were suggested to be held off the island to avoid potential protests. At the Mont Pelerin meetings in November 2016, the two sides agreed to discuss issues regarding territory allocation. At Geneva in January 2017, Greek Cypriots proposed redrawing boundaries to give Turkish Cypriots control of 28.2% of the island. They also suggested allowing displaced Greek Cypriots to return to certain areas. Greek Cypriots wanted control of cities like Verosha and parts of Famagusta, with other areas becoming enclaves under federal government administration. Additionally, they sought additional shoreline along the east. The Turkish Cypriots insisted on controlling at least 29.2% of the island with a straight border, no enclaves, and limited Greek Cypriot returnees. They were willing to consider more shoreline but wanted it designated as state parks to prevent Greek Cypriot settlements. Despite presenting territorial concessions at Geneva, an agreement was not reached due to disagreements over the return of Morphou. At Crans Montana, Akinci was willing to return part of Morphou to Greek Cypriots but wanted to retain additional territory. President Christofias proposed a citizenship plan linking property, territory, and number of residents in the north. Eroglu stated any final solution should not cause significant social changes. Eroglu rejected Christofias' offer, emphasizing that no one on Cyprus is a refugee anymore. He also insisted on a higher number of mainland Turks being allowed to remain in the north. Turkish Cypriot representatives later confirmed that no citizens of the north would be forced to leave the country. The Cyprus ambassador speculated that a resolution of the Cyprus problem could allow mainland Turks to remain on the island. Akinci initially avoided the issue but may have agreed to set population sizes for both Turkish and Greek Cypriots in the constituent states. The Turkish Cypriot population was set at 220,000, with Akinci wanting an additional 50,000, while the Greek Cypriot population would be around 802,000. In 2016, Ankara wanted Turkish Cypriot government to speed up citizenship process for mainland Turks. Ozgurgun government was accused of rushing citizenship for 26,000 mainland Turks, sparking controversy with Greek Cypriot political parties. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Turkes mentioned around 300,000 Turkish Cypriots in the north. Prime Minister Turkes stated that the population sizes of the two constituent states in Cyprus would need to be adjusted due to the 300,000 Turkish Cypriots in the north. In 2017, Anastasiades mentioned that Akinci had retreated from previous agreements, including accepting a 4:1 population ratio. Secretary-General Guterres reported that the issue of citizenship in a future united Cyprus was almost resolved, with security guarantees and Turkish troop deployments remaining as major obstacles during negotiations in 2017. The two sides met in Geneva and Crans Montana in 2017, resulting in the collapse of both meetings. Greek Cypriots argue for Turkish military forces to leave the island immediately after an agreement, relying on U.N. or EU security guarantees. Turkish Cypriots and Turkey insist on retaining the 1960 Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance for security due to past ethnic violence. The U.N. forces on the island were unable to prevent the military coup against the Makarios government or protect the Turkish Cypriot population. Greek Cypriots have a well-armed National Guard, while Turkish Cypriot security forces are smaller and rely on Turkish military presence. Eroglu emphasized the importance of security guarantees with Turkey, stating that Turkish troops would not leave the island. Akinci did not take a hard line on the issue, balancing negotiations without antagonizing Ankara. In negotiations, Akinci was open to adjusting provisions regarding Turkish military presence in northern Cyprus, proposing a gradual withdrawal of most troops. Anastasiades suggested a multinational police force, but Turkish Cypriots and Turkey rejected the idea. Former \"foreign minister\" Ozgurgun advocated for continued Turkish security guarantees. In negotiations, Turkish Cypriot government officials insisted on Turkey's continued security guarantees for northern Cyprus. Greek Cypriots and Greece opposed any Turkish military presence on the island. Despite initial rigidity, both sides showed some flexibility during formal talks on security in late 2016. In late fall 2016, discussions on security began between the Cypriot sides. Turkey initially proposed a military base in the north and suggested a 10-15 year timetable for reducing troops on Cyprus. Greek Cypriots opposed these ideas but may have suggested a small contingent of Turkish troops for a short period. At Geneva, Turkey took a hard line on security guarantees and troops on Cyprus, while Greek Cypriots proposed an international police force without Greek, Turkish, or UK forces. Russia suggested the UN Security Council as guarantors, but the idea was rejected. The EU offered assurances for implementing and enforcing any solution. The EU was unable to convince Ankara or Turkish Cypriots of guaranteeing security and fair treatment, leading to a lack of progress in talks. The dispute over enosis legislation in February 2017 highlighted Turkish Cypriot concerns for safety and the need for Turkish troops and guarantees. During the suspension of talks in 2017, U.N. Special Adviser Eide worked on a compromise on security. A new conference was planned in June 2017, where Eide would prepare a security \"roadmap\" for negotiation. However, the proposal was not presented as Cypriot leader Anastasiades objected to parts of it. Anastasiades objected to parts of the Eide document, leading to its non-presentation. At Crans Montana, security issues caused negotiations to deadlock. Turkey was willing to discuss troop removal post-agreement but rejected \"zero troops, zero guarantees.\" They insisted on keeping a small force for 15 years. Greece wanted the Treaty of Guarantee abolished, proposing a new \"treaty of Friendship.\" At Crans Montana talks, differences on security issues between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus led to a deadlock. Greece proposed a new \"treaty of Friendship\" and insisted on the withdrawal of all Turkish troops from Cyprus. Anastasiades may have considered allowing a small contingent of Turkish troops with a set date for complete withdrawal. These security issues were seen as a barrier to starting new negotiations, with suggestions to address them after resolving governance issues. In July 2018, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots set concessions on security issues as a precondition for resuming talks. The dispute over energy resources further complicated negotiations, leading to accusations and distrust between the parties. Turkish Foreign Minister emphasized that the \"zero troops, zero guarantees\" position will not happen. The energy issue has caused further distrust between the republic, Turkish Cypriots, and Ankara. Greek Cypriots see it as a financial opportunity, while Turkish Cypriots fear losing revenue. Ankara insists on Turkish Cypriot involvement in decision-making. Ankara supported involving Turkish Cypriots in decision-making to maintain its position as a gas supplier to Europe. Eroglu believed energy should be part of negotiations, but Greek Cypriots wanted to address it under a new system. Akinci initially trusted promises of shared energy wealth, but later pushed for involvement in energy decisions. After the Republic of Cyprus announced new gas exploration licenses in the Cyprus EEZ and plans for gas shipment to Egypt, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots objected, fearing harm to settlement negotiations. Despite Total's upcoming exploration and discussions on a gas pipeline to Europe, the issue did not hinder talks. Energy Ministers from Cyprus, Israel, Greece, and Italy revealed plans for an East Mediterranean pipeline from Israel to Greece and Italy. Total also made announcements. Turkey and Turkish Cypriots objected to new gas exploration in Cyprus EEZ and plans for gas shipment to Egypt. Total announced new exploration in Cypriot waters, leading to negative reactions from Turkey. Ankara threatened actions if drilling commenced before a Cyprus agreement. As Crans Montana talks approached, energy issues resurfaced. Turkey planned its own exploration in disputed areas and scheduled military exercises in July, seen as pressure on Cyprus to delay exploration. Total commenced drilling in mid-July 2017 despite objections from Ankara. Additional drilling by Total, ENI, and Exxon/Qatar was approved by Greek Cypriots in 2018. ENI began new drilling in a different area in December 2017, with significant findings announced in February 2018. In February 2018, ENI announced a significant gas find in a new area. Turkey attempted to impede the movement of ENI's drilling platform to a disputed area, leading to tensions with Greek Cypriots, supported by the EU. Ankara and Turkish Cypriots demanded inclusion in exploration planning, which was rejected by Greek Cypriots. Turkey threatened military action and planned its own drilling in Cypriot EEZ. Some believe Turkey was concerned about new gas finds in the Cypriot EEZ potentially excluding the possibility of piping gas to Europe through Turkey. The United States and EU intervened, urging both Greek and Turkish Cypriots to ease tensions over energy exploration. The U.S. Ambassador emphasized the need for fair sharing of energy resources in Cyprus between both communities, stating that commercializing gas deposits may not be immediate due to extraction costs. It could take years before revenues flow, urging all parties to focus on a solution to the island's division. Assistant Secretary Mitchell also called for Turkey to reduce provocations in the region. In November 2018, Exxon-Mobil/Qatar Petroleum began gas exploration in block 10 of the Cypriot EEZ. Turkey warned against unilateral exploitation of resources and announced plans to start drilling in disputed waters. Exxon-Mobile discovered significant gas deposits in early 2019, leading to tensions between the United States and Turkey over drilling issues. Turkey deployed two drilling platforms despite a slight improvement in U.S.-Turkish relations. When Mustafa Akinci became leader of the Turkish Cypriots in 2015, hopes for a permanent settlement of the Cyprus problem were reignited. Akinci, known for his cooperation with Greek Cypriot counterparts, raised optimism for a resolution between Anastasiades and Akinci. However, the initial positive atmosphere after Akinci's election was reminiscent of past failed attempts at quick solutions. Negotiations between Anastasiades and Akinci started quickly, with both leaders showing solidarity and hope for a settlement. Despite the long-standing issues between the two communities, there was optimism that a solution could be reached. The chemistry between Anastasiades and Akinci allowed them to overcome traditional barriers to a settlement effectively. Despite public controversy and criticism, they remained determined to seek a solution, even though concrete agreements on governance, security, and guarantees issues were elusive. The negotiations between Anastasiades and Akinci in 2016 and 2017 received international praise for their commitment and persistence in seeking a solution. Despite coming closer to a settlement in early 2017, the Crans Montana conference failed due to disagreements over security issues, with Ankara unwilling to accept changes. Ankara was reluctant to replace Turkish security guarantees with EU or international guarantees, insisting on maintaining troops on the island for security reasons. They also wanted to preserve their geostrategic interests and influence, including plans for a permanent naval base in North Cyprus. This stance clashed with Anastasiades' rejection of any Turkish troops remaining on the island, leading to a divergence in their visions for a bizonal, bicommunal solution. Reports indicated that President Anastasiades and his counterpart no longer agreed on the concept of a bizonal, bicommunal federation. Governance issues such as the rotating presidency and political equality remained unresolved, casting doubt on the possibility of reaching a consensus. Secretary-General Guterres' appointment of Jane Holl Lute as an adviser was seen as a challenge to both sides' commitment to resuming negotiations. Guterres adopted Akinci's demand for results-oriented negotiations, requiring agreement on a \"terms of reference\" document drafted by Lute. Anastasiades believed this document could reinforce his stance on Turkish military withdrawal and future security guarantees. Akinci saw support for political equality for Turkish Cypriots. Trust restoration between leaders and Ankara was crucial for accepting the terms of reference. Anastasiades proposed a \"decentralized\" federation in mid-fall 2018, suggesting more powers for constituent states. This shift in mindset complicated Lute's mission as trust between leaders and Ankara wavered, with disagreements on security issues and political equality. Anastasiades suggested a conference in Cyprus to discuss a decentralized federation or confederation, causing a mixed reaction. Some believed he was seeking a middle ground after meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister, while others thought he was buying time for gas exploration results. Akinci was skeptical of the proposal, seeing it as undermining support for a federal solution. Anastasiades's proposal was met with skepticism, especially from Akinci and his political opponents who criticized him for potentially abandoning the goal of a federal solution. Turkish and Turkish Cypriot officials, like Foreign Minister Ozersay, also expressed doubts about a federal solution, posing a challenge to Akinci's position. Ersin Tatar, the new leader of the National Unity Party, indicated support for a \"two-state\" solution, further complicating the situation. Observers noted that several pro-federal solution political parties did not publicly defend Akinci, leaving him isolated. Some suggested a rift between Akinci and Ankara, with speculation that Ankara was trying to sideline Akinci to delay negotiations until after local elections. Turkish Foreign Minister Cavasoglu intervened in late January 2019 to bring all sides together and end the public squabbling, reiterating Ankara's desire for a permanent solution. Turkish Foreign Minister Cavasoglu intervened to end public squabbling over the Cyprus issue. He emphasized Ankara's desire for a permanent solution, while some questioned the success of special adviser Lute's mission due to disagreements on key issues. Anastasiades and Akinci had differing views on political equality and deadlines for the talks, with Cavasoglu suggesting that the Guterres framework could jeopardize the terms of reference. An agreement to leave the island could jeopardize the terms of reference. Lute was unable to craft a document by the end of 2018 and had to return for more consultations in early 2019. The rift between Anastasiades and Akinci centered on Turkish Cypriot political equality. Lute found little basis for continuing consultations and decided to meet with the guarantor powers. Despite no likely breakthrough, she agreed to return for another round of consultations on April 7. Akinci insists on Turkish Cypriot political equality in the new federal government, proposing equal power on federal issues with a positive Turkish Cypriot vote. Anastasiades rejects this, fearing an absolute Turkish Cypriot veto and influence from Ankara. Anastasiades rejected Akinci's proposal for Turkish Cypriot political equality in the new federal government, suggesting a hybrid presidential-parliamentary system instead. Akinci viewed this as reinforcing Greek Cypriot dominance and rejected the idea. Lute's fourth return to Cyprus failed to achieve an agreement between the two leaders on a \"terms of reference\" document for restarting negotiations. Secretary-General Guterres will have to decide how to proceed after negotiations between Anastasiades and Akinci failed to reach an agreement on restarting negotiations. Questions remain on the possibility of a bizonal, bicommunal, federal solution for the island and the need for a new security framework that does not involve Turkey's unilateral intervention. The acceptance of these concepts by Ankara and Akinci's ability to convince his citizens of a new federal structure are key concerns. The new federal structure with political equality for Turkish Cypriots, EU law guarantees, and a stronger U.N. peacekeeping force may lead to a new security arrangement regarding Turkish troops. However, tensions between Turkey and Greek Cypriots over energy exploration make it difficult for either side to compromise on security demands, hindering the possibility of a solution. Concerns also arise about whether leaders can sell any agreement to their communities. Some observers are deeply concerned about the direction of the Cyprus dispute since Crans Montana. The Business Monitor International downgraded the likelihood of a new unification deal, and former British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw highlighted the challenges of conceding political equality. Despite efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres, a final settlement for Cyprus remains elusive."
