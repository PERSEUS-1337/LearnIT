    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10159.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require individuals applying for a license under this chapter to file a certified copy of their fictitious business name statement with the county clerk. A responsible broker can authorize a salesperson to apply for a fictitious business name on their behalf and request approval from the bureau to use a county-approved name linked to the broker's license number. (C) Pay for any fees associated with filing an application for a fictitious business name with a county or the bureau. Maintain ownership of the name under the control of the responsible broker. Salespersons must use the authorized name as permitted by the broker. This section does not alter a broker's duty to supervise a salesperson. Applicants can file for a fictitious business name in the county where it will be used. Advertising and solicitation materials must include the responsible broker's identity alongside a fictitious business name. Salespersons using a fictitious business name must also include their name and license number. Violating this rule is not a misdemeanor. Section 10159.6 of the Business and Professions Code requires advertising materials with a team name to prominently display the name and license number of at least one licensed team member. The responsible broker's identity must also be prominently displayed, and the materials should not imply the existence of a separate real estate entity. Section 10159.7 of the Business and Professions Code defines \"responsible broker's identity\" as the name and license number of the broker conducting business, excluding fictitious business names. \"Fictitious business name\" refers to a professional identity or brand name used for real estate activities, subject to bureau approval. Ownership of a fictitious business name allows the right to use, renew, and control the name as per Section 10159.5. A responsible broker is in charge of supervising salespersons for regulatory compliance and consumer protection under Section 10159.2. A team name is a professional identity used by real estate licensees to provide licensed services, and does not require a separate license. It is used by two or more licensees working together or representing themselves as a team to offer services. The name of a real estate team must include the surname of at least one licensee member and cannot imply independent brokerage services. This does not change a broker's duty to supervise salespersons. This act is urgent for public safety and will take immediate effect. To ensure consistent application of the law on \"team names\" at state and local levels, and to clarify that a \"team name\" does not count as a fictitious business name, this act must take effect immediately."
