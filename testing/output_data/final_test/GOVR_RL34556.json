    "content": "Congressional hearings and press coverage have increased interest in the medical care of noncitizens in ICE custody. Legislation related to detainee health care has been introduced, sparking a debate on the appropriate standard of health care for foreign nationals in immigration detention. ICE's National Detention Standards outline the medical care required for detainees, with the Division of Immigrant Health Services responsible for their health care. However, reports from organizations like the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center and the National Immigrant Justice Center highlight problems with access to medical care for aliens in detention. The report discusses complaints about access to medical care for aliens in detention, including a case of negligence in the death of a former ICE detainee. It questions whether standards are being followed and provides an overview of noncitizen detention and policies related to health care provision. The report does not investigate claims of substandard care but highlights issues surrounding detainee health care. The United States mandates certain categories of aliens to be subject to mandatory detention by the Department of Homeland Security. Detained aliens can be parole, released on bond, or continue to be detained while their removal from the US is determined. Detainees include criminal aliens, asylum seekers, and illegal aliens, some of whom are long-term legal residents. Additionally, detained aliens may include those arriving without proper documentation at ports-of-entry. ICE detains aliens who arrive without proper documentation, with some held until their asylum claims are adjudicated. In October 2007, 65% of detainees were held in state and local prisons, 19% in contract facilities, 14% in ICE-owned Service Processing Centers, and 2% in Bureau of Prisons facilities, all required to comply with ICE's National Detention Standards. Up to 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE's custody on an average day. ICE detains up to 33,000 immigration detainees daily in over 300 facilities nationwide, with an average stay of 37.5 days. In FY2008, around 311,000 aliens were detained, with 25% removed within four days and 90% within 85 days. However, over 7,000 aliens in FY2006 were detained for longer than six months, and 48% of detainees were criminal aliens. ICE contracts with Creative Corrections, L.L.C., for annual facility inspections and the Nakamoto Group Inc. for on-site quality assurance inspectors at the 40 largest facilities. The Detention Facilities Inspection Group (DFIG) oversees detention facilities and conducts investigations of serious incidents involving detainees. The DHS Inspector General's 2008 draft report found previous oversight ineffective in identifying problems. ICE's Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) ensures facilities comply with National Detention Standards. The Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) oversees the safe and humane confinement of detained aliens in federal custody, providing reliable health services. ICE established National Detention Standards in 2000, with updated standards published in 2008. These standards outline appropriate detention conditions for immigration detainees, often aligning with ACA standards but also including unique specifications for alien detainees. The Detention Standards do not have the force of law, so detainees lack legal recourse for violations. The Detention Operations Manual covers health services, including medical care, hunger strikes, suicide prevention, and terminal illness. The ACLU and National Immigration Law Center criticize ICE for lacking guidelines on facility adherence, giving advance notice for reviews, and not conducting detainee interviews during annual reviews. ICE's Office of Detention and Removal reports semiannually on adherence to National Detention Standards, ensuring detainees have access to medical, dental, and mental health care. Facilities must provide initial screening, primary care, and emergency services, with arrangements made for specialized care and hospitalization. ICE facilities are required to provide health care services to detainees, including mental health care and hospitalization. They must have a medical staff to offer basic exams and treatments, with some facilities having on-site medical staff and diagnostic equipment. Detainees can request medical services through a mechanism like paper request slips and have access to scheduled sick call times for medical care. All sick call requests must be triaged within 48 hours. ICE facilities must provide health care services to detainees, including mental health care and hospitalization. Detainees receive an initial health screening upon arrival and a physical examination within 14 days to identify medical conditions. Mental health screenings are also conducted within 12 hours of admission. Follow-up appointments are scheduled as needed, and detainees have access to sick call for non-emergency medical requests. Detainees in ICE facilities have access to sick call for non-emergency health care. An initial dental screening should be done within 14 days of arrival, with routine dental treatment available for those detained over six months. However, dental care is often limited to extractions, with delays in treatment for painful conditions. Detainees are not provided with dentures or eyeglasses unless they were broken while in detention, and they cannot use their own money for medical or dental care. Detainees in ICE facilities may not use their own money for medical or dental care. They have access to medication from on-site or community pharmacies, and can receive medicine from family members if approved. The Division of Immigrant Health Services (DIHS) is responsible for healthcare provision, with on-site care at 15 out of 300+ facilities. The provision of medical care at detention facilities varies, with some having full-time medical staff while others use local providers. DIHS approves off-site medical care for detainees, and their policy has a significant impact on medical services. Concerns include whether the Detention Standards for medical care are followed and if the benefits package allows for adequate services. DIHS is a standalone medical unit under the U.S. Public Health Service. ICE sought greater administrative control over DIHS due to HRSA's inability to fill vacancies promptly and reluctance to provide PHS Officers for ICE missions. In October 2007, DIHS was permanently detailed to ICE through a memorandum of agreement, allowing for the assignment of PHS resources as needed. ICE gained administrative control over DIHS through a memorandum of agreement, effective since October 2007. DHS is responsible for PHS Officers' day-to-day conduct and assumes liability for negligence. ICE and OHA are collaborating on improvement initiatives for DIHS, including hiring strategies, electronic medical records, and Treatment Authorization Requests. ICE has established a covered benefits package, the DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package (CSP), which primarily provides health care services for emergency care for detainees in ICE custody. The package covers accidental or traumatic injuries, acute illnesses, and other medical conditions that could deteriorate the detainee's health or cause uncontrolled suffering affecting their deportation status. ICE is also working with OHA to develop an enhanced process for TAR appeals. Detainees in ICE custody requiring non-emergency medical care beyond what the facilities can provide must obtain preauthorization through a Treatment Authorization Request (TAR). Despite ICE reporting a high approval rate for TARs, some detainees have experienced delays in receiving basic care, with instances of being denied necessary diagnostic tests like biopsies. ICE detainees requiring non-emergency medical care must go through a preauthorization process for treatment. Approval for diagnostic testing and specialty care is needed from DIHS, with Managed Care Coordinators reviewing physician paperwork. Hospitalized detainees have medical decisions made by the hospital. Off-site medical care for U.S. Marshals detainees follows a similar process. DIHS has an appeals process for care decisions. ICE detainees have the right to appeal denied Treatment Authorization Requests (TARs) through a formal process similar to industry standards. The Managed Care Review Committee (MCRC) conducts a second level review for upheld appeals within three working days. ICE, DIHS, and OHA are collaborating to enhance the appeal process for detainees. ICE, DIHS, and OHA are working on developing an independent appeal body for detainees. The preauthorization requirement is similar to managed care insurers, but some argue it can hinder necessary care. The DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package has been amended multiple times since 2005, limiting medical care scope. Difficulties in obtaining biopsies for cancer concerns have been a recurring issue. The ACLU is involved in a class action suit over inadequate medical care at the San Diego Correctional Facility. The ACLU has raised concerns about deficiencies in the CSP at the San Diego Correctional Facility, stating that detainees may not receive adequate medical care as per ICE Detention Standards. The CSP primarily offers health services for emergencies only and may not cover pre-existing conditions. There is a discrepancy between ICE's standards and the CSP, with critics arguing that the CSP falls short of constitutional and decency principles. Representative Zoe Lofgren also noted inconsistencies between the CSP and Detention Standards regarding medical condition evaluations for treatment. ICE disagrees with the claim that the Detention Standards and CSP are inconsistent regarding medical treatment for detainees. They argue that all detainees receive medical care when deemed necessary by DIHS, regardless of deportation status. Issues have been reported with detainees being transferred without their medical records, and ICE lacks a system to track medication and medical record transfers. Some lawyers have faced difficulties accessing medical records for their clients, while detainees have complained about challenges in receiving proper care. The curr_chunk discusses complaints from detainees about issues with interpreters during medical treatment and lack of gynecological care. It summarizes three U.S. government reports on compliance with National Detention Standards. In July 2007, ICE released its first semiannual report on compliance with National Detention Standards, covering reviews of over 175 facilities. The report rated facilities as \"acceptable\" or \"deficient\" based on standards, with 98% rated acceptable for medical care and 80% of ICE-owned Service Processing Centers rated acceptable. In July 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) audited 23 detention facilities and found deficiencies in medical care standards at 3 facilities. Concerns about medical care led to complaints from aliens. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) audited compliance with detention standards at five facilities, identifying instances of non-compliance. The OIG found instances of non-compliance with medical care standards at four out of five detention facilities, including delays in providing initial medical care. The report highlighted inconsistencies in response times for non-emergency medical requests, with 196 out of 481 requests not being addressed promptly. ICE was recommended to develop clearer standards for timely medical care responses. ICE was recommended by the OIG to define a reasonable time for medical treatment in detention facilities. ICE responded by stating that its medical program meets industry standards but relies on service providers for medical decisions. Concerns were raised about inadequate care for detainees, with an increase in the detainee population between FY2003 and FY2007 leading to questions about spending on medical care. ICE has the authority to release aliens due to medical and psychological problems, raising concerns about the adequacy of guidelines and practices for medical release. The special needs of asylum seekers in detention also prompt questions about the quality of care provided. Preventable deaths of aliens in detention highlight concerns about the standard of health care, leading to debates on measuring adequacy and quality of care. The appropriateness of the standard of health care in detention facilities is a key policy issue. The debate on the appropriate standard of health care for foreign nationals in immigration detention has increased interest in funding for detainee medical care. Total expenditures on ICE detainee health care increased from FY2003 to FY2007, with a significant rise in spending from $50 million to $92 million. Between FY2003 and FY2007, total expenditures on ICE detainee health care increased from $50 million to $92 million. The majority of the increase in spending was on program operations rather than medical claims. The funds for medical claims fluctuated between FY2003 and FY2007, while the funded bed space increased by 49%. ICE has the authority to release aliens for medical and psychological reasons, but the extent of this authority's use and effectiveness is unknown. ICE has prosecutorial discretion in determining custody for aliens with humanitarian concerns, including medical issues. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis when detention is problematic or removal is unlikely. There is debate about detaining asylum seekers, who often have medical and psychological issues. It is unclear how well-equipped the detention health care system is to address their specific needs. Aliens in expedited removal claiming asylum must be detained while their cases are pending. In FY2006, 5,761 asylum seekers were detained, with 27% detained for over 180 days. Some believe detaining asylum seekers reduces fraudulent claims, but the UNHCR finds it psychologically damaging. ICE provides medical care for asylum seekers with unique medical conditions from their home countries. ICE provides medical care for life-threatening conditions such as cardiac arrest, kidney disease, HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and diabetes to detained asylum seekers. Staff are trained to identify and assist detainees at risk of suicide. Psychologists and social workers have successfully managed a daily population of over 1,350 seriously mentally ill detainees without any suicides between May 2007 and May 2008. The quality of oversight and intervention techniques are highlighted when a detainee dies in custody. The oversight of detainee deaths in ICE custody is questioned, with doubts about the effectiveness of reporting procedures. Deaths are to be reported to ICE headquarters, Office of Professional Responsibility, and Office of the Inspector General for independent reviews. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducts independent reviews of detainee deaths in ICE custody, which are reported to the local medical examiner's office for autopsy consideration. The OIG is notified of deaths by the Joint Intake Center, which sends all records to the OIG for investigation. ICE has reported a decrease in detainee deaths from 2004 to 2008, but concerns remain about using mortality rates to evaluate healthcare quality for detainees. ICE reported 71 deaths in immigration detention facilities from 2004 to May 2, 2008, with a decline in deaths despite an increase in the detainee population. Physicians criticized ICE's comparison of mortality rates, stating that age and length of detention adjustments were not made. They suggested using morbidity as a better measure of healthcare quality in ICE facilities. Critics question the accuracy of ICE healthcare measures, noting an increase in detainee mortality rates from 2006 to 2007. Concerns include the exclusion of deaths outside facilities linked to detention, debates on appropriate care standards for detainees, and the cost of healthcare covered by taxpayers. ICE's healthcare for detainees is compared to that of criminal inmates. ICE argues that some aliens receive better healthcare in detention than in their home countries. Assistant Secretary Julie Myers stated that in FY2007, 34% of detainees were diagnosed and treated for chronic conditions. The healthcare decisions for detainees must consider the lack of follow-up care in their home countries. Despite acknowledging the burden of chronic diseases among detainees, ICE's health plan focuses on acute care. The ICE health plan focuses on acute care for detainees, not tailored for those with chronic medical or mental health needs. Some detainees have health insurance but can't use it. Officers may view detainees as criminals, leading to delays in receiving care. On average, 33,000 immigration detainees are in ICE custody daily, with an average stay of 37.5 days. In FY2007, 311,213 aliens were detained by ICE. In FY2007, ICE detained 311,213 aliens, with 48% being criminal aliens. The average daily detained population increased significantly from FY2006 to FY2007, reaching 30,295 detainees. By the end of FY2008, the average daily detained population was 31,244. ICE detained 79,713 more noncitizens in FY2007 compared to FY2003. ICE detained 79,713 more noncitizens in FY2007 compared to FY2003, with an increase in the total annual detention population due to the expansion of expedited removal. Legislation in the 110th Congress allocated funds for a review of medical care for ICE detainees and directed improvements in medical services. The Detainee Basic Medical Care Act of 2008 was introduced to ensure timely and effective delivery of medical and mental health care to immigration detainees, addressing all health needs including primary care, emergency care, prenatal care, dental care, eye care, and mental health care. The procedures required comprehensive medical and mental health screenings and examinations for detainees within specific timeframes. The proposed legislation, H.R. 5950 / S. 3005, aimed to ensure detainees receive timely medical and mental health care, including access to prescribed medications without interruption. It also prioritized detainees with serious medical or mental conditions for release on parole, bond, or alternative programs. Additionally, the bills required accessible medical records, discharge planning for continuity of care upon release, and an appeals process for denials of medical or mental health services. The proposed legislation, H.R. 5950 / S. 3005, mandated an appeals process for denials of medical or mental health care, including the opportunity to appeal to an impartial board. It also required the Secretary to report detainee deaths to the Inspector Generals within 48 hours and provide an annual report to Congress on detainee deaths."
