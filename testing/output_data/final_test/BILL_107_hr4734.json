Rural Alaskan communities near these units have unique cultural ties to the conservation efforts. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act established programs to give preference to Alaska Native lands for conservation system unit facilities, Alaska Native corporations for visitor services, and local residents for employment. The Act aims to promote innovative management strategies, expand Alaska Native contracting opportunities, increase local employment, and further the unique purposes of conservation system units.
