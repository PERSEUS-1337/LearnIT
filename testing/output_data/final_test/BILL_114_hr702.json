The Congress acknowledges the United States' leading role in oil production and the potential benefits of authorizing crude oil exports, such as boosting domestic energy production, creating jobs, strengthening national defense, and increasing State and Federal revenues. An energy-secure U.S. as a net exporter could positively impact global security, particularly in Europe and the Middle East, providing more secure supply options for allies like Europe and Israel. The Maritime Security Fleet program ensures US-flag ships and crews are available to support the military, strengthening alliances and reducing energy as a political weapon. It provides skilled American mariners for both government-owned and commercial fleets in peace and war. The United States has reduced oil consumption over the past decade, and investing in clean energy technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and enhance national security.
