    "content": "Under the ADA, public transportation entities must provide paratransit services that are comparable to services offered to individuals without disabilities. Failure to do so is considered discrimination. Public transportation services for individuals without disabilities must comply with ADA's complementary paratransit requirements. The ADA defines a \"fixed-route system\" as designated public transportation operating on a prescribed route with a fixed schedule. Public entities, including subcontractors, are subject to these obligations. Regulations were first implemented on September 6, 1991, by the Department of Transportation. Public entities operating fixed route systems must provide comparable paratransit service for individuals with disabilities. Paratransit service is alternative transportation for those who cannot use fixed-route systems. Entities cannot deny individuals with disabilities the opportunity to use general public transportation services based on their disability. Entities must provide paratransit service that is \"comparable\" to the level of service offered to the general public, as required by the ADA. The Department of Transportation developed minimum service criteria to determine this level of service. Public entities are not prohibited from offering paratransit services that exceed these minimum requirements. Paratransit service must be provided to all \"paratransit-eligible\" individuals, including non-resident visitors. The paratransit service must be provided to all \"paratransit-eligible\" individuals, including non-resident visitors who present ADA documentation. Eligibility categories include those unable to use fixed-route transit due to impairment, those with inaccessible fixed-route systems, and those with conditions preventing travel to a boarding location. The regulations require entities to provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities who are unable to travel to a boarding location or from a disembarking location. Accompanying individuals are allowed to travel with paratransit-eligible individuals for pleasure, but if a personal care attendant is needed, an accompanying individual must also be provided service. The regulations also mandate that paratransit services must be offered for the same time frame as fixed-route transportation services. The regulations allow entities to charge higher fares to paratransit riders, capped at twice the amount for a similar trip on general transportation services. Paratransit service must cover areas within three-quarters of a mile of fixed-route services for buses and a three-quarter-mile radius around rail stations. Premiums can only be charged for services exceeding minimum requirements. The regulations for paratransit service require an \"origin-to-destination\" service, with ambiguity on whether it means door-to-door or curb-to-curb service. Local decision-makers determine the specifics. Entities must respond promptly to requests, with a next-day service requirement in place. The Department of Transportation regulations for paratransit service require next-day service after a request, with limited flexibility in pick-up times. Another regulation on \"capacity constraints\" prohibits specific ways of limiting service availability for ADA paratransit eligible persons. The Department of Transportation regulations for paratransit service require next-day service after a request, with limited flexibility in pick-up times. Examples of discriminatory \"patterns or practices\" include untimely pickups, trip denials, and excessive trip lengths. In Anderson v. Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority, the court interpreted the next-day service requirement as imposing an affirmative obligation on public entities to provide adequate paratransit service. The court ruled that transportation providers are not liable for failing to meet 100% of paratransit demand unless it results in a pattern of denial. In Anderson v. Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority, the entity violated the ADA by denying paratransit services scheduled in advance. The court found that RGRTA violated the ADA by denying rides to paratransit-eligible riders despite anticipating increased demand and failing to adjust operations. In a similar case, MARTA was sued for discriminating against riders with disabilities by providing inadequate paratransit service. The court determined that MARTA's operational practices limited service availability for paratransit eligible individuals. The court found MARTA violated the ADA by limiting paratransit service availability, including changing \"ready times\" without notice and charging riders for late service. Case law suggests entities must plan to meet 100% of next-day service demand for paratransit riders. Failure to provide next-day service can lead to liability only if it results in waiting lists, ride restrictions, or discriminatory practices. The ADA limits paratransit requirements by waiving the obligation in cases of \"undue financial burden.\" Factors for determining this waiver include effects on fixed route service, per capita trips comparison, reductions in other services, fare increases, resources for paratransit, budget percentage needed, accessible service level, cooperation among providers, evidence of efficiencies, and unique circumstances in the area."
