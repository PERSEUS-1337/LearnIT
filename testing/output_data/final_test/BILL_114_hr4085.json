    "content": "The \"Church Plan Clarification Act of 2015\" may be cited as the Act. It clarifies church plans. The \"Church Plan Clarification Act of 2015\" clarifies the application of Controlled Group Rules to church plans, stating that organizations eligible for a church plan shall not be aggregated with another organization for certain purposes. The \"Church Plan Clarification Act of 2015\" clarifies that organizations eligible for a church plan shall not be aggregated with another organization unless one provides at least 80 percent of operating funds and there is common management between them. For the purposes of this subsection, a nonqualified church-controlled organization can be combined with other similar organizations to be treated as a single employer if certain criteria are met. Nonqualified church-controlled organizations can elect to be treated as a single employer for a plan year, with the election applying to all succeeding plan years unless revoked. The Secretary may prescribe permissive disaggregation of church-related organizations for church plans. An employer can elect to treat churches separately from non-church entities without maintaining separate church plans. The election applies to all succeeding plan years unless revoked. The anti-abuse rule continues to apply to each paragraph of section 414(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by paragraph (1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 apply to years before, on, or after the enactment date. Section 251(e)(5) is amended to subject grandfathered defined benefit plans to contribution and funding limitations of section 415(b) as if it were a defined benefit plan under section 401(a). The amendments made by this subsection apply to years before, on, or after the enactment date. This subsection supersedes any state law that restricts including an automatic contribution arrangement in a church plan. An automatic contribution arrangement allows participants to elect automatic contributions. An automatic contribution arrangement allows participants to elect to have contributions made by the plan sponsor or employer on their behalf, or receive cash directly. Participants are considered to have elected contributions equal to a percentage of compensation until they opt out or choose a different percentage. Notice and election requirements must be met. The plan sponsor or employer must provide participants with a notice before each plan year regarding their rights and obligations under the automatic contribution arrangement. The notice should be accurate, comprehensive, and easily understood by the average participant. The notice for participants in an automatic contribution arrangement must include an explanation of their right to opt out of elective contributions, provide a reasonable time to make this election before the first contribution, and explain how contributions work. The notice for automatic contribution arrangements must explain how contributions will be invested if no election is made. Default investments will be selected with care and prudence. This subsection will be effective upon enactment of the Act. Allowances for certain plan transfers and mergers are also addressed in the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to address certain plan transfers and mergers, specifying rules for transferring accrued benefits between church plans and annuity contracts maintained by the same church or association of churches. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow transfers and mergers of accrued benefits between church plans and annuity contracts maintained by the same church or association of churches. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows transfers and mergers of accrued benefits between church plans and annuity contracts maintained by the same church or association of churches, with certain limitations and qualifications in place. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows transfers and mergers of accrued benefits between church plans and annuity contracts maintained by the same church or association of churches. This includes defined benefit plans and other types of retirement accounts. The amendment made by this subsection is effective on a specified date. The amendment made by this subsection applies to transfers or mergers occurring after the enactment of this Act. Church plans and organizations administering such plans can invest in collective trusts. Investments in group trusts described in IRS Revenue Ruling 81-100, as modified by subsequent rulings, are allowed without affecting tax status. This applies to investments made after the enactment of this Act."
