    "content": "The \"Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" may also be referred to as the \"OFS Act.\" The purpose of this Act is outlined in Section 2, which includes findings and purposes. The Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009, also known as the OFS Act, highlights findings by Congress regarding oil as a strategic commodity. It emphasizes the need for fuel competition and consumer choice to reduce oil's monopoly in the transportation sector and strip it of its strategic status. The closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices. The Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for fuel competition to reduce oil's monopoly in the transportation sector. Petroleum exporting countries inflate fuel prices, harming the economy of the United States. Alcohol fuels like ethanol and methanol could provide additional supplies and contribute to energy independence if more vehicles can operate on them. The Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009 highlights the importance of fuel competition to reduce oil dependency in the transportation sector. It is crucial for the United States to not solely rely on petroleum resources for vehicle fuels, especially when alcohol fuels are a potential alternative. Flexible fuel vehicles can operate on gasoline, alcohol fuels, or a combination of both, allowing for fuel competition. The development of a distribution system for alcohol fuels in the United States is contingent on a significant number of vehicles being capable of using them. The establishment of a vehicle fleet and distribution system for alcohol fuels in the United States is crucial for advancing technology and national security interests. New cars should be flexible fuel vehicles to allow for fuel competition, and an open fuel standard would protect the market. An open fuel standard in the United States would safeguard the economy from oil price fluctuations and threats like global instability, terrorism, and natural disasters. An open fuel standard for transportation is proposed in the United States to protect the economy from oil price fluctuations and various threats. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like E85, flexible fuel automobile, fuel choice-enabling automobile, and light-duty automobile. The term 'light-duty automobile manufacturer's annual covered inventory' refers to the number of internal combustion engine-powered light-duty automobiles manufactured or imported for sale in the United States in a given year. 'M85' is defined as a fuel mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline. The Open Fuel Standard for Transportation requires at least 50% of a manufacturer's annual covered inventory to be fuel choice-enabling automobiles in certain years. The Open Fuel Standard for Transportation mandates that a certain percentage of a manufacturer's annual inventory be fuel choice-enabling automobiles in specific years. Manufacturers can request exemptions from this requirement by submitting applications to the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary can temporarily exempt a light-duty automobile from fuel choice-enabling requirements if unavoidable events hinder the manufacturer from meeting production volumes, such as supply disruptions or component installation issues. The Secretary may temporarily exempt manufacturers from fuel choice-enabling requirements if production is hindered by unavoidable events. Applications from multiple manufacturers can be consolidated if similar. Exemptions are conditional on the manufacturer's commitment to recall and install omitted components when available. The Secretary may grant temporary exemptions to manufacturers for fuel choice-enabling requirements due to production hindrances. Notices of applications and decisions will be published in the Federal Register. Limited liability protection is provided for fuel containing ethanol or renewable fuel. The Secretary may grant temporary exemptions to manufacturers for fuel choice-enabling requirements. Limited liability protection is provided for fuel containing ethanol or renewable fuel used in internal combustion engines, unless it violates regulations imposed by the Administrator under the Clean Air Act. The Secretary of Transportation must issue regulations within one year of this section's enactment."
