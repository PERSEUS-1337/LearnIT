    "content": "In this paper, a novel regularization method called RotationOut is proposed for neural networks. Unlike Dropout, which acts on individual neurons/channels, RotationOut treats the input layer as a whole vector and applies regularization by randomly rotating it. This method can be applied to convolutional and recurrent layers with slight modifications. A noise analysis technique is used to explain the difference between RotationOut and Dropout in reducing co-adaptation. The paper also demonstrates how RotationOut/Dropout can be used in conjunction with Batch Normalization through experiments in vision and language tasks to showcase its effectiveness. Codes will be available. Dropout has been effective in preventing overfitting in various deep learning areas such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Different variants of Dropout have been proposed, focusing on improving Dropout structures by dropping weights or neurons, computing adaptive dropping probabilities, and dropping neurons in max-pooling kernels. These Dropout-like methods introduce randomness by dropping each neuron/channel independently in a layer. RotationOut is proposed as a regularization method for neural networks, introducing noise by randomly rotating the vector of neurons in a layer. This method aims to prevent co-adaptation between feature detectors and reduce overfitting by considering other neurons' information when adding noise. RotationOut introduces noise to neurons by randomly rotating their vectors, using activations of other neurons as noise to reduce co-adaptation. Random rotation matrices are used to add noise to the directions of feature vectors, affecting the learning of weights in neural networks. RotationOut introduces noise by randomly rotating feature vectors to stabilize weight learning directions. This method helps prevent overfitting in neural networks by reducing co-adaptations more effectively than Dropout. RotationOut is proposed as a regularization method for neural networks that reduces co-adaptations more effectively than Dropout. It achieves competitive results in image classification on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets, improves object detection on COCO datasets, and shows promise for LSTM models in speech recognition tasks on the Wall Street Journal corpus. RotationOut is a regularization method for neural networks that reduces co-adaptations more effectively than Dropout. It involves randomly rotating the feature vector and introducing noise to one neuron independently. The method is theoretically analyzed for noise reduction and its effectiveness is demonstrated in vision and language tasks. Related work includes Dropout, SpatialDropout, Shake-shake regularization, and Cutout for different types of layers in neural networks. Batch Normalization (BN) accelerates deep network training and acts as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. It discourages the use of dropout in modern ConvNet architectures like ResNet and DenseNet. Shake-shake regularization and Cutout drop regions from inputs/feature maps, while applying standard dropout to recurrent layers can hinder long-term memory retention. Some approaches like generating a dropout mask for each input sequence aim to maintain memory over time. In this paper, the authors investigate the absence of dropout in convolutions in networks like ResNet and DenseNet, attributing it to a variance shift. They use noise analysis to delve deeper into this issue. Previous studies have explored rotations in networks for data augmentation, with different approaches such as enriched feature maps and multiple rotated filter versions. The related work on network dissection discusses the interpretability of random rotations of learned features. The RotationOut method introduces random rotations of learned features as a strong regularization technique. It involves using rotation matrices to rotate feature vectors in neural networks. The complexity of generating random rotation matrices is reduced by using Givens rotations. The RotationOut method introduces random rotations of learned features using rotation matrices. The rotation operator R is generated by function M (P, \u03b8) with properties such as zero-centered noise and angle determination between vectors. Permutation P determines rotation direction and angle \u03b8 determines rotation angle. The complexity for generating random rotation matrices and matrix multiplication is O(D). RotationOut introduces random rotations of learned features using rotation matrices. Permutation P determines rotation direction, while angle \u03b8 controls the regularization strength. The random rotation matrix arranges input dimensions into pairs and rotates them with angle \u03b8. The noise between dimensions is exchanged, making RotationOut equivalent to Bernoulli Dropout and Gaussian Dropout. RotationOut introduces random rotations of learned features using rotation matrices. The noise between dimensions is exchanged, making RotationOut equivalent to Bernoulli Dropout and Gaussian Dropout. The pairs are randomly arranged, with one neuron regarding the activation of other neurons as noise. This reduces co-adaptations and promotes independence among neurons. RotationOut differs from Gaussian dropout as the noise for one neuron comes from other neurons. RotationOut introduces random rotations of learned features using rotation matrices, equivalent to Bernoulli Dropout and Gaussian Dropout. LR with RotationOut is similar to ridge regression, while LR with Dropout doubles diagonal elements for numerical stability. LR with RotationOut has a bounded condition number, unlike LR with Dropout which is unbounded. Next, an m-way classification model of logistic regression is considered. The m-way classification model of logistic regression considers the input x \u2208 R D and weights W = [w 1 , w 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , w m ] \u2208 R m\u00d7D. The probability of x belonging to category k is determined by the angle \u03b8 i between x and w i. When \u03b8 i < \u03b8 j are close, RotationOut can change the angles to ensure correct classification by creating a gap between them. RotationOut changes the boundary from \u03b8 i < \u03b8 j to \u03b8 i < \u03b8 j \u2212 \u0398, where \u0398 is a positive constant dependent on regularization. Dropout with low keep rates leads to lower performance by rotating the feature vector. Lower keep rates result in bigger rotation angles, affecting the training process in neural networks with multiple hidden layers. The MLP feed-forward operation with RotationOut in training time involves rotating zero-centered features and adding the expectation back. This is done to ensure proper regularization strength, especially in cases where features are not zero-centered. RotationOut operation is removed at test time. In the 2D case, input for convolutional layers is three-dimensional: number of channels C, width H, and height W. Each x hw is considered a feature. In the 2D case, input for convolutional layers is three-dimensional with channels C, width H, and height W. RotationOut involves rotating feature vectors with the same directions but different angles to maintain spatial correlation in convolutional feature maps. RotationOut can be combined with DropBlock for extra performance gain. RotationOut can be used in recurrent networks to add noise and reduce co-adaptations between neurons. The correlation coefficient is used to evaluate co-adaptations, which is equivalent to mutual information when assuming Gaussian distributions of neurons. The co-adaptations between neurons can be evaluated using the correlation coefficient or mutual information. The ideal scenario is when neurons are mutually independent. Co-adaptations are defined as the distance between the covariance matrix \u03a3 and the diagonal matrix diag(\u03a3). Normalization term trace(\u03a3) defines the regularization strength. Noise, such as Dropout or RotationOut, should follow zero-center and non-trivial assumptions. Dropout with a keep rate p reduces co-adaptation by p times, while RotationOut reduces co-adaptation by p. RotationOut reduces co-adaptation by adding noise to neurons independently, reducing correlation coefficients and increasing uncertainty. Zero-center assumption and non-trivial noise help in reducing co-adaptations, with a focus on regularization strength. In this section, RotationOut is evaluated for image classification, object detection, and speech recognition using CIFAR100 dataset. Ablation studies are conducted, comparing RotationOut with other regularization techniques on tasks like image classification on ILSVRC dataset and object detection on COCO dataset. The CIFAR100 dataset comprises 60,000 color images of 32x32 pixels and 100 classes. The CIFAR100 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of 32x32 pixels and 100 classes. The dataset is split into a training set with 50,000 images and a test set with 10,000 images. Image classification experiments are conducted with a focus on regularization abilities. Experiment settings for different regularization techniques are the same, following the approach from He et al. (2016). Data augmentation methods include zero-padding, random cropping, and horizontal mirroring. The experiments use the same optimizer with specific parameters and learning rate adjustments at different iterations. We compare the regularization abilities of RotationOut and Dropout on ResNet110 and WideResNet28-10 architectures using different numbers of filters and feature map sizes. The experiments are repeated 5 times, recording the best validation accuracy and average validation accuracy of the last 10 epochs. The top 1 validation accuracy is reported as \"mean \u00b1 standard deviation\" of the 5 runs. The study compares RotationOut and Dropout regularization on ResNet110 and WideResNet28-10 architectures with different filter numbers and feature map sizes. RotationOut and Dropout are applied to specific convolutional layers based on the architecture. Results on CIFAR100 dataset show minimal performance differences between RotationOut and Dropout with Gaussian distributions. Tables present results for ResNet110 and WideResNet28-10 architectures. The study compares RotationOut and Dropout regularization on ResNet110 and WideResNet28-10 architectures. Results show that heavier regularization is needed for WideResNet28-10 due to its larger parameters. ImageNet Classification dataset with 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images is used. RotationOut is applied with a normal distribution to specific layers in Res3, Res4, and the last fully connected layer. Using the DropBlock idea, RotationOut achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing a 2.07% improvement over the baseline. Results are significantly better than Dropout and SpatialDropout, with ResNet-50 + DropBlock outperforming other regularization techniques. In Object Detection on MS COCO, RotationOut is applied to the ResNet backbone using RetinaNet as the detection method. The model is trained for 35 epochs with specific hyperparameters and evaluated on COCO val2017. Results are compared with DropBlock (Ghiasi et al., 2018) in table 3. RotationOut is introduced as an alternative to dropout for neural networks, adding continuous noise to data/features while preserving semantics. The method reduces co-adaptations in neural networks, improving training and accuracy. Further analysis on co-adaptations is suggested for future work. The proposed correlation analysis is not optimal for explaining differences between standard Dropout and Gaussian dropout, or methods like Shake-shake regularization. Further work on co-adaptation analysis can help understand noise-based regularization methods. RotationOut complexity is O(D) due to avoiding matrix multiplications for Rx. A sparse matrix in Equation 18 is similar to a permutation matrix combination, eliminating the need for matrix multiplications. The output is obtained through slicing and elementwise multiplication. The text discusses the impact of applying Dropout before Batch Normalization in neural networks. It highlights the variance inconsistency issue between training and inference, leading to unstable behaviors and erroneous predictions. This is explained using mathematical equations and the importance of maintaining consistent statistical variance for Batch Normalization. The text discusses the variance inconsistency issue in neural networks when using Dropout before Batch Normalization. It suggests using a more variance-stable form, Dropout-b, and expanding the input dimension of weight layer D to mitigate the problem. Li et al. (2019) argues for different approaches to address the variance shift between training and inference.

It suggests using a more variance-stable form, Dropout-b, and expanding the input dimension of weight layer D to mitigate the problem. Li et al. (2019) argues for different approaches to address the variance shift between training and inference. In Equation 16, the variance shift is the only term to reduce co-adaptations. Uout is variance-stable but provides less regularization, equivalent to Dropout with a higher keep rate. The length of w does not affect the ratio between training and testing variance, assuming it is fixed. The ratio in Dropout-b is more centered when the activation function is ReLU. Sample n weights to make the weight layer W, the maximum ratio in Dropout-a is bigger than in Dropout-b with high probability. Dropout-b helps mitigate variance inconsistency in neural networks, with more stable variance shift among dimensions compared to Dropout-a. Dropout-a may lead to serious numerical instability due to a higher training/testing variance ratio. Zero-centered Dropout-a can be a solution to this issue, as verified on the CIFAR100 dataset using ResNet110. Applying Dropout between convolutions of residual blocks can further improve stability. In ResNet110, Dropout is applied between convolutions in the third residual stage with three types tested. Variance calculations for BN layers are done in training and testing modes to measure variance shift. For Dropout-a-centered, the running variance is reduced by 1/p times to improve stability. In an experiment on speech recognition using RotationOut, a four-layer bidirectional LSTM network was trained on the WSJ dataset. The model had input, hidden, and output dimensions of 40, 512, and 137 respectively. Adam optimizer with specific parameters was used, and the model was trained for 80 epochs. The edit distance between predictions and ground truth was reported on the \"eval92\" test set. The performance of different regularization methods, including Batch Normalization (BN), is evaluated on the \"eval92\" test set. BN introduces noise to neurons similar to Dropout, with noise increasing nonlinearity as batch size decreases, leading to performance drop. The study evaluates the performance of Batch Normalization (BN) on the \"eval92\" test set. BN introduces noise to neurons, increasing nonlinearity as batch size decreases, leading to a performance drop. Cross normalization is proposed as an alternative method to BN, using sample mean and variance for normalization. Cross normalization is tested as an alternative to Batch Normalization (BN) on the CIFAR100 dataset with ResNet50. Results show that with a small batch size of 8 and 16, cross normalization has lower test loss but similar test accuracy compared to BN, indicating that nonlinearity is an important issue for BN in small batch sizes."
