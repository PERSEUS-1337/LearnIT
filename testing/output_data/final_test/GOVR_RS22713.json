Import controls were placed on farm-raised aquatic animals from China in June 2007. Baxter Healthcare Corporation temporarily halted the manufacture of heparin in January 2008. The FDA temporarily halted the manufacture of heparin due to serious adverse events, including deaths and complications. A Chinese firm producing an active ingredient for heparin was not certified by the Chinese government. The FDA issued warnings on contaminated infant formula and milk products imported from China. The FDA issued warnings on contaminated infant formula and milk products imported from China. Products containing milk from China were detained unless proven melamine-free. The NHTSA ordered a recall of tires made in China due to safety defects. CPSC issued alerts and recalls on Chinese-made products, with a significant number involving excessive lead levels in toys. In 2008 and 2009, millions of Chinese-made toys were recalled due to various safety hazards, including excessive lead levels, loose magnets, toxic chemicals, and potential finger entrapment. Additionally, concerns were raised about health and safety hazards of Chinese-made drywall products emitting sulfur gases that corrode copper coils and electrical components in American homes. The CPSC received reports from residents in multiple states and the District of Columbia linking health symptoms and metal corrosion in homes to Chinese drywall. An investigation began in 2009 to assess these issues and trace the origin and distribution of the drywall. China's government is also looking into the complaints. U.S. imports of Chinese plaster products, including drywall, fluctuated between 2005 and 2008. Proposed bills in Congress would require the CPSC to study and test Chinese drywall imported from 2004-2007. The CPSC investigated health symptoms and metal corrosion in homes linked to Chinese drywall in 2009. Proposed bills in Congress aimed to analyze the composition of drywall imported from China in 2004-2007 and issue an interim ban on hazardous products. Additionally, there were concerns over various Chinese imports in 2008, including toys, seafood, and tires. China was a major source of imports for various products that raised U.S. health and safety concerns, including toys, seafood, tires, animal foods, organic chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Despite these concerns, U.S. imports of most products increased in 2008. Analysts criticize China's fragmented and ineffective health and safety regime for manufactured goods and agricultural products, citing weak consumer protection laws, lack of inspections, and proliferation of fake goods. The challenges in China's health and safety regime include poor interagency cooperation, fake goods, unlicensed producers, pollution, intense competition leading to corner-cutting, lack of consumer protection advocacy groups, and government corruption. Chinese officials argue that most Chinese-made products are safe but acknowledge health and safety problems. They also blame U.S. importers and designers for some recalled products and note that some U.S. products fail to meet Chinese standards. In China, there have been numerous health and safety issues with products, including fake baby formula causing infant deaths, tainted injections leading to fatalities, and defective drugs causing harm. The government has implemented initiatives to improve supervision, increase inspections, require safety certificates, and combat corruption. Former officials have been sentenced for taking bribes in exchange for product approvals. In China, a former official was sentenced to death for taking bribes in exchange for approving untested and fake medicines. The government announced plans to establish a national food recall system and ban the sale of unsafe toys. A nationwide inspection found dangerous industrial materials in food production, leading to the closure of 180 unsafe food factories. The Chinese government conducted millions of inspections, finding issues in thousands of food businesses and closing unlicensed ones. They made amendments to food safety standards, established an emergency response mechanism, and pledged $1 billion to improve safety by 2010. China also announced mandatory government inspections for all food shipments and created a panel to oversee product quality and safety. China implemented a nationwide campaign to improve food and goods quality, shutting down 47,800 unlicensed food factories. They inspected 3,000 toy manufacturers, revoking licenses for 600 firms. A new food safety law was enacted in 2009 to enhance monitoring, toughen standards, and establish a product tracking system. Chinese courts would accept lawsuits from parents regarding food safety issues. In 2009, Chinese courts allowed parents to sue over melamine-tainted milk products. The government investigated 76,500 fake food cases in 2008, but reports of tainted products continued. Incidents included pesticide-contaminated dumplings in Japan and melamine-tainted infant formula in China, leading to deaths and hospitalizations. Officials were removed for cover-ups, and 22 Chinese baby formula companies were found with tainted products. In October 2008, 22 Chinese baby formula companies were found to have tainted products, leading to a blanket recall of all dairy products made before September 14, 2008. The Chinese government reported that melamine-tainted formula had killed six children and sickened 294,000 others. Additionally, some egg imports from China were found to be contaminated with high levels of melamine. The United States and China had agreements in 2007 to address health and safety concerns. China and the United States signed agreements in 2007 to enhance consumer product safety, with China committing to prevent exports of unsafe products to the U.S. Efforts included increased inspections, educating Chinese manufacturers, and developing a product tracking system. Additionally, in 2007, the NHTSA signed a cooperation agreement with China on vehicle safety, and the U.S. HHS signed agreements on specific food and feed items of concern. The FDA and CPSC signed agreements with China in 2007 to enhance consumer product safety. The agreements require Chinese firms exporting food, feed, drugs, and medical devices to the U.S. to register with the Chinese government and meet U.S. standards. Annual inspections and information sharing mechanisms are established to ensure compliance. Congressional concerns led to proposals for increased inspections and regulations on imported products. The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 tightened U.S. health and safety regulations, including increased inspections and funding for product safety agencies. Concerns over Chinese product safety could lead to trade friction and impact foreign investment in China's manufacturing sector. Efforts by China to restore international confidence in the health and safety of its exports through increased inspections, certification requirements, and mandatory testing could impact the cost of doing business in China, slow the pace of Chinese exports, and hurt employment in the export sector. International concerns over the safety of Chinese products may hinder the government's efforts to develop internationally recognized Chinese brands. The Chinese government is likely to take this issue seriously, but the timeline for effective action is uncertain. The Chinese government faces challenges in addressing government corruption and counterfeiting to ensure exports meet health and safety standards. Decreased purchases of Chinese products by U.S. consumers could impact U.S. firms and raise prices. Efforts to regulate the toy industry have led to a decline in lead-related recalls, but the melamine-tainted food crisis has raised doubts about product safety in China. The Chinese government faces challenges in ensuring product safety and addressing corruption. Allegations of officials ignoring safety issues until media exposure highlight ongoing regulatory challenges."
