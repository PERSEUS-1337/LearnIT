The department may prohibit authorized end uses if they pose environmental or public health harm, with notification given 60 days prior.

This section does not impact regulations on processing CRT panel glass for disposal or waste classification from listed end use products. This section clarifies that the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling's authority is not affected. It also specifies that certain CRT panel glass used for specific products like food packaging or medical devices are exempt from this section.
