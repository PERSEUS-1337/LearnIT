    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Joseph Moakley Memorial Fire Safe Cigarette Act of 2002\". Congress finds that cigarette ignited fires are the leading cause of fire deaths in the United States, resulting in numerous fatalities, injuries, and property damage. It is necessary to establish a cigarette fire safety standard for the manufacture and importation of cigarettes to address this issue. The Commission found that the annual cost of human life and property loss due to the absence of a cigarette fire safety standard is $4.6 billion. It is recommended that the Consumer Product Safety Commission utilize its regulatory expertise to enforce this standard. SEC. 3. CIGARETTE FIRE SAFETY STANDARD. The Commission must establish fire safety standards for cigarettes within 18 months of the Act, using specific testing methodology to reduce ignition risk. The Commission must establish fire safety standards for cigarettes within 18 months of the Act, using specific testing methodology to reduce ignition risk. Testing requirements include conducting tests on 10 layers of filter paper and completing 40 replicate tests for each cigarette. A test failure is defined as more than 25 percent of cigarettes failing to self-extinguish before burning the full length of the tobacco column. The Commission may accept proposed testing methodologies for cigarettes with unique characteristics if they meet ignition propensity standards. Additionally, the Commission has the authority to regulate cigarette paper in addition to establishing fire safety standards for cigarettes. The Commission may regulate the ignition propensity of cigarette paper for roll-your-own tobacco products. If the Commission fails to prescribe the required standard, it will continue to apply as a consumer product safety standard. The rule under subsection (a) includes a prohibition on stockpiling cigarettes subject to fire safety standards. The rule under subsection (a) prohibits stockpiling cigarettes subject to fire safety standards. Stockpiling is defined as manufacturing or importing cigarettes at a rate greater than the one-year average before the standard takes effect. The rule must be prescribed according to section 553 of title 5, United States Code. Modifications to the rule can be made by the sponsor of the testing methodology. The sponsor must notify the Commission of any modifications to the testing methodology under subsection (a)(2). The Commission may incorporate the modification if it enhances a fire safety standard. The Commission has the authority to modify the rule under subsection (a) if compliance is technically feasible and enhances fire safety. The rule required by subsection (a) can be modified if it enhances fire safety and is technically feasible. No other federal laws or executive orders, except for the Administrative Procedures Act, apply to the promulgation or modification of this rule. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 are referenced in the rule. The effective date of the rule must be specified by the Commission and may not be later than 30 months after the enactment of this Act. The fire safety standard will be treated as a consumer product safety standard under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Cigarettes will be treated as consumer products under the Act. The Consumer Product Safety Act designates the fire safety standard as a consumer product for enforcement purposes. SEC. 4. PREEMPTION. This Act and any cigarette fire safety standard established under section 3 cannot preempt or affect state laws with stricter fire safety standards for cigarettes. Private remedies under the Consumer Product Safety Act apply to the fire safety standard. SEC. 5. SCOPE OF JURISDICTION OF CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION. The Commission does not have jurisdiction over tobacco or tobacco products. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Commission\" refers to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and \"cigarette\" is defined as per the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $2,000,000 is authorized for the Consumer Product Safety Commission for fiscal year 2002 to carry out this Act, with funds remaining available until expended."
