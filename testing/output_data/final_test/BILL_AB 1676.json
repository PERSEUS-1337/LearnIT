    "title": "AB 1676",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature of California acknowledges the persistent wage disparities, especially for women of color, with African American women making 63 cents and Hispanic women less than 43 cents for every dollar white non-Hispanic men earn. The practice of seeking salary history and using prior salary to set pay rates perpetuates wage inequalities across occupations, with women being paid less than men in 99.6 percent of jobs. Employers using prior salaries in salary decisions disadvantage women, perpetuating gender bias. Government officials recognize this impact and advise eliminating discriminatory pay gaps based on prior salary. In July 2015, the federal Office of Personnel Management warned against using salary history in pay decisions, as it could harm candidates returning to work after a career break or whose pay does not reflect their qualifications or market conditions. Courts have cautioned against using salary history to justify wage disparities, stating that prior salary alone cannot justify pay differences. In Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, the Supreme Court ruled that paying women less than men for the same work is not a valid reason under the Equal Pay Act. In Rizo v. Yovino, the court denied summary judgment based on the risk of perpetuating wage disparities by relying solely on prior wages. The court emphasized that justifying pay differentials between men and women based on historical market forces perpetuates discriminatory wage disparities, which goes against the Equal Pay Act's goal of eradicating sex-based assumptions and stereotypes. This act amends Section 1197.5 of the Labor Code to prohibit employers from using prior salary to justify wage differentials between employees of opposite sexes. It aims to promote fair salary negotiations based on job requirements and qualifications, rather than past earnings that may reflect gender-based wage disparities in the labor market. The wage differential is based on factors like seniority, merit, production quality/quantity, or bona fide factors unrelated to sex. These factors must be job-related, not derived from sex-based differences, and serve a business necessity. Each factor must be applied reasonably. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement enforces the wage differential factors, ensuring they are applied reasonably. Employers violating the law are liable for wages deprived to employees, with additional liquidated damages. Acceptance of payment in full constitutes a waiver of the employee's cause of action. Every employer must maintain records of wages, job classifications, and employment terms for all employees for three years. Employees can file complaints with the division if they believe they are not receiving the wages they are entitled to or if the employer is violating certain provisions. The division will investigate the complaint confidentially and take necessary actions to enforce payment of any unpaid wages. The department or division can file a civil action on behalf of employees to recover unpaid wages and damages, with employee consent waiving their cause of action unless the action is dismissed without prejudice within 180 days. Any employee who is underpaid can sue for the balance of wages, interest, liquidated damages, and legal fees. The lawsuit must be filed within two years, or three years for willful violations. An employee must return recovered amounts to the employer if they also receive additional recovery under federal law for the same violation. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for invoking their rights under this section, including discussing wages. An employee who faces discharge, discrimination, or retaliation for engaging in specified conduct can seek reinstatement, lost wages, and benefits through a civil action within one year. Employers are prohibited from paying employees of one gender less than the opposite gender for similar work, unless justified by specific factors. The wage differential is based on factors like seniority, merit, production quality/quantity, or bona fide factors other than sex. These factors must be job-related, not derived from sex-based differences, and serve a business necessity. Each factor must be applied reasonably. An employer must not pay employees of different races or ethnicities less for similar work unless justified by factors like seniority, merit, or production quality/quantity. These factors must be job-related and applied reasonably. The merit system and factors like quantity/quality of production or bona fide factors other than race/ethnicity, such as education or experience, can justify wage differentials. These factors must be job-related, applied reasonably, and consistent with business necessity. The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement enforces the factors justifying wage differentials and penalties for violations. Acceptance of payment in full constitutes a waiver of the employee's cause of action. Every employer must maintain records of wages, job classifications, and terms of employment for all employees for three years. Any employee can file a complaint with the division if they believe they are not receiving the wages they are entitled to or if the employer is violating certain provisions. The division will keep the employee's name confidential until the validity of the complaint is established. The division will take necessary actions to enforce payment of any unpaid wages. The department or division can file a civil action on behalf of employees to recover unpaid wages and damages, with employee consent waiving their cause of action unless the action is dismissed without prejudice within 180 days. An employee can recover unpaid wages, interest, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees in a civil action if they are receiving less than the entitled wage. The civil action must be filed within two years, or three years for willful violations, from the cause of action. If an employee recovers amounts due under subdivision (c) and files a complaint under federal law resulting in additional recovery, they must return the lesser amount to the employer. Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for enforcing this section or discussing wages. Any employee who has faced discharge, discrimination, or retaliation for engaging in specified conduct can seek reinstatement, lost wages reimbursement, and equitable relief through a civil action within one year. Section 2.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Labor Code, contingent on the enactment of Senate Bill 1063 before January 1, 2017. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. The costs incurred by a local agency or school district will be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
