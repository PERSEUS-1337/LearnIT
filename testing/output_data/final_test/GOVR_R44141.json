    "content": "The report discusses the FY2016 budget request, congressional actions, and appropriations for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of the Census within the Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The focus is on the Census Bureau, which has a larger budget. The Economics and Statistics Administration provides policy support through the Commerce Department's Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) provides policy support and management oversight for the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau. ESA conducts economic research, monitors economic developments, analyzes fiscal and monetary policies, and evaluates major trading partners' economic conditions and policy initiatives. The Bureau of Economic Analysis presents valuable information on U.S. economic growth, regional development, inter-industry relationships, and the nation's position in the world economy. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces statistical measures such as GDP, personal income, corporate profits, and industry-specific GDP. The Census Bureau collects demographic, economic, housing, and governmental data. The FY2016 budget request for the Economics and Statistics Administration was $113.8 million, with $3.9 million allocated for policy support and management oversight. The FY2016 funding increase requested for BEA was $13.7 million (14.2%) more than the agency's FY2015-enacted funding level. Three initiatives were proposed in the budget justification for ESA: \"big data for small business\" ($1.9 million), \"energy satellite account\" ($2.0 million), and \"services trade initiative\" ($3.2 million). These initiatives aimed to track small business growth, analyze energy supply and consumption, and provide more detail on traded services data. The FY2016 budget request for the Census Bureau was $1,500.0 million, $412.0 million more than the FY2015-enacted amount. The increase was mainly for preparations for the 2020 Decennial Census, which is the bureau's most costly endeavor. Funding for the decennial census peaks in the census year and decreases afterward. The FY2016 request was divided between the bureau's two major accounts and included a restructuring of certain activities. The Census Bureau's FY2016 budget request included a restructuring of activities between its two major accounts. The Salaries and Expenses account was renamed \"Current Surveys and Programs,\" while the other account remained unchanged. This realignment aimed to better align appropriations with the bureau's programmatic structure, with annual programs now in the Current Surveys account. The restructuring was budget neutral overall, but the requested amounts for the two accounts changed to $277.9 million for Current Surveys and Programs and $1,222.1 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs. The FY2016 budget request for Current Economic Statistics was $191.6 million, with business statistics receiving $43.9 million. Construction statistics provide national performance indicators for the economy. The construction sector provides national performance indicators for the economy, derived from data on building permits, housing starts, and construction put in place. The FY2016 request for construction statistics was $13.1 million, while manufacturing statistics come from sources like the Annual Survey of Manufactures and the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey. The $21.5 million requested for manufacturing statistics in FY2016 was $2.3 million more than the previous year. General economic statistics originate from administrative records of agencies like the IRS, Social Security Administration, and BLS. The FY2016 budget request for general economic statistics was $65.1 million, an increase of $2.2 million from FY2015. Foreign trade statistics, requested at $35.7 million, saw a $898,000 increase from the previous year. Government statistics cover revenues, expenditures, debt, and employment of state and local governments. The FY2016 budget request for government statistics was $12.4 million, an increase of $345,000 from FY2015. Current Demographic Statistics in FY2016 had a budget request of $86.2 million, including collections and analyses of demographic data like the monthly Current Population Survey. The CPS conducts various supplements throughout the year, covering topics such as child support, tobacco use, volunteers, and food security. Vacant housing units in the CPS are eligible for the Housing Vacancy Survey, which produces quarterly housing vacancy rates. The FY2016 request for household surveys was $56.6 million, an increase of $982,000 from FY2015. The Census Bureau conducts research on income, poverty, and housing statistics in the U.S. The FY2016 budget request for population and housing analyses was $9.6 million, an increase from the previous year. The bureau provides demographic estimates by age, sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity for various geographic areas. The FY2016 budget request for intercensal demographic estimates was $10.2 million. The Census Bureau's FY2016 budget request is above the FY2015-enacted amount, with key programs including the 2020 Decennial Census, American Community Survey, Economic Census, and Census of Governments. The new IT initiative, Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing System (CEDCaP), will impact data collections. The population census is constitutionally required every 10 years for apportioning House seats and distributing federal funds. The Administration requested $662.6 million for these efforts. The Administration requested $662.6 million for the 2020 Decennial Census in FY2016, a significant increase from the previous year. The Census Bureau is mandated to control the cost of the census and is aiming to conduct the 2020 census at a lower cost per housing unit than in 2010. The 2010 census was the most expensive in U.S. history, costing nearly $13 billion in constant 2010 dollars. The Census Bureau is focusing on cost-control innovations for the 2020 census, including updating address frames using technology and offering an online response option to reduce mail phase operations. The Census Bureau is proposing cost-control innovations for the 2020 census, including using administrative records to reduce nonresponse follow-up and implementing operational control systems to track progress. These innovations could save over $5 billion compared to the 2010 design. Activities in preparation for the 2020 census include research and testing of new census methods. The Census Bureau conducted research and testing for its 2020 census innovations to inform design decisions for the Operational Plan. Planned activities for FY2016 include an early operations test focused on address canvassing and testing how people respond to the census via electronic devices. The budget justification for the 2020 Census includes plans for nonresponse follow-up, a communication program, and quality control of field operations. Adequate funding is needed for operational design and systems testing to ensure a properly planned Operational Readiness Test in 2018 and mitigate risks associated with design changes for the 2020 Census. The budget justification for the 2020 Census includes plans for nonresponse follow-up, communication program, and quality control of field operations, especially related to using technology. The American Community Survey replaced the decennial census long form, collecting detailed data from small samples of the population at regular intervals. The American Community Survey (ACS) is conducted in every county of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all Puerto Rican municipios. It provides detailed data for small geographic areas and groups within the population, releasing over 11 billion estimates annually. The Administration's FY2016 request for the ACS was $256.8 million, with plans to enhance data quality and secure cooperation from respondents. The failed edit follow-up operation was aimed at collecting incomplete data, and eliminating it in previous years led to increased missing data rates. The budget justification for FY2013 through FY2015 highlighted increased missing data rates after the cut, affecting data quality. Field representative refresher training was emphasized to improve interactions with respondents and survey understanding. General performance reviews by regional office supervisors were also crucial for reinforcing correct interviewing techniques and conduct. Failure to conduct these reviews risked negative consequences similar to the suspension of refresher training. The budget justification proposed terminating three-year ACS data products for areas with at least 20,000 residents due to resource constraints. It also suggested conducting research to reduce respondent burden, reviewing all ACS questions, and exploring monthly production of national- and state-level ACS estimates. The economic census dates back to the 19th century in response to increased industrial activity. The economic census, conducted every five years, provides vital information about the U.S. economy and is crucial for measures like GDP and national income accounts. The Administration requested $134.9 million for economic census activities in FY2016, a 13.1% increase from FY2015. The 2017 and 2012 Economic Census cycles overlap, with the bureau intending to finish releasing data. The budget justification for the Census Bureau in FY2016 includes plans to release data from the 2012 Survey of Business Owners and continue planning for the 2017 Economic Census. The bureau aims to use electronic response methods for the 2017 census and conduct the census of governments in conjunction with the economic census to cover a significant portion of GDP. The Census Bureau is the main source of information on the public sector of the U.S. economy, providing data on government organization, employees, finances, and public pension systems. The National Academy of Sciences recognizes Census Bureau data as the only comprehensive source on the fiscal welfare of state and local governments, which account for 12% of GDP and 15% of the civilian labor force. The FY2016 budget request for the census of governments was $8.9 million, slightly lower than the previous year. The FY2016 budget request for the census of governments was $8.9 million, slightly lower than the previous year. The proposed decrease in funding is due to a shift in focus towards planning and preparation for the 2017 Census of Governments, which aims to reduce expenses by using a mix of survey methods and administrative record practices. The 2017 census will also involve expanded use of state-level electronic data collection to lessen the reporting burden on governments. The FY2016 budget includes funding for the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing System (CEDCaP), an IT initiative aimed at creating an integrated system for data collection and processing across various census programs. This initiative will consolidate costs by retiring survey-specific systems and bring a greater portion of IT expenditures under a single, centrally managed system. The Census Bureau aims to consolidate IT expenditures under a single, integrated program with the Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing System (CEDCaP). This initiative will replace multiple systems currently in use and focus on supporting the 2020 Decennial Census and the 2017 Economic Census. The Administration requested $47.3 million for CEDCaP in FY2016. The Government Accountability Office identified CEDCaP as an IT investment in need of attention, projected to cost about $548 million through 2020. CEDCaP consists of 14 projects, with 4 related to the 2020 Decennial Census Internet response option. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended H.R. 2578, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, on May 27, 2015. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $100.0 million for the Economics and Statistics Administration in the Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. The House passed H.R. 2578 on June 3, 2015, with a funding level for ESA retained. The committee approved $1,113.0 million in FY2016 funding for the Census Bureau, restructuring its major accounts. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $100.0 million for the Economics and Statistics Administration in the Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. The committee approved $1,113.0 million in FY2016 funding for the Census Bureau, restructuring its major accounts. The committee recommended transferring $1.6 million of the FY2016 funding for Census Bureau oversight to the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General. They expressed concerns about the burdensome nature of the ACS and directed the bureau to focus on its core decennial Census activities. The recommendation included withholding 50% of funds for IT related to the 2020 census until an expenditure plan for CEDCaP was submitted. The ranking Members of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies expressed concerns about the FY2016 funding level for the Census Bureau, stating that it could lead to significant reductions in 2020 Census systems research and testing. The Administration also opposed House passage of H.R. 2578, citing inadequate funding for the 2020 census and potential threats to data availability for areas with small populations. The House passed H.R. 2578 with recommendations for the Census Bureau but faced potential veto from the President due to amendments transferring funds to the Department of Justice and making ACS responses voluntary. The bill would have left the bureau with $991.7 million in total funding, below the FY2015-enacted amount. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for various programs in FY2016, with Current Surveys and Programs receiving $16.9 million less than requested and Periodic Censuses and Programs receiving $491.4 million less than requested. The Committee recommended $100.0 million for the Economics and Statistics Administration, identical to the FY2015 funding level, and $1,128.0 million for the Census Bureau, $40.0 million below the requested amount. H.R. 2578 recommended $1,128.0 million for the Census Bureau in FY2016, $40.0 million above the FY2015 funding level. The committee approved the bureau's proposed restructuring of its major accounts, with Current Surveys and Programs receiving $266.0 million and Periodic Censuses and Programs funded at $862.0 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee also allocated $1.6 million for Census Bureau oversight. The Senate committee directed the Census Bureau to reduce the cost of the 2020 Decennial Census below the 2010 Census level and obtain necessary records for a more efficient nonresponse follow-up. They also emphasized the importance of securing the new CEDCaP initiative against cyber attacks. Additionally, the committee expressed support for the American Community Survey (ACS) as a vital source of data for various entities but requested an updated report from the bureau. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, H.R. 2029, P.L. 114-113, became law on December 18, 2015, providing funding for the Census Bureau and the American Community Survey (ACS). The act allocates $109.0 million for ESA, $9.0 million more than FY2015, and $1,370.0 million for the Census Bureau, $282.0 million more than FY2015. The Senate committee requested an updated report on efforts to reduce the number of ACS questions and ensure efficient survey conduct. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, allocated $270.0 million for Current Surveys and Programs, $9.0 million above the House-passed amount. For Periodic Censuses and Programs, $1,100.0 million was provided, $122.1 million less than requested but exceeding the House-passed amount by $369.3 million. The act approves the bureau's restructuring of its major accounts and maintains the mandatory nature of ACS responses."
