    "content": "The House passed several western water resource bills in July and September, including three bills amending the Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI recycling authorization. Seven House-passed Title XVI bills are now pending before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senators Murkowski and Feinstein introduced a bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act. Representative Napolitano introduced an identical bill. Several western water resource bills became law in October, including bills on salt cedar eradication and transferring federal water distribution facilities. A bill authorizing a desalination project in Dana Point, CA, has been reported from the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Legislation to establish a National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) passed the House in September. Members of the House and Senate prepared to respond to a settlement agreement regarding the San Joaquin River. A settlement agreement was reached among water users, the federal government, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) regarding the operation of the federal Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River. The agreement aims to provide water to support salmon habitat in reaches of the river that have been dry since the mid-1940s due to irrigation diversions. Congressional authorization would be required for many activities outlined in the settlement. Concerns arise about how reintroduction of federally threatened or endangered species (salmon) would impact existing irrigation and power project operations. The federal government has been involved in developing water projects for various purposes, including flood control, navigation, power generation, and irrigation. The Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have traditionally constructed major water projects. The Corps focuses on flood control, navigation, and power generation, while the Bureau's projects are primarily for irrigation and reclamation of arid lands. Municipal and industrial water supply is a secondary responsibility for both agencies. The Bureau of Reclamation operates numerous storage reservoirs and diversion dams, providing water to millions of acres of farmland and people in western states. They also manage power plants and have increased security measures post-9/11. The Reclamation Act of 1902 authorized the construction of water projects in the arid West to encourage settlement and farming. Construction of these projects expanded in the 1930s and 1940s but declined in the late 1960s due to changing priorities and increasing costs. Water supply for traditional uses began to compete with in-stream uses like recreation and scenic enjoyment. During the 1970s, construction of new water projects slowed down, with a focus on completing major works like the Tellico Dam project in Tennessee and the Tennessee Tombigbee waterway in Alabama and Mississippi. This led to conflicts between conservation groups, fiscal conservatives, and traditional water resources developers. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 required environmental assessments for federal projects, increasing public scrutiny. President Carter announced a shift towards economically viable water projects, cooperation with state and local entities, and environmental sustainability in federal water policy in 1978. The Reagan Administration opposed large water projects as fiscally unsound, leading to a halt in new federally financed construction until the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. Federal water research and planning activities were reduced, with a focus on states taking a greater role. President Reagan abolished the Water Resources Council, leading to changes in project authorization, repayment structures, and cost-sharing. In the 1980s, Congress passed laws changing water project operations and cost-sharing structures. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 revised water pricing policies, while the 1986 WRDA increased local entities' construction cost share. Both the Corps and the Bureau have worked on projects to prevent environmental degradation from water projects and expand water supply facilities. The federal government is currently involved in various restoration initiatives. The federal government is involved in restoration initiatives in various regions, including the Florida Everglades, California Bay-Delta, and Columbia and Snake River basins. These initiatives are controversial and involve multiple stakeholders. Demand for water resource projects, such as augmenting local water supplies and controlling floods, continues. Additionally, there is a demand for new large water supply projects like Auburn and Temperance Flats dams in California. The 109th Congress is considering various water resource issues, including re-authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation's water recycling program and oversight of ongoing agency activities like water management in different river basins and CALFED restoration proposals in California. The 109th Congress is discussing federal water activities and the establishment of a National Water Commission. H.R. 135, which would create the commission, has passed the House and is now with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Funding and policy direction in the Energy and Water appropriations bill impact project construction and operation. Security concerns at Bureau of Reclamation facilities were addressed in a hearing by the House Resources Water and Power Subcommittee. The Bureau of Reclamation closed visitor facilities and cancelled tours after September 11, 2001. Security measures were heightened at facilities during code-orange alerts. In February 2004, the road over Folsom Dam was closed due to security concerns. The Bureau received $30.3 million for security at its facilities as part of emergency supplemental funding in FY2002. The Bureau of Reclamation received varying amounts for site security in FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006. For FY2007, $39.6 million is requested. The Klamath River Basin has been a focal point for water management discussions. The Bureau of Reclamation received funding for site security in FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006, with a request for $39.6 million in FY2007. Water deliveries to 200,000 acres of farm and pasture lands in the Klamath Project were reduced to protect endangered fish species. Tensions arose in 2002 due to low water flows and high temperatures leading to salmon deaths. The Klamath Project faces complex water management issues involving various stakeholders. Farmers in the Klamath Project are concerned about their contractual rights to water deliveries and the potential hardships if water is cut off. Some suggest providing temporary economic assistance to farmers while protecting the economically valuable salmon fishery. The Bureau of Reclamation issued a 10-year operations plan in 2002 to address the issue of meeting irrigation contract obligations without jeopardizing endangered fish species. However, subsequent biological opinions found that the plan could threaten the existence of listed suckers and coho salmon. The Bureau of Reclamation rejected biological opinions in 2002 that could harm listed suckers and coho salmon. Despite criticism, they operated under a one-year plan and issued subsequent plans in 2003 and 2005. In 2005, the Bureau of Reclamation's 10-year operation plan was deemed \"arbitrary and capricious\" by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals due to a lack of analysis on the effects of project operations on coho salmon. The court decision's impact on Klamath project operations remains uncertain. The National Research Council (NRC) evaluated federal biological opinions in 2001 regarding water delivery to farmers. The NRC's reports in 2002 and 2003 found no scientific basis for maintaining Upper Klamath Lake levels and increased river flows. They suggested addressing land and water management concerns for the recovery of endangered species in the Klamath Basin. The NRC also determined that the Klamath Project was not the cause of the 2002 fish kill in the lower basin. The Secretary of the Interior signed a Klamath Watershed Coordination Agreement to address resource management issues highlighted by the NRC. PacifiCorp owns and operates hydroelectric dams in the Klamath Basin, with their license expiring in 2006. NMFS and FWS have proposed fishways construction as part of the new license application. The federal agencies have proposed fishways construction at PacifiCorp dams in the Klamath Basin to restore fish habitat, including for ESA-listed species. The estimated cost of implementing the prescriptions could be up to $200 million, with concerns about resolving fisheries issues due to poor water quality. PacifiCorp has requested a hearing to challenge federal agencies' fishway prescriptions in the Klamath Basin. They have proposed alternatives such as trapping and transporting fish around the dams. Legislation for the Klamath Basin in the 109th Congress has not been proposed, but the 108th Congress passed a section providing environmental assistance for water use efficiency in the Upper Klamath River Basin. Funding for the Klamath Project was $20.8 million for FY2006 and $24.7 million was requested for FY2007. Congress is considering legislation to transfer authority for the project. Congress is considering legislation to transfer ownership of Bureau of Reclamation water supply projects to current water users. The Clinton Administration initiated voluntary negotiations for title transfers in 1995. Transfer issues include valuation, legal and policy questions, and impacts on water users, wildlife, project operations, and land management. Some argue for mandated transfers of reclamation facilities, while others advocate for authorized transfers within a specific timeframe. The debate focuses on the role of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in project transfers, with environmentalists concerned about potential environmental impacts being overlooked. Project proponents seek directed transfers to avoid perceived unnecessary processes. Project proponents pursue directed transfers to avoid delays and ensure transfers occur. Legislation varies in directing transfers to comply with applicable laws or negotiated agreements with water users. Some laws authorize transfers, while others mandate them. Concerns arise about the Endangered Species Act's role post-transfer, with environmentalists worried about the lack of consultation on species impact once the project is no longer federally owned. Environmentalists and others are concerned about the lack of public scrutiny and federal oversight once projects are transferred out of federal hands. Controversies surrounding the application of NEPA and ESA, costs of transfers, effects on third parties, liability, and future operation of projects are key issues. The House Resources Committee has highlighted these concerns. The House Resources Committee has noted concerns about the lack of public scrutiny and federal oversight once projects are transferred out of federal hands. Transfer bills approved by committees have been silent on enforcement issues and potential changes in operations by new owners. Little has been said about potential consequences if new project owners decide to convert irrigation water to domestic use. Two sets of bills to transfer irrigation works have been introduced in Congress. The House Resources Committee has raised concerns about the lack of oversight once projects are transferred to new owners. H.R. 3443 became P.L. 109-321 in 2006, transferring facilities to the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. Another set of bills (H.R. 1564 and S. 1965) would transfer buildings and lands to the Yakima-Tieton Irrigation District, without transferring irrigation works. Funding for the CALFED program was reauthorized in 2004, with an annual appropriation of $143 million for ecosystem protection and restoration projects in the Bay-Delta. The CALFED Program was initiated to address water quality, supply, and habitat issues in the Bay-Delta estuary. A Record of Decision was issued in August 2000, and reauthorized in 2004 with $389 million in federal funding for FY2005-FY2010. The Administration's FY2007 request for the Bureau of Reclamation's CALFED program account is $38.6 million, with allocations for the Environmental Water Account, water storage activities, and ecosystem restoration. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2006 included $37 million for CALFED, with funds for storage project studies, planning, and levee stability. Concerns about food chain issues, fisheries declines, fiscal challenges, and governance have raised doubts about CALFED's implementation and viability. Scientists are investigating declining longfin smelt and threadfin smelt populations. A new governing structure for CALFED has been proposed, including three new entities. Oversight issues during the 109th Congress were expected to include project financing and water storage programs. Recent concerns about food chain issues and fisheries declines in the Bay-Delta have raised questions about CALFED's implementation and viability. The CALFED Program's implementation and viability have been questioned due to fiscal issues at state and federal levels. Concerns about the vulnerability of the Bay-Delta levee system to natural disasters have also been raised. Funding for Delta levee maintenance was not included in the Administration's budget request for FY2007. Congress has authorized the Bureau to fund rural water supply projects since 1980, with funding from the Department of Agriculture. The Bureau of Reclamation has been authorized to fund rural water supply projects since 1980, with funding from the Department of Agriculture. These projects aim to provide water for municipal and industrial uses in rural areas, deviating from the historical focus on irrigation. The most recent project approved is for Espanola, New Mexico, with a feasibility study authorized for a Chimayo water supply system. These projects have faced controversy due to the significant federal construction costs proposed, with M&I water users required to repay 100% of their construction costs plus interest. The federal cost share for Bureau of Reclamation's rural water supply projects typically ranges from 75% to 85%, with concerns raised about overwhelming the Bureau's budget. The Lewis and Clark project's federal contribution is estimated at $214 million, while the Bureau's annual budget is around $800 million. There are approximately 60 authorized projects with projected construction costs of $4.9 billion, and outstanding construction authorizations totaling approximately $7 billion. Some fear these projects may be outside the Bureau's budget capacity. Some projects, like the Lewis and Clark legislation, are causing concerns about overwhelming the Bureau of Reclamation's budget. These projects do not fit EPA or USDA criteria, leading project proponents to seek funding from the Bureau. Legislation has been introduced to establish a new rural water supply program administered by the Bureau, combining elements of multiple bills from the 108th Congress. In the 108th Congress, several bills were introduced regarding water and power resources. S. 895 passed the Senate, and a new bill, S. 3639, aimed to amend Title 16 of P.L. 102-575 to establish new review processes for water projects. Despite the authorization of around 30 projects under Title XVI, few investigations have been initiated by the Secretary of the Interior. The Title XVI program has approximately 30 projects, some with Administration support. Controversies over program goals have caused a standstill, prompting efforts to re-authorize and clarify program purposes. The program was originally authorized for construction of five reclamation wastewater projects and six studies, with subsequent amendments in 1996, 1998, and 2000 authorizing more projects. Individual project authorizations have been passed, including three during the 108th Congress. The Title XVI program aims to provide supplemental water supplies by recycling/reusing various sources of contaminated water. There is confusion over whether the program is for demonstration purposes or permanent reclamation facilities. S. 3639 seeks to clarify the program's purposes by assisting in the development of permanent local and regional water projects. The Title XVI program aims to assist in the development of permanent local and regional water reclamation and reuse projects. Water reclaimed via Title 16 projects may be used for various purposes such as M&I water supply, irrigation supply, groundwater recharge, fish and wildlife enhancement, or outdoor recreation. Project construction costs are shared by local sponsors and the federal government, with the federal share limited to 25% of total project costs. The federal share of feasibility studies is limited to 50%, with exceptions for financial hardship. S. 3639 proposes a maximum cost share of 20% or $20 million for projects authorized after enactment. The Bureau's water reclamation program is limited to projects in the 17 western states unless authorized by Congress. Authorized recipients include non-federal entities like irrigation districts and municipalities. S. 3639 proposes new planning and review processes for construction funding of Title 16 projects, replacing current appraisal and feasibility studies. Total funding for Title 16 projects in recent years has ranged from $23.0 million to $28.4 million. Several Title XVI bills are pending in Congress. The Salton Sea in California is a saline-rich water body sustained by agricultural run-off. It supports various plants and animals, including endangered species, and is a recreational area. Efforts to restore the sea are ongoing due to increasing salinity levels. Federal and state agencies are working on determining the best restoration alternative. The Salton Sea restoration plan endorsed by the Salton Sea Authority proposes dividing the sea into two smaller lakes with expanded wetlands. One lake will be for recreational saltwater activities, while the other will serve as a salt sink. The estimated cost of this plan is $2.2 billion. The proposed Salton Sea restoration plan involves dividing the sea into two smaller lakes with expanded wetlands, one for recreational saltwater activities and the other as a salt sink. The estimated cost of the plan is $2.2 billion, with funding expected from various sources including a restoration fund generated from water sales fees in the region. Additional funding may come from local, state, and federal sources, as well as pilot projects authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2005. The study will assess pilot projects in the Salton Sea restoration plan for economic viability, technical feasibility, environmental impact, and alignment with restoration objectives. If approved, $26.0 million would be allocated for implementation, with $16.9 million from federal funds and $9.1 million from non-federal sources. Congressional oversight is expected as proposals for Salton Sea restoration and Colorado River issues are negotiated. Drought conditions in the West exacerbate water scarcity, prompting proposals to aid states in drought planning. Legislation was introduced to establish a National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) to assist states in planning for and managing drought conditions. NIDIS aims to forecast and monitor drought, with an estimated annual economic impact of $6 to $8 billion in the United States. The goal is to create an integrated system to address drought impacts nationwide. The NIDIS aims to establish an integrated drought early warning system to provide accurate information on drought conditions, support decision-making to minimize loss, educate on drought impacts, and improve drought prediction. Legislation has been proposed to establish NIDIS, along with a National Drought Council and a Drought Assistance Fund to assist with drought-related activities. Two bills were introduced in 2005 to assist with drought-related activities and technology transfer, but did not advance. In 2006, bills H.R. 5136 and S. 2751 were introduced to establish NIDIS as a program within NOAA, proposing $94 million in funding from FY2007 to FY2012. H.R. 5136 passed the House with a funding reduction amendment, authorizing $81 million, while S. 2751 was reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. S. 2751, introduced in 2005, amends water resource acts in Hawaii and authorizes certain projects. It was reported by the Senate Commerce Committee and passed into law as P.L. 109-70 in 2005. H.R. 122, introduced by Issa, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to participate in a water project. The H.R. 177 (Miller, Gary) bill, introduced in 2005, aims to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in various water projects in California, including the Prado Basin Natural Treatment System Project and the Lower Chino Dairy Area desalination demonstration. It was reported by the House Committee on Resources and passed the House in 2006. H.R. 540 (Gibbons) bill introduced in 2005, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to convey the Newlands Project Headquarters and Maintenance Yard Facility to the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District. It also included amendments to the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act for various projects in California and Texas. H.R. 2334 (Capps) introduced in 2005 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the design, planning, and construction of permanent facilities for the GREAT project in Oxnard, California. It was reported from the House Resources Committee in 2006 and passed the House under suspension of the rules. The Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to participate in a project to reclaim and reuse wastewater in the City of Austin Water and Wastewater Utility area, Texas. Introduced in 2005, the bill passed the House and Senate committees in 2006. H.R. 5768 and S. 3639 aim to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to participate in water reclamation projects in western states and Hawaii. The bills replace current provisions with new project planning assistance and review processes. Introduced in July, H.R. 5768 and S. 3639 were referred to relevant committees in the House and Senate. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power held a hearing on July 27, 2006, regarding H.R. 4545 (Sanchez) and S. 3638 (Feinstein). H.R. 4545 aims to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the Los Angeles County Water Supply Augmentation Demonstration project. S. 3638 encourages projects to treat impaired surface water, reclaim impaired groundwater, and provide brine disposal in California.
