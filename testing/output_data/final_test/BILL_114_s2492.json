    "content": "The \"Encouraging Americans to Save Act\" allows for matching payments for elective deferral and IRA contributions by certain individuals under a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Encouraging Americans to Save Act\" allows eligible individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified retirement savings contributions, up to $1,000, at a 50 percent applicable percentage. The credit is paid by the Secretary to the individual's retirement account after filing a tax return. The tax credit for qualified retirement savings contributions has a 50 percent applicable percentage. The credit percentage is reduced based on the taxpayer's income compared to the phaseout range. The tax credit for qualified retirement savings contributions has a $65,000 applicable dollar amount with a phaseout range of $20,000. For heads of households, the amounts are 3/4 of the applicable values, and for other taxpayers, it is 1/2. The term 'eligible individual' for the tax credit means any person over 18 years old. Dependents and full-time students are not eligible. The term 'qualified retirement savings contributions' includes contributions made by an eligible individual, elective deferrals, and voluntary employee contributions to qualified plans. The term 'qualified retirement savings contributions' includes contributions to any qualified retirement plan, excluding amounts from payments under subsection (a). Contributions for a taxable year may be reduced by distributions received during the testing period from eligible entities. The term 'qualified retirement savings contributions' includes contributions to any qualified retirement plan, excluding certain distributions. Distributions excluded are those specified in various sections of the tax code. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of distributions received by a spouse of an individual for tax purposes. It states that distributions received by the spouse can be treated as received by the individual if they file a joint tax return. Additionally, it mentions the rollover contribution of qualified retirement savings to an eligible account or plan. The curr_chunk explains that an eligible individual can choose an applicable retirement savings vehicle for contributions, such as a Roth IRA or a designated Roth account. If no election is made, a myRA will be established for them by the Secretary. The curr_chunk defines a MyRA as a Roth IRA established under the MyRA program by an eligible individual or the Secretary. It also outlines the requirements for an applicable retirement plan for contributions made by the individual. The curr_chunk explains the definition of \"modified adjusted gross income\" for MyRA contributions, excluding certain deductions and exclusions. It also clarifies the treatment of contributions made under subsection (a)(2) as being treated similarly to individual contributions. The curr_chunk discusses the tax treatment of contributions made under this section, stating that such contributions are not considered income to the taxpayer and are not subject to certain limitations. It also clarifies that plans accepting contributions under this section do not violate certain requirements. Additionally, any erroneous payments are treated as underpayments of tax. Inflation adjustments for taxable years after 2017 increase dollar amounts in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(3)(A)(i) based on cost-of-living adjustments. Increases are rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 or $1,000 depending on the subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury will educate taxpayers on benefits under section 6433 of the Internal Revenue Code and issue guidance on implementation by December 31, 2017. Payment authority and deficiencies are amended to include section 6433. Conforming amendments are made to section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 25B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to refer to section 6433 for credit related to qualified retirement savings contributions. Amendments are made to the table of sections for subchapter B of chapter 65 of the Code. Effective Date: The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016."
