    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 5348 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require counties to offer assisted outpatient treatment services, including community-based mental health teams with high staff-to-client ratios and a service planning process. The local director of mental health must determine the number of persons to be served and the programs to meet their needs, consulting with various stakeholders. Plans for mental health services should include outreach to families with severely mentally ill adults, design of services, access to medications, psychiatric and psychological services, substance abuse services, housing assistance, vocational rehabilitation, and veterans' services. Evaluation strategies should consider cultural, linguistic, gender, age, and special needs of minorities. Staff with cultural and linguistic skills should be available to remove barriers to services. Recipients of outreach services may include families, the public, primary care physicians, and others likely to come into contact with individuals in need. Outreach to adults with severe mental illness, including those voluntarily or involuntarily hospitalized, to prevent homelessness. Provision for services to meet the needs of physically disabled persons, older adults, family support, client-directed services with psychosocial rehabilitation principles, integrated psychiatric and psychological services, and services for seriously mentally ill young adults at risk of homelessness. Services for women from diverse cultural backgrounds include supportive housing for children, therapeutic treatment, substance abuse programs addressing gender-specific trauma, and vocational rehabilitation with job training free of gender bias. Provision for immediate, transitional, or permanent housing, and support for clients with untreated severe mental illness at risk of homelessness. Each client must have a designated mental health personal services coordinator responsible for assessing needs, developing a personal services plan, linking to community services, monitoring service quality, and advocating for services. Clients participate in plan development, and staff consult with conservators and family with client consent. The individual personal services plan for assisted outpatient treatment programs ensures age-appropriate, gender-appropriate, and culturally appropriate services to promote independent living, work engagement, support systems, education or vocational training, and adequate income for recipients. The individual personal services plan for assisted outpatient treatment programs includes ensuring adequate income, self-management of illnesses, access to physical health care, reducing antisocial behavior, alleviating distress from mental illness symptoms, freedom from addictive substances, and offering services on a voluntary basis. Involuntary medication requires a court order. Counties running assisted outpatient treatment programs must report data to the State Department of Health Care Services annually, evaluating program effectiveness in reducing homelessness, hospitalization, and involvement with law enforcement. The program's effectiveness is evaluated based on various indicators such as housing stability, contact with law enforcement, employment participation, reduced hospitalization, treatment adherence, engagement indicators, victimization, violent behavior, substance abuse, and treatment intensity. The program's effectiveness is evaluated based on indicators like housing stability, employment participation, treatment adherence, and social functioning. Section 5349.5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to specify the program's duration until January 1, 2022, unless extended by a later statute."
