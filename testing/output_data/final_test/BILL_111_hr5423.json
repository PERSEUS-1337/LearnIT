    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transparent Review of the Affordability and Cost of Electricity (TRACE) Renewable Energy Act of 2010\". Congress finds that Federal energy subsidies have more than doubled over the past decade, with a total of $16.6 billion in 2007. There is a focus on research and development of renewable and low-emission technologies for power generation. Accurate reporting on the costs of alternative energy generation is needed due to significant Federal investment in this technology. The costs of alternative energy generation technology need to be analyzed without Federal subsidy to assess competitiveness and optimize deployment. The Energy Information Administration previously collected relevant information but discontinued the program due to funding constraints and lack of congressional authorization. SEC. 215. ELECTRIC PRODUCTION COST REPORT is added to Title II of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to analyze alternative energy generation costs without Federal subsidy. The Secretary, through the Administrator, prepares an annual report on electricity production costs per kilowatt hour by sector and energy source. The report includes carbon dioxide emissions, generation costs, and factors used to levelize costs. The Administrator collects data from various electric utilities and federal agencies to complete the annual report on electricity production costs per kilowatt hour by sector and energy source. Federal departments and agencies of the United States, including key officials, are required to assist in data collection for the annual report on electricity production costs. The Administrator will issue reports for previously collected data and prepare annual reports starting from 2012. The Administrator will collect necessary data for the report by January 31 each year and issue the report by June 30. After each report, the Administrator may review findings with energy industry experts. The Administrator will review findings with energy industry experts to enhance future reports."
