    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, leading to a significant reorganization of the executive branch. Similar to the Department of Defense (DOD), which underwent structural changes since its establishment in 1947, DHS was formed through legislative compromises. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to reorganize functions and units within DHS as needed, as outlined in Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the President temporary authority to reorganize DHS, leading to the creation of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement within the department's Border and Transportation Security Directorate. DHS was initially organized with the office of the Secretary/Deputy Secretary at the center and individual directorates for management. The Department of Homeland Security was organized with individual directorates for management, science and technology, information analysis, border security, and emergency response. Other units within the department reported directly to the Secretary, including the Coast Guard and Secret Service. DHS had approximately 170,000 employees, with a significant field organization. In March 2005, Michael Chertoff initiated a comprehensive review of the Department of Homeland Security's organization and operations. This effort involved 18 action teams and over 250 staff members evaluating specific issues and seeking input from public and private partners. The Department of Homeland Security conducted a comprehensive review in 2005, seeking input from various partners. This resulted in a six-point agenda focusing on preparedness, border security, transportation security, information sharing, stewardship improvement, and organizational realignment. Specific policy initiatives will be launched in key areas in the future. In July 2005, Secretary Chertoff announced structural changes at DHS to improve mission performance, including the formation of a new policy office, improvements in intelligence sharing, an operations coordination office, and a consolidation effort for the Department's preparedness mission. Secretary Chertoff proposed the creation of a central policy office led by an Under Secretary for Policy at DHS to strengthen the department's ability to develop vital policies. This idea builds upon previous work and recommendations for consolidating policy analysis and development offices under the direction of such an officer. The recommendation for the creation of an Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs at DHS was reiterated in a December 2004 report and supported by Senator Susan Collins. This proposed office, headed by an Assistant Secretary, would oversee strategic policy development and program oversight. The Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs at DHS is responsible for strategic policy development and oversight of program policy efforts, including economic, regulatory, legislative, and foreign policy analysis functions. The Policy Review Board evaluates and promotes developing policies, ensuring consistency with strategic goals and priorities. House appropriators approved $8.7 million for OPPIA, while Senate appropriators recommended $7.25 million and expected it to assume functions of the Operational Integration Staff. The Senate approved funding for the Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA) at DHS, but there was a discrepancy in expectations regarding its role compared to the Operational Integration Staff. Secretary Chertoff notified Congress of reorganization plans within DHS in July 2005. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to establish the Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs (OPPIA) under Homeland Security, with the intention to implement changes on October 1, 2005. He requested legislation to elevate the Assistant Secretary to an Under Secretary position to lead the Directorate for Policy. Various organizational units will be relocated to this new centralized policy office, including the Office of International Affairs and the Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office. Additionally, a strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator will be established. In July 2005, Secretary Chertoff announced the establishment of a new policy apparatus within Homeland Security, including a strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will become the Chief Intelligence Officer, leading a strengthened Information Analysis division. This division will ensure coordination, fusion, and analysis of intelligence within the Department, serving as a primary connection between DHS and the intelligence community. The Homeland Security Act vested the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis with the duty to access, receive, and analyze intelligence information to identify and assess terrorist threats. However, this provision was undermined when President George W. Bush announced the creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center in 2003. The creation of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) in 2003 by DHS and DOD aimed to merge and analyze all threat information in one place, potentially overshadowing the role of the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis. TTIC was responsible for terrorism analysis, except for purely domestic terrorism, while IAIP focused on assessing threats and vulnerabilities to the nation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 transferred TTIC to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), designated as the primary organization for analyzing and integrating all intelligence related to terrorism and counterterrorism. NCTC is responsible for strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities and coordinating with various departments and agencies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 led to the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the mission and functions of IAIP in light of these changes and provide a report on its future role in the intelligence community. Based on a comparative review of IAIP's intelligence responsibilities pre and post the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Secretary Chertoff highlighted the need to elevate IAIP's Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office due to the department's multiple intelligence offices. Secretary Chertoff emphasized the need for the Information Analysis unit to be a stand-alone office within DHS, reporting directly to the Secretary. He also mentioned the unit should coordinate activities and fuse information from all intelligence offices in DHS. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) will provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to State and local partners. Secretary Chertoff aims for better participation in the intelligence community by the Chief Intelligence Officer and IA. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer will have powerful tools to integrate intelligence from all department components and bring their own intelligence collection capability to the table. They will represent all intelligence components within DHS and be part of the intelligence community. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer will integrate intelligence from all department components and be part of the intelligence community. Secretary Chertoff anticipates DHS playing a role in the NCTC, with seven primary operational components having a direct line to the Secretary. The Department of Homeland Security will establish a new Director of Operations Coordination to improve coordination and execution of operations. The Office of Operations Coordination will work with component leadership and federal partners to ensure joint, well-coordinated actions. This initiative was outlined by Secretary Chertoff in a reorganization notification letter to Congress, aiming to enhance operational coordination within DHS. The Department of Homeland Security will establish a new Director of Operations Coordination to improve coordination and execution of operations at the Secretary's level. Secretary Chertoff aims to eliminate inefficiencies by creating the OOC and has requested legislation to remove the position of Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security. Additionally, he plans to consolidate preparedness responsibilities into a single directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness, focusing on both terrorism and natural disaster response. The Department of Homeland Security will establish a new Preparedness Directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness. FEMA will now focus on response and recovery, while the new directorate will provide support and training resources. A Chief Medical Officer will be appointed to advise on medical preparedness and coordinate with other agencies. Chertoff announced plans to create a new position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security within the Preparedness Directorate to centralize coordination efforts to protect technological infrastructure. He also proposed reorganizing the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response to consolidate preparedness resources into the Directorate for Preparedness. The IAIP Directorate will be renamed the Directorate for Preparedness, with portions of FEMA being transferred to it. Secretary Chertoff emphasized the importance of maintaining FEMA's skills while allowing it to focus on its core mission. The reorganization does not require congressional action and aims to enhance preparedness efforts. The restructuring of FEMA aims to enhance preparedness efforts by transferring certain elements to the Directorate for Preparedness, allowing FEMA to focus on its core mission under direct leadership and attention from the Secretary. The restructuring of FEMA aims to enhance preparedness efforts by transferring certain elements to the Directorate for Preparedness, allowing FEMA to focus on its core mission under direct leadership. The new directorate will unify strategic preparedness functions and bring critical prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts to the table. A Chief Medical Officer will oversee the health aspects of response and recovery. The proposed Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST) will focus on collecting, analyzing, and coordinating information on cyber terrorist threats, as well as coordinating Department-wide activities on cyber threats and infrastructure. The Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST) will coordinate Department-wide activities on cyber threats and infrastructure, supporting telecommunications infrastructure for national security and emergency communications needs. This aligns with the Department of Homeland Security's reorganization efforts to address cyber security threats effectively. In a reorganization notification letter to Congress on July 13, 2005, the Secretary announced the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center would become a standalone entity reporting directly to the Deputy Secretary. The Federal Air Marshal Service would be transferred from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to TSA by October 1, 2005. Additionally, the Secretary planned to merge the Offices of Legislative Affairs and State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness Office into a new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs (OLIA) to improve responses to Congressional inquiries. The Office of Security, previously reporting to the Deputy Secretary, will now report directly to the Secretary to integrate security concerns more effectively. Secretary Chertoff also discussed relocating the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination to the Preparedness Directorate, changing its reporting structure to the Under Secretary for Preparedness. The Office of the National Capital Region Coordination will now report through the Under Secretary for Preparedness to enhance preparedness planning for the Capital, including biopreparedness planning. The Secretary views this as enhancing the office's ability to influence preparedness functions directly related to protecting the country's Capital. The Secretary also mentioned a proposed Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, indicating that it would report separately. The Secretary proposed creating the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) to report directly to him, attracting senior personnel from various departments. He mentioned plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) to ICE and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) for better coordination. The reorganization proposal under Secretary Chertoff's 2SR plans included moving the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) out of ICE and back to TSA to allow ICE leadership to focus on the Federal Protective Service (FPS). A suggested merger of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not materialize, with some experts opposing the idea and the acting DHS Inspector General asked to study the issue. The House Committee on Homeland Security considered the CBP-ICE merger proposal but did not reach a conclusion. A provision in the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 required the Secretary to review the organizational structure of CBP and ICE and submit a report to Congress. Secretary Chertoff's 2SR initiative was ongoing, and he took the merger proposal \"very seriously.\" The Secretary considered the merger proposal for CBP and ICE, aiming for a less drastic approach to address operational collaboration. He emphasized the importance of working together with other components like the Coast Guard and infrastructure protection. A comprehensive border security strategy was discussed, involving CBP, ICE, and Coast Guard in the planning process. The Secretary proposed a restructuring plan to unify operations and policy between CBP, ICE, and the Coast Guard. This would involve creating a common department-wide policy and planning shop to enhance coordination across the department. The Secretary proposed a restructuring plan to unify operations and policy between CBP, ICE, and the Coast Guard. It was determined that a merger may not address the different functions of these agencies effectively, and the existing problems are being addressed through other means. In mid-September, a draft report recommended merging CBP and ICE into a single entity, contradicting Secretary Chertoff's 2SR realignment plan. Senator Susan Collins raised concerns about the reorganization plan during a Senate Committee hearing. Chertoff expressed concerns about the proposed changes to the department, urging for a more comprehensive reauthorization bill to address the fundamental changes. Senator Collins questioned Secretary Chertoff's interpretation of his reorganization authority, citing a footnote in a reorganization notification letter to Congress. Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize the Department by reallocating functions and establishing or consolidating organizational units. Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman expressed concerns about the broad scope of the Secretary's reorganization authority. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize the Department by reallocating functions and establishing or consolidating organizational units, subject to limitations specified in the section. The term \"organizational units\" is not clearly defined in the act, but it appears Congress intended them to be smaller than agencies or other statutorily created entities. Congress suggests that an organizational unit may be smaller than an agency or entity, as seen in the Homeland Security Act. This impacts the Secretary's authority to reorganize DHS, allowing for the establishment, consolidation, alteration, or discontinuation of organizational units within the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue organizational units within the Department. The term \"organizational units\" is not clearly defined, leading to uncertainty about the scope of the Secretary's authority. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan aimed to flatten the department's hierarchy by creating a single directorate called Policy. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan aims to flatten the department's hierarchy by creating a single directorate called Policy, replacing the hierarchical structure with a new arrangement that increases reporting lines to the Secretary/Deputy Secretary. Minority members of the House Committee on Homeland Security raised concerns about potential issues with oversight and control in the Secretary's office under this new structure. The report commended Secretary Chertoff for his reorganization plan but expressed frustration with the lack of details provided, raising concerns about unclear roles and competition within the Preparedness Directorate. It criticized the failure to merge CBP and ICE and to strengthen investigative powers for the DHS Privacy Officer. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for ignoring assessments supporting the elevation of offices in the Management Directorate and for not implementing a long-term planning system like a Quadrennial Defense Review. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal raised issues regarding the leadership composition at DHS, with concerns about appointment authority and compensation levels for new positions. It was unclear if the Secretary had the authority to establish these positions without congressional action, as Congress has the power to create departments and agencies and delegate organizational responsibilities. Congress determines the leadership hierarchy and accountability of departments by establishing top positions in law. This includes appointing officers with Senate approval (PAS positions) or by the President alone (PA positions). Creating leadership positions as PAS positions allows Senators to be involved in nominee selection and fitness evaluation. Confirmation hearings provide Senators with a role in selecting nominees and assessing their suitability for the position. It also allows for oversight of agencies and programs, and ensures nominees will appear before Congress when requested. This commitment obtained during confirmation makes it easier for Congress to call upon officials for testimony. In some cases, Congress assigns appointment authority to the President for positions in the White House Office, where officials act as advisers. The Homeland Security Act created seven such positions in the new department, giving Congress less influence over appointments. In other cases, appointment authority is given to the Secretary, commonly for lower-level officers. The Homeland Security Act created up to 12 Assistant Secretary positions, with appointment made by the President with Senate consent. The President submitted nominations for Assistant Secretary positions with various titles and organizational locations. Under Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal, Assistant Secretary positions were to be restructured with changes in titles, reporting structure, and compensation levels. The Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office was to become part of the new OPPIA, initially to be headed by an Assistant Secretary appointed through advice. The new OPPIA was initially to be headed by an Assistant Secretary, but Secretary Chertoff requested Congress to elevate the position to Under Secretary level. The reorganization proposals included creating several new Assistant Secretary positions. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal included creating new high-level positions within the Department of Homeland Security, but it was unclear whether these positions would be among the 12 statutory Assistant Secretaries provided for in the Homeland Security Act or created administratively. The President endorsed the creation of two additional Assistant Secretary positions to be appointed by him alone, which was a departure from prior practices. The Homeland Security Act created two presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary positions, distinct from the 12 statutory Assistant Secretary positions. These positions were responsible for assisting the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal included the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection reporting to the new Under Secretary for Preparedness. The Secretary's proposal did not specify any changes to the Assistant Secretary's authorities and responsibilities under the new reporting arrangement. Secretary Chertoff proposed elevating the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office named Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA), reporting directly to the Secretary. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis would be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, with changes in organizational location, responsibilities, and title. Additionally, non-career Senior Executive Service positions were created within DHS. Under Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal, non-career Senior Executive Service positions were created within DHS, including the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. A new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs was to be established, headed by an Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs. Other leadership positions were also to be created, such as the Director of Operations Coordination and the Director of FEMA. The reorganization proposal by Under Secretary Chertoff created new leadership positions within DHS, including the Director of Operations Coordination, the Director of FEMA, the head of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and the Chief Medical Officer. The proposal did not specify appointment authority or compensation levels for these positions, leaving the option for the President to appoint them through existing statutory Assistant Secretary slots or as SES positions. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal for DHS created high-level positions with significant authority, leading to questions about the department's leadership structure. The proposal included 27 officials reporting directly to the Secretary, with varying compensation levels and appointment methods, potentially causing confusion in the hierarchy. The FY2006 budget amendments supported Chertoff's plan, but there were concerns about the organizational hierarchy within the department. The conferees on the DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments endorsing Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan for the department. Changes included abolishing the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, dividing the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service, and expanding the functions of the Office of Policy. The reorganization plan for the Department of Homeland Security includes transferring various offices and functions, such as the Special Assistant to the Secretary-Private Sector and the Office of Immigration Statistics, to a modified version of OPPIA. The Office of Security will be moved to the Management Directorate, and the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness will be merged with the Office of Legislative Affairs to form the new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. Additionally, parts of the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate will be reconstituted as a new Preparedness Directorate, incorporating various functions and establishing the Office of Chief Medical Officer within it. The House and Senate approved the DHS reorganization plan, including the establishment of the Office of Chief Medical Officer and conducting a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. Despite controversy over FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina, Secretary Chertoff implemented the plan on October 1, 2005. Some confusion surrounds the manner in which the 2SR reorganization was effectuated by Secretary Chertoff in his July 13, 2005 letter to Congress. Questions have been raised about how much of the 2SR plan could be realized using his authority under Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act. Despite this, a DHS press release stated that the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act adopted many of the organization changes proposed in the 2SR process. The DHS appropriations committee report discussed the reorganization proposed in the 2SR process, which aimed to reflect the findings of an internal review conducted by the Department of Homeland Security. The budget was amended to accommodate the reorganization proposal for fiscal year 2006. The conferees mostly agreed with the Department's decision to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border. The conferees support the Department's decision to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, merging its functions into other offices. They have split the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection into two new components and transferred Federal Air Marshals to the Transportation Security Administration. The roles of the Office of Policy have been expanded, and no funding is provided for the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security. The Secretary agreed to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, but may not have the authority to do so. Changes were made to FEMA's operations under Secretary Chertoff's 2SR plan, focusing on improving disaster response and recovery efforts. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, legislation has been introduced to remove FEMA from DHS and restore its status as an independent agency. Secretary Chertoff plans to restructure FEMA to operate efficiently like a modern distribution company for emergency response. The DHS inspector general's report supports the merger of CPB and ICE into a single agency, sparking a heated dispute within the department. The DHS inspector general's report supports the merger of CPB and ICE into a single agency, sparking a heated dispute within the department over the advisability of the merger and the Secretary's organizational authority. Senator Susan Collins requested the IG's assessment during a hearing in January 2005. Secretary Chertoff and other senior DHS officials have resisted the recommendation, but there is support for the merger within Congress. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, indicated that he has the Secretary's mandate to integrate all intelligence capabilities within the Department. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, plans to establish a Homeland Security Intelligence Council to discuss intelligence issues, develop a strategic plan, and integrate intelligence components within the Department. He aims to fully involve DHS intelligence in the Intelligence Community and the National Intelligence Program. Jeffrey W. Runge, the DHS Chief Medical Officer, emphasized the importance of being a valued contributor to the overall intelligence effort and a trusted recipient of national intelligence information. He highlighted the need for a data-driven, science-based approach to fill gaps in the Department's medical readiness. Jeffrey W. Runge, the DHS Chief Medical Officer, emphasized the importance of bringing technology and intelligence to the Department's policy-making. He mentioned the appointment of a Deputy Chief Medical Officer and three Associate Chief Medical Officers. Jeffrey A. Lowell, a former senior medical affairs advisor to the Secretary of Homeland Security, highlighted the lack of a unified medical capability within DHS to respond to terrorist attacks or disasters. He recommended establishing an Office of Medical Readiness led by a Chief Medical Officer. The DHS Chief Medical Officer recommended creating an Office of Medical Readiness with clearly defined duties and responsibilities. Collaboration with HHS and other Federal partners is essential for seamless integration of medical preparedness and response capabilities at all levels. David Heyman emphasized the need for clarifying authorities and national leadership roles in biodefense, questioning the specific role of the Chief Medical Officer. The Chief Medical Officer suggested a broader role as a Chief Health Officer, emphasizing leadership in various areas beyond medical advice, such as navigating health care systems and advising on public health issues. He outlined four specific areas where clear leadership is needed today, indicating a need for sound scientific, medical, and public health advice, greater situational awareness of biological threats and health care preparedness, and integration of various sectors in preparedness efforts. The 2SR initiative involves federal, state, local, and private sector collaboration in developing a national strategy for biological event protection and educating citizens on health preparedness. Leadership changes have occurred, with nominees confirmed for new positions at DHS during the 109th Congress. George W. Foresman became the Under Secretary for Preparedness, and Stewart A. Baker was appointed as the first Assistant Secretary for Policy. Stewart A. Baker was appointed as the first Assistant Secretary for Policy at DHS in 2005. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, now known as the Chief Intelligence Officer. Charles E. Allen was appointed to this position. Congress may need to clarify the responsibilities and authority of this position, which is appointed by the President alone. The President appoints the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection, who now assists the Under Secretary for Preparedness. The hierarchical change may prompt Congress to reconsider the appointment process for this position. Only one of the five new assistant secretary positions required advice and consent by the end of the session. Tracy A. Henke was nominated for the Executive Director position of the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness, a statutory PAS position pending Senate approval. Three out of four new assistant secretary positions were established as non-career SES positions, with individuals previously working at DHS. Alfonso Martinez-Fonts, Jr. was appointed Assistant Secretary for Private Sector, Cresencio S. Arcos as Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Robert Stephan as Assistant Secretary. Robert Stephan, previously appointed as Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, was set to become Assistant Secretary for Strategic Plans in January 2006. The position of Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications remained unfilled by the end of the first session, with speculations that the appointment was delayed due to the FY2006 DHS appropriations process. The evolution of DHS has led to the creation of three categories of assistant secretaries. The assistant secretary title is used in three categories within the Department of Homeland Security: those appointed with Senate advice and consent, those presidentially appointed without advice and consent, and those appointed by the Secretary without Senate input. This varied usage is uncommon in other departments, raising questions about the level of policymaking authority and responsibility each category holds. Senate-confirmed assistant secretaries undergo greater scrutiny and are more accountable to Congress, while those appointed without Senate involvement may have differing stature within the department and government. Appointees in the Department of Homeland Security are obligated to respond to Senate committee requests. Some positions were filled permanently, while others remained with acting officials. New non-career SES positions were filled for the Chief Medical Officer and Director of the Nuclear Detection Office. R. David Paulison continued as the Acting Director of FEMA. The status of the Director of Operations Coordination at DHS remains unclear. Congress may evaluate the leadership structure and appointment process, considering legislation such as H.R. 4009, the Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005. This bill implements some of Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan but also includes provisions that differ from it. The bill requires a comprehensive examination of DHS known as the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review. It establishes an Office of Intelligence and Analysis headed by a Chief Intelligence Officer appointed by the President. The bill abolishes the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Preparedness Directorate. The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a task force on protecting security-relevant information from the private sector. It aims to determine the control and significance of such information for national security and propose a policy for sharing it with the government. The bill establishes new roles within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, including an Assistant Secretary for Preparedness appointed by the President. It also assigns the Under Secretary for Preparedness and Response primary responsibility for federal programs and relationships with state, local, and regional authorities in the National Capital Region. Additionally, it abolishes certain offices and establishes a Military Liaison within the Directorate. The bill establishes new roles within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, including a Director of FEMA appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. It also establishes a Deputy Director of FEMA and a Chief Medical Officer within the Directorate. Additionally, it suggests merging CBP and ICE into a single operational unit within DHS and strengthens the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer. The bill strengthens the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer within DHS, establishes new roles within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, and merges CBP and ICE into a single operational unit. It also abolishes the Under Secretary for Management and establishes joint authority for the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Human Capital Officer. Additionally, it creates a Business Transformation Officer to develop management integration strategies for DHS. The bill establishes an Office of Tribal Security within DHS, headed by a Director, with specified responsibilities, who shall report to the Secretary. It allows employees in homeland security areas to file complaints with the Department of Labor for retaliation, with potential relief in federal court if no action is taken. Retaliation against whistle blowers is punishable by ten years in prison. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005 establishes key positions within the Department of Homeland Security, including an Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Telecommunications, an Assistant Secretary for Physical Infrastructure Security, an Under Secretary for Policy, and a program for secure handling of ammonium nitrate. Introduced by Senator Susan Collins and Senator John Warner, the bill aims to enhance national security measures. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005 establishes an Under Secretary for Policy in the Department of Homeland Security."
