The bill passed in the House by a vote of 400-5 and in the Senate, with an increase of $1.3 billion over the Administration's request. The bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides $33.1 billion in appropriations, an increase of $500 million over the Administration's request and a 9.2% increase over the FY2004 level. S. 2537 was introduced in the Senate and accompanied by Senate Report, S.Rept. 108-280. President's FY2005 budget requested $32.6 billion for DHS, a 7.7% increase over FY2004 funding. Table 1 summarizes the legislative status of DHS appropriations for FY2005, including actions taken by the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees and Committees. The House passed H.R. 4567 by a vote of 400-5, while the Senate passed its own version of the bill after making amendments. The data in this report is based on legislative actions for DHS appropriations for FY2005, including the House and Senate versions of H.R. 4567. The budget authority is determined through a two-stage congressional process, with allocations known as 302(a) allocations. The congressional process for DHS appropriations for FY2005 involves two stages: the enactment of annual appropriations through 13 subcommittees, and the allocation of 302(a) discretionary funds to the subcommittees for each of the 13 annual appropriation bills. The 302(b) allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made as the appropriations bills progress towards final enactment. On May 19, 2004, the House agreed to the conference report on the FY2005 budget resolution S.Con.Res. 95, while the Senate did not pass it. On June 15, 2004, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Young submitted H.Rept. 108-543. The House Appropriations Committee Chairman submitted H.Rept. 108-543 on June 15, 2004, with 302(b) allocations for Homeland Security. The House version of S.Con.Res. 95 has a 302(a) allocation of $821 billion, with a $32 billion discretionary allocation for Homeland Security. The Senate approved a total budget authority of $32 million for Homeland Security on September 8, 2004. The report outlines the President's FY2005 appropriations proposal for DHS programs and the congressional response. It compares the proposed FY2005 amounts with current estimates for FY2004 programs transferred to DHS. The report tracks legislative action on the FY2005 DHS appropriations bill, focusing on discretionary programs. It does not cover funding issues for mandatory programs or legislation related to DHS program authorization or amendment. This is the second annual appropriations cycle for DHS. The DHS bill is estimated to be the fifth largest source of discretionary funds, accounting for approximately 3.5% of the total federal discretionary budget authority. $47.3 billion in FY2005 gross budget authority has been requested for federal homeland security activities, with $40 billion allocated to DHS. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the new DHS, organized into four major directorates.

The presentation in Table 5 matches that of the unofficial House Appropriations Committee tables. The offsetting of FPS funding with FPS fee collections in FY2005 represents a change in accounting, not a new fee. The decrease in Maritime and Land security reflects a reorganization of grants, moving them from TSA to ODP. Both the Administration's request and H.R. 4567 fund activities under the Science and Technology Directorate. The Administration's request includes an increase in staff for the Office of the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security.

ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws, investigating fraud, forced labor, smuggling, and other illegal activities. ICE, formerly part of the TSA, combines various functions including investigations, intelligence, air and marine interdiction, and immigration detention. The FY2005 budget request for ICE is $3,307 million, representing an 11% increase from FY2004. Despite appearing as a 2.9% decrease from FY2004, this is due to a change in accounting for fee receipts offsetting expenses. ICE actually receives an increase of nearly 11% from FY2004 enacted levels. ICE's budget for FY2005 sees an increase of nearly 11% from the FY2004 enacted level. H.Rept. 108-541 recommended $3,364 million for ICE, a $57 million increase over the Administration's request.

The Administration did not request additional funding for new initiatives for the FAMS, FPS, Automation Modernization, or Construction accounts. However, P.L.108-334 provides a total increase of $60 million for Federal Air Marshals, with $50 million for FAMS operations and $10 million for the FAMS air-to-ground communications system. P.L. 108-334 also provides a net appropriation of $3,260 million for TSA, representing a 9.7% increase over the FY2004 level. This increase does not include funding for expanding current programs or new initiatives. The increase in funding for TSA primarily consists of annualizations of prior year funding and pay inflation, totaling $73 million recommended in H.Rept. 108-541. The Administration's budget request included a $400 million increase in aviation security fees, but this was not funded by House or Senate reports.
