    "content": "The budget cycle involves Congress and the President setting spending and revenue levels over a three-year period. Budget baselines are crucial for measuring how legislative changes impact the budget outlook. Executive agencies start working on budget requests about a year and a half before the fiscal year begins, with OMB overseeing the process. The President submits a budget to Congress based on agency requests. The President submits a budget to Congress, typically in February, based on work by OMB and federal agencies. Congress then considers the budget resolution, which sets a plan for budgetary legislation. If Congress is late or does not adopt a budget resolution, they may use \"deeming resolution\" provisions. The last budget resolution agreed upon was for FY2010. The FY2010 budget resolution was agreed to on April 29, 2009. House and Senate Appropriations Committees begin reporting discretionary spending bills after the budget resolution. Appropriations acts passed by Congress set the amount of budget authority available for specific programs. Authorizing committees and committees with jurisdiction over revenues also play important roles in budget decision making. Budget baseline projections measure how future legislation would affect the budget picture. Baseline projections measure how future legislation would affect the budget picture, with slight changes in assumptions leading to significant effects in outyear totals. The Congressional Budget Office computes these projections using assumptions from budget enforcement legislation, resulting in fewer policy uncertainties under current law. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 has also played a role in setting baseline levels. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently set individual tax rates and policy provisions into law. Baseline discretionary spending levels are constrained by caps and automatic spending reductions from the Budget Control Act of 2011. Macroeconomic assumptions like GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates also impact baseline estimates. The CBO baseline includes assumptions that Medicare payment rate reductions for physician services will take effect as scheduled. The CBO baseline projects reductions in Medicare payment rates for physician services in April 2015 and certain tax provisions not being extended. Uncertainty remains in projections, especially regarding federal borrowing and healthcare costs. Improvements in the economy, discretionary spending restraints, and expiring tax provisions contribute to declining deficit figures through FY2018. Budget deficits are projected to slightly reduce the public debt as a percentage of GDP through FY2018, making them fiscally sustainable. However, deficits are expected to rise after FY2018, reaching 4.2% of GDP by FY2022 and 4.0% by FY2024. The baseline assumptions show deficits averaging 3.5% of GDP from FY2015 to FY2024. Alternative policy projections indicate higher spending and revenue levels if current policies continue. CBO projects a cumulative increase in the budget deficit by more than $2.3 trillion over the FY2015 to FY2024 period if the Budget Control Act's automatic spending reduction process does not remain in effect. Federal deficits are expected to grow beyond the 10-year forecast window due to increased outlays from health care costs and baby boomer retirements. Since FY2002, spending has exceeded revenue each fiscal year, resulting in budget deficits. The U.S. budget deficit deviated from historical averages due to economic downturn and policies in response to financial turmoil. In FY2013, government spending was $3.5 trillion with a budget deficit of 4.1% of GDP, the lowest in five years. Federal outlays are divided into discretionary, mandatory spending, and net interest. Mandatory spending includes entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In FY2000, total outlays equaled 18.2% of GDP, peaking at 24.4% in FY2009. Outlays have since fallen but remain above historical averages, with FY2013 outlays at 20.8% of GDP. Under the CBO baseline, total outlays are projected to be 22.4% of GDP in FY2024. Federal spending is divided into discretionary, mandatory, and net interest categories, as shown in Figure 2. Discretionary spending peaked in FY2010 at 9.1%. Discretionary spending as a share of GDP has increased since FY2000, largely due to security spending and funding from the ARRA. Defense discretionary outlays grew 5.9% per year, while non-defense outlays grew 4.6% per year. However, discretionary spending is projected to decrease to 5.2% of GDP by FY2024, the lowest level ever, due to reductions under current projections. Mandatory spending is projected to increase over the next decade, reaching 13.9% of GDP in FY2024. This growth is mainly due to increases in certain entitlement programs, despite some expected decreases in spending on income security programs. In FY2013, mandatory spending was 58.8% of total outlays, discretionary spending was 34.8%, and net interest was 6.4%. The largest mandatory programs were Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, making up 48.0% of federal spending. By FY2024, mandatory and net interest spending are projected to increase, reducing discretionary spending's share to 23.1%. Some experts argue that reducing mandatory spending is necessary to achieve significant reductions in federal spending. Future projections show increasing deficits and high debt levels, necessitating action to restore fiscal health. Revenue collection has been low due to economic downturn and tax relief provisions. Policies enacted during the 112th Congress improved revenue outlook. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 extended tax rates for most income groups and raised rates for upper-income households in 2013. Revenue projections show individual income taxes as the largest federal revenue source, followed by social insurance and corporate income taxes. Budget deficits or surpluses are determined by the difference between revenue and outlays, impacting federal debt and interest growth. Between FY2009 and FY2012, annual budget deficits as a percentage of GDP were significantly higher than any period since FY1945. In FY2013, the unified budget deficit was $680 billion, the lowest level since FY2008. Excluding off-budget items, the on-budget FY2013 federal deficit was $720 billion. The FY2014 budget deficit was estimated at $514 billion, mainly due to increased revenues from higher tax collections. The Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget reported a final deficit level for FY2014 of $483 billion or 2.8% of GDP. Gross federal debt consists of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, with debt held by the public being the most relevant in macroeconomic terms. The gross federal debt consists of debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt. Congress historically sets a ceiling on federal debt through legislatively established limits, imposing fiscal accountability. The debt limit is currently suspended until March 5, 2015, due to the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act (P.L. 113-83). The debt limit, set by Congress, has no direct impact on government borrowing but can hinder Treasury's financial management when approaching the limit. Extraordinary measures may be needed to meet obligations, causing inconvenience. In FY2013, federal debt was $16,699 billion, with $11,976 billion held by the public. The U.S. spent $221 billion on net interest payments, influenced by market rates and debt size. Currently, low interest rates have kept net interest payments as a percentage of GDP below historical average despite increased borrowing. Concerns exist that interest costs could rise once the economy fully recovers, potentially straining the budget. Projections show net interest payments reaching $880 billion or 3.3% of GDP in FY2024, exceeding historical averages. Legislative actions during the 112th and 113th Congresses, including the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, have impacted the fiscal outlook. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) was enacted in January 2013 to address expiring tax provisions and the sequester. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA) modified the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) in December 2014, setting new discretionary spending levels for FY2014 and FY2015. These legislative actions have impacted the fiscal outlook. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) was enacted on August 2, 2011, to reduce the deficit by $2.1 trillion over 10 years. It included savings from discretionary spending caps and the establishment of a Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction. When the committee failed to reach an agreement, automatic spending reductions were triggered in FY2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) was signed into law on January 2, 2013, to address additional spending provisions. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) was signed into law by President Obama on January 2, 2013. ATRA postponed the start of FY2013 BCA spending reductions until March 1, 2013, reduced the reductions by $24 billion, extended certain unemployment benefits, prevented reductions in Medicare physician payment rates, extended the 2008 farm bill, and made changes to tax policy including the permanent extension of tax cuts for taxpayers with taxable income below $400,000. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) raised marginal tax rates on income above $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for married couples. It also increased the top tax rate on long-term capital gains and dividends. ATRA reinstated personal exemption phase-out and limitation on itemized deductions for those with adjusted gross income above $250,000. Additionally, it extended tax credits, provided marriage tax penalty relief, and made changes to education-related tax incentives. ATRA included a permanent patch for the alternative minimum tax and estate and gift tax rules, as well as extended expiring tax provisions through 2013. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 raised tax rates on high-income individuals and extended various tax credits. In 2013, provisions known as \"tax extenders\" were extended until the end of the year. The federal government faced a funding gap and partial shutdown in October 2013, which ended with the enactment of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014. Senator Patty Murray and Representative Paul Ryan reached an agreement on discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA; P.L. 113-67) replaced a portion of the automatic spending reductions from the Budget Control Act for FY2014 and FY2015 with deficit reduction provisions, allowing for more discretionary spending. The Obama Administration released its FY2015 budget, focusing on national priorities and policy initiatives. President Obama's budget for FY2015 emphasized funding for various investments. Obama presented his policy agenda, focused on funding investments through the \"Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative,\" increasing infrastructure investment, and funding early childhood education programs. The budget proposes tax increases and spending reductions over the next decade to reduce the deficit from $649 billion in FY2014 to $434 billion in FY2024. Other proposals include comprehensive immigration reform, tax reform, and changes to federal health programs for additional deficit reduction. The budget proposes deficit reduction by replacing the Budget Control Act's automatic spending reduction process. It aims to eliminate the sequester on mandatory programs in FY2015 and replace most automatic cuts with spending cuts and tax increases in the following years. President Obama's budget includes an \"Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\" to increase discretionary spending levels. President Obama's budget proposes an \"Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\" to provide additional funding for unspecified discretionary programs in FY2015. The additional funding would be offset by changes to mandatory spending and revenue over the FY2015-FY2024 period. Key proposals include reducing agriculture subsidies, limiting tax-favored retirement accounts, increasing tobacco taxes, eliminating tax provisions, making changes to health programs, and enacting tax and immigration reforms. The budget also suggests reductions in Overseas Contingency Operations spending through spending caps, totaling $2,167 billion in deficit reduction. The Obama Administration's budget includes deficit reduction proposals totaling $2,167 billion through spending caps and changes to discretionary and mandatory programs. The budget projects a FY2015 deficit of $568 billion under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act baseline. The Obama Administration projected an Adjusted Baseline to show how new policy choices would impact the fiscal outlook, assuming limited discretionary spending and no reduction in Medicare payments to physicians. The deficit is projected to reach $561 billion in FY2015. The Proposed Budget projects a deficit of $564 billion in FY2015 if all proposed policies are implemented. The deficit is projected to reach $564 billion under the Proposed Budget, falling from 3.1% of GDP in FY2015 to 1.6% by FY2024. The Proposed Budget scenario shows lower deficit levels compared to other baselines. The Adjusted Baseline is considered the most realistic projection by the President's budget, while the Proposed Budget illustrates the outlook if all proposed policies are implemented. The impact on the deficit depends on the baseline used. The deficit reduction depends on the baseline used, with the Adjusted Baseline allowing for more assumptions compared to the BBEDCA baseline. The FY2015 budget assumes increased spending due to eliminating the reduction in Medicare physician payments, which would not impact the deficit under the Adjusted Baseline but would increase it under the BBEDCA baseline. The SGR fix under the BBEDCA baseline would increase the deficit, but not in the Proposed Budget due to assumptions about Medicare physician payments. The Administration also projects a reduction in OCO funding, leading to a $695 billion deficit reduction in the Proposed Budget compared to the Adjusted Baseline and BBEDCA baseline. Budget committees in the House and Senate develop a budget resolution for FY2015, receiving information from various sources. The Bipartisan Budget Act directs Chairmen to file spending and revenue levels in the Congressional Record, enforceable if no budget resolution is agreed upon by April 15, 2014. Levels would include spending levels for Appropriations Committees consistent with discretionary spending caps. The House and Senate are working on a budget resolution for FY2015, with the Bipartisan Budget Act setting spending and revenue levels if no agreement is reached by April 15, 2014. The House Budget Committee has already reported a budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 96) with revenue levels of $3,305 billion. Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray has suggested that the provisions in the Bipartisan Budget Act make a budget resolution for FY2015 unnecessary. The House passed a budget resolution with revenue levels of $3,305 billion and outlays of $3,664 billion for FY2015. The budget projects a deficit of $380 billion in FY2015, reaching a surplus of $5 billion by FY2024. The resolution includes policy changes affecting spending, reducing discretionary spending levels and caps through FY2021. Non-defense discretionary spending would be reduced relative to the CBO baseline between FY2022 and FY2024. The budget resolution proposes to increase defense discretionary spending caps through FY2021 and increase spending between FY2022 and FY2024. Non-defense discretionary spending would be reduced, offsetting the increases in defense spending. The resolution also includes changes to mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and aims to replace the ACA. Overall, it aims to reduce spending by $5.9 trillion between FY2015 and FY2024 relative to the current CBO baseline. The House Budget Committee recommends comprehensive tax reform with two tax brackets of 10% and 25%, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. Revenue collection would average 18.1% of GDP between FY2015 and FY2024 under the resolution's policies. Ongoing budgetary challenges may lead to Congressional action, with deficit reduction and slow economic recovery dominating the policy debate in the short term. Increased spending on entitlement programs could contribute to rising deficits in the long term. Entitlement programs, as currently structured, will likely contribute to rising deficits and debt, placing focus on achieving fiscal sustainability. Budget issues may feature prominently in the Congressional debate, with ongoing discussions over budget resolution, FY2015 appropriations levels, and the Budget Control Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 set new discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015, with potential changes in discretionary spending levels for FY2016 to FY2021. Congress and the President may work to adjust discretionary spending levels in future years. The President signed a continuing resolution into law providing appropriations for FY2015 through December 11, 2014. Further appropriations will need to be enacted to avoid a funding lapse. The debate over the debt limit is not expected to resume until spring 2015 due to legislation suspending the debt limit through March 15, 2015. The economy is still recovering from the recent recession, with moderate growth and elevated unemployment rates expected to persist. Unemployment rates are expected to remain high for the medium term. The budget deficit grew during the recession and subsequent years due to government actions to combat the economic downturn. CBO's projections assume steady economic growth over the next 10 years, with potential fluctuations due to economic conditions. As the economy recovers, revenue is expected to increase as unemployment falls and income tax collections rise. Spending should stabilize as well. The budget deficit grew during the recession and subsequent years due to government actions to combat the economic downturn. Revenue is expected to increase as unemployment falls and income tax collections rise, leading to more sustainable budget deficits. Concerns about future federal debt levels persist, with analysts noting the need for a plan to stabilize fiscal future without harming economic recovery. Persistent deficits can lead to growing federal debt, higher interest payments, and adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term. Large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through increases in taxes or spending cuts. A severe fiscal crisis may arise if private investors refuse to finance unsustainable deficits, forcing reforms to be made by events rather than deliberate planning. Deficit spending can help smooth outlays and taxes in the short term, but excessive deficits can slow investment and economic growth. The federal government faces long-term budget challenges, with rising health care costs impacting government-financed health care spending. Deficit reduction legislation has not made significant changes to the growing budget portion, requiring additional savings for long-term sustainability. Deficits are projected to continue under current law, necessitating further measures for fiscal solvency. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term due to rising health care costs and the aging population. Federal spending on health programs is projected to increase significantly, with Medicare and Medicaid costs rising under current law projections. Growing debt and rising interest rates will consume a greater share of future budgets. Under current projections, federal spending to finance the debt is expected to grow rapidly, reaching 4.5% of GDP in FY2035 and 11.4% in FY2085. Maintaining the debt to GDP ratio at today's level would require significant cuts in spending or reining in costs of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. Maintaining the current debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2038 would require immediate and permanent cuts in non-interest spending or revenues. To lower future debt levels, larger annual spending reductions or revenue increases would be necessary. For example, to bring debt levels down to FY2008 levels, spending reductions or revenue increases totaling roughly 2.1% of GDP annually would be needed. Congress may need to focus more on reducing the deficit and debt by implementing less spending, more revenue, faster economic growth, or a combination of these measures. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides data and analysis to Congress on budget and appropriations. CBO issues Budget and Economic Outlook in January with baseline estimates of outlays and revenues, and in March analyzes the President's budget submission. Delay in documents can occur due to legislative agenda or schedule changes. In late summer, CBO updates Budget and Economic Outlook with baseline projections to evaluate legislative proposals' impact on outlays and revenue. Baseline estimates show spending and revenues under current law. CBO projects federal budget over 75 years in The Long-Term Budget Outlook, discussing future fiscal health under different policy assumptions. The President's Budget contains five major volumes with projections of fiscal outlook, spending levels, and revenue proposals. The Budget Options volumes offer specific policy options and their impact over a 10-year budget window. The Department of the Treasury releases the Green Book for further detail on revenue proposals. The Department of the Treasury releases the Green Book for further detail on revenue proposals in the budget."
