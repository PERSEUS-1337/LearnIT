    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Child Marriage Prevention and Assistance Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to child marriage. Congress finds that child marriage in developing nations has negative economic and social consequences, posing risks to girls' health and well-being. The issue is interconnected with broader social and cultural challenges and should be addressed through community-based approaches promoting education, healthcare, legal rights, and awareness for girls and women. Child marriage persists due to extreme poverty, even in countries where it is illegal. The adverse impact increases with younger ages at marriage and childbirth. A 2005 survey found child marriage concerns in 64 countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Efforts are needed to empower girls to become agents of change and expand possibilities for their societies and the world. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, child marriage is prevalent, with girls as young as 7 or 8 getting married. Pregnant girls aged 10 to 14 in developing countries are at a higher risk of maternal mortality. Girls in sub-Saharan Africa face a greater risk of obstetric fistula, with limited treatment options available. Early pregnancy often leads to permanent incontinence, highlighting the urgent need for medical intervention. The maternal mortality rate is high in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia due to various factors like food taboos, poverty, early marriage, and FGM. Adolescents face greater risks during childbirth, leading to fistula and stillborn babies. Obstetric fistula symptoms include incontinence, bladder infections, infertility, and foul odor, often resulting in social abandonment. The World Health Organization estimates that over 2 million women live with obstetric fistula, with 50,000 to 100,000 new cases annually. Adolescent girls are more vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, due to biological and social factors. Married girls in high HIV prevalence countries are at higher risk than unmarried peers. Child marriage has long-term consequences. Child marriage, when combined with female genital cutting, can lead to complications during pregnancy and lasting health problems for girls and their children. It is a barrier to girls' education in developing countries and undermines efforts for economic and social development. Causes include poverty, custom, and the desire to protect girls from violence or premarital sexual relations. Gender violence can also lead to child marriage. The practice of child marriage, considered a harmful traditional practice by the United Nations, involves a man abducting and raping a girl, negotiating a settlement with the girl's parents, and sometimes marrying the victim. International conventions aim to eliminate child marriages and ensure freedom in choosing a spouse. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child prohibits child marriages. Child marriage is prohibited by international conventions, with the minimum age set at eighteen years. In Ethiopia, Girls' Activity Committees work to support girls in school, advocate for their education, raise awareness about child marriage, promote girls' school attendance, and reduce gender-based violence. They collaborate with traditional leaders to create safer environments for girls. In 2005, the Senior Coordinator for International Women's Issues of the Department of State initiated an effort to collect information on child marriage incidence, funded initiatives to reduce it, and assess the need for additional programs.
