    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bovine Growth Hormone Moratorium Act of 1993\" and addresses the sale of milk produced with bovine growth hormone. The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to include a new subsection (k) regarding the sale of milk produced with bovine growth hormone. Definitions for bovine growth hormone and cow are provided, and a prohibition on sale is outlined. During the specified period after the Bovine Growth Hormone Moratorium Act of 1993, it is illegal to sell milk from cows injected with bovine growth hormone for commercial use if the seller was aware of the injection. Records must be maintained by those selling or injecting the hormone as per regulations. The Secretary must issue regulations requiring persons who sell or inject bovine growth hormone into cows to maintain records with specified information within 30 days of the Bovine Growth Hormone Moratorium Act of 1993. The regulations under this subparagraph mandate record-keeping requirements for bovine growth hormone, including quantity, source, date obtained, recipients, injected cows, and ownership interests. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance. Penalties for violating regulations on bovine growth hormone include a civil penalty of $1,000 for a first violation of certain paragraphs, and $10,000 for each subsequent violation. Each day of selling milk in violation is considered a separate violation. The Bovine Growth Hormone Moratorium Act of 1993 imposes penalties for violating regulations, with each day of violation treated as a separate offense. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on the economic impact of bovine growth hormone on the dairy industry and submit a report to Congress within a year."
