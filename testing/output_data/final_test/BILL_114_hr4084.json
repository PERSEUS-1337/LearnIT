    "content": "The \"Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act\" is cited as the short title. Section 951 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to focus on nuclear energy. The Secretary conducts civilian nuclear research, development, and commercial application programs with objectives including promoting scientific progress, maintaining research programs, reducing nuclear weapons proliferation, and minimizing environmental impact of nuclear energy. The text chunk discusses the objectives of reducing the environmental impact of nuclear energy activities, supporting technology transfer from National Laboratories to the private sector, and enabling partnerships for demonstrating novel reactor concepts. It also defines an advanced fission reactor as a nuclear reactor with significant improvements over the most recent generation. The curr_chunk defines terms related to neutron radiation, including fast neutron, national laboratory, neutron flux, and neutron source for research purposes. The Congress recognizes the importance of nuclear energy for scientific progress, national security, electricity generation, industrial applications, and space exploration. The Department should focus on research programs that enable private sector, National Laboratories, and universities to advance nuclear engineering knowledge. SEC. 3. NUCLEAR ENERGY RESEARCH PROGRAMS. Amends Section 952 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. \n\nSEC. 4. ADVANCED FUEL CYCLE INITIATIVE. Amends Section 953(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n\nSEC. 5. UNIVERSITY NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT. Amends Section 954(d)(4) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n\nSEC. 6. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CIVILIAN NUCLEAR INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES. Section 955 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish a versatile neutron source as a national user facility, consulting with various stakeholders to meet research needs. The Secretary is required to determine the mission need by December 31, 2016, and provide updates to the Committee on Science promptly. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish a national user facility with fast neutron spectrum irradiation capability and capacity for upgrades to support research needs. The Secretary must provide a detailed plan to the Committee on Science and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish a national user facility with capabilities for high-temperature testing, fast neutron irradiation, maximizing irradiation flexibility, lower energy spectrum neutron irradiation, multiple loops for testing in different coolants, and additional pre-irradiation and post-irradiation features. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended to establish a national user facility with capabilities for high-temperature testing, fast neutron irradiation, maximizing irradiation flexibility, lower energy spectrum neutron irradiation, multiple loops for testing in different coolants, and additional pre-irradiation and post-irradiation examination capabilities. The Department aims to complete construction and approve the start of operations for this facility by December 31, 2025, reporting progress in annual budget requests and leveraging best practices for management, construction, and operation from the Office of Science. SEC. 7. SECURITY OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES. Amends Section 956 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 by removing a specific reference. SEC. 8. HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATION AND SUPPORTIVE RESEARCH. Amends Section 957 to focus on high-performance computation and supportive research. The Secretary will enhance new reactor technologies through high-performance computation modeling and simulation, coordinating with relevant agencies. The program aims to develop computational software for advanced fission reactor systems, nuclear fusion systems, and space exploration reactors, as well as tools to simulate nuclear phenomena for validation through physical experimentation. The Secretary will enhance new reactor technologies through high-performance computation modeling and simulation, coordinating with relevant agencies to predict nuclear phenomena for validation through physical experimentation and support additional research activities to maximize the utility of research facilities. SEC. 9. ENABLING NUCLEAR ENERGY INNOVATION. This section adds a new provision to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to enable nuclear energy innovation. The Secretary will establish the National Reactor Innovation Center to test and demonstrate reactor concepts proposed by the private sector. Federal agencies and National Laboratories will provide technical expertise to expedite the construction and operation of experimental reactors. The objectives include validating novel reactor concepts, resolving technical uncertainties, and conducting research to improve emerging technologies. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, will report on the Department's capabilities to oversee privately funded fusion and advanced fission experimental reactors. This includes assessing safety review and oversight capabilities, leveraging expertise from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and National Laboratories. The Secretary will report on potential sites for hosting fusion and fission activities, contractual mechanisms for partnering with the private sector, cost structures for security and decommissioning, and other challenges identified. SEC. 10. BUDGET PLAN. Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include a new section on budget planning. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act requires the Department to submit 2 alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development to specific committees. The first plan assumes constant annual funding at the 2016 level, while the second is unconstrained. These plans must prioritize programs, projects, and activities to support next-generation nuclear energy technology and include realistic budget requirements for implementing certain sections of the Act. The Department of Energy must submit a report on fusion innovation within 6 months of the Act's enactment, detailing engineering designs for fusion energy systems with potential for net energy production within 15 years. The report will also outline budget requirements for a fusion innovation initiative to accelerate research and development. SEC. 11. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. The Energy Policy Act of 2005's table of contents is amended to include new sections on high-performance computation, nuclear energy innovation, and budget planning. Passed by the House of Representatives on February 29, 2016."
