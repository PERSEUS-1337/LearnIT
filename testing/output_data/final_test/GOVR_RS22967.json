    "content": "In 2018, U.S. aid to Palestinians underwent significant changes, with the Trump Administration reducing funding for programs benefiting Palestinians. The Administration aims to involve the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in U.S.-led diplomacy on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas cut off diplomatic ties with the Administration in response to President Trump's decisions regarding Jerusalem. At least $225 million of aid was reprogrammed by the Administration in August and September 2018. In August and September 2018, the Trump Administration reprogrammed $225 million of FY2017 bilateral economic aid initially allocated for the West Bank and Gaza. This included ending U.S. humanitarian contributions to UNRWA and continuing nonlethal security assistance from the INCLE account to train and equip PA security forces. The Trump Administration's actions regarding FY2017 ESF funding for the Palestinians have raised concerns about future-year funding, leading to potential suspensions of aid programs in the West Bank and Gaza. The status of ESF programs and UNRWA's operations could impact the region's security and economic situation, sparking debates on U.S. political leverage and potential replacement of U.S. funding by other countries. In 2018, Congress suspended ESF funding for the Palestinians via the Taylor Force Act. The U.S. government clarified that $165 million in FY2017 ESF would have been withheld regardless of reprogramming. Future funding will be suspended unless Palestinian entities stop payments to individuals involved in terrorism. The Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 could lead to a complete end of U.S. aid for the Palestinians. The U.S. has halted bilateral aid for the Palestinians, citing it as not in the national interest or providing value to taxpayers. This decision follows a review of assistance to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza, with the aim to encourage their participation in U.S.-led diplomacy for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. President Trump halted hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Palestinians, stating it would only resume if they negotiate peace. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and top adviser on the Middle East, is pushing to cut all funding to Palestinian civilians to gain leverage in peace negotiations. The Trump Administration reprogrammed $231.542 million of economic aid intended for the West Bank and Gaza for other purposes in FY2017. This included $200 million directed to high-priority projects elsewhere and $25 million originally planned for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network. In September, the Trump Administration decided to bar Palestinians from participating in a Conflict Management and Mitigation program funded by USAID and the U.S. embassy in Israel. This decision halted new grants for initiatives involving West Bank Palestinians. The September decision halted new grants for initiatives involving West Bank Palestinians. USAID decided to support programs involving Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs to avoid program shutdown. Concerns have been raised about reduced U.S. influence in the region. The U.S. will not make further contributions to UNRWA. The United States has decided to stop funding UNRWA due to unsustainable fiscal practices and lack of international support. This decision will have a significant impact on innocent Palestinians, especially school children. The United States has decided to end funding for UNRWA, impacting Palestinian refugees, especially school children. The US aims to explore new models for assistance to provide a more stable future for Palestinian children. The United States has been a major contributor to UNRWA, providing around one-third of its annual budget. U.S. contributions come from humanitarian accounts and are administered by the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. The U.S. decision in August to stop funding UNRWA has sparked debate among Members of Congress and UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krahenbuhl. Krahenbuhl stated that the responsibility for the refugee issue lies with the parties involved and the international community's lack of action. Israeli government had been recommending changes until August. The Israeli government had initially recommended gradual funding cuts to UNRWA, with concerns about humanitarian and security consequences. However, Prime Minister Netanyahu changed course and urged President Trump to cut all funding for UNRWA, stating that the agency perpetuates refugees. PLO Secretary General Erekat argued for continued support, emphasizing UNRWA's international obligation to assist Palestinian refugees. UNRWA plans to seek emergency funding to cover its deficit for 2018, estimated at $21 million. Despite potential funding cuts, the agency aims to continue its operations until June 2020. Efforts are being made by various countries to help cover the shortfall, with $92 million saved internally and pledges totaling $425 million. Some countries are working to raise funds to help UNRWA cover its 2018 shortfall. If UNRWA cannot provide core services like youth education and health care, it is unclear what alternatives Palestinian refugees might have. Israeli defense officials warn that cuts to UNRWA in Gaza could strengthen Hamas, affecting stability in the West Bank and other countries hosting Palestinian refugees. Other organizations may struggle to replace UNRWA due to the large scope of its operations. The United States is considering replacing UNRWA due to the large scope of its operations and its direct implementation of programs. However, a former general counsel for UNRWA believes that the end of U.S. funding may not have a dire impact on Palestinians if UNRWA makes its benefits more cost-effective and need-based. The U.S. continues to provide aid to train and equip PA civil security forces in the West Bank to counter militants and improve rule of law, encouraging greater security coordination with Israel. The PA security forces have continued coordination with Israel despite opposition. Palestinian leaders believe the US is aligning with Israel on diplomatic outcomes. Officials are discarding failed diplomatic frameworks and helping Palestinians face realities for future negotiations. White House advisor Jared Kushner emphasizes dealing with issues as they arise to achieve real peace. Some observers question the Administration's approach, noting similarities to past administrations. Members of Congress doubt economic pressure will lead to political concessions from Palestinians. In a letter to President Trump, Senators expressed opposition to using funding cuts to pressure the PLO and PA to engage with the United States, warning that it could strengthen extremists like Hamas. Representatives also urged the Administration to reverse its decision on funding streams for Palestinians. The success of this political strategy hinges on whether cutting funding will increase U.S. leverage over the Palestinians. The withdrawal of material benefits and political access for the Palestinians could decrease U.S. influence on Palestinian actions, according to former U.S. officials. Abbas and other Palestinian officials have focused on rallying support within the United Nations in opposition to U.S. and Israeli policies. 62% of Palestinians oppose resuming dialogue with the Trump Administration. Various stakeholders have expressed opinions about the impact of U.S. funding changes on assistance to Palestinians. A letter from 34 Senators urged President Trump to reverse funding cuts, citing the potential consequences on emergency food aid, healthcare, clean water access, rehabilitation services, and breast cancer treatment for thousands of individuals. Additionally, the decision to end U.S. contributions to UNRWA puts civilian support at risk. The decision to end U.S. contributions to UNRWA jeopardizes education for 525,000 children, food assistance for 1 million residents in Gaza, and public health in the refugee population. Funding cuts could worsen the situation in Gaza, impacting economic growth and unemployment. Transfers of aid and PA money have declined since 2017, leading to significant effects on the region. The U.S. funding cuts for UNRWA and aid to Gaza have significant effects on economic growth and unemployment. Administration officials were urged to provide economic aid to alleviate humanitarian challenges in Gaza. A State Department official defended the decision to reprogram ESF away from the West Bank and Gaza due to Hamas control endangering lives and worsening the humanitarian situation. Funding cuts for the West Bank could undermine stability and economic stability. Funding cuts for the West Bank could jeopardize stability and economic well-being, potentially leading to Palestinian workers, students, and refugees facing hardships. Concerns have been raised about reprogramming $25 million from hospitals in East Jerusalem that provide specialized treatment to Palestinians, including children with cancer and those needing cardiac surgery. The U.S. funding change announced $20 million for East Jerusalem hospitals providing specialized treatments like cardiac surgery and pediatric dialysis. The Taylor Force Act was enacted to restrict certain PLO/PA payments linked to terrorism. Critics argue that any aid to the PA could indirectly support these payments. Rex Tillerson testified before Congress about the issue in June 2017. The Taylor Force Act suspends ESF aid that \"directly benefits\" the PA unless the Administration certifies that the PA and PLO are compliant. There is no standard definition for terrorism in the U.S. government, causing challenges in penalizing the PA. Palestinians may be jailed by Israel for acts considered civil disobedience by Americans. The Taylor Force Act suspends aid to the PA and PLO unless they take credible steps to end violence against Israeli and U.S. citizens, stop payments for terrorism, and revoke laws compensating imprisoned terrorists based on their sentence length. The Taylor Force Act requires the PA and PLO to condemn acts of violence, investigate and cooperate in bringing perpetrators to justice, or face aid suspension. The Administration must report to Congress if these steps are not taken, define \"acts of terrorism,\" and list criteria for aid determination. The Taylor Force Act requires the PA and PLO to condemn violence, investigate and bring perpetrators to justice, or face aid suspension. The Administration must report to Congress on PLO/PA terrorism-related payments and efforts to end them. Withheld aid can benefit the PA if certification is made within a certain time period, otherwise, 50% can be used for non-PA purposes and 50% outside of the West Bank and Gaza. Annual appropriations legislation has provided for reduction of ESF aid for the PA since FY2015. The Taylor Force Act (P.L. 115-245) enforces a \"dollar-for-dollar\" reduction of ESF aid for the PA in response to PLO/PA terrorism-related payments. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu supported the act, while PLO representative Zomlot criticized it. The impact on PLO/PA terrorism-related payments remains uncertain, with Abbas stating the payments will continue. The ATCA (P.L. 115-253) was passed to potentially expose the PA to terrorism-related lawsuits in the US. The ATCA was passed to potentially expose the PA to terrorism-related lawsuits in the US, leading to a possible end of US bilateral aid for the Palestinians. According to analysis, Palestinian leaders may forego U.S. aid due to potential legal liabilities under the ATCA. Efforts are being made to amend the ATCA to continue security assistance. Congress has the authority to allocate or withhold funding for Palestinians and other countries. Congress could provide U.S. foreign assistance to countries like Jordan or Lebanon to benefit Palestinians receiving UNRWA services. Congressional oversight could focus on implications of funding decisions and U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza. Pending legislation includes the FY2019 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations bills, with conditions attached to bilateral aid and reporting requirements for UNRWA. Bills introduced earlier this year include the Palestinian Assistance Reform Act and the UNRWA Accountability Act of 2018. Members in the Senate and House introduced bills such as the Palestinian Partnership Fund Act to establish a fund for joint economic development and people-to-people exchanges. The State Department would oversee the fund, with congressional leaders appointing its governing officers. The Palestinian Partnership Fund Act proposes the establishment of a fund for economic development and exchanges in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The fund would be overseen by the State Department, with annual contributions authorized from FY2019 through FY2024. The Senate committee version of the FY2019 appropriations bill would allocate $50 million for the fund, subject to vetting to prevent support for terrorist activities. Significant bilateral U.S. aid to the Palestinians began in the mid-1990s, totaling over $5 billion since 1994. Aid focuses on security, economic development, self-governance, and humanitarian needs, with conditions to prevent support for Hamas or terrorist activities. Aid to Hamas or Hamas-controlled entities is prohibited to prevent support for terrorism. The Secretary of State must ensure that economic assistance for the West Bank and Gaza does not fund terrorism and terminate aid to any individual or entity involved in terrorist activity. No aid is allowed for a power-sharing PA government with Hamas unless certain conditions are met. The PA government, including all ministers, must comply with the principles of recognizing Israel's right to exist and accepting previous agreements. Additional conditions apply if the government is Hamas-controlled, including restrictions on aid. ESF assistance is prohibited if Palestinians initiate an ICC investigation against Israeli nationals. ESF assistance is also prohibited if Palestinians gain the same standing as member states in the UN. The provision of aid to the Palestinian Authority is restricted if they achieve the same status as member states in the United Nations or any U.N. specialized agency, except UNESCO. Aid is not allowed for PA personnel in Gaza, the PLO, or the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. Funding for a future Palestinian state is contingent on certification from the Secretary of State that the state is committed to peaceful coexistence with Israel, counterterrorism measures, and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The U.S. aid programs for the Palestinians require vetting, monitoring, and evaluation to prevent aid from benefiting terrorists or corruption. The vetting process has become more rigorous since 2006, with reports showing compliance. The effectiveness of U.S. aid is challenged by conflicting objectives of Israel and Palestinian groups. Israeli security requirements and Palestinian factional disputes impact aid programs for Palestinian security, infrastructure, and economic development. Coordination with other donor states and international organizations like the EU, UN, World Bank, Quartet Representative, and Ad Hoc Liaison Committee adds complexity. Bilateral economic aid is provided through the ESF account, with USAID and other agencies supporting projects in the West Bank and Gaza for humanitarian assistance, economic development, democratic reform, water access, healthcare, and education. Since FY2014, the United States has provided budgetary assistance to the Palestinian Authority through direct payments to creditors, including Israeli utility companies and East Jerusalem hospitals. The PA, facing a yearly budget deficit of over $1 billion, relies on external sources for financial support. The U.S. also allocates funds for Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation and Arab-Israeli cooperation, in addition to bilateral assistance. Security assistance programs have been sponsored by the U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. The U.S. Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority sponsors nonlethal security assistance programs for West Bank-based PA security forces. Training has taken place in Jordan due to Israeli restrictions on firearm use. The program shifted to an \"advise and assist\" role around 2012, focusing on improving the PA's criminal justice system. The USSC works alongside other countries and the European Union in providing assistance to Palestinian security forces and intelligence organizations. The U.S. Security Coordinator sponsors nonlethal security assistance programs for PA forces in the West Bank, with training in Jordan. The PA forces have shown increased professionalism, improving law and order in West Bank cities. The United States has been the largest donor to UNRWA, providing over $6 billion in contributions for relief and protection services to Palestine refugees. UNRWA, funded by Western governments and international organizations, provides assistance and protection to approximately 5.4 million Palestine refugees. It faces security concerns and political pressures from Hamas. The program budget mainly relies on voluntary contributions for core programs such as food, shelter, education, and medical care. UNRWA provides humanitarian and social services to 5.4 million Palestine refugees through voluntary contributions. In FY2017, the United States contributed $359.3 million, with concerns raised in Congress about potential support for terrorists. UNRWA receives US funding with conditions to prevent support for terrorism. The State Department and UNRWA have a cooperation framework since 2010 to ensure compliance. Some in Congress seek increased oversight of UNRWA. Legislation and resolutions have been proposed to increase oversight of UNRWA, strengthen vetting procedures, and cap U.S. contributions. Annual appropriations legislation since FY2015 includes provisions for the State Department to report to Congress on UNRWA's compliance with various requirements, such as maintaining neutrality in facilities, ensuring educational materials align with human rights values, and addressing any violations promptly. In 2012, there was a public debate in the United States regarding UNRWA's provision of services to descendants of the original Palestinian refugees from 1948. The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee approved a reporting requirement for FY2013 appropriations to differentiate between the original refugees and their descendants, which was objected to by the State Department. The State Department was required to report on the issue of UNRWA's provision of services to descendants of Palestinian refugees. UNRWA officials argued against the idea that the right of return of Palestine refugees would disappear if UNHCR took over responsibility. Some observers noted differences in the definitions of refugees between UNHCR and UNRWA. The 2015 State Department report highlighted that both UNHCR and UNRWA recognize descendants of refugees as refugees in protracted refugee situations, citing examples such as Tibetan refugees in India and Nepal, Burmese refugees in Thailand, Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, Afghan refugees in Pakistan, and Somali refugees in Kenya."
