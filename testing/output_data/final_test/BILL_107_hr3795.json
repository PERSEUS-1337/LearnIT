The Congress finds that accounting firms have a history of inaccurate audits, leading to costly failures for investors. Auditors face conflicts of interest as they are hired and fired by their clients, pressuring them to approve substandard financial statements. Independence in auditing is crucial for all investors, necessitating government agency audits for true independence. The Federal Bureau of Audits, regulated by the Commission, will provide honest audits for publicly traded companies. The establishment of the Bureau is outlined in Section 3. The Federal Bureau of Audits is established as an independent regulatory agency within the Commission. It conducts annual audits of financial statements required by reporting issuers under securities laws. The Bureau is led by a Director appointed by the President, with a Deputy Director and Inspector General also appointed for 12-year terms. The Federal Bureau of Audits is an independent regulatory agency within the Commission. The Director, Deputy Director, and Inspector General are appointed for terms of 12 years, with exceptions for the first terms. The officers and personnel of the Bureau are not under the supervision of any other part of the Commission, except as provided in sections 4 and 5. The Bureau is authorized to establish procedural and administrative rules necessary for its functions but cannot establish auditing standards. The Bureau has the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas, and conduct inquiries. Former Bureau employees cannot work for audited issuers or their accountants. Employees of the Bureau must place investments in a blind trust and are exempt from the civil service pay system. Attorneys designated by the Director of the Bureau can represent the Bureau in civil actions related to its functions. SEC. 4. ASSUMPTION OF AUTHORITY BY COMMISSION OVER AUDITING STANDARDS. The Commission has the authority to establish auditing standards for financial statements of reporting issuers of securities. These standards must incorporate generally accepted auditing standards with necessary modifications for the public interest and investor protection. Rules prescribed by the Commission must be open for public comment for at least 90 days. The rules must be open for public comment for 90 days, prescribed within 180 days of enactment, and effective on the first January 1 after the 180 days. SEC. 5. FEES FOR THE RECOVERY OF COSTS OF OPERATIONS. The Commission will assess and collect fees on reporting issuers audited by the Bureau starting from the first applicable fiscal year. Total fee revenues collected will be based on appropriations, with individual fees determined to ensure the total collected equals the appropriated amount. The Commission may grant fee waivers or reductions if the fee exceeds expectations. The Commission will collect fees from reporting issuers audited by the Bureau, ensuring that fees do not exceed operational costs.
