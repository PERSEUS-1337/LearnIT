    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Salmon Planning Act\" and includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that certain species of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River basin are at risk of extinction due to various factors. These fish have significant economic, ecological, and cultural importance, supporting jobs and serving as indicators of river ecosystem health. The US Government has treaties with Indian tribes in the region. Since the construction of 4 Federal dams on the lower Snake River in Washington, salmon and steelhead populations have plummeted, with all salmon and steelhead in the Snake River now extinct or listed under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists warn that without changes, remaining Snake River salmon will be extinct in our lifetime, costing taxpayers billions of dollars. The federally funded group of State, tribal, Federal, and independent scientists found that partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams in Washington is the best way to protect and recover Snake River salmon and steelhead. Several communities reliant on the dams would be impacted by partial removal. A Federal court ruled that the dams violate water quality standards. The Northwest's energy production heavily relies on hydropower, linking salmon recovery and energy prospects. The Act aims to protect Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead while ensuring reliable energy, sustainable salmon recovery, and mitigation of economic impacts from potential dam removal. It also emphasizes the need for rapid response to protect and recover fish in the region. Scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts is mandated by SEC. 3. The Secretary of Commerce must arrange for scientific analysis of Federal salmon recovery efforts within 3 months of this Act's enactment. The analysis will evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of current and anticipated actions to recover salmon populations listed under the Endangered Species Act. A report on the analysis must be submitted within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report on the scientific analysis of Federal salmon recovery efforts to multiple government agencies within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The GAO will study the partial removal of Lower Snake River dams. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the potential effects of partially removing the 4 lower Snake River dams, including economic impacts on communities and transportation by water. The study will assess the economic benefits and costs, environmental impacts, means for mitigating harm, and development needs of alternatives to continue transporting cargo currently done by water. It will also examine the effects of partial dam removal on irrigation and energy production, including regional impacts. The study will assess the economic effects of changes in energy production, identify renewable energy sources, and analyze the impacts of salmon and steelhead extinction in the Snake River. The Comptroller General will submit a report to relevant authorities within 18 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION AND PLANNING OF SALMON RECOVERY. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to partially remove the 4 lower Snake River dams if necessary for salmon and steelhead population restoration, treaty obligations, or environmental protection requirements. Preliminary planning work will be undertaken by the Army Secretary. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to remove the 4 lower Snake River dams for salmon and steelhead population restoration. $4,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2004, for this purpose. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include Federal salmon recovery actions for protecting and restoring salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River basin, lower Snake River dams, and populations of 12 evolutionarily significant units of salmon and steelhead in the region. The Columbia and Snake River basin species listed under the Endangered Species Act of 1973."
