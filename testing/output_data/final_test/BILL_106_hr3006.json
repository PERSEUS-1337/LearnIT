    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Education Act of 1999\". Congress finds that access to high-quality early education programs is essential for children's development, especially for those from low-income families. Research shows that early brain development plays a crucial role in educational and intellectual achievement, emphasizing the importance of early education opportunities for children to develop language and literacy skills necessary for learning to read. Early education programs help children develop language and literacy skills needed for reading. Evaluations show that children in these programs perform better in reading and math, stay on track academically, avoid grade retention or special education, exhibit better learning retention, creativity, and social skills, and are more enthusiastic about school. Investing in quality early education programs leads to children being more enthusiastic about school and having good attendance records. Studies suggest that for every dollar invested in early education, about 7 dollars are saved in later costs. Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Early Education, emphasizing the importance of investing in quality early education programs. Studies show that such investments lead to increased enthusiasm for school and better attendance records, with significant cost savings in the long run. Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Early Education, defining it as at least a half day of schooling each weekday before kindergarten. The purpose is to establish a program for early literacy and numerical training by awarding grants to State educational agencies to expand education with early education programs. The Secretary can award grants to at least 10 State educational agencies for this purpose, with a matching requirement not exceeding 50%. The program funded under Title X shall not exceed 50% of the total cost and must be carried out by local educational agencies in public school buildings or other facilities. It must be available to all children served by the agency and only involve qualified instructors. Each State educational agency seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Secretary, detailing the program to be assisted, its total cost, and how it will be coordinated with other federally funded programs. The program must be carried out by local educational agencies in public school buildings, involve qualified instructors, and not exceed 50% of the total cost. The State educational agency must coordinate activities funded under this section with other federally funded programs like Head Start and Even Start Family Literacy Program to avoid duplication. Coordination may include activities funded under part B of title I, section 619 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or the Head Start Act with consent from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must approve coordination of activities funded under this section with other programs to avoid service reductions. The Secretary has the authority to monitor, evaluate, and report on the funded programs, and may establish additional policies. Funds under this section must supplement, not replace, other federal funds. Authorization of Appropriations: $300,000,000 are authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 to supplement other funds."
