    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act\". The Tiahrt Amendments limit ATF's ability to disclose crime gun trace data, prevent collection of valuable information for preventing illegal gun use, impede enforcement of gun laws, and increase gun sales to criminals according to studies. In 2016, a study found that 79% of guns recovered from crime scenes belonged to someone other than the perpetrator, with 30% being stolen. A gun is stolen in the US every 2 minutes, and nearly 115,000 Americans are shot each year. In 2016, 38,658 Americans were killed with a gun. Effective policies to prevent illegal gun trafficking can make communities safer, and repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts in combating illegal guns.
