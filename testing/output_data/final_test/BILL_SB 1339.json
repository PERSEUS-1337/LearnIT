    "title": "SB 1339",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 10003 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code, stating the following. Section 10003 of the Welfare and Institutions Code requires recipients of aid to promptly notify the county of their change of residence for CalWORKs, CalFresh, or Medi-Cal benefits. Recipients have various options to report the change, and the county must initiate an intercounty transfer within seven business days of notification. Benefits should be transferred no later than the first day of the next available benefit month after 30 days of notification. The intercounty transfer process for CalWORKs, CalFresh, or Medi-Cal benefits aims to be simple and client-friendly, minimizing workload for county eligibility operations. It ensures no interruption in benefits by electronically sharing case file documents between the prior and new county of residence. The new county of residence for CalFresh or CalWORKs recipients will not interview them for continued eligibility until the next scheduled recertification. CalWORKs recipients may still be interviewed for welfare-to-work program participation. For beneficiaries under a Medi-Cal managed care health plan, specific rules apply. If a beneficiary moves to another county but remains enrolled in a managed care health plan from the previous county, they will still have access to emergency services and authorized out-of-network coverage until the intercounty transfer process is complete and they are disenrolled from the plan. If a beneficiary moves to another county while still enrolled in a managed care health plan from the previous county, they can request expedited disenrollment to access nonemergent care in the new county. County-initiated disenrollment is processed within three business days, while beneficiary-initiated disenrollment by phone is effective within two business days if requested before 5 p.m. Requests made after 5 p.m. are processed the following business day. A beneficiary who moves to a new county can access full benefits through fee-for-service until enrolled in a new managed care plan. If moving to a county with a county organized health system, enrollment occurs the following month. Failure to report a move within the state does not lead to overpayment. The State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services will implement this section through various instructions until regulations are adopted by July 1, 2021. Beginning June 1, 2017, the State Department of Health Care Services and the State Department of Social Services will provide status reports to the Legislature on the adoption of regulations every six months until regulations are in place. This section will only be implemented if federal financial participation is available and necessary approvals are obtained. It will become effective on June 1, 2017. The caretaker relative, approved under Section 309, is moving to a new county and applying for benefits for related children under the CalWORKs Program. If they later apply for benefits themselves, they must meet program requirements. County CalWORKs programs must verify eligibility. Section 11053 of the Welfare and Institutions Code will be inoperative on June 1, 2017, and repealed on January 1, 2018, unless a later statute extends these dates. When a recipient changes residence within the state, they must notify the county paying aid and apply for eligibility in the new county. The new county will determine continued eligibility for aid and Medi-Cal within 30 days of being notified by the previous county. The first county must provide necessary documents to establish eligibility and grant amount to the new county. The Welfare and Institutions Code will be repealed on January 1, 2018 unless a later statute extends the dates. Section 11053.2 mandates the establishment of an intercounty transfer process for CalFresh benefits to ensure seamless benefits when recipients move within the state. The intercounty transfer process for CalFresh recipients receiving CalWORKs benefits or Medi-Cal benefits must be implemented by April 1, 2011. An intercounty transfer process for CalFresh recipients not receiving CalWORKs or Medi-Cal benefits must be developed by July 1, 2011, to simplify the process, be client-friendly, and minimize workload for county eligibility operations. Upon implementation of intercounty transfer procedures, recipients must notify their prior county of residence of their move. The prior county will then inform the new county of the recipient's location. The new county will determine the recipient's eligibility for CalFresh benefits without requiring an interview until the next scheduled recertification. The department may implement this section through all-county letters or similar instructions from the director by specific dates for different subdivisions. The department must adopt regulations by July 1, 2012, to implement this section. Emergency regulations can be adopted by the director under the Administrative Procedure Act for immediate preservation of public peace, health, and safety. These emergency regulations are exempt from review by the Office of Administrative Law and will remain in effect for up to 180 days. Section 11102 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to state that county residence is not a requirement for aid under public assistance programs. The county where the applicant lives is responsible for accepting the application and making aid payments. If a person receiving aid moves to another county in California, responsibility for payment is transferred to the new county within 30 days of notification. The county of residence is not a requirement for aid under public assistance programs. The county responsible for accepting applications and making aid payments is where the applicant lives. If a recipient moves to another county in California, payment responsibility is transferred within 30 days of notification. County residence is not a qualification for aid under public assistance programs. The county where the applicant lives is responsible for accepting applications and making aid payments. If a recipient moves to another county in California, payment responsibility is transferred within 30 days. The section specifies the county where a person who leaves their county for medical care should be considered a resident. It also mentions the effective date of the section and reimbursement for costs mandated by the state."
