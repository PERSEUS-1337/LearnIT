    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1505 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to exclude certain facilities from the chapter's regulations, including health facilities, clinics, juvenile placement facilities, child day care facilities, facilities for religious healing practices, and school dormitories. The amended Section 1505 of the Health and Safety Code excludes various facilities from regulations, including school dormitories, recovery houses for alcoholism or drug addiction, and alcoholism or drug abuse treatment facilities. The Health and Safety Code excludes certain facilities from regulations, such as school dormitories, alcoholism or drug abuse recovery/treatment facilities, and arrangements for the care of children by relatives or close friends without financial profit. It also includes home placements by juvenile courts supervised by welfare or probation departments. Any home of a nonrelative extended family member providing care to children placed by a juvenile court, and supervised by the county welfare or probation department is included. Additionally, supervised independent living placements for nonminor dependents placed by the juvenile court and supervised by various agencies are also covered. A Transitional Housing Program-Plus for eligible former foster youth over 18 years old, supported living arrangements for individuals with developmental disabilities, and family home agencies vendored by the State Department of Developmental Services are included in the program. Family home agencies provide 24-hour care for adults with developmental disabilities in approved family homes or teaching homes, not licensed or certified by state departments. Family home agencies recruit, approve, and support family homes. No implication of establishing a family home agency or licensing category. Facilities for Indian children under the Indian Child Welfare Act include extended family members or foster homes approved by the child's tribe. Any housing occupied by elderly or disabled persons, initially approved and operated under specific regulatory agreements, where supportive services are available to residents at their option, as long as the project owner or operator does not provide the services. Any housing occupied by elderly or disabled persons, initially approved and operated under specific regulatory agreements, may have supportive services available to residents at their option. The project owner or operator is not allowed to provide the services but can coordinate access to them. Additionally, a resource family as defined in the Welfare and Institutions Code, or any similar facility determined by the director, may also fall under these regulations. Section 1534.3 of the Health and Safety Code states that a recovery house owned or operated by a licensed community care facility is considered part of the facility and subject to inspection and enforcement. The community care facility provides treatment services for alcohol or drug abuse recovery. A recovery house owned or operated by a licensed community care facility is considered an integral component of the facility, providing services such as outpatient treatment, support meetings, and drug testing. The recovery house serves six or fewer persons and is not required to be licensed separately. The text states that subdivision (a) does not apply when a community care facility in a recovery house serves six persons or less. No reimbursement is required for this act as it creates a new crime or infraction."
