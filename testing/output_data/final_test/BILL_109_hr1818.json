    "content": "The \"Airport Screener Technology Improvement Act of 2005\" aims to facilitate airport growth, enhance air transportation system efficiency, and improve security. Installing in-line baggage screening systems at airports would reduce congestion at airline ticket counters and improve passenger flow in terminals, allowing for airport growth and faster baggage screening compared to stand-alone systems. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting the installation of advanced in-line baggage screening equipment by the TSA to enhance airport security. The chairman also supported moving explosives units to a secured area for a more seamless and secure baggage screening process. The chairman emphasized the benefits of a secured area for baggage screening, highlighting increased security, efficiency, and convenience. The GAO reports that many airports are planning to install in-line baggage screening systems. TSA and airport operators rely on letters of intent for funding airport modifications. The TSA relies on letters of intent to fund airport modifications for in-line baggage screening systems. By January 2005, 8 letters of intent had been issued for 9 airports, costing the Federal Government $957.1 million over 4 years. An additional 27 airports were identified as needing these systems to comply with screening mandates. The TSA relies on letters of intent to fund airport modifications for in-line baggage screening systems. TSA estimates that in-line systems at 9 airports could save $1.3 billion over 7 years and recover initial investment in a little over 1 year. However, TSA lacks resources to fund additional letters of intent. Greater investment in these systems is economically justified, recommended by the 9/11 Commission, and would enhance airport growth, air transportation efficiency, and security. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving explosives detection at screening checkpoints. Recent reports show the need for enhancements in aviation passenger screening to prevent dangerous items from entering airports. Despite diligent screeners, there has been a lack of improvement. The Inspector General emphasized the need for greater use of technology to improve screener performance at TSA checkpoints. TSA agrees that significant improvements can only be achieved through the introduction of new technology. SEC. 4 amends Section 44923(h)(1) of title 49, United States Code to allocate funds for aviation security capital in fiscal years 2004-2007. It increases funding to $650,000,000 in 2006 and 2007. Section 44923(h)(3) is also amended to allocate discretionary grants for explosive detection at airport checkpoints. Section 44940 of title 49, United States Code is amended to establish the Checkpoint Screening Security Fund with a deposit of $250,000,000 in fiscal year 2006 from fees collected under subsection (a)(1) by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Checkpoint Screening Security Fund was established with a deposit of at least $250,000,000 in fiscal year 2006 for the purchase of equipment to improve security screening personnel's ability to detect explosives."
