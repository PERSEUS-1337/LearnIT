    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund federal agencies, with 12 regular appropriations bills ideally passed before the fiscal year begins. If not, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide interim funding. The Department of Defense (DOD) has operated under a CR for an average of 119 days per year since FY2010, compared to 32 days per year from FY2002-FY2009. DOD has spent over 39 months under a CR since 2010, compared to less than 9 months in the 8 years prior. During a CR, DOD funding needs can change across various accounts due to evolving national security threats. If funded at a lower level than requested, DOD may face restrictions on personnel actions, maintenance, training, and contracted activities. During a continuing resolution (CR), delaying or deferring planned personnel actions, maintenance, training, and contracted support can lead to personnel shortages, equipment maintenance backlogs, oversubscribed training courses, and increased end-of-year contract spending. DOD program managers and senior leaders prepare in advance for potential delays in appropriations decisions to minimize contracting actions in the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal year. The Defense Acquisition University advises planning acquisition strategies and obligation plans based on the expectation of late enactment. During a continuing resolution, DOD managers can adjust program schedules and defer hiring actions to manage spending within the confines of a CR. Despite routine disruptions, there is little analysis on the long-term impact on military preparedness. An interim continuing resolution allows budget authority at a specified rate for projects and activities for a set period. The funding rate is based on the previous fiscal year's appropriations acts, with adjustments. This can have adverse effects on U.S. military preparedness in the long run. The funding rates for certain accounts in the fiscal year 2017 appropriations Acts were reduced by 0.6791% (Division D, Section 101). Congress has the flexibility to establish a CR funding rate based on various factors, such as the President's budget request or the appropriations bill for the pending year. CRs sometimes incorporate the text of regular appropriations bills for the current fiscal year, known as full text appropriations, to provide budget authority for covered activities. The \"Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, FY2011\" (P.L. 112-10) funded activities through full text appropriations, while Division B of the bill provided funding for projects based on the previous fiscal year's appropriations laws. If formulaic interim or full-year continuing appropriations were enacted for DOD, funding levels for base defense appropriations and Overseas Contingency would be determined. If formulaic interim or full-year continuing appropriations were enacted for DOD, funding levels for base defense appropriations and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) spending could be determined in various ways, such as establishing separate formulas for defense spending or funding defense and nondefense activities under the same formula. The level of OCO spending under a CR could be determined by the general formula or by providing an alternative rate or amount for such spending. For example, the first CR for FY2013 (P.L. 112-175) specified OCO funding based on the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. The CRs may contain limitations to allow minimal continuation of projects and activities, preserving congressional prerogatives. For example, an interim CR may prohibit agencies from starting new projects without prior funding. Congress has included specific sections in CRs to prohibit DOD from starting new programs without prior funding. The interim CR may limit starting new programs without prior funding and may cause problems for programs funded by multiple accounts if the funding ratio changes. For example, the Air Force combat rescue helicopter program saw a decrease in R&D funding and an increase in procurement funding between FY2019 and FY2020. The FY2020 program budget is $25 million higher than FY2019. A CR continuing previous funding would create a mismatch in R&D and procurement funds. CRs may have anomalies to address such issues and prevent a government shutdown. Congress may consider providing additional authority or flexibility for the Department of Defense (DOD) under a longer-term Continuing Resolution (CR) to avoid a government shutdown. The impact of a CR on DOD can vary depending on its length, with longer-term CRs posing more management challenges and risks. Anomalies may be included in a CR to address funding mismatches and extend expiring authorities for specific activities. The second CR for FY2017 (H.R. 2028 / P.L. 114-254) granted anomalies for DOD, including funding for the Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarine Program, multi-year procurement contracts for helicopters, and funding for the Air Force's KC-46A Tanker. DOD submitted a \"consolidated anomalies list\" to OMB in anticipation of an FY2018 CR, which included approximately 75 programs. The Office of Management and Budget received a \"consolidated anomalies list\" from the Department of Defense with around 75 programs that would be impacted by a prohibition on new starts or production quantity limits. These anomalies could make a continuing resolution more acceptable to agencies, potentially reducing the urgency for Congress to reach a budget agreement. The initial FY2018 CR did not address these programmatic issues, but subsequent measures included anomalies to address concerns. In 2018, an anomaly was included in the fourth measure (P.L. 115-123) to address Air Force concerns about the effects of a continuing resolution (CR) on FY2018 construction requirements. After a CR is enacted, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides detailed directions to executive agencies on fund availability and budget execution. OMB typically issues a bulletin announcing an automatic apportionment of funds for obligation, based on a percentage of the annualized amount provided by the CR. Funds are apportioned based on the time period or historical spending patterns covered by the CR. In an interim CR, Congress may authorize OMB to mitigate furloughs by apportioning funds for personnel compensation at a higher rate. CRs can create budget uncertainty, disrupt agency operations, and cause inefficiencies according to a GAO analyst. During a CR, agencies are often required to take limited funding actions. During CRs, agencies manage inefficiencies by shifting contract cycles, providing spending guidance, and facing consequences like additional paperwork and short-term contracting needs. The CR imposes funding restrictions and managerial complications, hindering agencies from saving money through bulk purchases or locking in discounts with long-term contracts. During a CR, agencies struggle to save money through bulk purchases or long-term contracts, hindering their ability to lock in discounts and exploit government purchasing power. DOD faces unique challenges in providing military forces under a CR, impacting readiness and limiting flexibility in funding patterns. Former Defense Secretary Ashton Carter warned that CRs put commanders in a \"straitjacket\" that hinders their ability to adapt to future threats. During a CR, agencies face challenges in saving money through bulk purchases or long-term contracts, impacting readiness and flexibility in funding patterns. CRs limit DOD's ability to adapt to evolving threats like the Islamic State, delaying development and production of weapon systems. This also restricts DOD's ability to enter into long-term contracts, affecting program stability and efficiency. CRs can increase costs, time, and risk by impacting trust and confidence with suppliers. During a CR, DOD may face significant issues with programs drawing funds from multiple accounts, leading to funding constraints and potential problems with program transitions. Specifically, the Navy's shipbuilding account, SCN, is managed at the line-item level under a CR, impacting funding apportionment. During a CR, the Navy's shipbuilding account, SCN, is managed at the line-item level, causing misalignments in funding which can lead to program execution challenges. Reports suggest that CRs increase costs and reduce efficiencies, but lack data for systematic analysis. The impact of CR-caused bureaucratic disruption on combat capability and readiness of U.S. forces is not well-addressed. The RAND Corporation's 2019 study on the impact of Continuing Resolutions (CRs) on DOD procurement programs did not show strong evidence of delays or increased costs. However, concerns about CR effects remain valid. Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer estimated that CRs cost the Navy around $4 billion since 2011, with an average of 106 days per year over the last decade. Continuing Resolutions (CRs) have averaged 106 days per year in the last decade, affecting over 100,000 Department of the Navy contracts and costing billions of dollars. This uncertainty leads to higher prices charged to the government by contractors, resulting in additional costs estimated at $2.6 billion per year. The Navy paper did not justify assumptions for the low estimate. A 2017 RAND study sponsored by DOD found a lack of quantitative data on CR effects, making it difficult to estimate consequences. Research on CR consequences mainly used qualitative approaches focused on case studies and anecdotal information. RAND examined 151 procurement awards for high-profile programs during FY2013-FY2015 to determine if CRs are linked to cost increases and delays in DOD procurements. The study found no significant difference in delays or cost increases between awards made under CRs and regular appropriations bills. Comparisons were also made with awards from FY1999 when DOD operated under a CR for only 3 weeks, showing similar results.

RAND concluded that while there was no strong evidence that CRs are generally associated with delays or increased costs, further assessment may be needed due to limitations in the statistical analysis. Congress may wish to mandate a broader assessment of DOD's use of management discretion to mitigate potential adverse impacts, including long-term effects of continuing resolutions on national security."
