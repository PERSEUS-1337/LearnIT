Three key challenges include processing diverse reward distributions, reasoning over long time horizons, and exploring efficiently. A new algorithm proposed in this paper addresses these challenges and achieves human-level policies on nearly all Atari games by using a transformed Bellman operator, auxiliary temporal consistency loss, and human demonstrations for exploration guidance. Our algorithm surpasses human performance on 40 out of 42 Atari games by utilizing human demonstrations to guide the agent towards rewarding states. The key challenges it addresses include processing diverse reward distributions and achieving stable learning regardless of reward density and scale. The challenges in reinforcement learning include clipping rewards to achieve stability, reasoning over long time horizons, and efficient exploration of the MDP. Efficient exploration is crucial for discovering long trajectories with high cumulative rewards. In this paper, a new Deep Q-Network (DQN) BID12 style algorithm is proposed to address challenges in reinforcement learning, including efficient exploration to discover long trajectories with high cumulative rewards. The algorithm uses a transformed Bellman operator to reduce variance and process environment rewards regardless of scale and density, ensuring stable learning independent of reward distribution. The optimal policy remains unchanged in deterministic MDPs, and the algorithm converges to a fixed point in stochastic MDPs. Our algorithm learns stably at high discount factors with an auxiliary temporal consistency loss, extending the planning horizon by one order of magnitude compared to other deep RL approaches on Atari. We combine distributed experience replay with Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations for improved efficiency in exploration. Experimentally evaluated on 42 games with expert human player demonstrations. Our algorithm, RLED, utilizes expert demonstrations to enhance performance in difficult RL problems. It surpasses average human players on 40 games, expert players on 34 games, and state-of-the-art agents on at least 28 games. It excels in sparse reward games, completing the first level of MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE and scoring 3997 points on PITFALL! with only 5 demonstration trajectories. Our algorithm, RLED, combines expert demonstrations with RL data to improve performance in challenging RL tasks such as Atari or robotics. It builds upon previous works like DQfD and RBS, utilizing deep neural networks to explore Reinforcement Learning from Expert Demonstrations (RLED) in large MDPs. In robotics tasks, techniques like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been used with improvements to solve exploration problems. DQN utilizes deep neural networks as function approximators for RL in Atari games, with extensions like prioritized sampling and Ape-X DQN enhancing performance. Ape-X DQN separates data collection and learning processes by using multiple actors to feed data to a central prioritized replay buffer for sampling. The BID3 algorithm addressed over-generalization in DQN by constraining TD updates to be orthogonal to the direction of maximum change in the next state. However, this approach was only effective in simple domains like Cart-Pole. Van Hasselt et al. introduced PopArt, which rescales targets for the value network to have zero mean and unit variance. The algorithm described consists of the transformed Bellman operator, temporal consistency loss, and a combination of Ape-X DQN and DQfD for MDPs. DQfD introduces a finite, discrete-time MDP with state space X, action space A, reward function r, discount factor \u03b3, and stochastic kernel p. The goal is to find a policy \u03c0 * that maximizes the state-value V \u03c0 (x) by determining the optimal action-value function Q * BID15. The optimal action-value function Q * BID15 is crucial in determining the optimal policy in reinforcement learning. The Bellman optimality operator T helps in learning Q * through fixed point iteration. The DQN BID12 algorithm utilizes a deep neural network to approximate Q * and iterates to minimize the Huber loss. Huber loss is used in reinforcement learning to minimize errors caused by limited network capacity and stochastic optimization. To reduce variance, rewards are clipped to [-1, 1], stabilizing the algorithm but changing optimal policies. For example, in a simplified version of BOWLING, any policy hitting at least one pin becomes optimal after reward clipping. The text discusses a new approach to address reward clipping in reinforcement learning by focusing on the action-value function instead. A function is introduced to reduce the scale of the action-value function, leading to a unique fixed point in certain cases. The approach is further extended to stochastic MDPs. The proposition demonstrates that contracting h can decrease the scale and variance of the action-value function. The algorithm uses a specific function h with a regularization term to ensure Lipschitz continuity. In practice, DQN minimizes a problem by sampling transitions from a replay buffer. The stability of DQN is influenced by the target T h f \u03b8 (k\u22121) and can lead to instability as the discount factor \u03b3 approaches 1. To address this, an auxiliary temporal consistency (TC) loss is added to penalize weight updates that change. The Ape-X DQfD algorithm combines the transformed Bellman operator and TC loss with the DQfD algorithm for distributed prioritized experience replay. It is robust to reward distribution and can learn at higher discount factors (\u03b3 = 0.999). The algorithm consists of replay buffers, actor processes, and a learner process. Following Hester et al. FORMULA2, two replay buffers are maintained: an actor replay buffer and an expert replay buffer. The actor replay buffer stores transitions from actor processes interacting with the MDP and regularly removes transitions to limit memory consumption. The expert replay buffer is filled offline before training. Using 128 actor processes following an \u03b5 i -greedy policy, the performance of DQN with prioritized replay buffers can be significantly improved. The noise levels \u03b5 i are chosen based on \u03b1 i, resulting in exploration closer to BID6 with less random exploration. The learner process combines TD-loss with a supervised imitation loss, where transitions are sampled from replay buffers. The imitation loss is a max-margin loss combined with the TD and TC losses to form the total loss formulation. Algo. 1 in the appendix outlines the entire learner procedure. Our learning algorithm differs from previous methods in three key ways: we do not have a pre-training phase using only expert transitions, maintain a fixed ratio of actor and expert transitions, and apply the imitation loss only to the best expert episode. Performance is evaluated on 42 out of 57 games due to limited demonstrations. The experiment evaluates Ape-X DQN performance on 42 games using different hyperparameters, including a higher discount factor and no reward clipping. The goal is to find an algorithm that consistently learns on all games. The experiment evaluates Ape-X DQN performance on 42 games with varied hyperparameters, including no reward clipping. Results show that simplifying the reward structure improves learning, but reward clipping hinders consistency across games. Using the transformed Bellman operator can help recover some performance. Using the transformed Bellman operator can help recover performance losses from unclipped rewards. Ape-X DQN, DQfD BID6, and Rainbow DQN are compared, with scores obtained from running 360 actors. Performance is also compared to human players, with expert scores surpassing average human performance levels. The Ape-X DQfD algorithm with the standard dueling DQN architecture achieves a new state-of-the-art result on 39 out of 42 games, significantly improving performance over previous approaches. This increase in performance is reflected in the median human-normalized scores, showing a significant improvement in learning good policies across a broader range of games. The experimental setup for the Ape-X DQfD algorithm includes using a discount factor of \u03b3 = 0.999, a wider and deeper network architecture, and achieving high scores on 40 out of 42 games, outperforming an average human. The algorithm is the first to learn non-trivial policies on all games, including challenging ones like MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE, PRIVATE EYE, and PITFALL!. The Ape-X DQfD algorithm demonstrates strong peak performance and consistency, exceeding baseline scores on most games. Qualitative comparisons with expert policies show that the algorithm finds more time-efficient strategies, indicating it goes beyond pure imitation. Videos and cumulative return plots are provided for further analysis. The Ape-X DQfD algorithm shows strong performance, surpassing baseline scores on various games. An ablation study on 6 games highlights the importance of key components like the transformed Bellman operator and demonstration data. Comparisons with expert policies reveal the algorithm's ability to improve upon demonstrated strategies, achieving better performance in some cases. Results of an ablation study show the importance of expert data in the Ape-X DQfD algorithm. Removing expert demonstrations severely degrades performance on sparse reward games, but in games where exploration is efficient, the algorithm's performance is comparable or worse without expert data. The TC loss is crucial for stable learning, as removing it leads to faster initial learning but eventual performance collapse. Removing the imitation loss also impacts performance. The imitation loss L IM does not significantly affect algorithm performance compared to the original DQfD. Previous work has addressed reward distribution diversity and network over-generalization in deep RL. Using PopArt with the Bellman operator T normalizes targets for improved learning, but the modified algorithm performs worse than Ape-X DQfD overall. The study compared a deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm with PopArt and TC loss to constrained TD updates, but found that the latter did not work well in their case. The algorithm achieved human-level performance despite challenges with training batches containing highly rewarding states early on. The paper presents a deep RL algorithm that achieves human-level performance on Atari 2600 games by addressing challenges like diverse reward distributions, longer time horizons, and sparse reward tasks. Novel approaches include a transformed Bellman operator, temporal consistency loss, and a distributed RLED framework. The algorithm outperforms an average human on 40 out of 42 games.
