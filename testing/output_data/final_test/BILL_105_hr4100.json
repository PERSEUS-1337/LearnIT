Federal Prison Industries can operate Limited Sales Projects for industries not under Private Sector or Prison Industry Enhancement Projects. These projects can only sell to specific entities, be run by Federal Prison Industries, and be housed in Bureau of Prisons facilities. The Prison Industries Reform Act of 1998 allows industries at facilities activated by the Attorney General to operate as Private Sector Projects, selling products on the open market under contracts with Federal Prison Industries for the use of prison labor. Federal Prison Industries can enter into contracts with private persons to operate Private Sector Projects, with terms beneficial to their mission. Before doing so, they must publicly solicit bids from private persons and submit a notice to the House and Senate judiciary committees. Federal Prison Industries gives preferences to private persons proposing to use Private Sector Projects for operations that would otherwise be located abroad. The Attorney General determines inmate wages from private contracts, with the remainder distributed as prisoner contributions. If unable to contract with a private person for a project, Federal Prison Industries retains control. Federal Prison Industries may operate an industry as a Prison Industry Enhancement Project within 18 months after notice is given or the Attorney General activates the facility. Industries in operation before the enactment of the Prison Industries Reform Act of 1998 can be operated as a Prison Industry Enhancement Project. Federal Prison Industries can operate a Prison Industry Enhancement Project, selling products on the open market, with revenues distributed as wages to inmates and prisoner contributions. At least 5 industries must be operated as Private Sector Projects or Enhancement Projects within 2 years of the Prison Industries Reform Act of 1998. Federal Prison Industries must operate a minimum of 20 Private Sector Projects or Prison Industry Enhancement Projects within 3 years. Section 4123 of Title 18, United States Code, is removed. SEC. 5. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.

Prison Industries Fund in title 18, United States Code is amended to allow for prisoner contributions under regulations by the Attorney General. SEC. 6 CLERICAL AMENDMENTS. The table of sections for chapter 307 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to update section numbers and titles. SEC. 7. MODIFICATION OF PROHIBITION ON SALES OF PRISONER-MADE PRODUCTS. Section 1761 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to exempt goods and services produced by inmates at Federal Prison Industries or State-operated industries from certain restrictions. The term 'State' includes states, commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United States. The Director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics will identify goods made in foreign countries, where 95% or more are sold in the US, and report to Congress within 180 days. The Attorney General is required to develop a plan for restructuring Federal Prison Industries, including reducing the use of Limited Sales Projects by 40% within 5 years, phasing out Limited Sales Projects by 2008, and phasing out Prison Industry Enhancement Projects by 2013. The plan for restructuring Federal Prison Industries includes creating a non-governmental entity to take over its rights and obligations. If the number of inmates employed in industries provided by Federal Prison Industries decreases after 3 years, certain provisions may be altered, such as the 40% reduction in Limited Sales Projects and the use of Prison Industry Enhancement Projects. Prison Industry Enhancement Projects can be used to provide industries post-September 30, 2013. The term \"submission date\" refers to the date the plan is submitted to Congress. The plan will go into effect 180 days after submission unless Congress intervenes."
