    "title": "SB 844",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Chapter 3.132 is added to the Government Code, detailing the financing of Adult Local Criminal Justice Facilities in 2016. A \"participating county\" is defined as a county, city and county, or regional consortium certified by the State Public Works Board and the Board of State and Community Corrections for financing adult local criminal justice facilities. An adult local criminal justice facility may include improved housing, program, treatment, mental health, and reentry space to manage the adult offender population under the jurisdiction of the sheriff or county department of corrections, as defined by the BSCC in regulations. The BSCC, CDCR, participating counties, and the board can acquire, design, and construct adult local criminal justice facilities approved by the BSCC. Acquisition can include completed facilities through build-to-suit purchases. Facilities can be delivered through design-bid-build or design-build processes. Participating counties must have adequate ownership interest in the site for financing eligibility. The participating county may assign an inspector during the construction of the adult local criminal justice facility. An agreement between the BSCC, CDCR, participating county, and the board will outline performance expectations, guidelines for revenue bond use, and maintenance responsibilities for the facility. The participating county must indemnify the State of California for any claims related to the adult local criminal justice facility. The board will oversee the scope and cost of the facility. The county is the lead agency for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. After receiving construction bids or design-build proposals, a participating county may borrow funds for project costs from various sources. If revenue bonds are not sold, the BSCC or CDCR must use its support appropriation to repay any loans for an approved adult local criminal justice facility. The board may issue up to $270,000,000 in revenue bonds to finance approved adult local criminal justice facilities. Proceeds can be used to reimburse counties for acquisition, design, and construction costs. Funds derived from this section are continuously appropriated for this purpose. The Legislature supports state financing for managing jail populations, citing decades of overcrowded and aging jails. Sustainable solutions are needed, focusing on efficient use of resources to prevent overcrowding and promote public safety through evidence-based practices in the criminal justice system. California needs a long-term, statewide strategy to manage its jail population and resources effectively, considering factors like population growth, criminogenic needs, crime rates, and changes to realignment or sentencing laws. The county adult criminal justice system requires improved housing with a focus on expanding program and treatment space for adult offenders. Improved county adult criminal justice housing with an emphasis on expanding program and treatment space will enhance public safety throughout the state by providing increased access to appropriate programs or treatment. This financing serves a critical state purpose by promoting public safety and represents valuable consideration for state action. The BSCC or CDCR, with board consent, can lease property for adult local criminal justice facilities. Participating counties must indemnify the state for any claims arising from facility use. The BSCC must follow its regulations for approving or disapproving adult local criminal justice facilities, considering cost effectiveness. State funds cannot be used until final plans are approved, documents are approved, or the county opts to purchase the facility. The BSCC reviews and approves plans for adult local criminal justice facilities to ensure proper use of funds and compliance with laws. Counties are responsible for facility acquisition, design, staffing, and maintenance. BSCC sets minimum standards, funding schedules, and procedures. Certification of control of adult local criminal justice facility site, documentation of need for improved housing, and written proposal required for facility funding approval. Submission of a written adult local criminal justice facility proposal, staffing plan, architectural drawings, CEQA compliance documentation, and provisions to maintain tax-exempt status of issued bonds. The participating county contribution for adult local criminal justice facilities financed under this chapter shall be a minimum of 10 percent of the total project costs, with the possibility of reduced requirements for counties with a population below 200,000 upon petition to the BSCC. The BSCC determines funding and scoring criteria for counties eligible for financing programs. $20 million is set aside for Napa County. Counties must show pretrial inmate percentage and risk assessment program. Preference given to counties ready for timely financing. The BSCC determines funding and scoring criteria for counties eligible for financing programs, with $20 million set aside for Napa County. Counties must demonstrate pretrial inmate percentage and risk assessment program. Preference is given to counties prepared to proceed successfully with timely financing. Counties must provide a resolution authorizing matching funds for financing approved by the BSCC. Matching funds must be compatible with state's lease-revenue bond financing. Counties seeking funding for housing capacity replacement or renovation must provide documentation of CEQA compliance and a letter from county counsel certifying challenges have been resolved. Funding priority will be given to projects adding treatment space or facilities for treatment and rehabilitation services, including mental health treatment. (d) Participating counties can use financing authority to replace existing housing capacity if a deficiency is documented. Counties increasing capacity must commit to not leasing to others for 10 years. Locked facilities funded by the state must provide onsite visitation meeting state regulations. Any county seeking financing authority under this program must address sexual abuse in its adult local criminal justice facility. This act is related to the Budget Bill and will take effect immediately."
