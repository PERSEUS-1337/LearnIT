    "content": "The \"Wi-Fi Innovation Act\" promotes unlicensed spectrum. In this section, key definitions are provided including the meaning of terms such as Commission, Dedicated Short-Range Communications Services, Dynamic Frequency Selection, 5850-5925 MHz band, and NTIA. The Telecommunications and Information Administration defines technical rules for widespread commercial development of unlicensed operations, including outdoor operations, a minimum transmitter output power of 1 watt, and no requirement for Dynamic Frequency Selection. The Commission is tasked with modifying regulations to promote unlicensed use in the 5 GHz band by providing additional unlicensed spectrum. The Commission will modify regulations to provide more unlicensed spectrum in the 5850-5925 MHz band for widespread commercial development. NTIA will cooperate to facilitate this modification by identifying necessary spectrum management actions. The Office of Engineering and Technology will issue a public notice seeking comments on interference-mitigation techniques, rechannelization, and deployment timelines for the 5850-5925 MHz band to accommodate incumbent licensees and commercial unlicensed operations. The NTIA will publicly submit a description of Federal uses of the 5850-5925 MHz band in response to a public notice. The Commission, in consultation with the Department of Transportation and NTIA, will develop and publish a test plan within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Commission will develop a test plan for unlicensed devices in the 5850-5925 MHz band to evaluate technologies for sharing the spectrum without causing interference to incumbent licensees. Multiple methods of sharing the band may be tested. The Commission will develop a test plan for unlicensed devices in the 5850-5925 MHz band to evaluate sharing technologies without causing interference to incumbent licensees. Considerations include comments from public notices, functions of exclusive allocation that could be shared, and the potential for a system of priority access to replace exclusive licensing. The Commission is considering whether priority access should be limited to specific portions of the 5850-5925 MHz band for critical functions like dedicated short-range communications crash avoidance. They are also exploring the possibility of non-exclusive licensing or shared spectrum access as alternatives to exclusive licensing, and whether rules could be established to transition existing licensees to a different band. The Commission is exploring whether shared use or a system of priority access in the 5850-5925 MHz spectrum could cause harmful interference to incumbent licensees or compromise safety-of-life uses necessary for advancing motor vehicle technology. The Commission will conduct testing and publish results for the 5850-5925 MHz band to determine unlicensed device use. The Commission will modify regulations for the 5850-5925 MHz band to allow unlicensed operations if no harmful interference is caused to existing licensees. The Commission may allow unlicensed operations in the 5850-5925 MHz band if no harmful interference is caused to existing licensees. Congress, the Department of Transportation, and the NTIA are involved in the decision-making process regarding unlicensed operations in the 5850-5925 MHz band. The Commission is prohibited from modifying part 15 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations for the 5850-5925 MHz band until ensuring no harmful interference to existing licensees. The Commission may modify regulations for the 5850-5925 MHz band to enhance its utility while safeguarding current licensees from interference. SEC. 3. ASSESSING UNLICENSED SPECTRUM AND WI-FI USE IN LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS. The Commission will conduct a study to assess broadband Internet access in low-income neighborhoods, focusing on unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks. They will evaluate barriers to deployment and usage, and explore ways to increase availability of technology for elementary and secondary school-age children. The Commission will conduct a study to assess broadband Internet access in low-income neighborhoods, focusing on unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks. Proposals aim to increase home broadband adoption by 50% in low-income neighborhoods with school-age children. A report summarizing the study's findings will be submitted to relevant committees within a year of the Act's enactment. The study conducted under subsection (a) will be summarized, and recommendations will be made regarding potential incentives, policies, and requirements."
