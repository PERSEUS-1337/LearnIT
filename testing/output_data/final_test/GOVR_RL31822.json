    "content": "Concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest and bias among government regulators and decisionmakers who previously worked for the industries they now oversee. Allegations of cozy relationships and large cash pay-outs to personnel entering government service have also been examined in the press. Loyalty to private interests over public welfare is a key issue. Federal conflict of interest laws focus on the financial interests of government officials and their past associations with private interests. Previous employment and affiliations are also considered in ethics standards for federal officers and employees. Federal conflict of interest laws primarily address conflicts between a federal employee's official duties and their personal financial interests. The laws aim to ensure that government employees maintain undivided loyalty to the government and make recommendations in the public interest. The House Judiciary Committee emphasized the importance of government officials being independent and impartial, making decisions in the public interest without influence from personal financial interests. The goal is to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the government by avoiding conflicts between a government employee's private interests and official duties. The conflict of interest laws aim to prevent official decisions from being influenced by personal interests, ensuring impartiality in government. These laws recognize that even well-meaning individuals can be swayed by their financial interests when conducting government business. The federal conflict of interest laws focus on officials' financial interests, requiring disclosure, disqualification, and divestiture. High-level government officials must file public financial disclosure statements annually. The federal conflict of interest laws, established in 1978, aim to identify and resolve potential conflicts for government officials. Public disclosure of financial information serves as a deterrent for holding certain assets and recruiting individuals uneasy with financial transparency. The Senate committee noted that public financial disclosure serves as a deterrent for individuals with questionable financial backgrounds from entering public service. The requirement is based on the employee's compensation rate and days worked for the federal government. Employees working for the federal government above a certain pay grade are subject to public financial disclosure requirements under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. This applies to around 30,000 officials and all \"Schedule C\" employees, regardless of salary, unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics. Federal employees covered by public financial disclosure laws must file reports within specific timeframes. Presidential nominees needing Senate confirmation must also file disclosure statements, with additional procedural steps involved. These statements are reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Senate committee overseeing the nomination. When a presidential nominee requiring Senate confirmation is announced, they must file a financial disclosure statement within five days. This statement is submitted to the agency ethics officer and forwarded to the Office of Government Ethics and the Senate committee. An updated report must be filed before the nomination hearings, including information on honoraria. Financial disclosure reports for federal officials are filed with designated agency ethics officers, with the President and Vice President filing with the Office of Government Ethics. Reports are open for public inspection and retained for six years as public records. Under the STOCK Act, high-level government officials must file annual financial disclosure reports, including details on assets, debts, income, and potential conflicts of interest. The reports are posted online by their respective agencies and retained as public records for six years. The regular annual financial disclosure reports filed in May require information on eight categories of financial details, including private income, gifts received, financial assets, liabilities, and financial transactions exceeding certain values. The annual financial disclosure reports filed in May require information on financial transactions exceeding $1,000, positions in outside businesses, agreements for future employment, and cash value of interests in blind trusts. New entrant reports for federal service include most required information but exclude details on gifts, travel reimbursements, financial transactions from the previous year, and cash value of trusts. The new entrant reports for federal service require disclosure of private income, ownership interests in assets over $1,000, liabilities over $10,000, positions in private entities, and future employment agreements. These reports also cover past affiliations and interests, particularly for first-time filers and nominees to Senate-confirmed positions. The public disclosure law mandates reporting individuals, including nominees to Senate-confirmed positions, to disclose clients who paid them over $5,000 in compensation in the two years prior to filing. This information should include the nature of duties performed for the client or employer. New entrant reports, including those of nominees, must detail all private income received in the filing year and the preceding calendar year, as well as positions held in private entities for the current and two preceding years. The ethics officials review annual disclosure reports for compliance with conflict of interest laws and ethical standards. If conflicts are found, recommendations may include divestiture, restitution, blind trust establishment, or requesting a personal conflict of interest exemption. Presidential nominees subject to Senate confirmation file financial disclosure reports under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(b). Agencies conduct expedited reviews to certify no conflict of interest issues. Remedial actions like divestiture or recusal may be required for conflicts. Presidential nominees subject to Senate confirmation must disclose conflicts of interest and enter into ethics agreements approved by the Office of Government Ethics. The Director of OGE reviews and signs off on the agreements, submitting them to the Senate committee for approval. Presidential nominees undergoing Senate confirmation must disclose financial information to the Office of Government Ethics. Senate committees have the authority to request additional information from nominees and may require them to divest assets or recuse themselves from certain matters. The statutory method for dealing with conflicts of interest requires disqualification or recusal of an executive branch officer or employee from participating in official governmental matters where they have a financial interest. Criminal penalties may apply if the individual participates in such matters. Regulatory recusal requirements may also apply. The regulatory recusal requirement for executive branch officials may be broader than the statutory restriction, requiring refraining from participating in certain matters involving past affiliations or economic interests. Current regulations mandate recusal for one year in certain circumstances, and disqualifications for two years if extraordinary payments were made upon departure. The \"ethics pledge\" for presidential appointees extends the recusal requirement to two years for specific parties. The recusal requirement for executive branch officials is extended to two years for specific parties, with additional restrictions on former lobbyists entering the Administration. Federal statutes address conflicts of interest by requiring disqualification from certain governmental matters where financial interests are involved, rather than mandating divestiture of conflicting interests. The principal conflict of interest provision under federal law requires officials to recuse themselves from matters where they or their family have a financial interest. The statutory provision at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208 bars federal officers or employees in the executive branch from taking official action that affects their current financial interests or existing arrangements for future employment. It does not require disqualification based on past affiliations or previous economic interests. The law prohibits federal officers or employees from taking action that affects their financial interests or affiliations. Regulations may exempt certain investments or interests deemed inconsequential. The law prohibits federal officers or employees from taking action that affects their financial interests or affiliations. Regulations may exempt certain investments or interests deemed inconsequential, such as securities, stocks, and bonds in publicly traded companies directly affected by governmental matters, with ownership values below specified thresholds. Regulatory requirements for disqualification may also apply to other financial interests and connections. The regulatory recusal provision in the Office of Government Ethics regulations aims to prevent any appearance of impartiality in federal employees' official duties by disqualifying them from governmental matters that may affect their financial interests or connections. This provision expands the scope of individuals and entities whose financial interests can be imputed to the employee, leading to recusal or disqualification, while narrowing down the specific governmental matters involved. The regulatory provision in the Office of Government Ethics regulations requires government employees in the executive branch to recuse themselves from particular matters involving specific parties if it may affect their financial interests or connections. Recusal is necessary when there is a direct impact on a household member's financial interests or when there is a covered relationship with a party involved in the matter. Employees must inform their agency if they believe their impartiality may be questioned. The regulation requires government employees to disclose and seek authorization for any financial relationships that may pose a conflict of interest. Covered relationships include those with business partners, household members, relatives, and organizations where the employee is actively involved. The recusal requirement applies to specific governmental matters that may impact the employee's financial interests. The regulation expands the recusal requirement for government officials beyond the statutory provision, covering specific governmental matters involving parties and past business associations. It also includes potential recusal and disqualification for certain economic associations. Government officials must recuse themselves from working on governmental matters involving specific parties if they have had a business association with those parties within the last year. This one-year recusal requirement applies to any officer or employee of the executive branch and is limited to \"particular matters involving specific parties.\" Such matters include contracts, investigations, prosecutions, or cases involving specific individuals or entities. Government officials are required to recuse themselves from specific governmental matters if they have had a recent business association with the involved parties. This restriction applies to contracts, investigations, prosecutions, or cases involving specific individuals or entities. Additionally, former employees with a \"covered relationship\" to a party in a matter may receive authorization to participate, subject to regulatory restrictions. Executive Orders may impose similar restrictions for appointees in non-career positions in the government. The Office of Government Ethics regulations require a two-year recusal for officials in the executive branch who had a recent business association with a party in a specific matter. This includes cases where a former employer made an \"extraordinary payment\" exceeding $10,000 to the official before entering government service. Waivers can be granted by agency heads or the President. Concerns have been raised about large cash payments or rewards given to employees of private firms entering the federal government, as they may influence policy decisions. OGE regulations require a two-year recusal for officials who receive \"extraordinary payments\" exceeding $10,000 from former employers before entering government service. Waivers can be granted by agency heads or the President. Federal conflict of interest law prohibits federal employees from receiving outside compensation for their official duties. This restriction dates back to 1917 and aims to prevent private entities from supplementing government salaries. The law at \u00a7209 prohibits federal employees from receiving outside compensation for their official duties to prevent conflicts of interest. It ensures that employees are only compensated by the government to maintain independence and avoid influence from external sources. This provision may apply to certain \"severance\" payments. The law at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 209 may apply to \"severance\" payments from a former private employer to an individual entering federal service if there is an \"intent to compensate\" for federal employment. However, the provision only applies to federal employees at the time of payment receipt, not before they become government employees. Severance payments made before becoming a federal official do not violate conflict of interest laws. Questions arise regarding pensions from outside entities and whether they constitute a current financial interest or association with the entity. The Office of Government Ethics distinguishes between defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in relation to conflict of interest laws. A \"defined contribution plan\" involves contributions to an individual retirement account, with payouts based on the account's performance. This type of pension plan does not typically raise conflict of interest concerns as the employer is not directly responsible for pension payments. The Office of Government Ethics does not consider a \"defined contribution plan\" as a disqualifying financial interest for an employee. However, a \"defined benefit plan\" may be considered a disqualifying interest in certain circumstances if it could directly impact the employee's pension plan. The Office of Government Ethics does not automatically presume conflict of interest for federal employees with a current interest in or receipt of payment from a pension plan, as it is unlikely that a governmental matter would directly affect a private pension sponsor's ability to pay pension benefits. The Office of Government Ethics advised agencies not to presume conflict of interest for federal employees with a pension plan. President Obama issued an Executive Order requiring ethics pledges from appointees in the executive branch. The \"ethics pledge\" imposes additional restrictions on appointees in the executive branch, particularly those of a confidential or policymaking nature. They must recuse themselves for two years from matters involving former clients or employers. Former lobbyists turned appointees face further limitations, including a two-year ban on certain activities. The \"ethics pledge\" imposes restrictions on executive branch appointees, including a two-year ban on former lobbyists participating in matters they lobbied on or seeking employment with agencies they lobbied. Waivers can be granted in certain circumstances. The Obama Administration announced a restriction on lobbyists serving in federal positions, prohibiting them from serving on federal advisory boards and commissions. This policy was formalized in a Presidential Memorandum in 2010. There is no federal statute requiring federal employees to divest private assets to resolve conflicts of interest. The Obama Administration restricted lobbyists from serving on federal advisory boards and commissions. Statutory provisions may require directors or board members of agencies to have no financial interests in regulated sectors. Agencies can also prohibit ownership of certain assets by officers and employees to maintain impartiality. This may necessitate divestiture of assets for individuals in these positions. The divestiture of assets may be required to avoid conflicts of interest by administrative provisions, Senate committees, or the Senate as a whole for presidential nominees. Disqualification from governmental matters affecting financial interests is a common method, but divestiture may be necessary for employees whose assets impair their job performance. When divestiture is required for ethics reasons, a current employee should be given a \"reasonable amount of time\" to sell the asset. A certificate of divestiture can help alleviate potential tax burdens. A \"qualified blind trust\" can be used as an alternative to divestiture to avoid conflicts of interest. Trust assets with a beneficial interest must be disclosed in annual financial reports. A \"qualified blind trust\" can be used by federal officials as a conflict of interest avoidance measure. In this type of trust, assets are placed with an independent trustee, and the official has no control or knowledge of the specific assets held in the trust. This allows the official to avoid disclosing these assets in future financial reports and prevents them from being considered \"financial interests\" for disqualification purposes. A \"qualified blind trust\" is used by federal officials to avoid conflicts of interest. The official has no knowledge of the assets in the trust, preventing them from influencing decisions. Assets placed in the trust by the official remain financial interests until disposed of or valued under $1,000. Office of Government Ethics regulations require impartiality and no preferential treatment. Former employment associations are also considered. The Office of Government Ethics emphasizes the importance of impartiality in federal employees, especially regarding former employment associations. Specific conflict of interest and federal ethics standards require employees to remain disinterested in governmental matters that may have a financial impact on them personally or on certain entities. The Office of Government Ethics emphasizes impartiality in federal employees, especially regarding former employment associations and financial interests that may impact them personally or certain entities. Conflict of interest concerns may arise from past professional affiliations, but current ethical standards do not imply favoritism or partiality solely based on past connections. Federal regulatory or administrative officials must adhere to impartiality standards, even if they have past associations or employment connections. Bias cannot be assumed solely based on previous affiliations, as specific regulatory restrictions govern their actions. Being impartial does not require complete neutrality, but rather a lack of bias in decision-making based on personal beliefs or past associations. The Office of Government Ethics emphasizes that employees should not be restricted from participating in matters due to their personal beliefs. Federal officials have faced allegations of bias in decision-making, particularly in agency rule-making processes, but courts have clarified that bias is only a concern when officials are acting in an adjudicatory capacity. Federal officials are not required to adhere to judicial standards of impartiality unless they are acting in an adjudicatory capacity. The disqualification requirement does not apply in rulemaking procedures, and agency officials are not held to the same subjective impartiality standards as judges. Agencies must objectively evaluate arguments presented to them, but do not need to be subjectively impartial beyond specific statutory or regulatory restrictions on employees' economic interests. Limiting conflict of interest regulation to current personal financial interests of employees may help address First Amendment concerns regarding regulating outside activities of public employees. Issues of bias or partiality in governmental functions based on employees' associations are generally not legally actionable by private litigants. Conduct regulations are typically not subject to legal resolution by private litigants as they are considered internal matters within the agency."
