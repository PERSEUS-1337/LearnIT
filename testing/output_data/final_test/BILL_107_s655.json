    "content": "The Act titled \"Treatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 2001\" addresses the federal tax treatment of income derived by Indians from natural resources-related activities. It introduces a new section, SEC. 7874, focusing on the federal tax treatment of income derived by Indians from the harvest of tribally owned natural resources. The Act \"Treatment of Indian Tribal Natural Resource Income Act of 2001\" exempts income from natural resources-related activities conducted by Indian tribes or qualified Indian entities from income and self-employment taxes. It also exempts employment taxes on remuneration for services within natural resources-related activities. The term \"natural resources-related activity\" refers to activities directly linked to cultivating resources. The term \"natural resources-related activity\" includes activities related to cultivating, harvesting, processing, extracting, or transporting natural resources held in trust by the United States for the benefit of a tribe or selling such resources with the majority of the selling done by tribe members. It excludes activities related to extracting minerals, ores, oil, or gas. A \"qualified Indian entity\" is an entity engaged in natural resources-related activities of one or more Indian tribes. Entities engaged in processing or transportation of natural resources can be considered qualified Indian entities if their annual gross receipts are 90 percent or more. Entities with annual gross receipts of 90 percent or more from natural resources-related activities of Indian tribes, each owning at least 10 percent equity in the entity. Distributions from qualified Indian entities to tribe members are treated as derived from natural resources activities. The text chunk discusses the exclusion of de minimis unrelated amounts for qualified Indian tribal entities or tribal members. It also mentions that no inference should be created regarding tax exemptions for income derived from tribal rights secured before January 1, 2001. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. Sec. 7874 addresses federal tax treatment of income from tribally owned natural resources for Indians. The amendments apply to periods before, on, or after the enactment date of the Act."
