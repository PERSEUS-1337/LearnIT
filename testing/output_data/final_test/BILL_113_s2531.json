    "content": "The \"Better Options for Kids Act of 2014\" may be cited as the short title. It pertains to juvenile justice. Section 520A of the Public Health Service Act is amended to give preference to juvenile justice programs in awarding competitive grants to youth involved in or at risk of involvement in the criminal justice system. The Public Health Service Act now gives preference to juvenile justice programs for awarding competitive grants to youth involved in or at risk of criminal justice system involvement. States must implement evidence-based policies and establish partnerships for coordinated service delivery and information sharing. The memorandum of understanding or strategic plan signed by State, tribal, and local agency partners articulates a commitment to shared accountability and achieving specific desired results. States must certify their commitment to partnerships and responsibility for the outcomes. To receive preference for grants, States or entities must demonstrate implementation of evidence-based policies such as training on discipline strategies and positive school climate to reduce student removal from instruction. The State requires local educational agencies to establish agreements with law enforcement agencies regarding the roles of school resource officers, focusing on improving the learning environment and prohibiting officer involvement in student disciplinary matters. The State mandates agreements between educational and law enforcement agencies for school resource officers, emphasizing their role in enhancing the learning environment and excluding them from student disciplinary issues. Additionally, the State enforces restrictions on court referrals for juvenile school-based status offenses and reallocates funding from secure detention to community-based alternatives. It also implements a reentry policy to facilitate immediate education continuation for youth in correctional facilities upon release. The Better Options for Kids Act of 2014 requires the Secretary to report on programs benefiting individual educational success within 90 days of enactment. The application preference under this act will expire 5 years after enactment."
