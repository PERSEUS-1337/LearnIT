    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 836 of the Penal Code is amended to allow a peace officer to arrest a person with or without a warrant under certain circumstances, including if the officer has probable cause to believe the person committed a public offense in their presence or a felony, whether or not in their presence. When responding to a domestic violence call, a peace officer must inform the victim of their right to make a citizen's arrest and provide guidance on how to do so safely, unless the officer has already made an arrest for specific offenses. When responding to a call alleging a violation of a domestic violence protective order, a peace officer must make a lawful arrest without a warrant if there is probable cause, even if the violation did not occur in the officer's presence. After making a lawful arrest for a violation of a domestic violence protective order, the officer must confirm with authorities that the protective order has been registered. The person subject to a protective order is considered to have notice if the victim shows proof of service to the officer, the officer verifies the proof of service with authorities, or if the person was present at the protective order hearing or informed by a peace officer. In cases of mutual protective orders issued under the Family Code, liability for arrest applies to the dominant aggressor. The peace officer must make efforts to identify and may arrest the dominant aggressor. Factors considered include the intent to protect victims, threats of physical harm, history of domestic violence, and self-defense actions. (d) If a suspect commits assault or battery on a spouse, cohabitant, dating partner, child, elderly person, or any close relative, a peace officer can make an arrest regardless of mutual protective orders. If the suspect commits assault or battery on a spouse, cohabitant, dating partner, child, elderly person, or close relative who is 65 years or older, a peace officer can arrest the suspect without a warrant. A peace officer can arrest a person without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe they committed assault or battery. Additionally, a peace officer can arrest a person without a warrant for a violation of Section 25400 if there is reasonable cause to believe the violation occurred in a controlled airport area. The peace officer can arrest a person without a warrant if there is probable cause to believe they violated Section 25400. Additionally, the Department of Justice is required to expand the shared gang database to provide accurate human trafficking intelligence information for law enforcement collaboration. The department may create regulations for implementing this section, with \"human trafficking\" defined as in Penal Code Section 236.1."
