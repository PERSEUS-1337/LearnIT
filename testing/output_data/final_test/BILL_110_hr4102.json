    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Outsourcing Security Act\". Congress finds that the United States is increasingly relying on private security contractors to perform critical functions previously done by military or government personnel. The number of private security contractors in Iraq is estimated to be 48,000, with funding for them increasing from $1 billion to $4 billion. About one-quarter of these contractors are third-party nationals. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has stated that the work of many contractors in Iraq is conflicting with the larger mission. The Government Accountability Office found deficiencies in the Army's oversight of contractors in Iraq, including limited visibility and lack of adequate personnel. Congress lacks access to security contract details and the number of private security contractors in combat zones. The relationship between the US and Iraq has been strained by incidents involving private military contractors. The Government of Iraq has demanded the US to sever contracts with Blackwater due to incidents involving private military contractors and Iraqi citizens, highlighting the dangers of relying on them for critical functions. The use of private security contractors undermines missions, jeopardizes troop safety, and should be phased out. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"mission critical or emergency essential functions\" refer to activities essential for combat systems and operational success, including protective services, security planning, military training, and weapon maintenance. The specified congressional committees oversee various functions including repair and maintenance for weapons systems, prison administration, interrogation, and intelligence. These committees include the Committees on Armed Services, Oversight and Government Reform, Appropriations, Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the House of Representatives, as well as the Committees on Armed Services, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence in the Senate. SEC. 4 of the Act requires all personnel at US diplomatic missions in Iraq to be provided security services by Federal Government personnel within 6 months. SEC. 5 mandates that contractors performing critical functions in conflict zones authorized by Congress must meet specific requirements. The President must submit a report to congressional committees by June 1, 2008, on transitioning away from private contractors for critical functions in conflict zones authorized by Congress. If agencies cannot transition by January 1, 2009, the report must include reasons, a timeline, and a transition plan. The President must ensure that all contract employees have undergone background checks and are under military jurisdiction. Contract employees accused of crimes by the host country must remain in US custody. Contracts must include whistleblower protections for reporting violations. Reports should be unclassified, with a possible classified annex. Contractors providing critical functions after 2009 must have their accounting practices examined. Contract employees performing critical or emergency functions after January 1, 2009, must allow congressional committees to review their accounting practices quarterly. Renewal of contracts for critical functions requires the President to report on agency personnel adequacy and certify background checks for employees. Contract employees must have clean criminal records, cannot have been accused of human rights abuses, and must remain in US custody if accused of crimes by the host country. The contract also includes whistleblower protections for reporting violations, abuses, or criminal actions. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL ACCESS TO CONTRACTS. Congressional committees must be granted access to copies and descriptions of contracts and task orders exceeding $5,000,000 for work in Iraq and Afghanistan by the Department of Defense, State, Interior, and USAID. The Secretary of Defense, State, Interior, and USAID must submit reports to congressional committees within 60 days of the enactment of the Act, detailing the number of individuals working in Iraq and Afghanistan. The submissions should be in unclassified form, with a classified annex if necessary. The reports required by the Act must include the number of persons working under contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the total cost of the contracts, the number of persons wounded or killed while working under the contracts, and details of any disciplinary actions taken against individuals involved in the contracts."
