    "content": "President Obama's FY2014 budget request for Energy and Water Development, totaling $34.9 billion, was released in April 2013. The bill includes funding for various agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set discretionary spending limits for FY2012-FY2021, but deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by the deadline, triggering automatic spending reductions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered automatic spending reductions if deficit reduction legislation was not enacted by the deadline. This process includes sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, with across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA, P.L. 112-240) made significant changes to the Budget Control Act (BCA) procedures for FY2013, including delaying the joint committee sequester implementation to March 1, 2013, reducing the sequester amount by $24 billion, and lowering discretionary spending caps for FY2013 and FY2014. President Obama ordered the sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, as per the amended BCA. The OMB report indicated budget authority cancellations for non-exempt funds at the program, project, and activity level within each account. Reductions were calculated annually due to the sequester during a temporary continuing resolution. The impact of these reductions on agency budgetary resources remains unclear until further guidance from OMB. Tables show energy and water development appropriations from FY2007 to FY2014 and funding for major programs in FY2014. The report presents FY2014 funding for Energy and Water Development programs, comparing requested amounts to FY2012 appropriations. It is a preliminary survey, with a more detailed report to follow. For program descriptions, refer to CRS Report R42498."
