Investigating these interactions can enhance understanding of tumorigenesis and aid in managing patient responses to cancer immunotherapies. A new imaging technique, MIBI-TOF, allows for quantification of cells in 36 protein markers at sub-cellular resolutions. A GAN model is proposed for analyzing MIBI images, focusing on cell types, sizes, and neighborhoods to study cell-cell interactions in different protein channels. Our model, cell-cell interaction GAN (CCIGAN), outperforms existing image synthesis methods on all measures and significantly on biologically motivated metrics. It systematically models multiple cellular protein behaviors and interactions under simulated conditions through image synthesis. Cell-cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment are implicated in cancer pathogenesis, immune evasion, metastasis, and cancer immunotherapy efficacy. Cell-cell relationships in the tumor microenvironment are influenced by cellular proteins like PD-1/PD-L1, which can impact disease progression. Blocking this interaction with antibodies can enhance the immune system's ability to target tumor cells. Deep learning models are valuable for predicting protein patterns in disease processes, especially in multi-cellular systems. Deep learning models are uniquely suited for predicting protein patterns in disease processes, especially in multi-cellular systems. A novel technology, Multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF), accurately quantifies and spatially resolves cellular protein expressions at the single cell level within tissue samples. This technology utilizes protein-specific antibodies tethered to elemental metals to bombard the sample with atomic ions, releasing elemental isotopes and tissue-specific material for quantification in a mass spectrometer. The Cell-Cell Interaction GAN (CCIGAN) is a novel protein-based attention mechanism for predicting cellular protein localizations accurately. It learns to map different cell types and protein markers in tissue samples, associating cell type, shape, and neighboring cells with protein expressions. The network was trained on semantic segmentation maps and applied to simulated maps to understand cell interactions. CCIGAN demonstrates its ability to probe elements of oncologic processes by recapitulating established patterns of biological phenomena, yielding quantitative and spatial information on cellular protein modulations, and allowing for biological data to be generalized beyond traditional in vitro scenarios. This represents a step forward in understanding cellular relationships within a microenvironment. CCIGAN allows for hypothetical biological scenarios to be generated, enabling assessment of individual cellular responses without the need for specific occurrences in biological tissue samples. This model provides insight on interaction events, shedding light on disease pathogenesis. Compared to labor-intensive MIBI-TOF, CCIGAN offers faster data synthesis capabilities by extending on MIBI-TOF capabilities through deep learning. CCIGAN, trained on MIBI-TOF data sets, can rapidly provide high throughput readouts on single cell scenarios, learning contextual cell-cell interactions for hypothesis testing in biological environments. It aims to generate biologically consistent expression patterns of cellular proteins given a segmentation map of cell neighborhoods. Generative models like GANs and VAEs are used to create high-quality protein expression maps for individual cells, ensuring consistency in expression patterns among similar cell neighborhoods. Image translation techniques such as Pix2Pix and CycleGAN are employed to transform data from one domain to another, allowing for more information extraction from segmentation maps to various protein channels in MIBI-TOF data sets. Using SPADE normalization, CCIGAN can condition on surrounding cell neighbors and capture cell-cell interactions in a local receptive field, enhancing image generation quality and diversity. Attention layers have been added to generative models with success, allowing the network to enhance activations in interesting parts of an image. Self-attention was initially proposed in machine translation tasks to model long distance dependencies, leading to the idea of external memories for long range dependencies. Visual attention complements convolutional neural networks by focusing on global structures. State-of-the-art generative modeling has been achieved using self-attention GAN. In unconditional generative modeling, a specialized attention module is proposed conditioned on different proteins to mimic real-world protein markers. Experiments are conducted on data from MIBI-TOF characterized tissue samples from TNBC patients, imaging over 36 protein markers to identify cell types and provide detailed information on sub-cellular structures and interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Each marker represents a different cellular subtype and functional properties of a cell. Selected markers exhibit cellular protein localization, while blank markers are disregarded. The MIBI-TOF data collected from TNBC tissue allows for differentiation between various cell types based on specific markers. These markers help identify T cells, tumor cells, and other cellular proteins involved in cell interactions and immunomodulatory processes within the microenvironment. The unique nature of MIBI-TOF data presents challenges in image modeling and characterization due to the distinct properties of each marker. Challenges in image modeling and characterization arise from marker expression on specific cell types, sparsity of data, and noisy nature leading to inaccurate cell type classifications. This makes it difficult for an RGB multihead decoder to output multiple channels accurately. MIBI-TOF images are processed into patches for semantic segmentation maps, addressing the challenges of modeling specific protein channels accurately. The data is split into train-test sets at a 9:1 ratio at the MIBI-TOF image level to avoid bias. SPADE residual blocks are used for generative modeling, with a focus on protein localizations. SPADE predicts affine transformations based on segmentation maps to model cell behaviors and interactions. CCIGAN takes a noise vector and segmentation map as input, with a protein marker dependent attention module in the final output layer. The protein marker m pk is used to identify tumor cells exclusively. An attention mechanism is designed to focus on tumor cells and ignore irrelevant cells in S for m pk. Learned persistent vectors s m are defined for each marker to identify specific cell types expressing it. These vectors offer model interpretability and undergo operations to attend to m's specific cell types. The attention module's input dimensions are R (128, 64, 64) after the last resblock R 4, with m indexes from 1 to M. A bottleneck convolution is applied after R 4 to match the original data's dimension, used in a residual manner with the final output. The model refines output channels by convolving original data into M K channeled features for each protein marker. Each group of K channels is spatially normalized and multiplied with a persistent vector, then flattened and convolved to obtain the output X. The outer product attention layer excels at modeling relationships and interactions between specific markers and cell types. The model utilizes a 1 \u00d7 1 convolution to analyze relationships and interactions between markers and cell types at a pixel level. Spectral Norm is applied to all layers in the generator, and fair experiments were conducted with similar parameters and training epochs. CCIGAN is similar to the SPADE comparison. CCIGAN, trained for 120 epochs, is similar to SPADE but with an attention module. Three experiments validated its ability to generate biologically meaningful proteins in the tumor microenvironment. Evaluation metrics included adjusted L1 and MSE scores, and SSIM index. The model verified PD-1/PD-L1 expression relationships between CD8 T cells and tumor cells. The study assessed the influence of tumor microenvironment on PD-1 expression in infiltrating T cells. They investigated the impact of increased PD-L1 expression on neighboring tumor cells on CD8 T cell PD-1 expression and localization. Earth Mover's Distance was used to analyze the shift in PD-1 localization before and after different tumor scenarios. The study also computed the center of mass of PD-1 in CD8 T cells relative to neighboring tumor PD-L1 expressions. Equations and figures detailing this process are provided in the study. The study investigated the impact of increased PD-L1 expression on neighboring tumor cells on CD8 T cell PD-1 expression. Results confirmed that tumor cells have a more significant suppressive effect on T cell PD-1 expression compared to endothelial cells. CCIGAN accurately captured the biological relationship of tumor cells inducing immunomodulatory changes on T cells. CCIGAN successfully captures the biological relationship of tumor cells affecting neighboring T cells. It also demonstrates the impact of immune cell presence on tumor cell status markers, specifically pan-keratin levels. The study hypothesized that CD8 T cells mediating tumor killing would result in decreased pan-keratin expression in tumor cells. In this experiment, a t-test was used to evaluate the correlation between pan-keratin expression in tumor cells and the presence of CD8 T cells. The study found that as the number of CD8 T cells surrounding a tumor cell increased, the pan-keratin expression in the tumor cell decreased. The presence of CD8 T cells surrounding a tumor cell led to a decrease in pan-keratin expression, indicating T cell mediated tumor killing. The t-test results showed a significant difference in pan-keratin expression between the T cell scenario and the control scenario. The study reported a significant change in tumor cell pan-keratin expression under control conditions. Protein interaction patterns identified by CCIGAN were also highlighted. The experiment showcased the robustness of CCIGAN in probing cell-cell interactions. Additionally, variability in PD-L1 expression in immune and tumor cells across TNBC patient groups was evaluated. It was found that in mixed tumor-immune architecture, tumor cells predominantly expressed PD-L1, while in compartmentalized tumors, macrophages were the main source of PD-L1 expression. Examples of these findings are shown in Figure 1 (B)'s row 2, 3. CCIGAN was used to predict on 200 mixed and non-mixed tumor environment segmentation patches, showing increased PD-L1 expression on tumor cells in mixed patient samples. The expression difference was quantified at the single-cell level, with a tumor to macrophage PD-L1 expression ratio of approximately 3.2 and 1.75 for patients A and B respectively. CCIGAN reported increased PD-L1 expression on macrophages adjacent to tumor cells compared to normal endothelial cells for patients C and D, with ratios of approximately 1.85 and 2.7 respectively. When predicting on mixed segmentation patches, there was a 26% increase for patient C and a 19% increase for patient D in macrophage PD-L1 expression compared to mixed microenvironments. CCIGAN has successfully captured biological outcomes at single cell levels and can adapt to different tumor architectures. The agreement between CCIGAN data and previous studies demonstrates its accuracy in predicting cellular scenarios. The model's persistent vectors help match real-world protein markers, such as pankeratin and CD8, to tumor cells. In a study using CCIGAN, vectors for specific protein markers like pankeratin and CD8 were exchanged internally to observe changes in expression levels for tumor cells and CD8 T cells. Results showed a significant decrease in expression ratios for the CD8 \u2194 pankeratin experiment, while minimal changes were seen in the control experiment switching HLA Class 1 and dsDNA markers. Visualizations further supported these findings. The study introduced the use of CCIGAN for understanding cell-cell interactions in different contexts. CCIGAN outperformed other models in biological modeling by accurately characterizing protein localization and identifying meaningful cellular interactions in a tumor environment. CCIGAN has the potential to identify cellular protein interactions affecting patient responses to cancer therapy, offering a framework for biological hypotheses explaining clinical outcomes on a cellular level. The discriminator architecture is detailed in Table 7, with ResBlk as the residual block and SPADE as the spatially-adaptive normalization layer. The generator (G) and discriminator (D) for CCIGAN produce the generated image X = G(S, \u03b4) using segmentation map S, ground truth Y, and noise \u03b4. The generated image X = G(S, \u03b4) is produced using segmentation map S, ground truth Y, and noise \u03b4 in CCIGAN. LSGAN loss and feature matching loss are utilized during training, with ADAM as the optimizer. The generator and discriminator have specific learning rates, and the model is trained for 120 epochs with a training set of 5648 cell patches. Multi-scale discriminators and perceptual loss are not used in CCIGAN. The training details of CCIGAN and baseline models are provided in Table 8, with hyperparameters fine-tuned for better performance. CCIGAN was slightly slower than SPADE baseline on a Tesla V100 GPU. The generated image set X and ground truth set are compared using L1 or L2 norm. Sorting function is used to ensure position-independent metrics for intensity comparison. The score function L(X , Y) computes loss of sorted expression inside cells and penalizes expression outside cells. An adjusted L1/MSE score is introduced. SSIM and MI are defined for images X, Y. Cell based MI computes mutual information between test patches and ground truth cells. The cell based mutual information (MI) is calculated for generated images compared to ground truth, considering all channels. Higher SSIM and MI values indicate better results. CCIGAN outperforms other baselines on all reconstruction metrics according to Table 1. The centroid of a generated cell image is the mean position of all points in the cell. The weighted centroid, known as the center of mass (COM), is calculated using pixel values in a cell image. In the PD-1/PD-L1 experiment, the COM of the CD8 T cell is weighted by PD-1 expression, while the COM of tumor cells is weighted by PD-L1 expression. The center of mass score measures the relative distance between the two COM points. The projection function Proj(\u00b7) is used to project Tumor onto the CD8 T cell to ensure the expected COM of the tumor cells is inside of the CD8 T cell. A random position p Random in the CD8 T cell is chosen as a reference to compute the random COM score. The COM is defined for each tumor cell as p Tumor t. The vector v t points from the centroid of the CD8 T cell to the COM of the t-th tumor cell. The angle between vectors u t and v t is calculated to determine the movement direction of CD8 T cells towards tumor cells. Earth Mover's Distance is then used to assess changes in PD-1 expression after adding a tumor cell, measuring protein localization shifts. Each cell's expression is evaluated in polar coordinates to analyze the resulting changes. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is used to evaluate changes in PD-1 expression when a CD8 T cell moves towards a tumor cell. The EMD score increases when the shift in PD-1 expression is correct and decreases when the CD8 T cell moves in the opposite direction. A randomized search algorithm is defined using EMD to discover other cell-cell interactions. Positive EMD score evaluates the change in PD-1 expression when the CD8 T cell moves towards the tumor cell's center of mass. The EMD score evaluates changes in PD-1 expression as a CD8 T cell moves towards a tumor cell. Visualizations show mass movement of PD-1 in response to surrounding PD-L1 expressions. The EMD score evaluates changes in PD-1 expression as a CD8 T cell moves towards a tumor cell. In Figure 8, vectors v t and u t illustrate the impact of adding tumor cells on EMD score calculation. CCIGAN predicts a decrease in tumor cell pan-keratin expression with increasing CD8 T cell area, while SPADE and pix2pixHD show different trends in pan-keratin expression. The study compares the predictions of different models on tumor cell pan-keratin expression with increasing CD8 T cell area/number. CycleGAN fails to predict a decrease in pan-keratin expression, while Figure 13 shows similarities between protein markers. Sparse markers are similar in state due to limited training data for rare cell types. The generativeness of CCIGAN is shown through an uncertainty map over 100 instances, indicating changes in cell interaction trends. Experimental findings support the decrease in tumor pan-keratin with immune cell presence, and an increase in T cell co-receptor expression. T cell clustering reduces PD-1 marker expression, while an increase in another marker is also demonstrated. Index 7 shows an increase in macrophage-expressed vimentin when placed near tumor cells, indicating an early inflammatory response. The markers used in the experiments include Pan-Keratin, EGFR, Ki67, CD3, CD8, CD4, FoxP3, HLA-DR, CD68, Lag3, PD1, PD-L1, Vimentin, and more. Unused markers include CD16, B7H3, CD45, Keratin17, CD20, and others."
