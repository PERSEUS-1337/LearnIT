    "content": "The CARES Act signed into law on March 27, 2020, includes $3.5 billion in supplemental appropriations for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). This report outlines the provisions in the CARES Act related to CCDBG, addressing allowable uses and allocations of the funds. The CCDBG Act supports child care programs for low-income families and is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Funds are allocated to states, territories, and tribes based on a statutory formula, with some funds reserved for activities like technical assistance and research. The CARES Act provides $3.5 billion in emergency funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to support child care programs for low-income families. This represents a 60% increase in total appropriations for FY2020. The funds are to be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, with provisions clarifying allowable uses. The additional funds are available for obligation by HHS through September 30, 2021. The CARES Act provides $3.5 billion in emergency funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) to support child care programs for low-income families. The act clarifies allowable uses of funds, including continued payments and assistance to child care providers during coronavirus-related closures to ensure they can remain open or reopen. Lead agencies subsidize child care costs and may provide additional funds for professional development or quality child care. The CCDBG Act encourages lead agencies to base payments to child care providers on enrollment rather than attendance, supporting fixed costs. The CARES Act allows CCDBG funds for cleaning, sanitation, and program operation, even for providers not previously receiving assistance. Eligible child care providers must adhere to CCDBG Act guidelines. The CCDBG Act requires child care providers to be licensed, regulated, or registered by the state and meet health and safety standards. Exceptions are made for providers caring for relatives, who must still comply with relative caregiver requirements. The CARES Act encourages using funds to pay staff salaries. The mean hourly wage for child care workers was $12.27 in May 2019. The CARES Act allows CCDBG funds to assist essential workers without income eligibility requirements. Eligible children must be under 13, reside with a working parent, and have family income below 85% of state median income. The CARES Act waives income requirements for essential workers to receive CCDBG funds, but other eligibility criteria still apply. States are reminded that existing authorities in the CCDBG Act can be used without amending state plans. Typically, states must submit plan amendments for substantial policy changes within 60 days of the effective date. The CARES Act allows HHS to provide child care assistance to essential workers regardless of income, waiving certain requirements related to CCDBG funds. States may want to amend their plans to reflect this change, which requires HHS approval within 90 days. The CCDBG Act mandates spending on quality activities, with at least 12% of FY2020 allotments allocated for this purpose. The CARES Act waives quality spending minimums for funds provided, offering lead agencies flexibility in spending. CCDBG Act requires minimum spending on direct services, with 70% of remaining funds to be used for direct services. The CARES Act also waives direct spending requirements, allowing lead agencies more flexibility in fund usage. The CARES Act allows flexibility in spending CCDBG funds, waiving quality and direct spending minimums. Funds should supplement, not supplant, state revenue for child care assistance for low-income families. Non-supplantation requirement may be violated if state reduces general revenue spending after new CCDBG appropriation. The CARES Act allows for flexibility in spending CCDBG funds, including restoring amounts for coronavirus-related expenses. Payments can be obligated within the current fiscal year or the next two fiscal years. CCDBG funds are allocated based on a formula, with set-asides for territories and tribes. Lead agencies have until FY2022 to obligate funds received under the CARES Act. The CCDBG formula includes set-asides for technical assistance, research, and a national hotline. Funds are allocated to states based on their share of children under age five, free- or reduced-price lunches, and per capita income. FY2020 CCDBG allocations are detailed in Table 1, including funds from annual appropriations and the CARES Act."
