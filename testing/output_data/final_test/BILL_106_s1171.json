Congress found that Presidential Decision Directive 42 and Executive Order No. 12978 emphasized the need to prioritize combating international crime for national security. The policy of the United States should be to impose sanctions on designated narcotics traffickers and their organizations. The United States policy is to impose economic and financial sanctions on foreign international narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. The purpose of this Act is to use the authorities in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sanction additional specially designated narcotics traffickers operating worldwide. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key officials, must provide a list of individuals involved in international narcotics trafficking by January 1 each year. The Director of National Drug Control Policy reviews the list and makes recommendations to the President by February 1 annually. Certain individuals can be excluded from the list. The Director of Central Intelligence can exclude individuals from the list of international narcotics traffickers if their disclosure could compromise US intelligence sources. The President must be informed of any such exclusions. The President must submit a classified report to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees explaining the reasons for designating individuals as threats to the United States. If no person is designated as a threat, a report must be submitted to Congress. The President may designate individuals playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking as threats to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The President must notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any such designations. If a designated individual no longer poses a threat, the President can remove the designation. If a person designated under subsection (d) or (e) no longer poses a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States, they will no longer be considered designated under that subsection. Such individuals may be referred to as \"specially designated narcotics traffickers\" in this Act. SEC. 4. BLOCKING ASSETS. Congress has found a national emergency exists regarding individuals who are designated narcotics traffickers. All property and interests in property within the US, or under the control of a US person, of designated narcotics traffickers or those who assist them, are blocked, except as provided by law. Any person who materially assists, provides support, or services for narcotics trafficking activities of a designated trafficker, or is determined to be owned or controlled by them, is prohibited from certain acts unless authorized by law. Prohibited acts include transactions involving property of designated narcotics traffickers and any attempts to evade or violate the law. Law enforcement and intelligence activities are not affected by these restrictions. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other officials, is responsible for implementation. The Secretary of the Treasury, along with other officials, is authorized to enforce regulations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Violations will be subject to civil or criminal penalties. Each agency must take appropriate measures to comply with the regulations. In this section, definitions for terms like \"entity,\" \"narcotics trafficking,\" \"person,\" and \"United States person\" are provided. These definitions are crucial for understanding the regulations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The curr_chunk states that the term \"person\" includes resident aliens, entities organized under US laws, and individuals in the US. SEC. 5. DENIAL OF VISAS TO AND INADMISSIBILITY OF SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. The Secretary of State must deny visas to specially designated narcotics traffickers and their family members. Exceptions include entry for medical reasons or upon request from specified officials. The Secretary of State must deny visas to specially designated narcotics traffickers and their family members, with exceptions for medical reasons or requests from specified officials. Exceptions include entry for medical reasons or upon request from specified officials, Central Intelligence, Secretary of the Treasury, or the Secretary of Defense, or for the prosecution of a specially designated narcotics trafficker."
