    "content": "The \"Protecting Student Athletes From Concussions Act of 2013\" establishes minimum state requirements for the prevention and treatment of concussions in student athletes. Beginning fiscal year 2015, states must certify to the Secretary that they have a law or regulation enforcing concussion safety and management plans for local educational agencies, including charter schools. The text chunk discusses the education and training on concussions for students, parents, and school personnel, including prevention, recognition, and response. It also mentions the use of release forms, treatment plans, monitoring, and reporting forms. The curr_chunk discusses supporting students recovering from concussions by guiding them in resuming school activities with a multidisciplinary team and providing appropriate academic accommodations. The curr_chunk outlines the process of providing academic accommodations and evaluating students with persistent concussion symptoms for eligibility under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The curr_chunk discusses best practices for ensuring uniform safety standards and management of concussions in public schools, including disseminating information and applying uniform standards to all students. Each public school in the State must post and make available information on concussions based on scientific evidence, including risks, actions to take, and symptoms to look out for. The State requires public schools to provide information on concussions, including definitions, prevention methods, and the impact on academic performance. If a student is suspected of having a concussion during a school activity, they must be immediately removed from participation and prohibited from resuming. The student must be immediately removed from school-sponsored athletic activities if they sustain a concussion. School personnel must report the injury to the concussion management team. The concussion management team must confirm and report the type of injury, date, and time to parents. Before resuming athletic activities, school personnel need a written release from a healthcare professional. The student's return to activities after a concussion should be coordinated with rest periods and gradually increasing cognitive and physical demands to avoid symptom reemergence. Once asymptomatic, the student can resume participation in activities. The concussion management team at public schools in the State must consult with relevant personnel and make academic support recommendations for students with concussions, including cognitive rest, modified assignments, gradual reintroduction to demands, and other accommodations. Certification for these recommendations must be in writing. \"SEC. 9512. DEFINITIONS.\" The term 'concussion' is defined as a mild traumatic brain injury caused by a blow, jolt, or motion to the head or body that disrupts normal brain functioning and alters the individual's physiological state, leading to symptoms like confusion, memory dysfunction, and disruptions in gait. Symptoms of a concussion may include physical symptoms like headache and fatigue, cognitive symptoms like memory disturbance, emotional symptoms like irritability, and difficulty sleeping. These symptoms can occur with or without loss of consciousness during school-sponsored athletic activities. The term 'health care professional' refers to a qualified individual recognized by the state to provide medical treatment, with experience in diagnosing and managing traumatic brain injury among children. The curr_chunk defines terms related to school settings and athletic activities for children with brain injuries. The table of contents in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include new items related to state requirements for the prevention and treatment of concussions."
