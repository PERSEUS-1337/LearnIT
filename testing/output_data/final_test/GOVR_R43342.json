    "content": "The medical device tax was proposed to offset the cost of the Affordable Care Act, projected to raise $30.6 billion over 10 years. After deductions, it is estimated to generate $24.4 billion in net revenues. Some advocate for keeping the tax, while others push for its repeal due to potential negative impacts on jobs and innovation in the industry. Repeal has become a priority for some Members of Congress. The Senate voted to include a repeal of the medical device tax as an amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution on March 21, 2013. Several bills were introduced to repeal the tax, but they did not advance in the Senate. The Jobs for America Act passed in the House in 2014 included a repeal of the tax. In the 114th Congress, the Medical Device Access and Innovation Protection Act aimed to repeal the tax retroactively to 2013. The House also passed the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015. The House passed the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015 (H.R. 160) to repeal the medical devices tax, which imposes a 2.3% excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices. The tax excludes certain devices like eyeglasses and hearing aids. The excise tax on medical devices, including eyeglasses and hearing aids, is deductible as a business cost and does not apply to exported devices. The tax can be offset by deductions for profitable firms, reducing the effective tax rate to about 1.4%. If the tax is passed on to consumers through price increases, the firm's revenue gain would be offset by the deduction, leaving income tax revenues unchanged. The medical device tax, part of the ACA, was meant to offset health care reform costs and benefit industries like medical device, health insurance, and pharmaceuticals. The tax aimed to raise $165.0 million over 10 years. The Senate proposed an industry-wide fee based on gross receipts for the medical device tax, while the House proposed a flat excise tax. The tax is estimated to raise $24.4 billion over a 10-year period according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The medical device tax is estimated to raise $24.4 billion over a 10-year period, with projected revenue of $1.8 billion in FY2016. The excise tax collections are larger than net revenue estimates, with estimated collections of $32.8 billion over the 10-year budget window and $2.4 billion in FY2016. JCT's revenue estimate projects a taxable base of $108.3 billion. The JCT's revenue estimate projects a taxable base of $108.3 billion of manufacturers' sales in FY2016. Initial receipts for the medical device tax were below expectations, likely due to compliance issues. Excise taxes are generally more efficient when not differential and are justified on specific grounds. Fishing and hunting equipment is taxed at either 10% or 11%. Excise taxes vary for different products, such as fishing and hunting equipment taxed at 10-11%, transportation by air at 6.5-7.5%, and large cigars at 52.75%. Federal cigarette taxes are around 16% of retail price, while alcohol taxes are about 4% for wine and beer, and 8% for distilled spirits. Medical device tax has small economic effects but higher administration costs relative to revenue. The medical device tax is small but has high administration costs relative to revenue. Concerns about deficit and revenue loss make it challenging to repeal the tax. It is part of a suite of taxes to finance the Affordable Care Act, including fees on drug manufacturers and health insurance providers. The \"Cadillac\" tax on high-cost insurance policies is also in the form of an excise tax and becomes more important in the future. The medical device tax, along with other taxes and fees, is being considered for elimination due to concerns about revenue loss. The tax is seen as a way to reduce industry profits and offset any negative effects on demand. Economic effects suggest the tax may not reduce profits but could be passed on in prices, with small impacts on output and jobs. The medical device excise tax is being considered for elimination due to concerns about revenue loss. Excise taxes are collected for distributional effects and to discourage consumption. The tax may not reduce profits but could be passed on in prices, with small impacts on output and jobs. Arguments for the tax include benefit taxes and the benefit principle. Taxes collected overall from consumers of health care might be appropriate to offset new and existing health insurance subsidies. The connection between taxes and health care benefits is loose compared to other tax-benefit links. Taxes on health care services may help reduce overconsumption by individuals with insurance. The evidence suggests that taxes on health care services may not effectively reduce overconsumption due to weak price signals influenced by medical professionals and insurance coverage. The justification for the medical device excise tax based on economic principles is weak in most cases. The medical device tax imposes administrative costs on firms to determine liability, product finality, and trace the supply chain. Compliance may be easier due to fewer exempt purchasers but challenging in other aspects compared to other excise taxes. The medical device tax imposes administrative costs on firms to determine liability, product finality, and trace the supply chain. Compliance may be more difficult due to the ad valorem nature of the tax and the complexity of exempt products and retail exemptions. The medical device tax imposes administrative costs on manufacturers, with limited information on compliance and administration costs. One study in the UK found low costs, but it may vary based on industry concentration and tax rate. Lower tax rates may result in higher administrative costs relative to tax revenues. The medical device tax has potential harmful effects on the industry, including job loss, reduced research and development, and impacts on smaller businesses. Despite some studies predicting negative effects, actual data shows an increase in revenue, employment, and research and development after the tax implementation. However, it is still early to fully assess the tax's impact, and further analysis is needed to understand its effects on industry performance. The medical device industry faces competition based on product types, with about half of output exempt from the tax. The tax is expected to be passed on to consumers through price increases, with minimal impact on U.S. output and jobs, estimated at no more than 0.2%. The tax on the U.S. medical device industry is small and estimated to have minimal effects on innovation and small to mid-sized firms. Approximately half of production is exempt from the tax, reducing its impact. Economic theory suggests that the tax would not affect output or jobs, but stockholders may lose money. The tax on U.S. producers would be $0.9 billion in FY2016 if it fell entirely on profits, representing 0.7% of industry revenues. Technical details are in the Appendix, which also compares estimates from other studies projecting larger effects on jobs and output. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that actual medical device tax collections were 76.1% of projected collections for a specific period. Some firms may not have been aware they were subject to the tax due to unreliable NAICS codes. The NAICS code is unreliable for identifying businesses subject to medical excise tax reporting. TIGTA recommended IRS take actions to reduce noncompliance, such as issuing notices to potential non-filers. The medical device industry produces a wide range of products, with output concentrated in larger firms operating globally. A significant fraction of the tax is projected to be paid on imports from foreign manufacturers. The medical device industry produces a variety of instruments and supplies, including syringes, needles, catheters, IV pumps, and surgical dressings. Technologically advanced products like in-vitro diagnostics and orthopedics make up a significant portion of the global market. The global medical devices market includes joint replacements, spinal products, cardiology devices (pacemakers, defibrillators, stents, heart valves), and diagnostic imaging equipment (X-ray, ultrasound, CT, PET, SPECT, MRI, nuclear medicine, mammography, fluoroscopy). Conventional products like catheters and needles face close competition with limited profit margins. The top global medical device firms account for a significant portion of sales, with the top five firms making up 28% of global sales. These firms include Johnson and Johnson, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Medtronic, and Philips Healthcare. Other notable firms in the market include Abbott Labs, Covidien, Boston Scientific, Becton Dickinson, and Stryker. The distribution of U.S. firms manufacturing medical supplies and equipment is shown in Table 1 based on corporate tax data analysis. Based on IRS data, the top 1% of firms in the medical supplies manufacturing industry accounted for 78.5% of receipts in 2012. In 2013, 34.9% of medical devices produced in the US were exported, while 36.6% of US consumption was from foreign imports. This implies that 36.6% of excise revenues could come from imported products. The excise tax on medical devices in the U.S. applies to approximately half of domestic production, with some exemptions for retail and specific items. The tax revenue estimate assumes that 20% of medical devices sold in the U.S. market will be exempt. The burden of the tax is influenced by supply and demand dynamics in the market. The market for medical devices is driven by supply and demand, with elasticities measuring the responsiveness of producers and consumers to price changes. The analysis assumes specific supply and demand curves, with a horizontal supply curve at equilibrium. Flat curves indicate high elasticity, while steep curves indicate low elasticity. The market for medical devices is driven by supply and demand, with elasticities measuring the responsiveness of producers and consumers to price changes. The supply curve is horizontal, indicating high elasticity. The demand curve is almost vertical, showing low elasticity. The relationship in Figure 1 represents the steady state after tax adjustment. The evidence suggests a highly elastic supply curve and an inelastic demand curve in the medical device market. The medical device industry is highly competitive with numerous manufacturers and suppliers. Despite production being concentrated at the top, there are still many firms in the market. In a competitive market, firms earn no profit above the normal return necessary to attract capital. Economic theory indicates that the tax is passed forward into the price in the long run. In a competitive market, firms earn no profit above the normal return necessary to attract capital. Economic theory indicates that the market supply curve is perfectly elastic. Firms may see their normal profits fall initially, leading to firms leaving the industry. If firms have market power, the tax may be passed on in price. The adjustment process could involve raising prices or reducing quantity. The process of passing on taxes in the tobacco, alcohol, and fuel industries involves raising prices or reducing quantity. Empirical research shows that these taxes are typically passed forward in price, sometimes exceeding 100%. Large purchasers in the health market, such as hospitals and insurance companies, may have the power to resist price increases. Buyers have been successful in limiting the profits of medical device manufacturers, but the tax may still be passed on through higher prices. Anecdotal evidence and a survey by S&P suggest that firms are planning to increase prices to cover the tax. The tax on medical devices may be passed on through higher prices as large firms are planning to increase prices to cover the tax. The effect on output and jobs in the industry depends on the elasticity of the demand curve, which is expected to be relatively inelastic for medical devices. The demand for medical devices used in hip replacement procedures may increase prices due to taxes, impacting output and jobs in the industry. The elasticity of demand for medical devices is expected to be relatively inelastic. The tax on medical devices used in hip replacement procedures can impact prices by a percentage reflecting the cost of the input. The demand for medical devices is expected to be relatively inelastic, but can become more elastic if other inputs can be substituted. The factor substitution elasticity is a key concept in input demand analysis. It is calculated by multiplying the factor substitution elasticity by the share of other inputs, and adding the consumer demand elasticity for the final product multiplied by the share of the input. Empirical evidence suggests that the aggregate factor substitution elasticity in the economy is around -0.5, lower than the commonly used value of one in simulation studies. The elasticity of factor substitution in the economy is likely inelastic, with a value of -0.5. Demand for medical devices is also expected to have a small substitution elasticity, approaching zero. This is due to limited substitutes and little ability to economize on these devices, especially when costs are covered by insurance. The demand elasticity for medical devices depends on consumer demand, factor substitution, and the share of medical devices in health services. With a price elasticity of -0.2 for health services, the estimated demand elasticity for medical devices is -0.008, assuming a 4% share of health costs. This elasticity is likely smaller for individuals with health insurance. The economic effects of the medical device tax are analyzed under different assumptions regarding price pass-through. If the tax is fully passed on to consumers, there will be a decrease in quantity demanded. However, if the firm absorbs some of the tax, profits will decrease. Two elasticity assumptions are considered, both assuming a final consumer demand elasticity of -0.2. The economic effects of the medical device tax are analyzed under different assumptions regarding price pass-through. Two elasticity assumptions are considered, with the demand elasticity set at -0.2. The range of effects from these cases is shown in Table, with the possibility of more elastic demand for technologically advanced products. The economic effects of the medical device tax are analyzed under different assumptions regarding price pass-through. The effects on output, employment, and innovation are shown in Table 3. The tax impact on profit as a percentage of revenue is reduced due to only half of devices being taxed and savings in income taxes. The estimated reduction in output for U.S. medical device firms ranges from 0.01% to 0.2%. The effects on jobs range from almost zero to about 1,200 based on different elasticities. The medical device tax has varying effects on jobs, with job losses ranging from almost zero to about 1,200 based on different elasticities. Concerns have been raised about the tax leading companies to offshore operations to avoid it, but it should not affect production location decisions. Additionally, there are concerns about the tax's impact on research and innovation in the industry. The medical device tax has minimal effects on research and innovation in the industry, particularly on small firms. Critics argue that small firms will reduce innovation due to thin profit margins, but analysis suggests minimal impact on both small and large firms as the tax is expected to be passed on in price. Smaller firms have greater research expenditures and smaller profit margins, but the decrease in demand is projected to be negligible. Large firms in the medical device industry, especially those with assets over $2.5 billion, dominate research and development activities, accounting for a significant portion of business receipts and general business credit. Despite smaller profit margins, most firms across asset categories still manage to have net profits larger than deficits. In the medical device industry, innovation should be carefully considered as rapid adoption of high-tech equipment and procedures can lead to rising healthcare costs. While these technologies offer benefits, the marginal cost may outweigh the gains, resulting in higher costs for smaller improvements. The current tax on the industry is expected to have a relatively small impact, with only around 1,200 job losses and a decline in output and employment by no more than two-tenths. The tax on the medical device industry is expected to have a small impact, with minimal job losses and a slight decline in output and employment. Most of the tax is likely to be passed on to consumers, with some falling on the federal government. The appendix provides a technical discussion on supply and demand relationships in the industry. The report discusses supply and demand relationships in economics, focusing on tax, price, quantity, profit maximization with monopoly power, and derivation of demand function for an intermediate good. Notation includes P (price), Q (quantity), Ed (demand elasticity), Es (supply elasticity), t (tax), c (marginal cost), and S (factor substitution elasticity). Figure A-1 illustrates the basic supply and demand relationship. The text discusses the supply and demand relationship in economics, focusing on the impact of a unit tax on price and quantity. It presents formulas for price and quantity changes, derived from linear demand and supply curves. The equations show the relationship between tax, price, quantity, demand elasticity (Ed), and supply elasticity (Es). The text discusses the impact of a unit tax on price and quantity in economics. It shows the relationship between tax, price, quantity, demand elasticity (Ed), and supply elasticity (Es). In perfect competition, firms have no profits and are price takers, while in monopoly, firms have market power and above-normal profits. In imperfect competition, firms may have market power due to barriers to entry, allowing them to influence prices. Monopolies are rare and regulated, with firms facing downward sloping demand curves. Each firm operates independently, but a decrease in output by one firm can increase demand for others. The analysis focuses on the optimization process for an ad valorem tax in firms with market power and assumes constant marginal costs. In imperfect competition, firms with market power may have constant marginal costs. The analysis considers the impact of an ad valorem tax on firm profits, with the price after the tax compared to the price without the tax. The price after the tax is calculated as P t -P = tP/(1-t). The ad valorem tax leads to a price increase slightly higher than the tax rate. In imperfect competition, firms with market power may pass on half of the tax cost to consumers. This analysis is based on a linear demand curve intersecting the x and y axis. The price equation with a linear demand curve is derived by substituting into the profit function. The pass-through of an ad valorem tax is calculated as (1/2) (t(1-t))*c. The pass-through of an ad valorem tax is calculated as (1/2) (t(1-t))*c, where only half of the tax on c appears in the price. Linear demand functions are commonly used to discuss tax pass-through, but they may not accurately represent real-world demand. Other demand curves, such as log-linear functions, provide alternative models for analyzing tax incidence. Bishop (1968) and Mixon (1986) have criticized the continued use of linear examples in textbooks. The log-linear function Q= Ae -bP represents tax pass-through, with the tax being fully passed forward. Individual firms' demand curves are more elastic than the aggregate market demand curve, leading to smaller quantity reductions. The demand elasticity in the market must account for products that are inputs into further production for final consumer products, like medical devices. The first order conditions for choosing a given input in relation to its price and the price and quantity of the final product can be represented by a production function equation. The tax on medical devices may have minimal negative effects on supply and demand, contrary to claims that it would reduce employment and innovation. Studies suggesting offshoring due to the tax lack economic theory basis. Three empirical studies on job effects of the medical device tax are reviewed in this section. The Furchtgott-Roth study projects job losses of around 43,000 based on supply and demand analysis. They estimate a job loss range from 2,300 to 23,000, with a projected job loss of 4,700. The estimate of job losses in the medical device industry is four times higher than the highest job loss estimated in a previous study. The assumption that 10% of production would move abroad contributes to almost 90% of the job loss projection. However, there is no reason to expect the industry to relocate due to the tax, as it is based on consumption in the United States. The study's demand elasticity appears too high, leading to methodological drawbacks. The Battelle study estimates a job loss of 38,000 in the medical device industry due to a hypothetical $3 billion revenue loss. This includes job losses of suppliers and general economic effects. The study's methodological drawbacks include high demand elasticity and no adjustment for tax-exempt sales. The assumption that production will move abroad contributes significantly to the job loss projection. The Ramlet, Book, and Zhong study highlights the limitations of using implicit elasticities to analyze the effects of a tax change. It fails to consider the impact on exports and the broader economy, leading to an overestimation of the tax's effects. The Ramlet, Book, and Zhong study projects job losses for the medical device industry and the economy due to a tax, using regression analysis. Their measurement of the tax understates it due to not grossing up by income and payroll tax offset, but also overstates it by not excluding the effect of exports. This leads to an overestimation of the tax effect by 20%. Based on CRS analysis, job loss related to the tax is projected to be negligible, ranging from zero to a high of about 1,200."
