Congress finds that the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 established overtime compensation requirements for certain employees working over 40 hours a week. The Secretary of Labor has defined the white collar exemption for executive, administrative, and professional employees for over 75 years through regulations including a duties test and minimum salary threshold. The Secretary of Labor has historically used a salary threshold to define the white collar exemption, as approved by Congress. However, the salary threshold has become outdated and ineffective due to lack of updates, with a significant decrease in the percentage of full-time salaried workers earning below the threshold from 1975 to 2016. The salary threshold for white-collar exemption was updated on May 23, 2016, to $913 per week or $47,476 per year, benefiting over 13 million employees with overtime compensation protections. The Secretary of Labor crafted a final rule to provide overtime compensation protections to 4.2 million new employees and strengthen protections for 8.9 million additional employees. This process involved extensive public input, economic analysis, and significant changes made in response to feedback. The public comments on the proposed rule were overwhelmingly positive. The final rule increased the salary threshold to $913 per week or $47,476 per year, a strong yet measured increase compared to the initial proposals. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas questioned the authority of the Secretary of Labor under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by issuing a preliminary injunction against enforcing the final overtime rule. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas invalidated the final overtime rule, jeopardizing overtime protections for millions of workers. The final overtime rule was invalidated by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, putting millions of workers' overtime protections at risk.
