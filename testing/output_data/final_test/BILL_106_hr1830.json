The Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 was amended by the \"Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1999\" to establish mandatory triggers based on total unemployment rates in states. The Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 was amended in 1999 to set triggers based on total unemployment rates in states. The amendment specifies conditions for a State 'off' indicator unless certain requirements are met. The Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 was amended in 1999 to determine rates of total unemployment and insured unemployment. The Act amended in 1999 delegates the determination of total unemployment rates to the Secretary. The rate of insured unemployment is calculated based on average monthly covered employment and the number of individuals filing claims for regular compensation. The Act amended in 1999 delegates the determination of total unemployment rates to the Secretary based on average monthly covered employment. Requirements for supplemental benefits during high unemployment periods are specified in the Act. The Act amended in 1999 delegates the determination of total unemployment rates to the Secretary based on average monthly covered employment. Amendments to Alternative Trigger include changes to compensation effective after March 6, 1993. The Act amended in 1999 delegates the determination of total unemployment rates to the Secretary based on average monthly covered employment. Amendments to Alternative Trigger include changes to compensation effective after March 6, 1993. The rate of insured unemployment under State law equals or exceeds 6 percent, with a State 'off' indicator if the requirement is not met. Any week with a State 'on' indicator remains as such, regardless of State law provisions. SEC. 3. SPECIAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE STATES. Section 903(a)(3) of the Social Security Act is amended to specify the conditions for amounts not exceeding $20,000,000 for the proper administration of the unemployment compensation program. The Secretary of Labor shall reserve funds to award grants to States for implementing alternative base periods for unemployment compensation programs. The Secretary of Labor reserved funds for implementing alternative base periods for unemployment compensation programs in 2002 to reduce the time between the end of the base period and filing a claim for compensation. SEC. 4. SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS. Section 903(b) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a provision stating that if a State has not achieved the solvency target by a certain date, the funds allocated for that State will be transferred to States that have met the requirements. The transfers will be based on each State's share of funds, excluding the wages of non-compliant States. The solvency target for December 31, 2001, is an average high cost multiple of 1.0, representing the number of years a State could pay unemployment compensation based on its reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the balance in the State account by the total covered wages. The benefit cost rate is determined by dividing unemployment compensation paid during a calendar year by total covered wages in the State. Acceptable progress towards achieving the solvency target for December 31, 2001, means reducing the difference between 1.0 and the average high cost multiple by at least 5 percent. Wages and unemployment compensation paid by employers covered under section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are excluded from the ratio and rates calculation. The Secretary may adjust the solvency target for States experiencing significant unemployment increases between 1998 and 2001. States must include information in their annual plan on how they plan to achieve the solvency target. Requirements apply to excess remaining in employment security. The Secretary may adjust the solvency target for States based on unemployment increases. States must include plans to achieve the target. Excess amounts in the employment security account exceeding $2,900,000,000 are exempt from requirements. SEC. 5. TREATMENT OF SHORT-TIME COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. The text chunk discusses the definition of a short-time compensation program under the Internal Revenue Code, where employers can voluntarily reduce employee work hours to avoid layoffs, with eligible employees receiving pro rata unemployment compensation. Employees receiving short-time compensation benefits are not required to meet work search requirements but must be available for their normal workweek. They can participate in approved training programs and may continue to receive health and retirement benefits as if their workweek had not been reduced. The State agency can also require employers to provide benefits during reduced workweeks. Employers must submit a written plan to implement the requirements of the program. The program must meet additional requirements determined by the Secretary of Labor. Amendments are made to allow withdrawal of amounts for short-time compensation under a defined program. Amendments allow withdrawal of amounts for short-time compensation under a defined program. The provisions of this Act will take effect on the date of enactment, with extended benefit amendments coming into effect for weeks beginning on or after October 1, 2002. Additionally, states may implement these amendments earlier, but not before 60 days after the Act's enactment."
