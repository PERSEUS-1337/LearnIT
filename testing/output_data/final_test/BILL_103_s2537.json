    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act\" and includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, purpose, definitions, general rule, applicability, preemption, jurisdiction of Federal courts, and effective date. The Congress recognizes that imposing multiple punitive damages for harms from a single act can deplete a defendant's assets, jeopardizing compensation for claimants. Even settlements are affected as the threat of punitive damages leads to higher payouts, reducing funds for future compensatory claims. Multiple imposition of punitive damages can deplete a defendant's assets, jeopardizing compensation for claimants and hindering global settlement negotiations. This practice may violate constitutionally protected rights and impede the resolution of mass tort claims. Federal and State trial courts lack the authority to address these issues. Individual State legislatures have limited power to address issues with multiple punitive damages as they cannot control awards in other states. The purpose of this Act is to address the issue of multiple punitive damages in interstate commerce. It aims to provide a fair and balanced resolution to this problem. The Act defines \"punitive damages\" as awards meant to punish or deter certain behavior, \"specific findings of fact\" as written findings focusing on a defendant's conscious indifference to safety, and \"claimant\" as the person bringing a civil action or on whose behalf it is brought. The term \"claimant\" includes the parent or guardian of a minor or incompetent. SEC. 6. GENERAL RULE. Punitive damages are generally prohibited in civil actions if they have already been awarded against the defendant for the same act. However, new evidence of additional wrongful behavior or insufficient previous punitive damages may warrant a new award. The court may award punitive damages if previous damages were insufficient to punish or deter similar behavior in the future. The court must make specific findings of fact, reduce the award by previous punitive damages, and keep its actions confidential from the jury. SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY; PREEMPTION; JURISDICTION OF FEDERAL COURTS. The Act applies to civil actions seeking punitive damages for the same conduct already awarded punitive damages, except for actions under specific statutory damages laws. The Act supersedes any federal or state laws on punitive damages recovery, and federal courts do not have jurisdiction over civil actions under this Act. The Act will take effect upon enactment and will apply to civil actions pending or commenced on or after that date, including actions where harm occurred before the enactment."
