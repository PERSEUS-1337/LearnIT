    "content": "The 112th Congress passed legislation to stimulate innovation in the pharmaceutical industry through changes in patent law and regulatory exclusivities. This includes the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which address pediatric exclusivity and extended regulatory exclusivity for qualified infectious disease products. Patents and regulatory exclusivities create a complex landscape of intellectual property rights to incentivize drug development and marketing. Regulatory exclusivities, administered by the FDA, provide protection for approved drugs from competing applications for marketing approval. Innovation policy issues have been raised regarding the need for both regulatory exclusivities and patents, the duration of exclusivities, and their use to encourage specific types of innovation. There are also concerns about the obligations of other nations to grant regulatory exclusivities in a manner similar to U.S. law. The report discusses innovation policy issues related to intellectual property rights in pharmaceutical innovation, focusing on patents and regulatory exclusivities. It also addresses domestic and international concerns at the intersection of these proprietary rights, along with congressional issues and potential alternatives. The Patent Act of 1952 requires innovators to submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection, which is assessed by examiners for disclosure and distinctiveness of the invention. The USPTO examines patent applications to determine if the invention meets substantive standards. For a patent to be granted, the invention must be useful, novel, and nonobvious. If approved, the patent holder has the right to exclude others from using the invention for twenty years. The term of a patent is typically twenty years from the filing date of the patent application. Patent owners are responsible for monitoring competitors using the patented invention and may need to litigate in federal district courts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handles patent appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court can review cases from the Federal Circuit. The U.S. government regulates pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical marketing for public health, requiring safety and efficacy demonstration by drug developers. Before a product can be distributed to the public, the FDA requires sponsors to conduct preclinical and clinical investigations to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness. The FDA evaluates the test data submitted in a New Drug Application (NDA) to decide on marketing approval. This data is kept confidential to prevent competitors from using it to avoid development costs. Prior to 1984, there were no specific provisions for generic versions of FDA-approved brand-name drugs. Some generic manufacturers had to file their own NDA to market their drug, as not all drugs had published safety and efficacy studies available. The FDA sometimes requested additional studies for generic drugs, leading to redundant and costly approval processes. Critics believed this system forced generic manufacturers to prove the safety and effectiveness of their chemically identical products. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, was enacted in response to concerns about the costly and time-consuming process of obtaining FDA approval for generic drugs. This legislation introduced the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for generic drug approval based on bioequivalence to the original drug. The ANDA mechanism allows generic drug manufacturers to rely on safety and efficacy data of the original manufacturer, avoiding costs and delays associated with filing a full NDA. It also enables them to market bioequivalent drugs once relevant patents expire. The Hatch-Waxman Act imposes limits on generic competitors referencing brand-name drug data through regulatory exclusivities. These exclusivities restrict competitors' ability to sell generic versions of approved brand-name drugs for a specific period. Regulatory exclusivities cover various aspects such as new chemical entities, clinical studies, orphan drugs, pediatric studies, generic drugs, and biologics. There is no standard terminology for these exclusivities, with some referring to them as \"statutory exclusivity,\" \"data protection,\" or \"marketing exclusivity.\" However, a distinction is made between data exclusivity and marketing exclusivity, with the former providing protection for safety and efficacy data and the latter granting exclusive marketing rights. The distinction between data and marketing exclusivity lies in the scope of protection each affords. Data exclusivity protects safety and efficacy information submitted by brand-name firms from use by generic firms, while marketing exclusivity prevents competing firms from obtaining FDA approval regardless of their own data. The expense of generating clinical data for marketing approval is a barrier for many firms, making the difference between data and marketing exclusivity more significant for those who can afford it. The Hatch-Waxman Act established a five-year data exclusivity for new chemical entities (NCE) to encourage innovative drug development with new active ingredients. NCE exclusivity prevents generic firms from using the data submitted by the innovative drug company for five years. During the five-year period of NCE exclusivity, the FDA cannot accept generic drug applications for products containing the same active ingredient. NCE exclusivity acts as data exclusivity, allowing the FDA to accept applications from entities that have conducted all required studies. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a reduction of NCE exclusivity to four years if the NDA holder's patents are challenged by generic applicants. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows for a reduction of NCE exclusivity to four years if the NDA holder's patents are challenged by generic applicants, allowing additional time for brand-name and generic pharmaceutical firms to put their patent affairs in order prior to generic marketing. NCE exclusivity restricts generic manufacturers from bringing a product to market for five years plus the length of the FDA review of the generic application, potentially extending protection to seven years. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for a three-year new clinical study exclusivity period to encourage improvements on existing drugs. This exclusivity can be granted for changes like new dosage forms, indications, or switching from prescription to over-the-counter status. To qualify, the study must be new, involve clinical research on humans, and be conducted or sponsored by the sponsor. To qualify for new clinical study exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the study must be new, involve clinical research on humans, and be conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The applicant must provide substantial support for the investigation, with 50% or more of the funding qualifying as substantial support. The study must also be essential to the approval of the application or supplement, meaning there are no other data available that could support approval. New clinical study exclusivity, unlike NCE exclusivity, does not prevent FDA approval of a full NDA or acceptance of a generic application. If new clinical study exclusivity delays marketing approval, FDA may issue tentative approval for the generic product. New clinical study exclusivity only applies to the specific use or dosage form supported by the new clinical study. It does not prevent FDA approval of generic drugs for other indications or forms. A drug can have both NCE exclusivity and new clinical study exclusivity during its lifespan. The Orphan Drug Act encourages the development of pharmaceuticals for rare diseases. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of drugs to treat rare diseases and conditions, including FDA protocol assistance, tax breaks, grants for clinical trials, and a seven-year marketing exclusivity period. This exclusivity applies to both patented and unpatented products, blocking competitors from obtaining FDA approval. Orphan drug exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act blocks competitors from obtaining FDA approval for the same drug, unless for a different use. To qualify for orphan drug status, the drug must treat a rare disease affecting less than 200,000 people in the United States. The Orphan Drug Act allows for exclusivity for drugs treating rare diseases affecting less than 200,000 people in the US. Changes in 1988 required sponsors to request orphan drug status before submitting a marketing approval application. The BPCIA introduced new regulatory exclusivities for biologically derived preparations. The BPCIA introduced new regulatory exclusivities for biologics, including vaccines, antitoxins, blood components, and therapeutic serums. These exclusivities provide brand-name biologics with periods of 4 and 12 years of regulatory exclusivity. The BPCIA specifically states that approval of a biosimilar application cannot be effective until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. The BPCIA introduced new regulatory exclusivities for biologics, including vaccines, antitoxins, blood components, and therapeutic serums. These exclusivities provide brand-name biologics with periods of 4 and 12 years of regulatory exclusivity. Some debate exists over whether the 12-year exclusivity period is for data or marketing. FDA referred to it as marketing exclusivity, but some Members of Congress argue it is data exclusivity. The BPCIA introduced new regulatory exclusivities for biologics, including vaccines, antitoxins, blood components, and therapeutic serums. Brand-name biologics are granted 4 and 12 years of regulatory exclusivity. There is debate over whether the 12-year exclusivity is for data or marketing. Some Members of Congress argue it is data exclusivity, not marketing exclusivity. The 12-year exclusivity period does not prevent other manufacturers from developing their own data for FDA approval of similar products. The FDA issued a draft guidance aligning with congressional views on pediatric exclusivity for brand-name firms. This exclusivity extends for six months after completion of pediatric studies on a drug's effects. It aims to improve pediatric labeling availability. Pediatric regulatory exclusivities were established by the FDAMA in 1997 and reauthorized by Congress. In the 112th Congress, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act made pediatric exclusivity permanent to encourage additional testing on children. FDA issues written requests to perform pediatric studies on drugs to improve labeling availability for children. The FDA issues written requests to drug holders for pediatric studies, outlining study details and timeframe. Responding is voluntary, but successful completion results in six-month pediatric regulatory exclusivity. This exclusivity incentivizes research and submission of results to the FDA, regardless of study success in demonstrating safety and effectiveness in children. The pediatric exclusivity extends manufacturer's regulatory exclusivity or patent protection by six months. If applied to an orphan drug, it results in seven years and six months of marketing exclusivity. The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act allows FDA to designate a drug as a \"qualified infectious disease product\" (QIDP) for antibacterial or antifungal drugs. The GAIN Act designates drugs as \"qualified infectious disease products\" (QIDPs) for serious infections. It adds five years to exclusivities for QIDPs, including those addressing drug-resistant tuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus. This extension is cumulative with pediatric exclusivity, resulting in a total data exclusivity period of ten years and six months. Regulatory exclusivities mostly benefit brand-name firms, but federal law also establishes them. The Hatch-Waxman Act and the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act establish regulatory exclusivities to encourage generic and follow-on firms to market their products. These exclusivities provide periods of exclusivity for generic and follow-on products, precluding the approval of competing products for a specified time. The regulatory exclusivity for brand-name biologic drugs may end after one year of commercial marketing, 18 months after a final court decision in a patent infringement action, 42 months after approval if the applicant is sued and litigation is ongoing, or 18 months after approval if the applicant is not sued. The Obama Administration proposed reducing the exclusivity period to seven years to encourage faster development of generic biologics and save $4 billion over 10 years in federal health programs. The FDA launched an Unapproved Drugs Initiative in 2006 to encourage manufacturers to seek formal agency approval for old drugs. One firm submitted NDAs for colchicine to treat familial Mediterranean fever and acute gout flares, which were approved with seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. The FDA awarded exclusivity for colchicine to treat familial Mediterranean fever and acute gout flares. Enforcement action was taken against unapproved colchicine products, leading to a price increase for the sole provider's product, Colcrys\u00ae. Regulatory exclusivities can be awarded to existing products, impacting patients and payors with higher costs.

Regulatory exclusivities can impact patients and payors with higher costs. Legislation in the 112th Congress proposes a framework that emphasizes regulatory exclusivity over patents as an incentive for health care innovation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. The MODDERN Cures Act, introduced as H.R. 3901 and H.R. 3116, allows drug sponsors to request \"dormant therapy\" designation for therapies addressing unmet medical needs. This designation grants 15 years of marketing exclusivity, with patents extended up to 15 years after approval but with a waiver of patent enforcement after the exclusivity period. This Act raises debates on the role of patents in healthcare innovation. The debate over the role of patents and regulatory exclusivities in promoting pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D is ongoing. Regulatory exclusivity may align better with the product life cycle than patents, as it starts after market approval and corresponds more closely to product markets. Patents provide the right to sue for exclusion, while regulatory exclusivity tracks FDA approvals more directly. Regulatory exclusivity keeps competitors off the market without the need for patent lawsuits, but may have disadvantages compared to patents. The U.S. Supreme Court highlighted that patents should not stifle innovation, yet regulatory exclusivities can be granted for old products based on routine trials. This raises questions about promoting progress through regulatory exclusivity while denying patent rights for \"ordinary innovation.\" Regulatory exclusivities, like patents, can hinder innovation and access to generic medications. The World Trade Organization requires signatories to provide patent protection without discrimination. Regulatory exclusivities may divert resources from the FDA's core mission of protecting public health. The TRIPS Agreement mandates patent protection without discrimination, including for pharmaceutical products. It also requires protection of pharmaceutical test data under certain conditions. Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement requires members to protect data against unfair commercial use and disclosure, with vague terms leading to debate over obligations. The United States has entered FTAs mandating five years of regulatory exclusivity for pharmaceuticals with new chemical entities. The Dominican Republic-Central America-United States FTA mandates regulatory exclusivity for new pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products for five to ten years. The term \"new product\" refers to those containing chemical entities not previously approved in the territory. The United States is also negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) for similar provisions. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a multilateral free trade agreement focusing on liberalizing trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Negotiations include discussions on adopting a period of exclusivity for biologics, with some Members of Congress advocating for a 12-year exclusivity period to align with the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Concerns have been raised about the impact of regulatory exclusivity provisions in the TPP on healthcare in developing countries. Regulatory exclusivities, along with patents, form the basis of intellectual property incentives for pharmaceutical innovation in the United States. Regulatory exclusivities are a key tool for stimulating private activity in specific product classes regulated by the FDA. They supplement patent protection by offering limited protections for inventions that do not meet Patent Act requirements or delaying patent litigation. Expanding and extending regulatory exclusivities could make them the primary form of intellectual property protection for certain FDA-regulated products. The decision to replace patent rights with FDA-administered regulatory exclusivities for certain FDA-regulated products raises trade-offs for policy makers to consider. These include the impact on pharmaceutical innovation incentives, medication cost and availability, individualized determinations of technical merits, patent enforcement costs, and the choice between USPTO and FDA for awarding proprietary rights. International harmonization is also a significant issue in regulatory exclusivities. Some observers have concerns about using free trade agreements to extend regulatory exclusivity periods, while others believe it benefits the United States. Future discussions may focus on establishing global regulatory exclusivity standards aligned with national goals."
