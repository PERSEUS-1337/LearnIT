    "content": "Recent empirical results on over-parameterized deep networks show a lack of the classic U-shaped test error curve, with test error decreasing in wider networks. Researchers are exploring better complexity measures to address this discrepancy. The study directly measures prediction bias and variance in modern deep networks for classification and regression tasks. Both bias and variance can decrease as the number of parameters increases. The role of optimization is examined by decomposing total variance into variance from training set sampling and initialization. In the over-parameterized regime, total variance is lower and dominated by variance from sampling. The study provides theoretical analysis in a simplified setting. The bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning suggests that achieving low bias often results in high variance. However, recent empirical evidence shows that wider networks can generalize better than smaller ones. The study provides theoretical analysis in a simplified setting consistent with these findings. Recent studies have shown that wider networks can generalize better than smaller ones, contradicting the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. By directly measuring prediction bias and variance, researchers found that both can decrease as network width increases in classification and regression tasks with deep networks. This behavior was observed with various optimizers, bypassing the need to identify complexity measures to understand the tradeoff. In studying the role of optimization and sampling in networks, a decomposition of total prediction variance was proposed. Variance due to initialization is significant in under-parameterized regimes and decreases with width in over-parameterized regimes. Total variance is dominated by sampling variance in the latter case. Theoretical analysis supports these empirical findings, showing that prediction variance does not grow arbitrarily in linear models and variance due to initialization diminishes in deep networks under certain assumptions. In the context of optimization and sampling in networks, a study focused on the bias-variance tradeoff. The variance decreases with network width, contradicting traditional intuition. The over-parameterized setting shows a decrease in generalization error with capacity. The study uniquely analyzes bias and variance in supervised learning tasks. In this paper, predictors h \u03b8 are parameterized by the weights \u03b8 \u2208 R N of deep neural networks. The focus is on randomness from initialization in the learning algorithm A, which produces \u03b8 = A(S, I) given a fixed training set S and fixed optimization randomness I. The learning algorithm A produces weights \u03b8 = A(S, I) with randomness in initialization. The average performance is decomposed into three error sources in the context of classification. The average performance of the learning algorithm is decomposed into three error sources in the context of classification. The bias-variance decomposition reveals the sources of variance in the output predictions, including variance due to initialization and variance due to sampling. Classification losses do not have a clean bias-variance decomposition, but it is natural to expect some level of bias and variance in risk computation. In this section, the study explores how the variance of fully connected single hidden layer networks changes with width. Evidence contradicts the claim that bias decreases and variance increases with the number of hidden units. Experimental results show that variance decreases as network width increases on MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets. This trend is also observed in a sinusoid regression task. The same hyperparameters are used across all widths in each task. In a study exploring the variance of fully connected single hidden layer networks with varying widths, it was found that decreasing the dataset size can increase variance. When the MNIST training set was reduced to 100 examples, bias and variance still decreased with width. Test error trends aligned with bias-variance trends, indicating effective capacity increased with width. The step size for each network size was tuned using a validation set. These observations were also tested using batch gradient descent. In experiments exploring neural network variance, the study investigates the impact of sampling and initialization variance on optimization. Contrary to traditional bias-variance tradeoff intuition, sampling variance increases with width while initialization variance decreases. Over-parameterization in width has been shown to aid gradient descent in reaching global minima in neural networks. Our empirical results show that in wider neural networks, variance due to initialization decreases while variance due to sampling levels off. This behavior is inspired by overparameterized linear models where variance does not grow with the number of parameters. The dimension of the solution space, r = rank(X), is independent of N. The prediction for a fixed example x depends on a subspace of the parameter space, M, with dimension d(N), and parameter components corresponding to directions orthogonal to M. The optimization of the loss function is invariant with respect to these components. The optimization of the loss function is invariant with respect to parameter components orthogonal to M. The variance from initialization decreases to zero as N increases, provided the Lipschitz constant grows more slowly than the square root of dimension. The Lipschitz constant L grows slowly compared to the square root of dimension. Evidence refutes the claim that low bias leads to high variance. Variance due to sampling is not width-dependent in over-parameterized settings. Variance from initialization decreases with width. Experimental tests on various datasets show promising results for neural network complexity and generalization abilities. Averages over data samples are calculated using bootstrap replicate training sets. In the study, 50 neural networks are trained for each hidden layer size using different training sets. E bias 2 and E variance are estimated using 100 neural networks for each hidden layer size. Confidence intervals are computed using bootstrap. Networks are trained using SGD with momentum and run for extended periods even after reaching 100% training set accuracy. The study's findings are robust regardless of how long the networks are trained. In the study, neural networks are trained without regularization techniques like weight decay or dropout. Hyperparameters are set for different datasets, with step sizes and momentum values specified. Step sizes are tuned for each network size using a validation set. Training for tuning stops after 1000 epochs, while training for final models stops after 10000 epochs. Step sizes are chosen based on performance sensitivity in small data settings. The study focuses on training neural networks without regularization techniques. Step sizes are tuned for each network size using a validation set, leading to increasing effective capacity and decreasing variance. Sensitivity to step size in small data settings tests the hypothesis, showing a decreasing trend in variance. The step size is crucial for optimizing neural networks, as it needs to correspond well to the noise structure in SGD for good test set accuracy. Tuning the step size for different network sizes helps maintain optimality across networks. The study also highlights the variance behavior in linear models with increasing parameters. In linear regression, the over-parameterized setting occurs when the input dimension is larger than the number of examples. The predictor learns weights from the data and makes predictions based on the input features. In linear regression, the over-parameterized setting occurs when the input dimension is larger than the number of examples. The predictor learns weights from the data and makes predictions based on the input features. The initialization of \u03b8 is done with a normal distribution. The predictor makes predictions on x using h(x) = \u03b8^T x. The quantity of interest is E x Var(h(x)). In the case where N > m, even if X has maximal rank, \u03a3 is not invertible, leading to a unique solution from updates that belong to the span of the training points x_i. In over-parameterized linear models, gradient descent yields a solution closest to initialization in the null space of X. The variance decomposition does not grow with the number of parameters N, scaling with the dimension of the data instead. In over-parameterized linear models, variance does not grow with the number of parameters N, scaling with the dimension of the data instead. The proofs for this can be found in the appendix, showing an explicit increasing dependence on N. In over-parameterized linear models, the variance does not increase with the number of parameters N but scales with the data dimension instead. The proof involves the law of total variance and explicit dependence on the rank of the data matrix X. Concentration results from Levy are used in the proof. In over-parameterized linear models, the variance scales with the data dimension instead of the number of parameters N. Levy's lemma is used to derive concentration inequalities for functions of Gaussian variables, leading to variance bounds for random variables. The proof involves the law of total variance and assumptions regarding the optimization of the loss function. The optimization of the loss function is invariant with respect to \u03b8 M\u22a5. Assumptions include the prediction h \u03b8 (x) being L-Lipschitz with respect to \u03b8 M\u22a5 and network parameters initialized as DISPLAYFORM2. The Gaussian concentration theorem translates into concentration of predictions in the setting of ??, with parameters at the end of learning process denoted as \u03b8. Concentration of predictions is achieved under initialization randomness for a fixed data set S. The text discusses the initialization of parameters \u03b8 in a lower-dimensional space, assuming a mapping to lower-dimensional representations. It mentions the Lipschitz constant L and the Gaussian concentration theorem, leading to the conclusion that variance decreases as dimension grows. The section provides a bound on classification risk in terms of regression risk. The section provides a bound on classification risk R classif in terms of the regression risk R reg, showing that R classif \u2264 4R reg. The classifier defines a map h : X \u2192 R k, outputting probability vectors h(x) \u2208 R k. The classification and regression risks are given by Y denotes the one-hot vector representation of the class y. The text makes strong assumptions with some support in the literature, including the existence of a subspace M \u22a5 where no learning occurs. The existence of a subspace M \u22a5 where no learning occurs was conjectured and shown to hold in linear neural networks. Empirical evidence suggests that learning mainly occurs in a small number of directions, with a critical number of relevant parameters independent of model size. The spectrum of the Hessian for over-parameterized networks splits into a bulk near zero and a few large eigenvalues, indicating that learning occurs in a small subspace. Classical complexity measures do not consider optimization and what will actually be learned. The -hypothesis class considers the probabilistic nature of learning by defining hypotheses likely to be learned for a given data distribution and learning algorithm. This approach provides insights into model complexity and variance, challenging traditional bias-variance views. The traditional view of bias-variance as a tradeoff does not always hold true. The size of a neural network affects bias and variance. A small network may be biased, while an overparameterized network can reduce bias but increase variance. Incomplete convergence of the minimization algorithm can help mitigate the variance contribution to the mean-squared error. The text discusses the tradeoff between bias and variance in estimating an unknown function from data. It mentions the need to construct networks with small VC-dimension to avoid overfitting and highlights the goal of minimizing expected loss by decomposing it into bias and variance components. The tradeoff between bias and variance in model complexity is crucial for minimizing expected loss. Bias decreases and variance increases with model complexity, leading to overfitting or underfitting. Adding more parameters increases model complexity, raising variance and lowering bias."
