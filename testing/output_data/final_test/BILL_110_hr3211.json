Congress finds that in the past 7 years, an average of 150 Federal law enforcement officers per year sustained physical injuries while dealing with an assaultive subject. Despite this, only 2 Federal agencies have an awards mechanism to recognize injured officers, unlike the military and most State and local police departments that have commendations for injured officers. Formal congressional recognition for injured Federal law enforcement officers is lacking. Congress acknowledges the lack of formal recognition for Federal law enforcement officers injured in the line of duty and supports honoring their bravery and sacrifice. The Attorney General may award a Congressional Badge of Bravery to a Federal law enforcement officer for sustaining a physical injury while on duty, upon recommendation of the Congressional Badge of Bravery Board. An agency head can nominate a Federal law enforcement officer for a Badge if they sustained a physical injury while on duty, put themselves at personal risk, and showed bravery during the incident. The nomination must include a written narrative describing the circumstances of the injury. The nomination for the Congressional Badge of Bravery must include the nominee's full name, home mailing address, agency served, occupational title, field office address, and years of Government service.
