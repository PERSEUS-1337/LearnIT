The country has historically close ties with the United States, with support from past administrations in transitioning from communism. Poland has historically close ties with the United States, with strong support in transitioning from communism. The Clinton and Bush administrations advocated for Poland's NATO membership. Poland has been a reliable ally in the global war on terrorism, contributing troops to U.S.-led coalitions. However, involvement in Iraq has become a political liability for many Poles, especially with elections approaching in 2005. Poland's loyalty to the United States has not been rewarded as some Poles hope for increased military assistance, Iraq reconstruction contracts, and changes in U.S. visa policy. President Kwasniewski urged restraint in criticizing the U.S. for its fight against terrorism. EU officials praised Poland's efforts in the war on terrorism after a visit in December 2004. Poland's efforts in the war on terrorism have been praised by EU officials for being \"professional and enthusiastic.\" They have supported EU initiatives to enhance law enforcement cooperation against terrorism and have contributed military personnel to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. Polish Prime Minister Marek Belka has called for increased troop commitments to ISAF during a visit to Kabul in July 2004. Observers believe that Poland's determination to cooperate with the United States in the global war on terrorism will remain unchanged regardless of election outcomes. Poland's historical consistency in supporting U.S.-led coalitions, including in the Gulf War and Iraq conflict, has been noted. Approximately 200 Polish special forces participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom, working closely with U.S. Navy SEALs. Poland's efforts in the war on terrorism have been praised, with Prime Minister Marek Belka calling for increased troop commitments to ISAF in Afghanistan. Poland has contributed significantly to post-war peacekeeping efforts, commanding a multinational stability force with over 9,000 troops. The Polish-led division received support from NATO and had around 4,000 troops in June 2005. Concerns about terrorist attacks were raised in relation to Poland's involvement in Iraq. In response to terrorist threats, Poland faced pressure to withdraw troops from Iraq after suffering casualties and public opposition surged following prisoner abuse revelations at Abu Ghraib. Defense Minister Szmajdzinski indicated a plan to reduce troop presence after Iraq's elections in January 2005. In response to pressure and public opposition, Poland planned to reduce troop presence in Iraq after the January 2005 elections. Government officials affirmed troop reduction, with up to 700 troops to be withdrawn after the elections. Despite a new perspective on Iraq post-elections, Poland announced that additional troops would return by August, with all soldiers exiting Iraq by December 2005 when the UN mandate expires. Warsaw is expected to continue supporting NATO training of the Iraqi officer corps. Warsaw plans to continue supporting NATO training of the Iraqi officer corps despite downsizing its military contingent in Iraq due to various factors such as the difficult stabilization mission, high costs, and the need to postpone defense modernization. Defense Minister Szmajdzinski announced in April 2005 that the deployment had cost Poland $210 million. Observers note that Poland has not seen significant benefits from its presence in Iraq, despite the human casualties and financial costs. Key areas of concern include Iraq reconstruction contracts, military assistance, and a waiver from U.S. visa requirements. Polish companies expected lucrative contracts for Iraq's economic reconstruction, but these have not materialized, leading to resentment towards the U.S. for awarding contracts to American companies. U.S. officials are aware of Poland's disappointment and have attempted to address it. In December 2004, Iraq agreed to purchase military equipment from Poland, including helicopters and ground transportation vehicles. Poland's expectations for offsetting contracts were high, but other contracts were under negotiation. Polish officials expressed concerns about the strain on their resources due to Iraq, delaying the transformation of their armed forces. They also complained about the lack of significant benefits from their presence in Iraq. In February 2005, President Bush pledged $100 million in military aid to Poland to help offset costs from their contributions to Iraq. Congress approved a $200 million \"Solidarity Fund\" for countries with troops in Iraq, but it is uncertain if Poland will receive the full amount. Additionally, Poland is expected to receive $32 million in regular military assistance for FY2006. Warsaw also hopes for a waiver of the U.S. government requirement for Poles traveling to the U.S. Warsaw hopes for a waiver of the U.S. visa requirement for Poles traveling to the United States for three months or less. The U.S. government believes that granting this waiver could lead to an increase in illegal immigration. Polish leaders argue that the country no longer faces the same incentives for emigration as in the past. Discussions on this issue have taken place between Polish and U.S. officials. In the latest Bush/Kwasniewski meeting, a \"roadmap\" was agreed upon to resolve the visa waiver issue with Poland. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to add Poland to the visa waiver program, but some members oppose it due to security concerns. Poland's political scene has seen turnover due to scandals and sleaze in recent years. The current government in Poland is facing scandals and sleaze, leading many to believe its days are numbered. In the 2001 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) took power from the center-right parties. They formed a coalition with other parties to hold a majority in parliament, with the Civic Platform (PO) as the main opposition. The League of Polish Families (LPR), an ultra-conservative party aligned with the Catholic church, failed to pass the parliamentary threshold. Poland faced high-profile scandals, leading to defections from the SLD party and Miller's resignation. Despite economic growth and EU entry, the SLD's tainted reputation and Iraq involvement may cost them support in the next elections, favoring center-right parties like PO and PiS. In September 2005, elections are scheduled in Poland where the PO and PiS parties may need the support of LPR to form a government. The Polish economy has seen rapid development with the private sector dominating economic activity. Aleksander Kwasniewski of the SLD won a second term as President in 2000 but cannot run again in the upcoming elections in October 2005 due to term limits. Poland's economy experienced growth in 2003 and 2004, with GDP reaching 5.3% in 2004. Despite this, unemployment was high at 19.3% in April 2005. The economy's rebound was driven by increased export sales to EU countries. Germany was a significant trading partner. International organizations have given mixed reviews on Poland's economic reforms. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ranked Poland fourth-highest among former communist countries, praising price liberalization and business privatization but recommending improvements in investment climate, labor market reform, agricultural sector restructuring, and fiscal policy. Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index placed Poland 67th out of 145 countries and last among EU members. The OECD in Europe criticized Poland's labor market as the worst performing among its 30 rich-country members due to high payroll tax, minimum wage, and firing restrictions. Poland's ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index dropped to 60th out of 105 countries in 2004. Poland's agriculture sector, despite being inefficient, is crucial for the economy. It accounts for one-fifth of employment but only 3% of GDP. The country is the largest food producer among recent EU members, leading to concerns among farmers about competition with more efficient Western European producers. Populist leader Andrzej Lepper exploited these fears through various means, including illegal actions like destroying imported grain and blockading highways. After Poland joined the EU, agricultural exports and prices increased, farmers received subsidies, and the EU pledged to fund farm modernization. Economic benefits from EU membership have reduced support for anti-EU parties in rural Poland. Corruption is a prevalent issue in Poland, with some arguing that media exposure is revealing instances of graft. Instances of corruption in Poland are being revealed in detail today, rather than being hidden as in the past. Recent cases have been widely reported in newspapers and on national television. While some worry about the country's reputation for graft, Poland continues to attract foreign funding despite its poor showing in corruption surveys. Poland attracts foreign funding with a low corporate tax rate. Several U.S. firms have entered or expanded in the Polish market. Poland shifted its security orientation to the West after Communism, joining NATO in 1999. Defense modernization is a top priority, with a $3.5 billion contract for F-16 fighters signed in 2003. Poland is using U.S. Foreign Military Financing to purchase various equipment for its military, with a goal of having 60% of its military be professional by 2006. The assistance is seen as beneficial for the United States as funds are reinvested in U.S. industries. Poland is also focused on meeting its NATO obligations and has spent around 2.0% of GDP on defense between 1999 and 2002. The Iraq deployment is providing valuable experience for the Polish military, including commanding a multinational division.

Poland's foreign policy is focused on democracy in Ukraine, diplomacy with Belarus and Russia to the east, and initiatives to the west. Poland's foreign policy focuses on democracy in Ukraine, diplomacy with Belarus and Russia, and integration with pan-European institutions like the EU and NATO. Recent tensions with Belarus stem from criticism of their elections and authoritarian practices. Poland aims to establish a buffer zone between itself and Russia for security reasons. Poland's foreign policy towards Belarus emphasizes maintaining low-level ties and supporting civil society, while also addressing border security and the rights of the ethnic Polish minority. President Kwasniewski describes the approach as one of \"determination and delicacy.\" In Ukraine, Poland has long advocated for integration with the West to reduce Russian influence. Poland played a significant role in defusing Ukraine's 2004 political crisis and was involved in the recent presidential elections, where protests erupted due to concerns about the fairness of the vote. In 2004, Poland played a crucial role in defusing Ukraine's political crisis by mediating negotiations that led to a new election, resulting in the election of democratic reformer Viktor Yushchenko. Poland's involvement was instrumental in persuading the EU to assist Ukraine, despite initial opposition from some EU governments concerned about offending Moscow. Poland has attempted to normalize ties with Russia since the expulsion of Russian diplomats in 2000. Despite concerns over building ties with Ukraine and Belarus, Poland aims to act as a mediator between the West and Russia. Russia has shown resentment towards Poland's efforts, especially regarding coverage of incidents in Beslan and Chechnya. Poland seeks to balance economic and geopolitical interests in its relationship with Russia. Poland has tried to placate Russia for economic and geopolitical reasons, as Russia is its main supplier of oil and gas. President Kwasniewski criticized Russia's intervention in Ukrainian elections, causing tension with Russian President Putin.

Poland has reaped economic benefits from EU membership and actively participates in EU affairs. It supports EU security policy while emphasizing the importance of NATO. Poland also joined the European military police force for international deployment. Poland, along with Italy and other Roman Catholic countries, pushed for EU recognition of Europe's Christian heritage in the constitution preamble, but the proposal was rejected. Despite this, Poland supports Turkey's EU membership bid, citing it as proof that Western democratic values can be applied in Islamic countries. This stance is seen as a reflection of Poland's strong concern for religious values compared to its more secular European counterparts. Poland supports Turkey's EU membership bid to strengthen the transatlantic link and improve Ukraine's chances of joining. Poland opposes France's proposal to reduce EU funds for countries with low corporate tax rates, arguing against an EU-wide minimum corporate income tax. Poland has also had disagreements with Germany, France, and other EU members on various bilateral issues. Poland has had differences with Germany, France, and Spain on various EU and other matters. Polish-German relations were strained in 2004 over compensatory payments to expelled ethnic Germans.

Relations with the United States have been positive, but there is growing disillusionment with the Iraq mission and a sense of unreciprocated loyalty. The United States disappoints Poland by not rewarding their loyalty and sacrifices. Poland may become a leading nation in Europe with a phased troop withdrawal announced by the government. Analysts predict closer ties with the EU in the long term."
