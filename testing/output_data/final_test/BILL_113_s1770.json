    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Future of American Innovation and Research Act of 2013\" or the \"FAIR Act\". It includes definitions for various terms used within the Act. The \"Future of American Innovation and Research Act of 2013\" or the \"FAIR Act\" defines terms such as \"covered trade secret,\" \"improper means,\" and \"misappropriate.\" The \"FAIR Act\" defines improper means as acquiring or disclosing a trade secret without consent, using knowledge obtained through improper means, or breaching a duty to maintain secrecy. The \"FAIR Act\" defines a trade secret as any information that has independent economic value. It can include formulas, patterns, programs, devices, methods, techniques, or processes. The term \"person\" in this context refers to various legal or commercial entities. A trade secret has independent economic value and requires efforts to maintain secrecy. SEC. 3. CIVIL ACTION. The owner of a covered trade secret can sue for misappropriation outside the US, with federal courts having exclusive jurisdiction. Civil actions can also arise from conduct outside the US if it causes injury within the US. The covered trade secret owner can sue for misappropriation within the US if it causes injury to a US person. SEC. 4. REMEDIES. In a civil action under this Act, a court may issue injunctive relief, require actions to protect a trade secret, and order payment of a reasonable royalty for ongoing use. Damages for actual loss caused by misappropriation can also be awarded. The court may award damages for misappropriation of a covered trade secret, including damages for unjust enrichment. Punitive damages may be awarded if the misappropriation is willful or malicious, not exceeding twice the damages awarded for actual loss. Additionally, if a claim is made in bad faith or a trade secret is willfully misappropriated, the prevailing party may be awarded reasonable costs and attorney's fees. SEC. 5. PROCEDURE. (a) Pleadings in a civil action under this Act require a sworn statement by the plaintiff regarding the conduct in question and allow for an affirmative defense that the trade secrets were easily accessible to others. (b) When considering a motion to dismiss based on forum non conveniens in a civil action under this Act, the court must prioritize the plaintiff's chosen forum. In a civil action under this Act, the court may give weight to the plaintiff's choice of forum and consider if fair treatment is possible in the defendant's jurisdiction. The court can issue an anti-suit injunction to prevent the defendant from filing litigation in another jurisdiction if the parties are the same, the case outcome is crucial, and the other action threatens the court's jurisdiction or the Act's purposes. In a civil action under this Act, the court may enter orders to preserve trade secret confidentiality. A civil action must be filed within 3 years of discovering the conduct described in the Act. SEC. 6. SEIZURES. In a civil action under this Act, the court may issue a seizure order for property used to commit conduct described in section 3(a) and preserve evidence. The court can do so if the applicant provides adequate security and specific facts show the need for the seizure order. The court may issue an ex parte seizure order if specific facts demonstrate the necessity to stop the conduct described in section 3(a). The applicant must not have publicized the seizure request and is likely to prove misappropriation of a trade secret. Immediate and irreparable harm must be shown if seizure is not ordered, and the property to be seized must be located at the specified place. The court may issue an ex parte seizure order if necessary to stop conduct described in section 3(a). The applicant must show harm outweighs legitimate interests, and there is a risk of evidence destruction if notice is given. The seizure order directs service by a Federal law enforcement officer. The court may issue an ex parte seizure order carried out by a Federal law enforcement officer to seize items, place them in court custody, protect confidential information, and schedule a review hearing within 3 to 10 days. The court may issue a seizure order under seal, allowing access to the order and supporting documents after the seizure. A seizure hearing must be held on a set date unless good cause is shown for a different date, with the burden of proof on the party obtaining the seizure order. The party obtaining the seizure order must prove that the grounds for the order are still valid. If they fail to do so, the court will dissolve or modify the order. The court can adjust discovery time limits to ensure the hearing's purpose is not frustrated. An injured party can bring a civil action against the applicant for the seizure order if they prevail in the civil action. In a civil action against the applicant for a seizure order in a US district court, the prevailing party can recover reasonable costs, attorney's fees, lost profits, and punitive damages if the seizure order was sought in bad faith."
