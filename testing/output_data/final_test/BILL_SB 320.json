    "title": "SB 320",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 49013 of the Education Code is amended to allow complaints of noncompliance to be filed anonymously with the school principal. If unsatisfied with the school's decision, the complainant can appeal to the department and receive a written decision within 60 days. If a public school upholds a complaint, they must provide a remedy to affected individuals, including reimbursement if applicable. Information on these requirements must be included in the annual notification distributed to relevant parties as per regulations. Public schools must establish local policies by March 1, 2013, to implement the provisions of this section. The Superintendent has the authority to ensure timely resolution of complaints with merit. If an appeal is found to have merit, the department will specify corrective actions for the public school to remedy the issue. If the public school did not address a complaint issue, they must respond within 10 days, and the department will make findings on the appeal without further consideration. If new evidence related to the underlying complaint is submitted on appeal, the department will assess the appeal's merit regardless. If the appeal is deemed meritorious, the department will resolve the complaint; if not, it will send the complaint and new evidence back to the school for review. If new issues are raised on appeal, they will be sent back to the school as new complaints, while the rest of the appeal will be resolved by the department. A public school must provide evidence of compliance with corrective actions within 60 days of the department's decision. If not, the school officials must explain the failure at the next governing board meeting. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be provided according to the Government Code."
