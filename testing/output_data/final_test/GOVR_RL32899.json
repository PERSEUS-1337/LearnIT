    "content": "In the 109th Congress, housing issues were prominent, including the annual budget process and Hurricane Katrina's effects. Legislation addressed creating a stronger regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, revising the FHA loan insurance program, and replacing the Section 8 voucher program with a block grant. Congress had not yet enacted an FY2007 spending bill for HUD, with the President's budget request including reductions for some programs like CDBG and increases for others like the Section 8 voucher program. In the 109th Congress, housing issues were prominent, including the annual budget process and Hurricane Katrina's effects. The House of Representatives passed its version of the funding bill (H.R. 5576) on June 14, 2006, and the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version to the full Senate on July 26, 2006. Both versions of H.R. 5576 restored some of the proposed reductions in the President's budget, including funds for the CDBG program, the Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program, and the Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program. Congress enacted three continuing resolutions providing funding for HUD, with the third expiring on February 15, 2007. In the 109th Congress, funds were allocated to HUD for hurricane recovery and reconstruction. The President aimed to reduce the federal budget deficit by increasing revenues and cutting spending. Congress kept discretionary spending growth below the rate of inflation in FY2006 and FY2007. HUD's budget faced funding reductions in the 109th Congress, with the President requesting cuts to several programs in his FY2006 budget. In his FY2006 budget, the President requested cuts for programs like Housing for the Elderly and Disabled, CDBG, HOPE VI, and Brownfields redevelopment. Congress did not enact most cuts. In FY2007, the President again sought cuts for HUD programs, criticizing them as ineffective. The Section 8 voucher program requires increased funding due to rising housing costs, straining HUD's budget. Since HUD's budget is limited, any increases in funding for the voucher program come at the expense of other programs. The Federal Housing Administration's insurance program contributes to the HUD budget, but declining market share has led to a decrease in excess fees. This has forced the President and Congress to find additional funding to maintain the overall budget level. Congress faces pressure to reduce funding for HUD programs, but also to address the perceived shortage of affordable housing. The U.S. Housing Act of 1949 aimed to provide affordable housing for every American family, but challenges remain. The Millennial Housing Commission highlighted affordability as a major issue, with a growing number of households spending over 30% of their income on housing. Owners and renters face different challenges in the housing market. The U.S. housing market saw record prices in 2005, with home equity reaching $11.2 trillion. Rising housing prices boosted consumer spending, but homeownership rates slightly decreased. Minority homeownership increased from 43.7% to 53.1% between 1995 and 2005, while white homeownership rose from 70.9% to 75.8%. Concerns about the housing market's health and sustainability of homeownership gains are growing. The sustainability of recent homeownership gains is a growing concern amidst speculation about a housing \"bubble\". Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed concerns about unsustainable home prices in certain markets. Factors such as future interest rate increases, economic health, and job growth will influence housing price appreciation. The proliferation of risky mortgage products in hot markets has made homeownership more affordable but could lead to market corrections if speculators fear the end of the boom. Loans for high-priced homes have become more accessible, including options like interest-only loans and adjustable rate mortgages. Relaxed credit standards and subprime loans have expanded the pool of first-time homebuyers, but repayment risks exist if interest rates rise or if the economy falters. Low- and moderate-income families could be at risk of default if they become unemployed. A growing number of low- and moderate-income homeowners are severely burdened by housing costs, with over 8.4 million renter households paying more than 50% of their income towards housing in 2004. Low-income renters face the greatest burdens, limiting their ability to meet other needs or save. The affordability problem is attributed to a dwindling supply of low-cost rental units. The Center for Housing Studies report identifies land use regulations and growth of low-wage jobs as key factors contributing to the affordability problem. Solving the issue will require collaboration between government, business, and nonprofit organizations. The federal government's role in addressing \"worst-case housing needs\" is being questioned due to deficits and pressure to cut domestic spending. After the 2005 hurricanes, focus shifted to recovery and rebuilding of flood-damaged areas, with over 1.2 million housing units damaged, including 305,000 seriously damaged owner-occupied homes. After the 2005 hurricanes, over 1.2 million housing units were damaged, with 63% being owner-occupied homes. Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, was the hardest hit, with 67% of seriously damaged units located there. Rebuilding efforts were slow, with FEMA releasing flood maps in April 2006 and the Army Corps of Engineers demolishing 185 housing units in Orleans Parish by August 2006. The pace of rebuilding was hindered by uncertainty at various levels of government. The rebuilding of New Orleans post-2005 hurricanes is a topic of debate at local, state, and federal levels. The balance between public and private sector involvement in housing reconstruction is being discussed. Congress has approved over $16 billion in funds for rebuilding efforts, including Community Development Block Grants. Various proposals, such as creating an entity to buy out owners of damaged properties, have been suggested but not enacted yet. The President signed P.L. 109-234, providing $5.2 billion in CDBG assistance for Gulf Coast recovery efforts after the 2005 hurricanes. States were encouraged to focus on infrastructure reconstruction and affordable rental housing redevelopment. The law allocated $5.2 billion in CDBG funds for Gulf Coast recovery after the 2005 hurricanes. It prioritized infrastructure reconstruction and affordable rental housing redevelopment, with specific provisions on fund usage, administrative expenses, waivers, and program administration. The $5.2 billion allocated for CDBG disaster recovery activities includes provisions to decrease income targeting requirements, require state plans for fund use approval by HUD, prioritize infrastructure and affordable housing, mandate quarterly reports on fund usage, prevent fraud and abuse, and prohibit using CDBG funds for matching other federal programs. HUD allocated $5.2 billion for CDBG disaster recovery activities, with funds distributed to Louisiana and other states based on unmet need and data analysis. Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas received funds based on their recovery needs. Prior to P.L. 109-234, Congress approved $11.5 billion in supplemental CDBG disaster-recovery assistance for states impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The funds were designated for disaster relief, long-term recovery, and infrastructure restoration in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. States could use up to 5% for administrative costs and receive waivers for certain program requirements. Mississippi and Louisiana were allowed to allocate up to $20 million for local support organizations. The act allocated $11.5 billion in CDBG disaster-recovery assistance for states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. States could designate entities to administer funds, with lowered income targeting requirements and a cap on assistance. HUD was tasked with allocating funds among the five states. HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson allocated $11.5 billion among five states for CDBG supplemental assistance based on data from FEMA, Small Business Administration, NOAA, and U.S. Geological Survey. Funds were distributed based on unmet housing needs and concentrated distress in affected areas. HUD allocated $11.5 billion in CDBG disaster recovery assistance to states based on unmet housing needs and concentrated distress. The funds were intended for areas of concentrated distress, allowing flexibility for long-term recovery and infrastructure restoration. The Louisiana Recovery Corporation was proposed in bills introduced in the House and Senate to coordinate economic stabilization and redevelopment in areas of Louisiana affected by Hurricane Katrina and Rita. The corporation would have followed local redevelopment plans and used financial incentives to acquire property, without the power of eminent domain. Neither bill received a floor vote. The proposed Louisiana Recovery Corporation aimed to purchase homeowners' equity and pay mortgage lenders up to 60% of the pre-hurricane balance. Owners with mortgages would benefit more than those without, as mortgages would be forgiven in some cases. The corporation planned to build infrastructure and sell the property to developers, with original owners having the right of first refusal. Funding for the corporation was proposed through $100 million in start-up funds and a $30 billion government bond issue. The HUD program has faced criticism for cost increases without serving more families, accounting for a large portion of the total budget. Criticisms include lack of promoting self-sufficiency and high error rates in subsidy calculations. Initiatives have been introduced to change funding methods, shifting from unit-based to budget-based programs. Prior to FY2003, PHAs distributed vouchers reimbursed by HUD based on actual costs. In FY2005, funding was based on voucher usage and costs from May to July 2004, leading to some PHAs receiving insufficient funds. Program adjustments were made to reduce costs within federal regulations. FY2006 appropriations law continued funding based on FY2005 levels plus inflation. The President's budget requested Congress to use the same formula for FY2007 funding as in FY2005, adjusted for inflation. A new housing subsidy program was proposed to replace the existing Section 8 voucher program, with bills introduced in Congress in 2005. The Flexible Voucher Program proposal from the 108th Congress aimed to replace the Section 8 voucher program, expand eligibility to higher-income families, and give PHAs the option to set time limits or increase tenant contributions. Two additional titles were included in the bills, one modifying eligibility and rent rules for public housing, and another extending and expanding the Moving to Work Demonstration program. No action was taken on the bills before the end of the 109th Congress. On June 14, 2006, the House Financial Services Committee approved the bipartisan Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2006. The Section 8 Voucher Reform Act of 2006 aimed to improve the efficiency and administration of the Section 8 voucher program. It included changes to tenant income calculations, housing quality reviews, and funding allocation methods. The bill also proposed a small expansion of the Moving To Work demonstration. However, it did not progress further in the 109th Congress. HUD will implement a new formula for distributing public housing operating funds to housing authorities in January 2007. This change will impact how PHAs receive funding, potentially leading to significant increases or decreases. Operating funds cover the gap between tenant rent payments and housing costs, based on allowable expenses set by HUD. PHAs calculate budgets by totaling expenses for all units and subtracting rent revenue. Congress typically appropriates less than the full amount, so HUD applies prorations to agency budgets. The new funding formula for FY2007, established by HUD, adopts new allowable expense levels and requires PHAs to transition to asset-based management by FY2011. Agencies may qualify for higher budgets or face reductions based on the new formula. The President requested $3.5 billion for operating funds in FY2007, which could result in an 85% proration according to HUD estimates. The requested FY2007 funding level could lead to an 85% proration, but PHA advocacy groups argue it would be closer to 80%. The 109th Congress adjourned without finalizing the funding level for the Public Housing Operating Fund. The HOPE VI program offers grants for public housing revitalization, facing criticism for slow spending and displacing families. HUD proposed no new funding for HOPE VI in FY2004-2007, but Congress continued funding at lower levels. Authorization for the program was set to expire in FY2006, but a bill was introduced to reauthorize it through FY2011. The HOPE VI program was reauthorized through a continuing resolution, extending it for the duration of the CR. Another bill to reauthorize the program for five years was introduced but not enacted. The Section 202 Housing for the Elderly program provides capital grants and project rental assistance to non-profit developers. The Section 202 program primarily provides capital grants and project rental assistance to private non-profit developers for housing elderly households. Funds are also allocated for service coordinators and assisted living conversion. In FY2006, $735 million was appropriated for elderly housing programs, with $51 million for service coordinators and $24.5 million for assisted living conversion. The President proposed to fund the Section 202 program at $546 million for FY2007, a reduction of almost 26% from the previous year. The President's FY2007 budget requested a reduction in funding for the Section 202 program, with the House and Senate Appropriations Committees proposing different amounts. Currently, Section 202 is funded at the FY2006 level under a continuing resolution. The Section 811 Housing for the Disabled program provides capital grants and project rental assistance for accessible housing for low-income persons with disabilities. The President's budget proposed significant funding cuts for the program in FY2007. The FY2007 budget request allocated funds for voucher renewals, new vouchers, PRAC renewals, and new PRAC. The Section 811 program was recommended to be funded at $240 million by both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee. Homeless Assistance Grants fund various homeless assistance programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. The President's FY2007 budget request proposed consolidating the three competitive components of the Homeless Assistance Grants account into one program. Senator Jack Reed introduced a bill to reauthorize the McKinney-Vento Act, which would consolidate the grants into one program and make funds available for permanent housing for non-disabled homeless families. Representative Rick Renzi also proposed reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento Act. Rick Renzi proposed reauthorizing the McKinney-Vento Act on March 29, 2006, to consolidate competitive grants. H.R. 5041 aimed to allocate at least 30% of funds for permanent housing for disabled individuals or families. The Bush Administration set a goal in 2002 to end chronic homelessness within 10 years, focusing on single adults with mental health or substance abuse issues. The plan included increasing permanent supportive housing units annually, with a proposed $200 million Samaritan Initiative in FY2004. The Administration proposed a $200 million Samaritan Initiative for FY2004 to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. Legislation for this initiative was introduced but not enacted. In FY2006, Congress funded homeless assistance grants at $1.3 billion, with a slight increase from the previous year. For FY2007, the President requested over $1.5 billion, including $200 million for the Samaritan Initiative. Both the House and Senate recommended funding homeless assistance grants at over $1.5 billion in the HUD funding bill, without separate funds for the Samaritan Initiative. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac support the secondary mortgage market by purchasing mortgages from lenders, freeing up funds for more mortgages. They sell bonds to finance their portfolios and improve mortgage lending efficiency. The secondary market has lowered interest rates for homeowners. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, benefit from lower interest rates due to ties to the federal government. Regulation is split between HUD and OFHEO, the safety and soundness regulator. Recent accounting problems have involved the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. On May 23, 2006, Fannie Mae signed a consent order with OFHEO to limit its mortgage portfolio to $727 billion. Fannie Mae filed its annual report late in December 2006. HUD monitors affordable housing lending goals at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Federal Home Loan Bank System consists of 12 regional banks that serve as lenders for home mortgages. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, consisting of 12 regional banks, has evolved to include more commercial banks and various financial institutions. The System now provides lending for housing, agriculture, and small businesses, with special programs for low- and moderate-income housing and community development. The Federal Housing Finance Board regulates the System for mission and safety purposes. Two bills were introduced in Congress to strengthen oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the banks. The Senate bill (S. 190) aimed to give the new regulator greater powers than the House bill (H.R. 1461) in overseeing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and banks. H.R. 1461 included provisions for an Affordable Housing Fund and raised the conforming loan limit for mortgages in high-cost areas. The conforming loan limit for one-unit properties in 2006 was $417,000. The House passed H.R. 1461 on October 26, 2005, while the Senate did not vote on it. The Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee ordered S. 190 reported to the Senate on July 28, 2005, but the full Senate did not consider it. For more information on the bills, refer to CRS Report RL32795. The FHA administers mortgage insurance programs that insure lenders against loan defaults, enabling borrowers to obtain loans for various purposes. The programs are administered through two accounts - the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance fund account and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance fund account. The MMI/CMHI fund provides insurance for home mortgages, while the GI/SRI fund covers riskier mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans like hospitals and nursing homes. The FY2007 HUD budget proposed reforms to make FHA more flexible and offer lower-cost alternatives to subprime mortgages. H.R. 5121 included many of these reform proposals, aiming to limit FHA-insured home loans based on area median prices. The bill aimed to raise FHA loan limits for low-cost areas and allow for 100% mortgages with HUD determining down payment requirements based on borrower default risk. The borrower's mortgage insurance premium would be based on their risk to the insurance fund. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not include these provisions in H.R. 5576, citing concerns about financial risk, fraud, and abuse. The Committee expressed concerns that the proposals could push FHA towards becoming the lender of last resort. Congress did not pass H.R. 5121 or H.R. 5576 by the end of the 109th Congress. Lenders have improved risk estimation for mortgage loans since the 1990s, leading to the issuance of subprime loans to borrowers with higher risks. Issues arise when lenders target vulnerable populations like low-income elderly and minority homeowners who may not fully understand complex financial products. The Home Owner Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) and state laws aim to prevent predatory lending practices by lenders who take advantage of borrowers. Calls for a uniform federal statute have been made to address varying requirements among state and local statutes. The 109th Congress addressed predatory lending issues in various bills, including provisions for counseling and financial literacy programs, restrictions on high-cost mortgages, and amendments to banking laws. However, none of these bills were enacted. Some argue that state and local laws restricting predatory lending may limit access to credit for certain individuals. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) was enacted in 1974 to improve the settlement process for residential real estate by providing advance disclosure of costs, eliminating kickbacks, reducing escrow amounts, and modernizing record-keeping. RESPA, administered by HUD through Regulation X, requires lenders to provide consumers with estimates of settlement costs. However, lenders are not required to deliver settlement costs in the amounts stated in the estimates, leading to unexpected fees at closing. Consumers often find the real estate settlement process confusing, and lenders find it cumbersome. Despite proposed changes in Regulation X since 1995, Congress has not prioritized reforming RESPA, but HUD has sought to reform the rules under the existing law. Several changes in Regulation X have been proposed since 1995, but none have resulted in a final rule. The most recent proposal, titled \"Simplifying and Improving the Process of Obtaining Mortgages to Reduce Settlement Costs to Consumers,\" was withdrawn in March 2004 after facing opposition. HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson pledged to work with Congress, consumer groups, and the housing industry to reach a consensus on RESPA reform during the Mortgage Bankers Association annual policy conference in April 2005. The Department will take the necessary time to develop a meaningful RESPA reform proposal, which will be introduced as a proposed rule for comments. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) was created in 1986 to incentivize affordable housing development. Developers apply for LIHTC allocations from state housing finance authorities to raise capital for projects. The tax credits reduce financing costs, allowing for potentially lower rents. In 2005, the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act (P.L. 109-135) provided tax relief to areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. LIHTC authority was increased for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, with two allocations of tax credits. The first allocation is a nationwide statutory amount per capita, while the second allocation is temporary and based on the state's population in the GO Zone. The Gulf Opportunity Zone Act provided tax relief to areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita. LIHTC authority was increased for Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, with two allocations of tax credits. The second allocation yielded annual amounts for each state for 2006, 2007, and 2008. Additionally, legislation proposed increases in LIHTC authority nationwide. The Community Restoration and Revitalization Act of 2005 proposed changes to the tax credit to target low-income communities. The Administration's budget request in FY2007 aimed to eliminate federal economic and community development programs by consolidating them into the \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative\" (SACI). This initiative would combine activities from 18 existing programs across five federal agencies. The Administration's FY2006 proposal aimed to transfer 18 economic and community development programs to the Department of Commerce under the SACI initiative. This would have reduced funding from $5.6 billion to $3.7 billion, with a core program and bonus program for communities showing improvement. However, Congress rejected the proposal and funded all programs at $5.3 billion. The Administration did not submit a legislative proposal during the 1st session of the 109th Congress. After facing opposition, an advisory group was established within the Department of Commerce to develop a legislative proposal for the revamped SACI initiative in the FY2007 budget. The proposal included funding for HUD's Community Development Block Grant program and a new Regional Development Account within the Economic Development Administration. The proposed funding level for SACI was $3.4 billion, $2 billion less than the previous year. The House version of the HUD spending bill would have appropriated $4.2 billion for the Community Development Fund, including various assistance programs. The House version of H.R. 5576 included $250 million for Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grants and $20 million for Neighborhood Initiative (NI) grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee also provided funding for CDF, CDBG, Indian CDBG assistance, EDI, and NI. The House version required a 40% match of local funds for EDI and NI earmarked projects. The Administration's FY2007 budget proposed a new SACI initiative with common goals and performance measures for federal community and economic development programs. The Administration proposed a new Regional Development Account (RDA) in EDA funded at $257 million to replace current budget categories. HUD unveiled a legislative proposal to reform the CDBG, eliminating the dual formula and changing the appropriations split. The new allocation formula would consider factors like the number of households living in poverty. The proposed formula for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) heavily weights factors like poverty, overcrowded housing, and per capita income. 50% of funds are allocated based on the poverty factor, with a minimum grant threshold for communities. A $200 million challenge grant program is also included to assist areas of concentrated need. The House Appropriations Committee report criticized the Administration's proposal. The Administration has consistently proposed zero funding for the Rural Housing and Economic Development program (RHED) in recent years, arguing that rural housing needs can be met through programs administered by the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the USDA. Despite these proposals, Congress has continued to fund RHED. For FY2006, the Administration suggested consolidating RHED into a new program within the Department of Commerce, but Congress rejected this and allocated $17 million for RHED. In FY2007, the Administration once again proposed zero funding for RHED. For FY2007, the Administration proposed zero funding for the Rural Housing and Economic Development program (RHED). The House and Senate had differing funding proposals for RHED, with the Senate Appropriations Committee providing $20 million. Rural housing advocates are concerned about preserving affordable rental housing, especially in regards to Section 515 loans. The FY2006 Department of Agriculture Appropriations Act included $9 million for a preservation demonstration program. The FY2006 Department of Agriculture Appropriations Act included $9 million for a preservation demonstration program for Section 515 housing. The President's Budget did not provide funding for the program in FY2007, proposing to transfer remaining balances to the multifamily housing rural voucher program. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committee agreed to transfer funds from the demonstration program to the voucher program. Additionally, a proposed rule by USDA on March 6, 2006, required first-time homebuyers to complete a homeowner education course. The Section 502 program is a means-tested program with higher delinquency rates compared to VA or FHA housing finance programs. The proposal aims to help borrowers become successful homeowners and reduce delinquency rates. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL33421, USDA Rural Housing Programs: An Overview.
