    "content": "The federal government has exclusive power over alien entry and removal, but the impact of alien migration is felt most directly in communities. State and local responses to unlawfully present aliens vary, especially in the role of police in enforcing federal immigration law. Some jurisdictions actively assist federal immigration authorities, while others seek a greater role in immigration enforcement due to perceived shortcomings in federal efforts. In response to federal immigration enforcement, some states and localities have adopted measures to sanction activities aiding unlawfully present aliens. However, after the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States, many of these measures were struck down. On the other hand, some jurisdictions, known as \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" are less willing to assist the federal government with immigration enforcement. Some states and localities limit their involvement in enforcing federal immigration laws, known as \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" There is debate over the meaning and application of this term, with varied reasons for non-cooperation, including concerns about civil liability and resource availability. President Trump issued an executive order on enhancing public safety in immigration enforcement. The report discusses legal issues related to state and local measures limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. It explains the term \"sanctuary jurisdiction,\" constitutional principles, and various laws and policies adopted by states and localities to restrict participation in federal immigration efforts. State or local measures limiting police participation in immigration enforcement have a long history, dating back to church activities in the 1980s providing sanctuary to unauthorized Central American aliens. Some states and municipalities have enacted measures to limit police involvement in federal immigration enforcement activities. This has led to lawsuits challenging executive orders targeting sanctuary jurisdictions and actions to implement them. Sanctuary jurisdictions limit involvement in federal immigration enforcement activities, but there is no official definition of a \"sanctuary\" jurisdiction in federal law. Some jurisdictions self-identify as sanctuaries, while others may disagree with this designation, especially if they cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The debate over sanctuary jurisdictions revolves around the extent to which states can refuse to assist in federal immigration enforcement. The federal government's power to regulate immigration is significant, and the issue raises questions about the Supremacy Clause and federalism principles. The federal government's power to regulate immigration is substantial and exclusive, derived from various sources including Congress's Article I powers and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Arizona v. United States affirmed the federal government's role in creating and enforcing immigration laws. The Supreme Court ruling invalidated several Arizona laws related to immigration as preempted by federal law, emphasizing the federal government's broad power over immigration. Preemption is based on the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, allowing Congress to invalidate state laws through legislation. Preemption can be implied when Congress intends federal government to govern exclusively, either through field preemption or conflict preemption. The Supremacy Clause allows federal authority to preempt state laws, even in areas traditionally reserved to the states. Congressional intent is crucial in analyzing the relationship between federal statutes and state measures. The \"police power\" allows states to regulate public health, safety, and economic activity within their jurisdiction, including measures related to aliens. The Supreme Court has emphasized that not every state law dealing with aliens is automatically preempted by federal immigration authority. In Arizona v. United States, the Court stated that state police powers are not superseded unless Congress clearly intended to do so. For example, in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, the Court upheld an Arizona law related to states' powers. In United States v. Whiting, the Supreme Court upheld an Arizona law allowing the revocation of licenses for state employers who knowingly hire unauthorized aliens. This decision was based on the state's authority to regulate employment relationships to protect workers. The Court found that the law did not conflict with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as it fell within the state's licensing regime and was not preempted. The federal government's power to preempt state immigration laws is extensive but not absolute due to the system of dual sovereignty between the federal government and states. The anti-commandeering doctrine stems from the system of dual sovereignty between the federal government and states, preventing Congress from directly compelling states to enforce federal regulations. Supreme Court rulings, such as New York v. United States, define the boundaries of this doctrine. The Supreme Court ruled that a federal law offering states a choice regarding radioactive waste disposal was unconstitutional as it crossed the line between encouragement and coercion, violating the federal structure established by the Constitution. This decision was based on the anti-commandeering doctrine, which prevents Congress from directly compelling states to enforce federal regulations. The Supreme Court, in Printz v. United States, found that certain provisions of the Brady Act violated the anti-commandeering doctrine by requiring state and local law enforcement to conduct background checks on handgun purchasers. This decision reinforced the principle that the federal government cannot compel states to administer federal regulatory programs. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot force states to enforce federal regulatory schemes by conscripting state officers directly, as seen in Printz v. United States. While some federal statutes require states to report certain information to federal agencies, not all requirements violate anti-commandeering principles. The Court distinguished reporting requirements from cases involving state participation in federal programs, as in Reno v. Condon. The Supreme Court rejected an anti-commandeering challenge to the Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), which prohibits states from sharing a driver's personal information without consent. The Court distinguished the DPPA from previous cases and clarified that it is a generally applicable law. The Supreme Court clarified the anti-commandeering doctrine in its 2018 ruling, Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, involving a challenge to the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). New Jersey repealed state laws prohibiting sports gambling, leading to a lawsuit by sports leagues invoking PASPA's civil-suit provision. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the leagues, rejecting New Jersey's argument of unlawful commandeering. The Supreme Court ruled in Murphy v. NCAA that PASPA's anti-authorization provision violated the anti-commandeering doctrine. The Court emphasized that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures, regardless of whether it prohibits or compels state actions. The Supreme Court in Murphy v. NCAA ruled that PASPA's anti-authorization provision violated the anti-commandeering doctrine. The Court rejected the argument that PASPA validly preempts state and local gambling laws, stating that every form of preemption is based on federal law regulating private actors, not states. PASPA does not impose federal restrictions on private actors, so it can only be seen as regulating state actors, not a valid preemption provision. Congress can enact legislation for the \"general welfare\" through its spending power, including placing conditions on funds distributed to states. However, financial conditions cannot be so coercive as to compel states to act. For example, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the ACA that withheld Medicaid funding from states not expanding their programs. The ACA placed conditions on states' Medicaid funding, deemed coercive by the Supreme Court. States have implemented various measures to limit participation in federal immigration enforcement, such as restricting police cooperation and information sharing. Some state and local restrictions on law enforcement in immigration enforcement relate to violations of federal immigration law, which can be criminal or civil. Removal proceedings are civil, but certain conduct may also lead to criminal prosecution. Unauthorized immigration status can make an alien removable, but unlawful presence alone is not a criminal offense. Some jurisdictions restrict police from arresting individuals for violations of federal immigration law, including unlawful presence. Other restrictions prohibit police from assisting federal immigration authorities with investigations or arrests. Local restrictions on police authority to arrest individuals for federal immigration law violations do not pose significant legal issues. While the INA allows state and local law enforcement to participate in immigration enforcement activities, there is no obligation for their involvement. States and localities are generally preempted from making arrests for civil violations of the INA without specific federal authorization or instruction. Sanctuary-type policies often limit police inquiries into immigration status, with some only allowing questions as part of a criminal investigation. Restricting police authority to question individuals about their immigration status helps prevent sharing information with federal immigration authorities. Federal laws prohibit state or local restrictions on sharing immigration status information, but do not require police to collect such information. Murphy has raised concerns about this issue. Some states and localities restrict government agencies from sharing information with federal immigration authorities, including notifying them about the release status of incarcerated aliens unless convicted of certain felonies. Employees are also prohibited from disclosing immigration status unless suspected of illegal activity separate from unlawful immigration status. The Department of Justice has interpreted these provisions as conflicting with federal information-sharing laws. In 1996, Congress enacted laws to counter sanctuary policies by ending state and local restrictions on information sharing. President issued Executive Order 13768 to encourage cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and discourage sanctuary policies hindering federal enforcement. In 1996, Congress passed laws to eliminate state and local barriers to sharing immigration-related information with federal authorities. These laws do not mandate sharing but prohibit restrictions on communication between state or local entities and federal immigration authorities. The provisions in IIRIRA \u00a7 642, codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, prevent any limitations on sending or receiving information on citizenship or immigration status to or from federal immigration authorities. New York City challenged the constitutionality of Sections 1373 and 1644, which restrict information-sharing with federal immigration authorities. The city alleged that these provisions violated the Tenth Amendment by limiting states and localities from controlling cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The City of New York challenged the constitutionality of provisions in PRWORA and IIRIRA that restrict information-sharing with federal immigration authorities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the judgment, stating that these provisions do not directly compel state authorities but prohibit restrictions on the voluntary exchange of immigration information between federal and state authorities. The court emphasized the importance of cooperative interaction between states and federal authorities in the American system of dual sovereignty. The Second Circuit affirmed that the Tenth Amendment does not give states the unrestricted right to block voluntary cooperation with federal programs. New York City's challenge to information-sharing provisions in PRWORA and IIRIRA was rejected, with the court ruling that they did not violate federalism principles. The Supreme Court later upheld this decision in Reno, stating that the DPPA did not infringe on Tenth Amendment principles. President Trump's executive order targeted jurisdictions that do not comply with Section 1373, sparking new litigation challenging its constitutionality. Executive Order 13768 aims to encourage state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and threatens to withhold federal grant money from sanctuary jurisdictions. The Department of Justice later provided interpretive guidance on the definition of \"sanctuary jurisdiction.\" The Department of Justice defined \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" as a jurisdiction that refuses to comply with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373. This section discusses recent litigation regarding challenges to the implementation of state or local \"sanctuary\" policies under Executive Order 13768. It covers ongoing lawsuits challenging the executive order and the Justice Department's new grant eligibility conditions for programs like Byrne JAG and COPS. The discussion covers recent litigation related to challenges against state or local \"sanctuary\" policies under Executive Order 13768, which aims to encourage cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. It also mentions lawsuits filed by the United States against California for obstructing immigration enforcement efforts. The President's executive order instructs the Attorney General and DHS Secretary to enforce compliance with 8 U.S.C. 1373, denying Federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions. The DHS Secretary can designate sanctuary jurisdictions, and the Attorney General can take enforcement actions against entities hindering Federal law enforcement. Additionally, a weekly list of jurisdictions ignoring detainer requests for aliens must be published to inform the public. Attorney General Sessions issued a memorandum interpreting EO 13768, defining \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" as those that refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373. The executive order applies to grants administered by the DOJ or DHS, requiring jurisdictions to certify their compliance with federal law, including 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373, to receive awards. This certification applies to all existing grants from the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs and Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. The Attorney General issued a memorandum interpreting EO 13768, defining \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" as those that refuse to comply with federal law. This applies to grants administered by the DOJ or DHS, requiring jurisdictions to certify their compliance to receive awards. The DOJ may seek to tailor grants to promote lawful immigration. New conditions were announced for recipients of the Byrne JAG program. The press release announced three new conditions for Byrne JAG program grant recipients: 1. Compliance Condition - certifying compliance with Section 1373, 2. Access Condition - allowing DHS immigration enforcement personnel access to detention facilities, and 3. Notice Condition - notifying DHS when an alien is in state or local custody. ICE officers issue detainers for aliens in state or local custody believed to be removable for violating federal immigration law. Recipients of Byrne JAG grants must give DHS 48 hours' notice before releasing an alien wanted for removal. Compliance with these conditions was required for grant applications due on September 5, 2017. Additionally, applicants for COPS Office grants must certify compliance with Section 1373. The COPS Office grants are used for community policing initiatives, including training and developing innovative strategies. Priority consideration is given to applicants who cooperate with federal immigration authorities to address illegal immigration. Applicants can sign a form certifying their compliance with federal immigration access conditions to receive special consideration. The lawsuits challenging Section 9(a) of EO 13768 and its implementation came in two waves, with the first wave shortly after President Trump signed the executive order and the second wave after the DOJ announced new Byrne JAG and COPS conditions. Challengers raised concerns about the DOJ lacking statutory authority, imposing conditions arbitrarily, violating separation of powers, and government actions. The Counties filed lawsuits challenging Section 9(a) of EO 13768, arguing it violated separation of powers and anti-commandeering doctrine. The district court issued an injunction blocking nationwide enforcement, which was upheld by the Ninth Circuit for California but remanded for further review on a nationwide scale. The factual record was deemed insufficient for a nationwide injunction and the case was remanded for further factfinding. Two cases challenged new Byrne JAG and COPS conditions, with courts enjoining the conditions in Chicago and Philadelphia, citing exceeding statutory authority and arbitrary imposition. District courts in New York, California, and other states have enjoined the government from enforcing new conditions related to COPS grants, citing violations of the anti-commandeering doctrine and the Spending Clause. President Trump's EO 13768 faced legal challenges from cities like San Francisco and counties like Santa Clara, resulting in federal court injunctions. The County of Santa Clara, California, filed a lawsuit challenging Section 9(a) of an executive order, arguing it is unconstitutional in three ways: violating separation of powers, exceeding Spending Clause limits, and violating the anti-commandeering doctrine by coercing compliance with ICE-issued directives. The County of Santa Clara, California, challenged Section 9(a) of an executive order, contending it violates separation of powers, exceeds Spending Clause limits, and coerces compliance with ICE-issued directives. The district judge agreed and permanently enjoined Section 9(a) nationwide. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, stating that Section 9(a) violates separation of powers by usurping Congress's spending power. The injunction's nationwide application was vacated, and further factfinding was remanded to determine its scope. The Ninth Circuit court ruled that the executive branch cannot withdraw federal grant money from jurisdictions that disagree with the Administration's immigration strategies. Congress has the exclusive spending power, and the Administration overstepped by attempting to appropriate funds without authorization. Another California city, Richmond, unsuccessfully challenged Executive Order 13768 regarding sanctuary jurisdictions, arguing that the President exceeded his constitutional authority in allocating federal funds. The district court denied Richmond's request for injunctive relief, as it could not establish pre-enforcement standing to challenge the executive order based on the framework set forth in Babbitt v. Farm Workers National Union. The district court denied Richmond's request for injunctive relief based on the lack of pre-enforcement standing to challenge the executive order. The court concluded that Richmond had not demonstrated a \"well-founded fear\" of enforcement under the order, as it had not been asked to assist in enforcing immigration policy or identified as hindering ICE's efforts. The court denied Richmond's request for injunctive relief regarding cooperation with ICE. Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon challenged Trump's executive order, arguing it was unconstitutional. The district court stayed the case pending the Ninth Circuit's appeal decision on the injunction in the Santa Clara/San Francisco litigation. After the Ninth Circuit ruled Section 9(a) unconstitutional, the district judge... After the Ninth Circuit ruled Section 9(a) unconstitutional, the district judge in this case also found it violated the separation of powers. Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, challenged Section 9(a) after President Trump issued EO 13768. They argued it violated the Tenth Amendment and separation-of-power principles. The City of Chicago, Illinois, sued to enjoin the Attorney General from imposing new Byrne JAG conditions. Chicago sued the Attorney General to stop the imposition of new conditions for Byrne JAG grant eligibility, arguing that the DOJ lacked statutory authority to add substantive conditions. They contended that requiring compliance with Section 1373 was a new condition not covered by the Byrne JAG statute. Chicago argued that Section 1373 is not an \"applicable\" law as intended by the JAG statute, narrowing the phrase to a subset of laws that govern federal grantmaking. They also claimed that the notice and access conditions violated the Constitution's separation-of-power principles and exceeded constitutional spending authority. Chicago argued that the new conditions on Byrne JAG funds exceeded constitutional spending authority and violated the Fourth Amendment. They also claimed that Section 1373 violated the Tenth Amendment, leading to a preliminary injunction granted by the district court. The district court issued a nationwide, permanent injunction blocking the enforcement of all three Byrne JAG conditions, including Section 1373, deemed unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine. The court stayed the nationwide effect of the injunction pending appeal, in deference to the Seventh Circuit's earlier order. The court found that Section 1373, which prohibits state policymakers from restricting employees sharing immigration-status information with federal authorities, violates the anticommandeering doctrine. The court also ruled that the notice, access, and compliance conditions imposed by the Byrne JAG statute were unlawful. The court found Section 1373 unconstitutional due to the anticommandeering doctrine. The Byrne JAG statute's notice, access, and compliance conditions were deemed unlawful by the court, with no convincing arguments in support of greater statutory authority. The Seventh Circuit questioned the authority of the Assistant Attorney General to place special conditions on grants under the Byrne JAG program. The City of Evanston, Illinois and the United States Conference of Mayors filed a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief, challenging the government's actions. The district judge, who had presided over Chicago's lawsuit, relied on earlier opinions to conclude that the City and Conference were likely to succeed in their challenge against the government's imposition of Byrne JAG conditions. Consequently, the government was enjoined from enforcing the conditions against the plaintiffs, including the City of Philadelphia. Philadelphia, like Chicago, challenged the DOJ's authority to impose new Byrne JAG conditions, citing violations of separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the APA. The district court initially blocked enforcement of the conditions and later permanently enjoined the DOJ from enforcing them against Philadelphia, deeming the imposition arbitrary and capricious. The court found no explicit authority for the conditions in the Byrne JAG Statute. The court found the decision to impose new Byrne JAG conditions arbitrary and capricious, citing lack of justification and statutory authority. The Third Circuit affirmed the ruling, stating that the conditions were unlawful as they were imposed without proper authority. The government argued that the Attorney General could require grant applicants to report data and information he deems necessary, including alien release notifications. However, the court disagreed, stating that the JAG statute only allows for programmatic and financial information. The court also rejected the government's claim that the coordination provision allows access to aliens in custody. The court rejected the government's argument that the coordination provision allows access to aliens in custody in Philadelphia. The court concluded that the statutory language does not impose an ongoing requirement to coordinate and also rejected the government's view that compliance with Section 1373 is necessary for grant funding. The court rejected the government's attempt to impose conditions on grant funding based on compliance with U.S. Code laws, stating that the Attorney General lacked the authority to do so under Title 34. The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's order enjoining the notice, access, and compliance conditions imposed by the Attorney General on Philadelphia. California and San Francisco also sued the Justice Department to block the Byrne JAG conditions, arguing lack of statutory authority and violation of separation of powers. They contended that Section 1373 is constitutionally unenforceable against states. The district court declared the Byrne JAG conditions unconstitutional, citing violation of separation of powers. A nationwide injunction was issued, pending Ninth Circuit review. The court found the Justice Department lacked authority to impose notice and access conditions under the Byrne JAG statute. The court ruled that the Justice Department violated separation of powers by unlawfully exercising Congress's Spending Power. It also found that Section 1373 violates federalism principles by impacting states' law enforcement control. Multiple states and the City of New York sued the DOJ over this issue. The States and City sued the DOJ over new Byrne JAG conditions, arguing they violate separation of powers and the APA. A district judge in New York enjoined the DOJ from imposing the conditions, ruling they were imposed without statutory authority. The government's argument that 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) authorizes the conditions was rejected. The district court ruled that the Assistant Attorney General could not impose conditions under 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102(a)(6) as the Attorney General had no statutory authority to do so. Additionally, the court found that the term \"all other applicable Federal laws\" in 34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153(a)(5)(D) was ambiguous and violated the requirement for unambiguous conditions on federal grant money. The court concluded that the applicable federal laws are limited to those applicable grant, and the conditions imposed were deemed arbitrary and capricious agency action. The government failed to provide evidence of the negative impacts of withholding funds, leading to a lack of analysis on whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The district court found that Section 1373 is unconstitutional due to violating the anti-commandeering doctrine. It disagreed with the Second Circuit's earlier ruling in City of New York v. United States, stating that the distinction between affirmative commands and prohibitions is now considered \"empty\" after the Supreme Court's decision in Murphy. The district court ruled that Section 1373 is unconstitutional under the anti-commandeering doctrine and found that the Byrne JAG conditions violate the separation of powers. It stated that Congress did not delegate the authority to impose new conditions when delegating spending authority to the executive branch. Los Angeles separately challenged the new conditions for the Byrne JAG and COPS programs. Los Angeles challenged the DOJ's new COPS program considerations, citing lack of statutory authority and violation of the Spending Clause. The district court granted a permanent injunction, ruling that the DOJ exceeded its authority by considering cooperation with federal immigration enforcement in grant applications. The court found that the challenged COPS considerations on grant funding violated the Spending Clause, as compliance was required for applicants to compete fairly. The government's argument that these considerations were not subject to Spending Clause requirements was rejected, as it could potentially allow agencies to bypass such requirements by labeling them as \"plus factors.\" Since the COPS statute did not prioritize cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, the court concluded that Congress did not intend for it to be a factor for preferential treatment. The court found that the added considerations for grant funding violated the Spending Clause as they were not germane to the goals of the COPS program. The court emphasized that Congress, not the agency, must be clear in its directives. Additionally, the court concluded that the considerations were arbitrary and capricious, lacking evidence to support their relevance. The court found that the government violated the APA by adding new conditions without evidence or data to support them. The Byrne JAG notice and access conditions were blocked by a preliminary injunction, as the court determined that the Attorney General's authority does not include requiring assistance in immigration enforcement. The Justice Department has sued California over three laws related to immigration enforcement, alleging that they obstruct federal law and violate the Supremacy Clause. The laws in question are the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, Assembly Bill 450 (AB 450), Section 12 of Assembly Bill 103 (AB 103), and the California Values Act, Section 3 of Senate Bill 54 (SB 54). The federal government is challenging California's AB 450, AB 103, and SB 54 laws, arguing they violate the Supremacy Clause by impeding federal immigration enforcement. AB 450 restricts immigration officers from entering nonpublic areas of worksites. AB 450 restricts immigration enforcement officers from entering nonpublic areas of a worksite without a judicial warrant or as required by federal law. It also prohibits employers from allowing officers to access employee records without a subpoena or warrant, requires written notice of I-9 inspections within 72 hours, and limits reverification of employee eligibility to federal law requirements. Section 12 of AB 103 requires the California Attorney General to review and report on detention facilities housing aliens in immigration proceedings for the next 10 years. SB 54, the California Values Act, prohibits law enforcement agencies from using resources for immigration enforcement purposes. The California Values Act, also known as SB 54, prohibits law enforcement agencies in California from engaging in immigration enforcement activities, such as detaining individuals based on immigration status, providing personal information to immigration authorities, or participating in arrests based on civil immigration warrants. Additionally, the Act prohibits California law enforcement agencies from placing their officers under federal supervision or employing officers deputized for immigration enforcement purposes. The California Values Act, also known as SB 54, restricts law enforcement agencies in California from collaborating with immigration authorities without specific authorization. It also prohibits contracting with the federal government to house federal detainees in California law enforcement facilities. However, the Act allows enforcement of certain federal immigration violations, sharing criminal history information, and participating in joint law enforcement task force activities. On March 6, 2018, the United States sued California over three laws that restrict collaboration between state law enforcement and immigration authorities. The government argues that these laws violate the Supremacy Clause by obstructing federal immigration enforcement efforts. California law allows immigration authorities to interview individuals in custody and inquire about potential crime or trafficking victims eligible for certain visas. The United States sued California over laws restricting collaboration with federal immigration authorities. The district court ruled that parts of California's Immigrant Worker Protection Act violate the Supremacy Clause. The Ninth Circuit upheld most of the district court's rulings, finding one subsection of AB 103 unconstitutional. The district court found that California's AB 450 violates intergovernmental immunity. It concluded that the consent provision discriminates against those dealing with the Federal Government, and the reverification provision is likely preempted by IRCA. The court ruled that California's AB 450 notice provision does not violate the Supremacy Clause as it does not discriminate against the federal government or hinder federal inspections. The court opined that California's AB 450 notice provision does not hinder federal inspections or discriminate against the federal government. The Ninth Circuit also found that AB 450's notice requirement does not disrupt federal immigration authorities' activities in enforcing IRCA. The district court did not grant a preliminary injunction against Section 12 of AB 103, despite the government's argument that it interferes with federal immigration enforcement. The court disagreed with the government's claim that California's AB 103 interferes with federal immigration enforcement. It stated that the California Attorney General's review does not give the state a role in deciding on alien detention or removal. The court also found that the burden imposed on federal contractors under AB 103 is minimal and not higher than burdens imposed by other California laws. The Ninth Circuit ruled that part of California's AB 103, requiring the state Attorney General to review the circumstances of detained aliens' apprehension and transfer, violates intergovernmental immunity. The court rejected the creation of a \"de minimis exception\" to this doctrine, stating that any discriminatory economic burden on the federal government is unlawful. Only the provision mandating state inspectors to examine the circumstances likely violates intergovernmental immunity. The Ninth Circuit found that California's AB 103 requirement for state inspectors to review detained aliens' apprehension likely violates intergovernmental immunity. The court also rejected the government's argument that SB 54 obstructs immigration enforcement. The Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling that SB 54 does not obstruct federal immigration enforcement. The court stated that refusing to help is not the same as impeding, and SB 54 simply makes the choice for California law enforcement agencies to not assist federal immigration authorities. The court also mentioned that invalidating SB 54 under conflict preemption principles would dictate what a state can do. SB 54 does not obstruct federal immigration enforcement as it allows California law enforcement agencies to choose not to assist federal authorities. The Ninth Circuit ruled that conflict preemption principles would dictate what a state can do, but SB 54 does not violate these principles as it permits the sharing of information required by federal law. Anti-commandeering principles likely prevent a preemption challenge to the information-sharing provisions of SB 54. The Tenth Amendment reserves the states' power to regulate public safety, but federal immigration enforcement authority can override state or local initiatives. Ongoing lawsuits on sanctuary jurisdictions may clarify immigration and federalism issues. The anti-commandeering doctrine limits the federal government from forcing states to enforce federal immigration laws. Lawsuits challenging EO 13768 focus on the constitutionality of federal methods to address sanctuary policies hindering immigration enforcement. The district court rulings in cases such as City & County of San Francisco v. Trump and County of Santa Clara v. Trump found that the executive branch lacked statutory authority to withhold federal grants from sanctuary jurisdictions, deeming it unconstitutionally coercive. Congress could potentially ratify Section 9(a) to incentivize cooperation with immigration enforcement without being coercive. In City of Chicago v. Sessions and City of Philadelphia v. Sessions, district courts addressed similar issues. The courts have found that the executive branch lacks statutory authority to impose certain spending conditions on the Byrne JAG program. Congress could amend the statute to allow the Attorney General to impose conditions. Courts have also deemed Section 1373 constitutionally unviable, suggesting that Congress may use its spending power to encourage states to share immigration-related information with federal authorities."
