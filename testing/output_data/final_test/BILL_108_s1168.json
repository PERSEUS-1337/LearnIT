    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Recycled Roads Act of 2003\". In 2000, there were over 3.9 million miles of highways in the US. By the early 1990s, 350 million tons of material were used annually for highway construction. The Federal Government provided over $26 billion for highways in 2002. 45 states recycle 73 million tons of asphalt annually, saving $300 million. The Federal Highway Administration encourages states to use recycled materials in construction. Increased use of recyclable material in highway construction offers engineering, economic, and environmental benefits. It creates new national markets, incentives for recycling in small communities, conserves raw materials, and reduces waste in landfills. This could also provide opportunities for rural economic development. The curr_chunk states the goal to encourage expanded use of biomass products for economic development. The goal is to encourage expanded use of biomass products for economic development, while the curr_chunk focuses on the use of recyclable material in federal-aid highway construction. The curr_chunk introduces a new section in the United States Code regarding the use of recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway construction. The definition of recyclable material is provided, including materials like glass and forest biomass. The curr_chunk introduces various recyclable materials that can be used in road construction, including glass, forest biomass, used tires, reclaimed asphalt, and plastic, among others. These materials should not contain toxic constituents that pose a risk to human health or the environment during preconstruction, road use, or after the road's useful life for recycling, reuse, or disposal. The Secretary will establish a recycled roads incentive grant program to promote the use of recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway construction. Grants will be provided to States and qualified Indian tribes for employing coordinators and competitive grants for this purpose, with a maximum amount of $125,000 per fiscal year. The Secretary will provide grants up to $1,400,000 for projects promoting recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway construction, including eliminating economic barriers, developing markets, providing outreach and training, and collecting data. The Secretary may use remaining funds to provide additional grants under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) for a fiscal year, but cannot use the funds for grants or assistance under any other program. When providing a grant for transportation and environmental cooperation, the Secretary shall follow specific guidelines for States or Indian tribes. The Secretary encourages cooperation between transportation and environmental programs by States or Indian tribes. Indian tribes are treated as States for grant purposes. States and tribes must report data on recyclable material use annually. The report covers the use of recyclable materials in construction projects for Federal-aid highways in the State or on land under the jurisdiction of Indian tribes using at least $1,000,000 in Federal funds. It includes details on the types and quantities of recyclable materials used. The Recycled Roads Act of 2003 requires the use of recyclable materials in construction projects for Federal-aid highways. The Secretary must ensure data quality for assessing national achievements in recyclable material use. A report on program requirements must be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Recycled Roads Act of 2003 mandates the use of recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway construction projects. The Secretary must provide an overview of program requirements, analyze significant issues, and propose an implementation timeline. Annual reports on the program, including information on recyclable materials used, must be submitted to Congress. The Recycled Roads Act of 2003 requires the use of recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway projects. The Secretary will promulgate regulations and authorize appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for grants under subsection (b)(2)(A) and (b)(2)(B) annually. The Recycled Roads Act of 2003 mandates the use of recyclable materials in Federal-aid highway construction."
