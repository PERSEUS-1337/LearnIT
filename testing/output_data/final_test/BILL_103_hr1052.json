The \"States Solid Waste Regulatory Authority Act\" grants states the authority to regulate solid waste under Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act. State laws can impose and collect fees for the treatment and disposal of solid waste generated in another state, with limitations on fee increases starting in 1994. The percentage applicable for fee increases for the treatment and disposal of solid waste generated in another state is as follows: 1994 - 50%, 1995 - 100%, 1996 - 150%, 1997 - 200%, 1998 and thereafter - amount determined by the receiving State. The base amount for state fees is determined based on the fee imposed by the State on December 31, 1993, or the first fee imposed after that date. If a state imposes a fee after 1993, adjustments are made to the fee table for subsequent years. The fee imposed by an exporting State in connection with solid waste treatment cannot exceed the fee imposed by a receiving State. If it does, the receiving State can impose and collect a fee in connection with solid waste treatment. Each State can impose and collect a fee on solid waste treatment equal to that of the exporting State. States are authorized to ban the importation of solid waste generated outside their borders for a 5-year period. States can ban the importation of solid waste from outside their borders for a 5-year period if they have an approved waste management plan meeting all requirements. The definition of solid waste excludes hazardous waste. State authority to regulate solid waste includes the ability for states to ban the importation of solid waste from outside their borders for a 5-year period with an approved waste management plan. The definition of solid waste excludes hazardous waste. The State's waste management plan must identify expected solid waste generation, reduction strategies, and ensure adequate waste treatment facilities for the next 10 years. The State's waste management plan must include laws and regulations for new solid waste facilities to ensure adequate capacity, taking into account existing waste management compacts. The plan should also establish a process for siting and constructing these facilities, with a focus on environmental soundness. The waste management plan must reserve State authority to ensure capacity for waste volumes, including compacts with other States if needed. It should also describe practices promoting source reduction and recycling, including public education campaigns and coordination among officials. The waste management plan includes curriculum development for schools on source reduction and recycling, projects to inform the public and private sectors about these programs, and identifying markets for recyclable materials. Additionally, it requires solid waste management facilities to register with the State. The waste management plan mandates solid waste management facilities to register with the State, providing details such as owner/operator information, facility address, waste types, and amounts. It also includes provisions for technical and financial assistance to local communities and outlines conditions for accepting waste from other states in compliance with the plan. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to ensure waste-to-energy facilities do not interfere with the Act's objectives. State plans must include a policy for procuring products made with recyclable materials. The State plan must include programs for procuring products made with recyclable materials, encouraging composting, implementing curbside pickup of recyclables, and requiring separation of recyclable materials from solid waste before disposal. A surcharge may be imposed on tipping fees for non-compliance. The State plan must include programs for procuring products made with recyclable materials, encouraging composting, implementing curbside pickup of recyclables, and requiring separation of recyclable materials from solid waste before disposal. A surcharge may be imposed on tipping fees for any solid waste from commercial establishments or office buildings that is delivered to a landfill, waste-to-energy facility, or waste treatment facility, and from which recyclable materials have not been separated at their source. The State shall include recyclable materials such as corrugated cardboard, office paper, newspaper, glass, plastic materials, metals, yard waste, and beverage containers in its policy. Each State must submit a plan to the Administrator for approval under the States Solid Waste Regulatory Authority Act. If the Administrator does not act on a State plan within 6 months, the plan will become effective as submitted. Amendments are made to the Solid Waste Disposal Act regarding plan approval."
