    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the escalating threat of climate change in California, with extreme weather events and impacts already affecting public health, safety, and property. Planning for these challenges is crucial for future preparedness. Climate change poses a significant threat to California's residents, economy, and local governments. A single extreme winter storm could cost the state billions of dollars in property losses and impact residents, the economy, and natural resources. Adapting to climate change is crucial for protecting the environment and economy, requiring coordination across all state departments. Action needs to be taken now to mitigate these potential impacts. Part 3.7 of Division 34 of the Public Resources Code addresses Climate Change and Climate Adaptation. It defines key terms like \"Agency\" as the Natural Resources Agency and \"Council\" as the Strategic Growth Council. The \"Plan\" referred to is the Safeguarding California Plan. The Legislature prioritizes the state's response to climate change impacts by ensuring all departments are prepared. Actions should focus on people, places, and water, consistent with the Safeguarding California Plan. The agency is required to update the state's climate adaptation strategy every three years, coordinating with other state agencies to lead adaptation efforts in various sectors. The updates must include vulnerabilities to climate change and priority actions to reduce risks in sectors such as water, energy, transportation, public health, agriculture, emergency services, forestry, biodiversity, habitat, ocean, and coastal resources. The agency must release a draft plan every three years, hold public hearings for feedback, and report annually to the Legislature on implementation actions. State agencies are required to work towards maximizing objectives to address vulnerabilities identified in the plan. The state must educate the public on climate change consequences like sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and habitat loss. They also need to maintain a repository for climate data to inform policy decisions and identify risks. Additionally, the state should use the plan to guide planning decisions and consider climate impacts in infrastructure development. When developing infrastructure for adaptation, utilize natural features and ecosystem processes or restore them. Natural infrastructure includes ecological system preservation/restoration and engineered systems using ecological processes for climate resilience. Encourage regional collaborative planning for addressing climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. Promoting drought resiliency through an integrated water system, establishing preparation and response programs for sustainable water systems. Building resilient communities with urban greening projects to reduce pollution and create sustainable urban cores. Protecting habitat, species strongholds, and wildlife corridors critical for species at risk from climate change. The council aims to promote healthy soils, sustainable agriculture, reliable transportation planning, emergency management response, safe energy, public health threat response, climate change impacts on disadvantaged communities, and protection of cultural resources from climate change impacts. The council reviews state agency activities and funding programs to improve air and water quality, natural resource protection, affordable housing availability, transportation, climate goals, sustainable land use planning, and urban revitalization in a sustainable manner. It also comments on infrastructure plans and environmental goals reports. The council recommends policies and investment strategies to promote sustainable communities that enhance equity, economy, environment, and public health. It provides data to assist local governments in planning and manages grants and loans for sustainable development. The council awards revolving loans for planning projects based on financial capacity. Interest rates are capped at the Pooled Money Investment Board's rate. Loans must be repaid within a specified time frame. Funds can be recovered from applicants who do not complete projects. Technical assistance is provided for application preparation. The state agency administers grants and loans for sustainable community development. An annual report to the Legislature includes a list of applicants, approved applications, awarded amounts, remaining funds balance, and project management details. Minimum requirements and priorities for projects are set by the council."
