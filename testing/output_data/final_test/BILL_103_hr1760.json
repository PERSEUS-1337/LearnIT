    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Job Corps Youth Sentencing Alternative for Vocational Education and Training Act\" or the \"YOUTHSAVE Act.\" The Congress finds that prison overcrowding is a significant issue, with high costs of incarceration and a lack of preparation for juvenile offenders upon release. Early intervention for first-time offenders and job training in prison are crucial for reducing recidivism. Training in prison can significantly reduce recidivism rates, with those who receive job training being 3 times less likely to return to jail. The current system of juvenile incarceration often fails to provide effective counseling, education, and job training needed to steer youth away from crime. Educating and training convicted youths could lead to cost savings by reducing crime, incarceration, and public assistance, while increasing payroll tax revenues. The Job Corps program is the only residential education and vocational training program aimed at low-income youth facing barriers to economic self-sufficiency. The Job Corps program has a successful record of helping graduates find employment, return to school, or join the armed services, with a 75 percent placement rate. Eligibility requirements limit participation for youths with certain behavioral issues or criminal backgrounds. The Secretary of Labor can undertake pilot projects for youths with behavioral problems under the Job Training Partnership Act. The Job Corps program aims to establish separate centers for youth offenders convicted of nonviolent crimes, providing them with education, job training, and counseling services to help them reintegrate into society. These centers offer a disciplined environment tailored to the needs of youth offenders to maximize the benefits of Job Corps services. The Job Corps program establishes centers for youth offenders convicted of nonviolent crimes, offering education, job training, and counseling services to aid in their reintegration into society. Additionally, a new Job Corps YouthSave Program is established under Part B of title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act. The Secretary is authorized to establish up to 10 Job Corps Youthsave centers for eligible youths convicted of non-violent offenses under Federal or State law. These centers will provide comprehensive education and training services separately from Job Corps centers. The Secretary is authorized to establish Job Corps Youthsave centers for eligible youths convicted of non-violent offenses under Federal or State law. Regulations for screening and selection of applicants will be developed in consultation with various individuals and entities. The Secretary is authorized to establish Job Corps Youthsave centers for eligible youths convicted of non-violent offenses under Federal or State law. Regulations for screening and selection of applicants will be developed in consultation with various organizations, labor organizations, and agencies and individuals having contact with youths over a substantial period of time to ensure proper interviewing of each applicant. The Secretary will establish Job Corps Youthsave centers for eligible youths convicted of non-violent offenses. Regulations for screening and selecting applicants will ensure understanding of the program, gather applicant data, and assess educational and vocational needs. Special limitations apply, and regulations will be disseminated to appropriate parties. The Secretary will establish Job Corps Youthsave centers for eligible youths convicted of non-violent offenses, providing education, vocational training, work experience, rehabilitation, and counseling. Each center will operate under a project agreement with State or local agencies. The project agreement with State or local agencies for Job Corps Youthsave centers requires them to cover at least 30% of operating costs. Instructors at these centers must receive appropriate training in dealing with youth offenders. The Secretary will maintain separate information on center performance and enrollees, including placement statistics. The Secretary will disseminate information about centers to judges, attorneys, and organizations for awareness and referrals. $60,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for 1995-2004. The Job Training Partnership Act funding of $60,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 will remain available until expended. A conforming amendment is made to the table of contents. The Job Corps Youthsave Program is established under Sec. 433B."
