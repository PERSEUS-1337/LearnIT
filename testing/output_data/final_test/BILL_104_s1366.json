    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding the exclusion from estate for real property subject to endangered species conservation agreement. It adds a new section, SEC. 2057, which pertains to certain real property under such agreements. The value of the taxable estate for estate tax purposes can be reduced by the adjusted value of real property included in the gross estate subject to an endangered species conservation agreement. Real property is considered subject to such an agreement if all owners have entered into the necessary agreements. The executor of the decedent's estate must have a written agreement with the Secretary and elect the application of the section to file an endangered species conservation agreement. The adjusted value of real property is its value reduced by any deductible amount under section 2053(a)(4). An endangered species conservation agreement is a written agreement entered into for this purpose. A conservation agreement is a written agreement with the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce committing to specific activities on real property to assist in the conservation of endangered or threatened species. The executor must annually certify to the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce the status of endangered species conservation agreements if they elect the application of this section. The executor must annually certify to the Secretary that the endangered species conservation agreement for the property remains in effect and is being complied with. An additional tax may be imposed if there is a disposition of interest in the property or a failure to comply with the agreement. The additional tax imposed for non-compliance with an endangered species conservation agreement is based on the fair market value of the property at the time of the event. The term 'estate tax liability' refers to the tax imposed by section 2001, reduced by allowable credits. An exception to transferor obligations applies if the transferee assumes them in a written agreement. The transferee must assume obligations and liability in a written agreement, notifying the relevant authorities. The additional tax becomes due 6 months after the disposition. The statute of limitations for assessing additional tax liabilities under subsection (d)(1)(A) is 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified of the tax liability, regardless of the expiration date. The statute allows for a 3-year period to assess tax liabilities, regardless of any other laws preventing assessment. The election and filing of agreements must be done on the tax return, as regulated by the Secretary. Regulations will also apply to interests in partnerships, corporations, and trusts related to closely held businesses. The statute allows for a 3-year period to assess tax liabilities, regardless of any other laws preventing assessment. An interest in a discretionary trust where all beneficiaries are heirs of the decedent is considered a present interest for tax purposes. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. The amendments made by this section apply to estates of decedents dying after the enactment of this Act."
