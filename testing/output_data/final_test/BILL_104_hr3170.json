    "content": "The \"Port Revitalization Act of 1996\" is the short title of this Act. It includes provisions for cost sharing for land-based and confined dredged material disposal facilities. The \"Port Revitalization Act of 1996\" provides for cost sharing for land-based and confined dredged material disposal facilities associated with Federal navigation projects. The cost of these facilities is considered a general navigation feature and subject to cost sharing in accordance with the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The Port Revitalization Act of 1996 allows for cost sharing of dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects. The costs are determined according to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, including construction, operation, and maintenance expenses. The Port Revitalization Act of 1996 allows cost sharing for environmental dredging and disposal facilities in Federal navigation projects. The Federal share covers contaminated sediments, mitigation of environmental impacts, and remediation in critical port areas to facilitate commercial navigation. Preference is given to projects in port areas with annual harbor maintenance tax payments. The Harbor Maintenance Tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 should not exceed Federal expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for projects in port areas. Funds for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects must be used only after ensuring they are not needed for other eligible operation and maintenance costs. The construction of such facilities should be equitably apportioned based on regional needs. This section applies to dredged material disposal facilities under contract. The Secretary of the Army can amend project agreements to cover Federal costs for dredged material disposal facilities. The non-Federal share of costs for facilities authorized before this Act will not increase. Federal participation in covering costs for dredged material disposal facilities is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of the Army may provide additional capacity at a dredged material disposal facility if requested by a non-Federal project sponsor, who agrees to pay all associated construction costs. The sponsor can recover costs through fees charged to third parties using the facility. The amount of fees is determined by the sponsor. The Secretary of the Army may permit the use of any dredged material. The Secretary of the Army may allow non-Federal entities to use dredged material disposal facilities and charge fees to cover costs. Fees collected will be used for operation and maintenance of the facility. Federal participation in non-Federal disposal facilities is also permitted. The Secretary of the Army can participate in non-Federal disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects and pay disposal fees. References to non-Federal sponsor obligations are limited to property acquisition, excluding construction costs. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for managing land-based and aquatic dredged material disposal facilities to extend their useful life. Costs for preparing disposal areas for dredged material reception are considered project costs subject to cost-sharing formulas. SEC. 4. LOWER HARBOR MAINTENANCE TAX. Effective January 1, 1997, the tax on port use will be 0.085 percent of the value of commercial cargo. The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, will assess the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund annually to determine if adjustments to the tax are needed to maintain a sufficient balance for operation and maintenance costs. The Secretary of the Army will report to Congress annually on the determination made regarding the tax on port use for operation and maintenance costs. SEC. 5. SEDIMENTS DECONTAMINATION TECHNOLOGY. The Water Resource Development Act of 1992 is amended to include a project purpose for sediment decontamination technologies on a pilot scale. Authorization of appropriations is also amended for fiscal years. Reports are required annually from the Administrator and the Secretary. The Water Resource Development Act of 1992 is amended to include a project purpose for sediment decontamination technologies on a pilot scale. Annual reports are required from the Administrator and the Secretary on the progress of the project. Authorization of dredge material containment facility for Port of New York/New Jersey. The Secretary of the Army is authorized to construct a dredged material containment facility for the Port of New York/New Jersey. The facility will have a capacity for long-term disposal needs and costs will be shared with the local sponsor. Dredged material not suitable for ocean disposal can be disposed of in the facility. After reaching capacity, beneficial use of the material will be considered. After subsection (a) reaches capacity with dredged material, the Secretary will maintain the facility for public benefit."
