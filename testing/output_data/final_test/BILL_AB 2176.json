    "title": "AB 2176",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 8698 of the Government Code is amended to define key terms for this chapter. \"Political subdivision\" includes various government entities, \"governing body\" refers to specific officials or boards, and \"public facility\" encompasses facilities owned or operated by a political subdivision. A \"Declaration of a shelter crisis\" is the official recognition of a situation where many people lack shelter, posing a threat to their health and safety. An emergency bridge housing community is a facility reserved for homeless individuals and families, providing temporary housing in structures like sleeping cabins with support facilities such as showers and bathrooms. The goal is to move homeless individuals to permanent housing quickly, with rents and fees based on ability to pay. During a shelter crisis declared by the City of San Jose, emergency housing may include an emergency bridge housing community for the homeless on city-owned or city-leased land. The city may adopt local standards for emergency bridge housing communities in lieu of state and local standards to mitigate the effects of a shelter crisis. The Department of Housing and Community Development will review the city's ordinance for health and safety standards. During the shelter crisis, state and local building, housing, health, habitability, and safety standards are suspended for emergency bridge housing communities, as long as the city has adopted health and safety standards for these communities. Landlord tenant laws providing a cause of action for habitability or tenantability are also suspended. The city must match residents of emergency bridge housing communities to affordable housing units by January 1, 2022. On or before July 1, 2017, the city must develop a plan for each emergency bridge housing community with on-site supportive services, to be publicly available. By January 1, 2018, and annually after, the city must report to the Legislature on residents in each community, those who transitioned to permanent affordable housing, average time to secure housing, and projected affordable housing units by January 1, 2022. An emergency sleeping cabin is a relocatable hard-sided structure with specific size requirements and no plumbing or gas service. It must have a minimum live load roof structure, access to electricity for lighting and heating, approved heating equipment, and ventilation. The emergency sleeping cabin must have adequate ventilation, a GFCI-protected receptacle, two forms of egress, privacy locks on doors, compliance with accessibility requirements, and a smoke alarm with battery backup. The California Building Standards Commission must include standards in the California Building Standards Code that conform to this subdivision. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2022, unless a later statute extends that date. A special law is necessary to address homelessness in the City of San Jose."
