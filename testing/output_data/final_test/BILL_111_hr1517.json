The term \"Commissioner\" refers to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. \"U.S. Customs and Border Protection\" is the agency under the Department of Homeland Security. \"Competitive service\" is defined as per section 2102 of title 5, United States Code. An \"overseas limited appointment\" is an appointment under specific regulations. SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO CONVERT CERTAIN OVERSEAS LIMITED APPOINTMENTS TO PERMANENT APPOINTMENTS. This section allows for the conversion of overseas limited appointments to permanent appointments. The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection may convert an employee serving under an overseas limited appointment to a permanent appointment in the competitive service if certain conditions are met. The employee must have completed at least 2 years of continuous service and have a performance rating of at least fully successful. Upon conversion, the employee acquires competitive status. Upon conversion, the United States will indemnify and hold harmless any individual whose appointment is converted, protecting them from claims related to their official duties in a foreign country. This indemnification applies to events where the individual would not have been liable if they had the same privileges and immunities as a permanent employee in that country. The United States will provide services and payments to individuals whose appointments are converted under this Act, equivalent to those provided to other U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees in the same country of assignment. The Commissioner will implement the conversion of employees from overseas limited appointments to permanent appointments in a way that meets operational needs and minimizes disruption. Services and payments will be provided to these individuals as if they had held a permanent appointment in the competitive service. The Act does not affect the pay of employees for services performed before conversion. The Commissioner's authority to convert overseas limited appointments to permanent appointments in U.S. Customs and Border Protection will end 2 years after the Act's enactment. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
