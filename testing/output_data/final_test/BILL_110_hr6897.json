The Philippine islands became a US possession in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. Filipinos served in various units during World War II under US control. The Philippine Scouts and Commonwealth Army members were called into service by President Roosevelt in 1941. The new Philippine Scouts continued their wartime service until 1946 and disbanded in 1950. Filipino veterans who served during World War II receive varying benefits under title 38, United States Code, with some receiving full benefits and others receiving reduced rates depending on their legal residence. Benefits paid to Filipino veterans under title 38, United States Code include compensation, dependency indemnity, survivor benefits, burial benefits, and educational assistance for dependents, all at a rate of $0.50 per dollar authorized, except for those residing lawfully in the United States. SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO ELIGIBLE PERSONS WHO SERVED IN THE PHILIPPINES DURING WORLD WAR II. The \"Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund\" is established in the Treasury's general fund to make payments to eligible persons without fiscal year limitation. Eligible persons who served in the Philippines during World War II can receive payments by submitting an application within a one-year period. Eligible persons served in the organized military forces of the Philippines before July 1, 1946, under the Armed Forces of the United States. Payment amounts vary based on citizenship status. Eligible persons who served in the organized military forces of the Philippines before July 1, 1946, under the Armed Forces of the United States may receive payments. The amount is $9,000 for non-US citizens and $15,000 for US citizens. The Secretary can only make one payment per person. Receiving this payment does not affect eligibility for Social Security benefits under title VIII of the Social Security Act for individuals living outside the United States. Acceptance of the payment constitutes a final release. The Secretary will provide detailed reports to Congress on the operation of the compensation fund, including the number of applicants, eligible persons receiving benefits, amounts paid, and fund administration. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the compensation fund within 90 days of the Act's enactment. $198,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the fund to make payments. The House of Representatives passed the bill on September 23, 2008."
