    "content": "The 8(a) Program provides training and assistance to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. Participants can receive federal contracting preferences through set-aside and sole-source awards. The program aims for firms to graduate and succeed in the competitive business environment. The 8(a) Program provides training and assistance to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the United States, aiming for their success in the competitive business environment. Additionally, other small businesses like those owned by Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian Organizations are also eligible for the program. In FY2017, 3,421 8(a) firms were awarded over $27.1 billion in federal contracts. Congress has a continual interest in small business programs, including the 8(a) Program, as per the Small Business Act. The Small Business Act aims to support small-business concerns and promote free competitive enterprise by ensuring a fair share of government purchases and contracts go to small businesses. The Act also emphasizes the importance of full participation in the free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The 8(a) Program is designed to help achieve these goals by providing training and assistance to eligible small businesses. The 8(a) Program aims to promote the business development of small businesses owned by disadvantaged individuals to compete equally in the American economy. Recent Congresses have shown interest in the program due to its impact on minority-owned businesses and job creation. Business development assistance includes counseling and support. The 8(a) business development assistance program offers various forms of support, including counseling, access to capital, contract marketing guidance, and assistance with acquiring federal government surplus property. The Small Business Administration (SBA) reviews and certifies eligible clients, assigns Business Opportunity Specialists (BOSs) to monitor progress, and helps identify contract opportunities. This report examines the program's historical development, key requirements, administrative structures, and the SBA's oversight of 8(a) firms. The curr_chunk discusses SBA programs supporting 8(a) firms, program statistics, and current issues including revisions to the application process, reported service delivery variations, oversight deficiencies, and disagreements on financial thresholds. The current 8(a) Program is a merger of federal programs aimed at assisting small businesses and minorities. It originated in 1967 and was officially established in 1978. In 1942, the Smaller War Plants Corporation was authorized by Congress to enter into contracts with small businesses to support the war effort. The Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA) was created in 1951 during the Korean War, with powers similar to the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC). In 1953, the SDPA's authorities were transferred to the newly established Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Small Business Act of 1958. Initially, the SBA's subcontracting authority was not limited to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. Federal programs for racial and ethnic minorities began developing around the same time as those for small businesses. Executive orders were issued to improve employment opportunities for various groups, following President Franklin Roosevelt's order in 1941. These initiatives gained importance after the Kerner Commission's report. After the Kerner Commission's report on the causes of the 1966 urban riots, Presidents Johnson and Nixon established initiatives to support African Americans in entering the economic mainstream. Johnson's President's Test Cities Program used SBA authority to award contracts to firms in urban areas, while Nixon's program focused on minority-owned small businesses. The SBA's earliest programs were developed during Nixon's administration. During the Nixon Administration, the SBA established regulations for the 8(a) Program to assist minority-owned small businesses. In 1978, Congress amended the Small Business Act to give the SBA statutory authority for the program. The 1978 amendments to the Small Business Act gave the SBA authority for its 8(a) Program, which focuses on minority-owned businesses. It defines socially disadvantaged individuals as those who have faced prejudice or bias due to their group identity, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and other minorities. The 1978 amendments to the Small Business Act granted the SBA discretion to recognize socially disadvantaged individuals based on specific criteria. The regulations established a three-part test for determining minority groups' disadvantage and defined economically disadvantaged individuals for the 8(a) Program. The SBA established criteria for socially disadvantaged individuals in the 8(a) Program, with a personal net worth threshold of $250,000. The program was expanded in the 1980s to include small businesses owned by four disadvantaged groups, starting with Community Development Corporations (CDCs). The Community Economic Development Act of 1981 created CDCs and instructed the SBA to ensure their participation in the 8(a) Program. In 1986, Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations became eligible for the program, followed by Native Hawaiian Organizations in 1988. Native Hawaiian Organizations (NHOs) were recognized in 1988 as community service organizations serving Native Hawaiians in Hawaii. NHOs must be nonprofit corporations controlled by Native Hawaiians, with business activities benefiting them. Statutory and regulatory requirements govern 8(a) Program eligibility, set-aside awards, and sole-source awards, with some special rules for group-owned 8(a) firms. An Appendix compares requirements for individual owners of 8(a) firms to groups owning them (e.g., ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes). The 8(a) Program eligibility is limited to small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the United States. Businesses must be for-profit entities operating primarily within the U.S. or making a significant contribution to the U.S. economy. Eligibility requirements remain the same throughout the program, with special rules for group-owned 8(a) firms. For 8(a) Program eligibility, businesses must be small, independently owned and operated, not dominant in their field, and meet SBA Administrator's standards based on size measured by employees or annual receipts. Specific size standards vary by industry, such as 1,500 employees for scheduled passenger air transportation or $32.5 million in annual receipts for data processing. Affiliations or control relationships among businesses are also considered. The SBA considers affiliations among businesses in size determinations for the 8(a) Program. Businesses can be deemed non-small due to joint ventures, subcontracting arrangements, or franchise agreements if their size, along with their affiliates, exceeds the threshold. 8(a) firms must be majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with exceptions for certain entities. Ownership must be unconditional to qualify. Ownership of an 8(a) business must be unconditional and direct, with disadvantaged individuals owning the business in their own right. Non-disadvantaged individuals and nonparticipant businesses can only own up to 10-20% of another 8(a) firm. Additionally, nonparticipant businesses earning the majority of their revenue in the same line of business are limited to owning 10-30% of another 8(a) firm. In order to qualify as an 8(a) firm, ownership must be direct and unconditional, with disadvantaged individuals controlling the business. Control involves strategic policy setting and day-to-day management by disadvantaged individuals, who must have the necessary managerial experience and devote full-time hours to the business. A disadvantaged individual must hold the highest officer position within the company. Non-disadvantaged individuals may have roles in management but are limited in ownership to 10-20% of another 8(a) firm. Socially disadvantaged individuals must have control of an 8(a) business, with restrictions on non-disadvantaged individuals' control and compensation. Designated-group members have a rebuttable presumption of social disadvantage, while others must prove it with evidence. To qualify as socially disadvantaged for the 8(a) program, individuals must demonstrate objective distinguishing features, personal experiences of social disadvantage, and negative impacts on business advancement. The SBA considers education, employment, and business history to assess disadvantage. Economically disadvantaged individuals are also considered socially disadvantaged for program eligibility. Individuals applying for the 8(a) program must prove they are socially disadvantaged due to limited capital and credit opportunities. Financial documentation is required, including personal income, net worth, and asset value. Net worth must be under $250,000 for initial eligibility and under $750,000 for continued eligibility. Principal ownership and equity in a primary residence are excluded from net worth calculations. The SBA also evaluates good character, considering criminal conduct and SBA violations. The SBA evaluates good character for the 8(a) Program, considering criminal conduct, violations of SBA regulations, and other factors. To qualify, a firm must have been in business in its primary industry for at least two years, but waivers may be granted. The Small Business Act allows agencies to award contracts to the SBA for subcontracting to 8(a) firms. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) requires federal agencies to allow full and open competition when procuring goods or services. However, set-aside and sole-source awards to 8(a) firms are permissible under certain circumstances. An 8(a) set-aside is a recognized competitive procedure that encourages agencies to subcontract through the 8(a) Program to meet government-wide goals for awarding procurement dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. The SBA has limits on subcontracting through the 8(a) Program, including restrictions on accepting procurements for award under Section 8(a) in certain situations. The SBA is restricted from awarding an 8(a) contract if the price exceeds fair market value. Agency officials have discretion to offer contracts to the SBA, and the SBA can accept requirements for the 8(a) Program as needed. Protests regarding 8(a) Program determinations are generally not heard unless bad faith or violation of federal law is proven. Contract awards through the 8(a) Program are based on set-aside or sole-source basis, determined by the contract amount. When the contract's anticipated total value is below $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing contracts), it is awarded without competition. Contracts exceeding these thresholds must be set-aside for 8(a) firms with limited competition. Sole-source awards are allowed for contracts valued at $4 million ($7 million or more for manufacturing contracts) under specific conditions. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council adjusts acquisition-related dollar thresholds, including those for the 8(a) Program, every five years on October 1. The next adjustment for inflation is scheduled for October 1, 2020. Other key 8(a) Program requirements include the inability to protest an 8(a) firm's eligibility for an award. Eligibility challenges must be submitted to the SBA separately from the solicitation or contract award process. Firms must meet eligibility requirements outlined in Section 124.517 of Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations to participate in the 8(a) Program for a maximum of nine years. Once a firm or individual exits the program, they are generally not eligible to participate again. Ownership limitations apply to family members of current or former 8(a) firm owners. Ownership limitations apply to family members of current or former 8(a) firm owners. 8(a) firms have award limitations, where they cannot receive additional sole-source awards once they reach a certain threshold. Firms in the transitional stage must meet annual revenue targets from non-8(a) sources. Ownership limitations apply to family members of current or former 8(a) firm owners. 8(a) firms have award limitations, where they cannot receive additional sole-source awards once they reach a certain threshold. Firms in the transitional stage must meet annual revenue targets from non-8(a) sources, increasing over time. Firms failing to meet these targets are ineligible for sole-source 8(a) contracts until the situation is corrected. Federal subcontracting limitations require small businesses to perform a minimum percentage of work under set-aside contracts. Ownership limitations apply to family members of current or former 8(a) firm owners. Firms owned by Indian tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs must be deemed small under the SBA's size standards. Certain affiliations with the owning entity or other business enterprises are excluded in size determinations unless a substantial unfair competitive advantage is determined. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes must be for-profit businesses unconditionally owned and controlled by the respective entity. ANC-owned firms may face early graduation from the 8(a) Program if they exceed size standards. Tribally or ANC-owned firms can be managed by non-members if certain conditions are met. The NHO must control all management decisions, including strategic planning and budget approval. A management development plan must show how Tribal members will develop managerial skills. ANCs are deemed economically disadvantaged, and CDCs must be managed by individuals with sufficient managerial experience. Indian tribes, ANCs, NHOs, and CDCs are presumed socially disadvantaged. Indian tribes and NHOs must establish economic disadvantage by presenting data on tribe members, unemployment rate, per capita income, poverty levels, access to capital, and business ownership. NHOs now follow the same criteria as Indian tribes since August 24, 2016. The SBA's regulations for tribally and ANC-owned 8(a) firms state that the good character requirement applies to officers, directors, or shareholders with over a 20% interest. NHO-owned firms may have similar requirements. CDC-owned firms must have good character for the firm and all principals. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes can show potential for success by being in business for at least two years. The SBA's regulations for tribally and ANC-owned 8(a) firms require good character for key individuals with a significant interest. NHO-owned firms may have similar requirements, while CDC-owned firms must demonstrate good character for all principals. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes can show potential for success by operating for a minimum of two years and meeting specific criteria related to financial stability and successful performance on contracts. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes must demonstrate good character for key individuals and show potential for success by operating for at least two years. They are required to submit information to the SBA detailing how they have benefited their community through participation in the 8(a) program. This includes funding cultural programs, providing employment assistance, scholarships, and other services. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes are eligible for 8(a) set-asides and sole-source awards. ANCs and Indian tribes can receive sole-source awards over $4 million, while NHO-owned firms may receive them from the Department of Defense. These firms are subject to the same regulations as other 8(a) firms, including certain requirements like demonstrating good character and community benefits. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes have specific eligibility criteria for the 8(a) Program, including limits on subcontracting and maximum program participation of nine years. These firms can only participate in the program once and have restrictions on majority ownership and contract amounts. Unlike disadvantaged individuals, these entities can confer program eligibility multiple times and for an indefinite period. Additionally, they cannot own 51% or more of another firm in the same primary industry. Firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes in the 8(a) Program have specific eligibility criteria and restrictions on subcontracting, ownership, and contract amounts. They can own multiple firms in different primary industries but have limits on owning firms in the same industry. These entities can receive sole-source awards even after reaching a threshold of competitive and sole-source contracts. The SBA's Office of Business Development oversees the 8(a) Program, with three offices: OCE, OMTA, and OPR. Applications are processed at CODS in San Francisco and Philadelphia. BOSs work with 8(a) firms under the supervision of the SBA's OFO. The SBA's Business Opportunity Specialists (BOSs) report to the SBA's Office of Field Operations (OFO) but interact extensively with Business Development (BD) in Washington, DC. Prior to applying for certification in the 8(a) Program, firms must fulfill various requirements such as obtaining a D-U-N-S number, a tax identification number, and creating a profile in the System for Award Management. District office staff encourage potential applicants to attend information sessions for program eligibility criteria. The SBA revised the 8(a) Program's application process in 2016 to streamline it by accepting online applications only and eliminating certain requirements. The determination of economic disadvantage is now based solely on objective financial data. This change aims to prevent unnecessary delays for minor infractions that may have occurred many years ago. The SBA made optional the automatic suspension of consideration and referral to the SBA OIG for applications with adverse information on criminal conduct. Applicants still need to submit a long list of supporting documents, including federal income tax returns and financial statements for the past three years. Applicants must provide a completed personal financial statement form, list of assets and liabilities, federal and nonfederal contracts, lease agreements, proof of signature authority on bank accounts, and documented proof of contributions for ownership and asset transfers. The firm must provide state filings, certificate of good standing, foreign corporation filings, articles of incorporation, bylaws, stock certificates, proof of social disadvantage, personal information of principals, and documentation on how the firm meets requirements. The SBA processes applications for waivers within 90 days of receipt at specific CODS. Applicants are notified within 15 days if their application is complete. Incomplete applications will not be processed. Additional information may be requested if an application is deemed incomplete during the eligibility review process. The BOS may request additional information via a delivery method that tracks delivery and provides return receipt capability. The applicant must provide the requested information within five calendar days. Failure to meet the deadline may result in ineligibility. A request for additional information does not stop the 90-day processing clock. The case may require priority handling for the CODS to complete the eligibility review. The BOS submits the case file, analysis, and decision letter to the CODS' chief for review. The chief verifies proper application of steps and regulations before returning the case file to the BOS. After the chief verifies the application, the BOS makes any necessary changes before the chief signs and returns the case file. The recommendation is then sent to the OCE's director for approval. The AA/BD ultimately approves or declines the application, with the firm notified via an approval or declination letter detailing reasons for ineligibility. The SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals may issue a letter detailing reasons for ineligibility due to regulatory provisions not met by the applicant. The letter includes the right to request reconsideration or appeal. The application process for the 8(a) Program has a high rejection rate, hindering its growth. Business Opportunity Specialists (BOSs) help firms with application questions, eligibility requirements, and business development assistance. Their ongoing responsibility is to assist firms in developing their business. The Business Opportunity Specialists (BOSs) assist 8(a) firms in developing their business by identifying strengths and weaknesses, providing advice on marketing to the federal government, and monitoring compliance with program requirements. Firms must demonstrate compliance through reporting specific information to the SBA. The annual review for 8(a) firms requires various forms and documentation, including Form 1450\u20148(a) Annual Update Review, Form 1623\u2014Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters, and Form 1790\u2014Representatives Used and Compensation Paid for Services in Connection with Obtaining Federal Contracts. The annual review for 8(a) firms includes submitting various forms and documentation such as Form 912, Form 413, and updates to the business plan. Additionally, firms participating in the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program must provide a narrative report on contracts with their mentor. Reporting on performance of 8(a) contracts, including joint ventures, is also required. In 2010, GAO reported that district staff's dual role of advocacy and monitoring for firms may have led to retention of ineligible firms. In response, SBA shifted responsibility for processing continued eligibility reviews to its Washington, DC, office in 2012 to eliminate conflict of interest. 8(a) firms can leave the program voluntarily or through early graduation. The SBA's 8(a) program allows firms to exit voluntarily or through various means such as meeting business plan targets, involuntary early graduation, termination for cause, expiration of program term, or graduation at term end. The 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance Program supports 8(a) firms with training. The SBA's 8(a) program, established in 1970, aims to assist small disadvantaged businesses in becoming self-sufficient and competitive. Through statutory authority, the SBA provides management and technical assistance to qualified service providers. P.L. 95-507 in 1978 granted the SBA explicit authority to extend financial and other services to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. The SBA's 7(j) Management and Technical Assistance Program provides services to socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, including counseling, training, and identifying new business opportunities. Eligible individuals and businesses include 8(a) certified firms, small disadvantaged businesses, and businesses in areas of high unemployment or low income. In FY2018, 6,483 small businesses received assistance through the program. The SBA is actively marketing the program to increase awareness among 8(a) firms. The SBA has been marketing the 7(j) program to 8(a) firms to increase awareness and help them prepare for federal contracting opportunities. The SBA also established the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program to enhance the capabilities of 8(a) firms and improve their ability to compete for contracts through various forms of assistance. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program is government-wide and administered by the SBA's Office of Business Development. SBA regulations govern aspects such as mentor and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 qualifications, written agreements, and evaluations. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program, administered by the SBA, requires mentors to be for-profit concerns capable of assisting developing 8(a) firms. Only SBA approved firms can serve as mentors, who must demonstrate good character and impart value to prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must be small businesses. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program requires mentors to be for-profit concerns capable of assisting developing 8(a) firms. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s must be small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in good standing in the program. Mentors are generally expected to have one prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at a time, but may have up to three under certain conditions. Similarly, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s are expected to have one mentor at a time, but may have two in specified circumstances. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows for mentors to assist developing 8(a) firms by entering into written agreements with prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, lasting up to three years with the option to renew for another three years. The program benefits both mentors and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with mentors fulfilling subcontracting requirements under Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act. The mentor firm under the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program may be subject to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, requiring subcontracting plans for federal contracts over $700,000. Mentors can form joint ventures with prot\u00e9g\u00e9s for small business contracts, and acquire up to 40% equity in the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firm to help raise capital. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows mentor firms to acquire a larger ownership share in prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms, exceeding the usual limit of 10%-20%. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s receive assistance from mentors while retaining their status as \"small businesses.\" SBA regulations prevent affiliation between prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms and their mentors to maintain small business status. The 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program allows mentor firms to assist prot\u00e9g\u00e9 firms without creating affiliation. There were 314 active agreements as of September 30, 2017. The number of federal contracts awarded to 8(a) firms increased from 3,421 in FY2017 to 3,709 in FY2018. In FY2017, 8(a) firms received $27.167 billion in federal contracts. During FY2010 through FY2017, 8(a) firms received approximately 5.45% of federal contracts, totaling $214.902 billion. This included $58.609 billion through set-asides, $73.544 billion through sole-source awards, and $82.749 billion through open competition or other small business preferences. The SBA faces challenges with the 8(a) Program, such as declining participation and disagreements over economic disadvantage thresholds. The SBA aimed to increase the number of approved 8(a) firms by 5% in FY2016 and FY2017. To achieve this, they streamlined the program's application process, marketed the 7(j) Management and Training Assistance Program, and expanded the 8(a) Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program. The SBA highlighted issues with the 8(a) program application process, including delays, rejections due to missing documentation, and low approval rates. Third-party firms charge applicants to prepare applications, but there is no guarantee of approval as the rate is less than 50%. The SBA reported low approval rates for the 8(a) Program, with less than 50% guaranteed approval. Despite efforts to streamline the application process, concerns have been raised about eroding core safeguards. Federal prosecutors have expressed difficulty in identifying fraud when proper due diligence is not exercised in admitting firms. The SBA needs to ensure that only eligible firms are admitted into the program. The SBA needs to ensure that only eligible firms are admitted into the 8(a) Program. Recent audits found that lack of documentation led to potentially ineligible firms being accepted. The SBA agreed to document justifications for approval in its tracking system to address this issue. The SBA's lack of documentation in the 8(a) Program certification process has raised concerns about ineligible firms being admitted. Congressional hearings revealed inconsistencies in Business Opportunity Specialists practices across different SBA district offices. Members of Congress argue that the position's responsibilities are not clearly defined in statute, leading to issues with oversight of 8(a) participants. During the 115th Congress, the Small Business Act was amended to clarify the responsibilities of Business Opportunity Specialists in overseeing the 8(a) Program. Concerns about variation in service delivery were raised due to breakdowns in communication between SBA district offices and headquarters. The SBA's organizational structure was also noted to contribute to inconsistencies in program delivery. District officials at SBA work with program offices at headquarters to implement agency programs. Business opportunity specialists in district offices assist small businesses with government contracts but report to district office management. Legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress to address concerns about SBA's organizational overlap. GAO reported a \"skill gap\" among specialists may affect program service delivery. The SBA revised field office operations in 2012 to align with strategic plans, creating new positions like economic development specialist and business opportunity specialist. This was done due to changes in responsibilities after loan processing was moved to processing centers in 2004. The SBA revised field office operations in 2012, creating new positions like economic development specialist and business opportunity specialist. The change in position descriptions led to a skill gap among employees, requiring different skills such as marketing and interpersonal skills for assisting and overseeing 8(a) firms and conducting outreach to small businesses. Despite efforts to address the gap through training and incentives, the skill gap remained pronounced among employees in job series GS-1101 and GS-1102. The SBA addressed a skill gap among employees by offering training and incentives in FY2012 and FY2014, but the gap remains due to changes in job requirements and new initiatives. The National Defense Authorization Act of FY2016 now requires BOSs to obtain federal acquisition certification. The SBA issued a new 300-page SOP in September 2016 for the Office of Business Development to help address the skill gap. The SBA's GCBD and OFO offices oversee the 8(a) Program. The OCE within GCBD evaluates program applications and conducts eligibility reviews for high-risk firms. However, an audit found that less than half of high-risk firms were reviewed in FY2016 and FY2017. BOSs in OFO's district offices work directly with 8(a) firms and conduct annual progress reviews. The SBA's district office BOSs conduct annual reviews of 8(a) firms to ensure compliance with eligibility requirements. The SBA is also required to review continuing eligibility based on specific information received, often from the SBA OIG's Hotline. The SBA OIG's audit found that the OCE did not conduct continuing eligibility reviews for 44 OIG Hotline complaints referred to the GCBD from October 1, 2015, through May 4, 2017. District office BOSs were not informed of complaints against firms in their purview, leading to no action taken. The audit reviewed the continuing eligibility of 8(a) firms to identify ineligible firms in the program. The SBA OIG found that 4 of the 15 individually-owned 8(a) firms reviewed were ineligible for the program due to issues like excessive income and lack of good character. Additionally, the SBA did not take timely action to remove ineligible firms identified through annual reviews. 20 out of 25 firms reviewed should have been removed from the 8(a) Program. The SBA OIG found that 20 out of 25 firms reviewed should have been removed from the 8(a) Program. SBA management agreed with 7 recommendations to improve the program's eligibility review process. During the 112th Congress, there were proposed bills to increase the financial thresholds for the 8(a) Program, with one bill suggesting thresholds of $750,000 for admission and $2.25 million for continued participation. Advocates pushed for increasing the personal net worth threshold for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program, citing the Department of Transportation's adjustment for inflation in 2011. The DBE threshold was raised from $750,000 to $1.32 million, benefiting DBE firms seeking federal transportation contracts. Advocates argued for raising the personal net worth threshold for the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program, claiming that the current limit hindered the growth of DBE firms. Opponents believed the $1.32 million limit was too high and would benefit larger, established DBEs over smaller start-up firms. The SBA's OIG criticized the exclusion of equity in a primary residence from net worth calculations, stating it allowed affluent business owners to exploit the program. The Small Business Administration is required to develop a process for collecting data on the operations of the 8(a) Program and report it to Congress annually. The report must include details on the personal net worth of program participants, benefits and costs to the economy and government, and an evaluation of businesses that have exited the program in the past three years. The Small Business Administration must report annually to Congress on the operations of the 8(a) Program, including the status of businesses actively engaged, ceased, or acquired, as well as benefits and costs to the economy. The report also includes details on program participants' personal net worth, contracts received, and advance payments. The Small Business Administration's annual report to Congress on the 8(a) Program includes details on contracts awarded, benefits received, and resources needed for the next two years. The report also provides information on the dollar value of contracts awarded by standard industrial classification code. The SBA's FY2014 report on the 8(a) Program showed that active firms contributed jobs to the economy, with some firms acquired or curtailed. The active firms reported revenue of $5.49 billion and provided jobs for 70,330 persons. The SBA periodically surveys 8(a) firms to assess program effectiveness and meet firms' needs. The survey measures impact on client firms' creation, financial development, and survival. The survey's questions on client satisfaction and program impact could be useful for a nationwide survey of 8(a) firms."
