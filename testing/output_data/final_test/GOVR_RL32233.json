Federal funds covered 71.5% of the total, with a significant portion going towards medical assistance. Welfare spending in 2002 increased by $38.2 billion from the previous year, with the majority of the increase allocated to medical assistance. Other areas that saw increases included education, food benefits, housing, and services. In FY2002, over 80 benefit programs costing $522.2 billion were aimed at individuals with limited income. Spending increased by $38.2 billion from the previous year, with a significant portion going towards medical assistance. Other areas that saw increases included education, food benefits, housing, and services. Outlays for cash aid dropped by $1.2 billion, and for jobs and training by $0.5 billion. Spending for \"human capital\" programs accounted for 7.3% of all welfare dollars. The report provides details on 85 need-based programs, including funding formulas, eligibility requirements, and benefit levels. Most benefit programs are based on income eligibility, offering income transfers in various forms. Recipients may need to work or study for wages, training allowances, or grants. Some programs require work or training, while others focus on self-sufficiency activities or community service. The Earned Income Tax Credit is available only to workers. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is available only to workers and excludes income maintenance programs that are not income-tested. It excludes Social Security cash benefits, unemployment compensation, and Medicare, but includes the EITC for low-income workers with children and the child tax credit. The child tax credit provides refunds to working families with income below specified limits. It is now refundable for those with earnings above $10,000. Other tax benefits like mortgage interest deduction are not included in this report as they do not make direct payments. These tax transfers increase families' disposable income by reducing their tax liability. Total expenditures on cash and noncash welfare programs multiplied many times between 1968 and 2002, even after adjusting for inflation. Spending rose significantly over the 34-year period, with an annual growth rate of 5.5%. Total per capita welfare spending grew from $416 in FY1968 to over $1,800 in FY2002, with uneven growth patterns over the years. Total per capita welfare spending increased significantly from $416 in FY1968 to over $1,800 in FY2002. The federal total for 1973 was raised by $101 million to include Title X family planning. Data for FY1975-FY1999 were revised to incorporate new estimates and historical data for added programs. Federal expenditures accounted for over 70% of total spending, with the federal share declining from 76% in 1978-1980 to an average of 71.4% in the 1993-2002 decade. Major welfare policy changes occurred from 1968-2002. Major Welfare Policy Changes (1968-2002) included liberalizing and establishing new welfare programs. Congress expanded Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with a work incentive bonus, abolished minimum rents for public housing, converted the Food Stamp program into a federal income guarantee, adopted basic educational opportunity grants for needy college students, and enacted Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for the aged, blind, and disabled. In 1974, food stamps were extended nationwide, providing an income guarantee. In 1981, Congress restricted eligibility and lowered benefits for some programs. This included imposing income limits for AFDC and food stamps, reducing benefits for families with earnings, and raising public housing rents. Congress later restored food stamp benefit rules for workers in 1985 and expanded Medicaid eligibility in 1986. In 1996, Congress repealed AFDC, JOBS, and Emergency Assistance, replacing them with a fixed annual block grant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), through FY2002. State TANF programs must condition eligibility on work and impose a lifetime limit. The 1996 law (P.L.104-193) established TANF programs with work requirements, lifetime limits on aid, and work participation rates for full funding. It also ended welfare benefits for non-citizens, added work requirements to the Food Stamp program, expanded federal funding for child care, and introduced welfare-to-work grants, S-CHIP, and a child tax credit. Federal and state-local welfare spending increased significantly from 1968 to 2002 in constant 2002 dollars. Federal spending for income-tested benefits rose by 529%, while state-local welfare spending increased by 508%. Total welfare outlays grew by 523%, with cash aid being the primary form of federal welfare until 1980 when it was surpassed by medical benefits. Since 1979, welfare spending has increased steadily, with medical benefits accounting for over 50 cents of every dollar spent by state-local governments. Federal welfare outlays have also risen, with medical assistance making up about 25% in the mid-80s, over 30% in the 1990s, and averaging 43% in 2000-2002. Welfare spending as a component of the federal budget averaged 13% from 1975-1979, dropped to 12% in the 1980s, and has equaled or exceeded 17% since 1994. In 2001, welfare spending rose above 18%, reaching 18.6%. The earned income tax credit is the largest income-tested cash benefit program for families with children, with $27.8 billion paid out in FY2002. This almost equaled federal SSI payments and was five times more than cash assistance from TANF federal dollars. The composition of total spending for income-tested benefits has dramatically changed since 1978, with medical benefits surpassing cash aid in FY2000 and reaching over 50% of total welfare spending by then. In FY2000, outlays for medical benefits exceeded cash aid, reaching 54% in 2002. Noncitizens' eligibility for federal means-tested benefits depends on immigration status and arrival date in the US. Welfare eligibility for noncitizens was restricted by the 1996 welfare law, with modifications made since then. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171) expanded food stamp eligibility for legal permanent residents (LPRs), including children and those who meet a 5-year residence test. Refugees and asylees are eligible for SSI benefits, Medicaid, and food stamps for 7 years after arrival, and for 5 years for TANF. LPRs with a work history or military connection may qualify with 10 years of work or military service. Legal permanent residents (LPRs) are eligible for major benefits if they were legally resident as of August 22, 1996. Those who received SSI by that date continue to be eligible for it. Disabled LPRs are eligible for SSI and food stamps, elderly LPRs (65+) are eligible for food stamps, and LPR children (under 18) are eligible for food stamps until they turn 18. LPRs who meet SSI noncitizen eligibility tests must receive Medicaid. LPRs who entered the US after August 22, 1996, are initially barred from TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid for 5 years, but may be eligible for these benefits thereafter. In 2002, 7.2 million families, including 5.4 million with children, had income below the poverty threshold. The poverty rate among related children was 16.3%, the highest since 1999. 34.6 million people were classified as poor based on pre-tax income, with 66.6% receiving means-tested aid from various programs. In 2002, 5.7 million families with children were poor before receiving cash aid from TANF, GA, or EITC. Among them, 3.4 million had a female householder and 2.3 million had a male householder. Majority of female-headed families and male-present families received means-tested aid, with percentages varying. In 2002, a significant number of families with children were poor before receiving cash aid. The majority of male-present families received the EITC as the dominant form of aid, while female-headed families received various combinations of cash and noncash aid. Over 90% of programs in the report have an explicit income test for eligibility. The report classifies benefit programs by type of income test, including federal poverty guidelines, state median income, and lower living standard levels. Tables provide poverty thresholds, income eligibility limits for meals, and income levels for Medicaid eligibility. States must extend Medicaid to certain individuals below the federal poverty income guideline, including pregnant women, children born after September 30, 1983, the aged, the blind, and the disabled. Eligibility is determined by state, locality, Indian tribe, or Alaskan Native village. Those not qualifying for TANF cash assistance but income-eligible for AFDC under July 16, 1996 terms are eligible for Medicaid, foster care, and adoption assistance. Veterans receiving pensions or eligible for Medicaid are automatically eligible for free VA medical care. States with Medicaid limits for children at or above 200% of the poverty guideline may provide S-CHIP to children within 150% of the Medicaid limit. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant law aims to provide quality services to mothers and children with low income, based on federal poverty guidelines. Free care is limited to those below the poverty income guidelines, with fees charged to nonpoor residents. States determine the need for optional state supplements to Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and blind or disabled children eligible for SSI can also receive adoption assistance. The eligibility for adoption assistance is based on recipients of SSI, GA, or TANF automatically meeting food stamp assets and income tests. Food stamp eligibility also qualifies for free school lunch and breakfast programs. States may grant automatic eligibility to public assistance recipients based on economic or social need. Preference is given to those with the greatest need, determined by the federal needs analysis methodology. There is no income test for migratory children, and forgiveness of loans is available for needy students who do not complete their studies. Educational institutions use an approved needs analysis system to determine loan eligibility. The law defines exceptional financial need for health professional scholarships and loans to students of medicine and osteopathy. Educational institutions must determine financial assistance for migratory students and economically disadvantaged middle and secondary students. Federal income ceiling is 85% of state median for families of the same size. Child Care Development Block Grant funds must primarily benefit TANF families or those at risk of becoming eligible. Families aided with TANF dollars transferred to Title XX must not exceed 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. The federal poverty guidelines determine eligibility for benefits, with a preference for low-income individuals. States can set limits below federal ceilings but not below 110% of the federal poverty guideline. Tables provide specific income thresholds for various programs. The Lower Living Standard Income Level (LLSIL) is used for eligibility purposes under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). It sets the minimum pay needed for self-sufficiency at 100% of the LLSIL. WIA defines terms like \"low-income individual\" and \"disadvantaged adult\" based on the LLSIL or poverty line. The Internal Revenue Code defines \"economically disadvantaged\" as total family income not exceeding 70% of the Lower Living Standard Income Level (LLSIL). The replacement of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) affected Medicaid eligibility, with only those meeting specific criteria being entitled to coverage. After AFDC was replaced by TANF, Medicaid operated with a federal matching formula based on a state's per capita income. The federal matching rate for services averaged 57% for FY2000-FY2002, with federal outlays totaling $146.2 billion in FY2002. The federal share of administrative costs is generally 50%, but can be as high as 100% for certain items. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is higher for states with lower per capita incomes and lower for states with higher per capita incomes, with a minimum FMAP of 50% and a maximum of 83%. The federal matching rate for Medicaid services is determined by the FMAP formula, with a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 83%. The FMAP is based on the average per capita income of each state compared to the national average. Family planning services receive a higher federal match rate of 90%. Temporary changes to federal matching rates were made by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (P.L. 108-27) altered Medicaid matching rates for specific quarters in FY2003 and FY2004. States were held harmless for declines in federal matching rates and received a 2.95 percentage point increase. Program costs in FY2002 totaled $258 billion, with $147 billion from federal funds. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal law and state decisions, with some groups being mandatory and others optional. Medicaid eligibility is determined by federal law, with some groups being mandatory and others optional. Federal law places limitations on the categories of individuals that can be covered, with specific eligibility rules for groups within those categories. Medicaid traditionally covered low-income families with dependent children, low-income persons with disabilities, and low-income elderly. Additional coverage groups were added in the 1980s for higher income children and pregnant women. Over 50 distinct population groups are identified in federal law, some mandatory and some optional. Medicaid eligibility is complex due to mandatory and optional groups, with financial criteria determining qualification. States have flexibility in defining income and assets limits, leading to varying standards among states and different standards for different population groups. This results in individuals being automatically eligible in one state, needing to pay medical expenses in another, and not eligible in a third state. Families, pregnant women, and children are the main groups covered by Medicaid. Medicaid eligibility for families, pregnant women, and children is determined by meeting AFDC standards or targeted Medicaid expansions. The AFDC program was replaced by TANF under PRWORA and BBA 97. States must cover families meeting AFDC requirements as of July 16, 1996, with flexibility to adjust income and resource standards. Medicaid assistance can be adjusted based on income/resource standards, with options to raise or lower them. States must provide Medicaid for recipients of adoption assistance and foster care. Transitional benefits are available for families who lose eligibility due to increased employment or earnings. Medicaid coverage can be extended for 6 to 12 months if eligibility is lost due to increased earnings or hours of employment. States have the option to extend Medicaid coverage to additional groups such as former foster care recipients ages 18-20 and children up to age 21 in families meeting certain income criteria. Beginning in 1984, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and children based on income levels, rather than ties to welfare programs. States must cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines. Pregnant women are covered for pregnancy-related services through 60 days postpartum, while children receive full Medicaid coverage. States are also required to extend coverage to certain groups like former foster care recipients and children up to age 21 in low-income families. States are required to cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines. Pregnant women are covered for pregnancy-related services through 60 days postpartum. Optional provisions allow states to cover pregnant women and infants under age 1 with family incomes up to 185% of the federal poverty level. States can also extend coverage to additional pregnant women and children through waivers and Medicaid expansions under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Under SCHIP, most states cover children under age 19 in families with income at or above 200% of the federal poverty level. States can extend Medicaid eligibility for child beneficiaries for up to 12 months without redetermination. Medicaid also covers pregnant women and children under 19 on a \"presumptive\" basis. Medicaid provides coverage for individuals receiving cash assistance through SSI, covers Medicare cost-sharing obligations, and includes long-term care services. The SSI program, established in 1972, replaced previous federal-state cash assistance programs. The SSI program, established in 1972, replaced previous federal-state cash assistance programs for the aged, blind, and disabled. Income and resource standards are defined in federal law. States may supplement SSI payments for aged persons living independently. States are generally required to cover SSI recipients under their Medicaid programs, with the option to use more restrictive eligibility standards if authorized under Section 209(b) of the Social Security Act. States using more restrictive income standards must allow applicants to \"spend down\" by deducting medical expenses from income before determining Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid coverage must continue for certain individuals who lose SSI or state supplement payments, such as disabled persons who return to work and lose SSI eligibility due to earnings but still meet all other criteria for SSI except income. Medicaid coverage must continue for individuals who lose SSI due to earnings but still meet all other criteria, including disabled persons returning to work. States are also required to continue Medicaid for certain SSI-related groups and optional coverage for individuals not receiving SSI. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, states can offer Medicaid to disabled SSI beneficiaries with incomes up to 250% of the FPL. The Ticket to Work legislation of 1999 allows states to cover employed disabled individuals with higher income and resource levels. States may also cover working individuals whose medical condition has improved, requiring them to pay premiums based on income. Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, states can offer Medicaid to disabled SSI beneficiaries with incomes up to 250% of the FPL. The Ticket to Work legislation of 1999 allows states to cover employed disabled individuals with higher income and resource levels. States may also cover working individuals whose medical condition has improved, requiring them to pay premiums based on income. Additionally, states have the option to extend Medicaid to certain elderly or disabled persons, including those eligible for SSI but not receiving it, and individuals whose income does not exceed 100% of the FPL. Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) are aged or disabled Medicare beneficiaries with incomes no greater than 100% of the FPL and assets no greater than $4,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a couple, who are eligible to have some of their Medicare cost-sharing expenses paid for by Medicaid. Under the Medicaid program, states are required to cover the cost of Medicare premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMB) with incomes no greater than 100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and assets below $4,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a couple. Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMB) have incomes between 100% and 120% of the FPL and are only covered for the monthly Medicare Part B premium. Other Medicaid services are not covered unless they qualify through other eligibility pathways. The QI-1 eligibility pathway applies to aged and disabled Medicare beneficiaries with incomes between 120% and 135% of the FPL. States pay the monthly Medicare Part B premium until the federal allotment is depleted. QDWIs have their Medicare Part A premiums paid by states if their incomes are below 200% of the FPL and they are not eligible for Medicaid. States may provide Medicaid to certain otherwise ineligible groups of persons who are in nursing facilities or other institutions, with a special income standard not exceeding 300% of the maximum SSI benefit. This allows coverage for individuals with incomes above SSI levels. Both the medically needy and those eligible under the \"300% rule\" must contribute their available income to the costs of their care. Medicaid has post-eligibility rules for beneficiaries' income contribution to care costs. \"Spousal impoverishment\" protections prevent one spouse from being impoverished if the other needs nursing home care. States can obtain waivers to provide home and community-based services to certain individuals. In 2002, 35 states and the District of Columbia provided Medicaid to medically needy persons who do not meet income or resource requirements but meet nonfinancial standards for coverage. Individuals can spend down to the medically needy standard by incurring medical expenses. States can set income standards for medically needy programs up to 133 and 1/3% of the standard used for cash assistance programs. Maximum income standards for families with children can be one-third more than the former AFDC program, and for individuals with disabilities or elderly, it can be one-third more than the SSI income standard. States may limit who receives medically needy coverage but must include all children under 18 and pregnant women with low income or resources. Under Section 1115 waivers, states can experiment with new approaches for Medicaid coverage, including extending it to the uninsured with incomes below 200% of the FPL. The HIFA Initiative encourages states to seek waivers to maximize private insurance options. Some states have used waivers under Section 1115 to extend health insurance coverage to low-income children and families. Legal immigrants arriving in the US after August 22, 1996 are ineligible for Medicaid for 5 years, with coverage being a state option after that. States are required to provide Medicaid to certain legal immigrants and refugees/asylees for a specific period after entry or asylum is granted. Legal immigrants and refugees/asylees in the US are eligible for Medicaid for a specific period after entry or asylum is granted. States must provide emergency Medicaid services to all legal and undocumented non-citizens who meet the financial and categorical eligibility requirements. Medicaid Purchase of COBRA Coverage allows employees or dependents leaving a firm with 20 or more employees to continue buying insurance. Employees leaving a firm with 20 or more employees can continue buying insurance through the group for 18 to 36 months. The employer may charge a premium of no more than 102% of the average plan cost. State Medicaid programs may pay the premiums for COBRA continuation coverage if cost-effective and eligibility requirements are met. States are required to offer various healthcare services to recipients. The Medicaid program covers a range of services for individuals under 21, including family planning, nurse-midwife services, and physician services. States must also provide transportation to medical care providers for Medicaid-eligible individuals. Federal law mandates coverage for ambulatory services for children and pregnant women, as well as home health services for those entitled to nursing facility care. The Medicaid program offers a variety of services for individuals, including coverage for mental health institutions and intermediate care facilities. States must provide mandatory services to all covered groups, with the option to offer additional services such as prescription drugs and inpatient psychiatric care. States have the flexibility to limit the amount, duration, and scope of care provided under each service category. In FY2000, 44.3 million people were covered by Medicaid, with aged, blind, and disabled individuals accounting for 25% of enrollment but 70% of program spending. Total federal and state Medicaid spending increased by 25% from $206.1 billion to $258.2 billion between FY2000 and FY2002. Medicaid outlays from federal funds in FY2002 totaled $146.2 billion, with total FY2003 expenditures expected to reach roughly $278 billion. In FY2003, Congress provided $23.9 billion for VA medical services, with an expected caseload of nearly 4.9 million unique patients. The VA also used $1.836 billion from the Medical Care Collections Fund for medical care. Additionally, the VA provides per diem payments to states for eligible veterans' care in state facilities and extends medical care to certain spouses and children. The VA provides medical care to certain spouses and children of service-connected disabled veterans under CHAMPVA. FY2002 appropriations for low-income veterans totaled $8.1 billion. Eligibility for VA medical benefits varies, with high-priority veterans receiving full services. Services for lower-priority veterans depend on space and resources availability. Veterans with severe, service-connected disabilities have the highest priority for medical services. Access for other veterans varies based on factors like severity of condition, income level, and type of service. No evidence of service denials at VA facilities in FY2002, with exceptions for nursing home care based on availability. Veterans are encouraged to enroll in regional VA health care plans for better management of medical needs. The VA provides free medical care to veterans who meet low-income standards, with an estimated 7 million out of 25 million veterans qualifying for this assistance. Care plans enrollment for certain veterans has been temporarily halted. Veterans who meet low-income standards are eligible for free medical care from the VA, with about 38% of applications coming from those meeting income criteria. Benefits include inpatient hospital care, nursing home care, domiciliary care, and outpatient care. VA facilities also offer free medications to eligible veterans, with copayments for others. Reported income is subject to verification, and once eligible, veterans remain so until reevaluation. VA contracts with other facilities to provide care to veterans. The VA is the largest provider of inpatient psychiatric services, specializes in treatments for spinal injuries and prosthetics, and conducts research in various medical fields. It offers medical care to 25 million veterans, with 15% utilizing the services. In FY2002, the VA provided care for 4.7 million persons through inpatient episodes and outpatient visits. The Veterans Health Administration operated hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, domiciliaries, and a pharmaceutical supply apparatus. Medical care appropriations were $21.3 billion in FY2002, $23.5 billion in FY2003. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, providing federal matching funds for states to offer health insurance to low-income children. Congress appropriated $39.7 billion in SCHIP grants for 10 years. Federal funding for FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004 was $3.2 billion each year, with state matching funds estimated at $1.6 billion for FY2002. Funding allotment among states is determined by a formula based on the number of low-income children and uninsured individuals. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) formula is based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children in the state, with a cost factor representing average health service industry wages. States submit program plans to CMS and have 3 fiscal years to use funding. Unspent funds are redistributed to states that have fully spent their allotments. SCHIP is a federal-state matching program like Medicaid. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is a federal-state matching program where the federal government matches state spending up to the state's allotment. The state's share of program spending is determined by the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage. There is a limit on SCHIP administrative expenses, with a 10% cap on state administrative expenses for federal matching purposes. Under SCHIP, states define eligibility factors for low-income children, including geography, age, income, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of eligibility. Funds cannot be used for children eligible for Medicaid or with group health plans. States can cover children with family incomes above Medicaid standards but below 200% of the federal poverty guideline, or above 200% with a 50 percentage point buffer. The Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Initiative, announced by the Bush Administration in August 2001, encourages states to coordinate Medicaid and SCHIP with private health insurance coverage for uninsured individuals with income below 200% of the federal poverty level. Unspent SCHIP funds could be used to finance the HIFA Initiative. The Bush Administration announced the Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability (HIFA) Initiative in August 2001 to coordinate Medicaid and SCHIP with private health insurance for uninsured individuals below 200% of the federal poverty level. CMS approved 14 SCHIP 1115 waivers, with seven being SCHIP HIFA demonstrations allowing states to cover new groups like pregnant women and childless adults. States can choose to expand Medicaid, create a separate state program, or use a combination approach. As of July 8, 2003, 20 jurisdictions implemented Medicaid expansions, 19 created separate state programs, and 17 developed a combination approach. States covering low-income children under Medicaid must provide mandatory benefits. Children under Medicaid must provide the full range of mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. States creating a separate state insurance program for uninsured children can choose from three benefit options: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or another health benefits plan approved by the Secretary. Benchmark benefit package options include plans from Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee health coverage, or the largest HMO in the state. Benchmark equivalent coverage is defined as a package of benefits that is equivalent to the benchmark options. Benchmark equivalent coverage is a state option for providing coverage that must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, lab services, and well-child care. It must also cover at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, mental health services, vision services, and hearing services. States are encouraged to cover other services as well, but abortions are only allowed in specific circumstances. Title XXI allows states to determine the coverage for Medicaid, with the exception of cases involving rape, incest, or saving the mother's life. Benchmark equivalent plans can limit benefits as long as they are actuarially equivalent. Cost-sharing is not allowed for well-baby or well-child care services, and American Indian and Alaskan Native children are exempt. States covering low-income children must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules. Generally, Medicaid does not allow cost-sharing for medical services. Medicaid does not allow cost sharing for medical services, and cost sharing for program participation is limited to nominal amounts. Premiums or enrollment fees for separate state SCHIP programs are subject to limits. Income-related charges for families under 150% of the federal poverty line must not exceed amounts set by federal Medicaid regulations. Service-related cost-sharing for children varies based on family income, with limits on nominal amounts for those at or below 100% FPL and adjusted nominal amounts for those between 101% and 150% FPL. Adjusted nominal amounts must reflect enrollees' ability to pay, with cost-sharing maximums not exceeding 5% of family income for targeted low-income children. States must inform families of limits, provide a way to stop payments once limits are reached, and give notice of missed payments before disenrollment. Enrollment in the SCHIP program increased significantly over the years. By FY2002, total enrollment reached 5.3 million children, with 1.3 million covered under Medicaid expansions and 4.0 million in separate state programs. Additionally, adult enrollment reached 349,118 in FY2002. SCHIP spending has also increased over time, with federal expenditures totaling $122 million in FY1998. In FY2002, federal SCHIP expenditures equaled $3.78 billion, with state spending exceeding program appropriations for the first time. More states are expected to spend all available funds, leading to potential shortfalls in the program from FY2003 to FY2006. Total federal SCHIP spending is projected to grow to $5.0 billion in FY2007. Total federal SCHIP spending is projected to reach $5.0 billion in FY2007. No federal funds are available for the program, with some states fully funding medical assistance for certain recipients. In FY2002, estimated GA medical payments totaled $5 billion, with some states offering Medicaid to GA cash recipients through waivers. To qualify for GA medical assistance, individuals must demonstrate financial need and reside in a participating area. Some states required recipients to be in medical need or meet specific income criteria for medical aid. Ohio, for example, provided medical assistance to all GA recipients and needy individuals at risk of incapacitation without medication. In some jurisdictions, GA medical eligibility rules are more lenient than for GA cash benefits. States like Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, D.C., and Massachusetts provided Medicaid to all GA recipients. Other states offered less comprehensive medical benefits, ranging from inpatient care to just physician services and prescription drugs. Maryland had programs for the medically indigent. Maryland's programs for the medically indigent offered basic physician services and limited prescription drugs. State-local outlays for GA medical assistance in FY2002 totaled $4,955.8 million, up 5% from FY2001 but down 10.4% from the FY1992 record high. In FY2002, Maryland's state-local outlays for GA medical assistance totaled $4,955.8 million. The composition of medical spending included hospital care, prescription drugs, payments to medical professionals, nursing homes, home health care, and durable medical equipment. Over the 1993-2003 decade, spending on prescription drugs increased significantly while hospital expenditures decreased. Indian Health Service appropriations are allocated based on historical or program continuity basis among its 12 service areas. In FY2002, the Indian Health Service (IHS) collected $514 million in reimbursements, up from $484 million in FY2001. Total program appropriations for FY2002 were $2.824 billion, an increase of $135 million from the previous year. IHS funds are used by Indian tribes to deliver health services to their communities, and the Service collects reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid for services provided to eligible populations. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received $514 million in reimbursements in FY2002, up from $484 million in FY2001. Total program appropriations for FY2002 were $2.824 billion, an increase of $135 million from the previous year. The IHS serves American Indian or Alaskan Native (AI/AN) individuals who are members of federally recognized tribes, residing within specific areas, with no income test required. The program reaches urban areas as well, with contracts in place to make health services more accessible to urban Indians. In total, IHS programs serve around 1.6 million AI/AN individuals. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides free hospital, medical, dental, and environmental health services to 1.6 million American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals through various facilities and programs. Reimbursements are received for services provided to those with private insurance. Safety Net Amendments of 2002, P.L. 107-251, reauthorized the health centers grant program through FY2006 under the Public Health Service Act. The program includes various types of health centers for underserved populations, funded by grants from the Bureau of Primary Health Care. Centers must seek third-party reimbursement and may receive contributions from state and local governments. Health centers receive grants from various sources like Medicare, Medicaid, state, and local governments. These grants can be for planning, operating, or infant mortality reduction. In FY2002, $1.3 billion was appropriated for health centers to provide services to underserved populations. Health centers receive grants for providing primary health services to underserved areas based on specific criteria. Profit-making organizations are not eligible for grants, and all residents in the area served are eligible for services. Free services are limited to families below the federal poverty income guidelines, with nominal fees for those above but below 200% of the poverty guideline. Individuals and families with incomes above the poverty guideline but below 200% are required to pay for services based on ability to pay. Health centers offer a range of primary health services, including diagnostic, treatment, preventive, emergency, transportation, and dental services. Funding for health centers in FY2003 was $1.5 billion, serving an estimated 9.6 million people. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant supports activities to improve the health of mothers and children. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds are distributed to state governments to pay for services, with some funds reserved for federal projects. States must contribute $3 for every $4 of federal funds awarded and allocate a minimum percentage for preventive and primary care services for children and services for children with special needs. States may use the remaining funds for other maternal and child health services. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds support child health services, with a portion allocated for administrative costs. Federal law mandates that a percentage of the appropriation be set aside for various activities, including research, training, genetic disease programs, and maternal and child health improvement. Additional funds are designated for CISS projects, which focus on initiatives like casemanagement and increasing participation of healthcare providers in the program. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds support child health services, with a portion allocated for administrative costs. FY2002 appropriations were $731 million, with non-federal matching funds estimated at $548 million. States determine eligibility criteria for MCH block grant services, targeting low-income mothers and children. Services provided may include prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant funds support child health services, including prenatal care, well-child care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and vision and hearing screening services. In FY2002, Title V provided services to pregnant women, infants, children with special health care needs, and women of child-bearing age. Charges for services are based on a sliding scale reflecting income, resources, and family size. Grants are provided for voluntary family planning services through the Title X program, with appropriations for FY2003 at $273 million. Priority is given to low-income individuals, particularly women aged 15-44 at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Clinics must offer services to all who request them. Title X program provides grants for family planning services to low-income families at risk of unplanned pregnancy. Clinics must offer services free of charge to those below 100% of the federal poverty income guidelines, with a sliding scale for those between 100% and 250%. Required services include a range of family planning methods, counseling, exams, infertility services, and referrals. Title X funds cannot be used for services not specified in the law. The Title X program provides grants for family planning services to low-income families, with clinics offering services free of charge to those below 100% of the federal poverty income guidelines. Approximately 4.8 million persons received family planning services in FY2002 through 4,600 clinic sites supported by 85 service grantees, including screenings for cervical cancer, breast cancer, and HIV tests. One-third of all clients served at Title X clinics are adolescents. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes federally funded medical assistance for needy refugees and asylees during their first 3 years in the United States. Funding has been appropriated since FY1992 to provide medical care for certain Cuban, Haitian entrants, and Amerasians. Since FY1992, funding has been provided for medical care for refugees and asylees for the first 8 months after entry, administered by the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). ORR expenditures for refugee medical assistance (RMA) totaled around $74 million in FY2002. Eligibility criteria include being admitted as a refugee or asylee, Cuban or Haitian paroled into the US, having an asylum application pending, or being a Vietnam-born Amerasian immigrant fathered by a US citizen. Under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, certain needy individuals, including refugees and Amerasian immigrants, are eligible for medical benefits for 7 years after entry. State Medicaid programs must offer basic services, but states have the authority to determine the scope of services and reimbursement rates. Since January 1974, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) has provided a minimum income floor, funded by U.S. general revenue and managed by the Social Security Administration (SSA). States can choose to provide additional payments to SSI recipients at their own expense, with a \"grandfather\" clause requiring supplements for certain individuals. States can either have the federal government administer supplements for all federal SSI recipients of the same class or administer their own supplements. The federal government administers supplements for 15 jurisdictions, with total SSI outlays in FY2002 at $38.5 billion. Title XVI of the Social Security Act entitles aged 65 and over, blind or disabled individuals to SSI payments if they meet income and resource limits and live in specific locations. To be eligible for SSI on grounds of disability, an adult must be unable to engage in any \"substantial gainful activity\" due to a medically determined physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or lasting at least 12 months. A child under 18 may qualify as disabled if they have an impairment resulting in \"marked and severe\" functional limitations. Additionally, a person must be a citizen of the United States or an immigrant enrolled in the program to qualify for SSI. To qualify for SSI benefits, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, an immigrant enrolled in the program, a refugee, an asylee, someone insured for Social Security, or a veteran/active duty member of the armed forces. Income limits for federal benefits in 2003 are $582 monthly for individuals and $829 for couples, with higher limits in states offering supplementary SSI benefits. SSI benefits have higher countable income limits, up to $907 monthly per individual in Alaska. The countable resource limit is $2,000 per individual and $3,000 per couple. Excluded assets include a home, household goods, an auto if needed for employment or medical treatment, a life insurance policy not exceeding $1,500 in cash surrender value, and burial plots and funds. Social Security Administration notifies beneficiaries aged 64 about their approaching eligibility for Medicare and SSI. Social Security Act establishes benefit levels and requires SSI benefits to increase with automatic cost-of-living adjustments. Social Security benefits are increased through automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), with SSI benefits also increasing by the same percentage. In 1983, Congress delayed the COLA until January 1984 and increased SSI benefits by $20 per month ($30 per couple). States supplementing SSI benefits are required to pass through federal basic benefit increases to recipients. However, when Congress deferred the 1983 COLA, states only passed through half of the increase. As of January 2002, state supplements for aged persons living independently ranged from $1.70 in Oregon to $362 in Alaska. SSI disregards a portion of recipients' earnings to ensure some gain from work. Aged SSI recipients without Social Security benefits or other unearned income can still receive a declining SSI payment until their gross earnings equal double their basic benefit plus $85 monthly. In states without supplementing the federal benefit, the gross income limit in 2003 for an aged SSI recipient with only wage income is $1,189 monthly. SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid in most states, except for 11 states with more restrictive eligibility rules. In 2003, rules require deducting medical expenses for SSI recipients to determine countable income. Disabled SSI recipients with earnings above $800 can receive special cash benefits to maintain Medicaid eligibility. In 1996, Congress ended benefits for those disabled due to drug or alcohol addiction. In December 2002, over 6.7 million people received federally administered SSI benefits, with average payments ranging from $322 to $488. In December 2002, SSI recipients received supplemental checks alongside Social Security benefits. Dual recipients averaged $414 in Social Security benefits and $318 in earnings. FY2002 SSI expenditures totaled $38.5 billion, with federal funds at $33.9 billion and state funds at $4.7 billion. Federal SSI spending accounted for 1.7% of all federal outlays and was 100% federally funded through the tax system. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) totaled $27.8 billion in FY2002. It is a refundable credit that does not require owing or paying income tax to receive. Eligible workers must apply for the credit by filing an income tax return. Married couples generally must file a joint income tax return to qualify. The EITC is based on earnings and the number of children, up to a maximum amount. It is reduced for earnings above a certain level. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is available to parents with earnings above the phase-out income level and a qualifying child. The child must be under age 19 (24 if a full-time student) and reside with the tax filer for more than half of the tax year. The tax filer must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien and live in the United States for more than half of the tax year. The EITC is also available to workers ages 25 through 64 with no eligible children. The EITC is available to workers ages 25 through 64 with no eligible children and AGI less than $11,060 ($12,060 for married couples) in tax year 2002. Congress established limits on investment income for EITC eligibility in 1995 and changed filing procedures in 1996 to prevent undocumented workers from accessing the credit. Congress also broadened the definition of income used to phase out the EITC for filing units above the phase-out income threshold in 1996 and 1997. Provisions against fraud were enacted in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, with penalties for fraudulent claims including a 10-year ban on claiming the EITC. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was enacted in 1975 as a temporary measure to return a portion of employment taxes to lower-income workers with children. It became permanent in 1978 with a maximum benefit of $500. Congress expanded the credit in the 1990s, including adjustments for family size and extension to childless workers. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 made changes for married tax filers filing jointly, increasing the phase-out range. Penalties are imposed for fraudulent claims, including a 10-year ban on claiming the EITC. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was expanded over the years, with changes for married tax filers and simplification of the credit calculation. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 clarified that EITC payments were not to be counted as income for certain means-tested programs. The 1996 welfare reform law ended federal rules for the treatment of the EITC by family welfare programs, allowing states to decide how to treat it in their TANF programs. However, TANF recipients engaged in work experience or community service may be disallowed the EITC for subsidized earnings. EITC benefit levels for tax years 2001-2003 are outlined in a table. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL31768(pdf), The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): An Overview. The 1996 welfare reform law repealed AFDC, EA, and JOBS programs, combining them into a TANF block grant. Federal funding for TANF cash aid in FY2002 was estimated at $10.4 billion. Each state receives an annual family assistance grant based on peak funding from FY1992-FY1995. Territories and Indian tribes are also entitled to TANF grants. The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC, EA, and JOBS programs with a TANF block grant. Indian tribes can operate their own family assistance plans with a block grant deducted from their state's TANF grant. Additional funds include supplemental grants, bonuses for states with declining non-marital birth ratios and high performance, matching grants for states with high unemployment, and Welfare-to-Work grants. The TANF law established Welfare-to-Work grants to help long-term welfare recipients find jobs, with state matching funds required. States must spend a specified amount of their own funds on TANF-eligible families to avoid penalties, with a maintenance-of-effort level set at 75% to 80% of historic expenditures. In FY2002, TANF outlays for cash assistance were estimated at $10.419 billion, with $4.848 billion (47%) from federal funds. Total administrative costs for the TANF block grant were $2.6 billion, with $1.6 billion (62%) from federal funds. TANF allows states to provide ongoing basic cash aid to needy families with children or pregnant women, with states determining who is considered \"needy.\" TANF allows states to provide ongoing cash aid to needy families with children or pregnant women. States determine eligibility based on various policies, including treating two-parent families like one-parent families, liberalizing earnings treatment, and increasing asset limits. State policy choices aim to restrict caseloads through benefit cutoffs, sanctions, welfare avoidance payments, and family caps. Some changes were initially implemented under waivers from AFDC law. Federal law excludes unwed mothers from TANF-funded cash aid. Federal law makes certain individuals ineligible for TANF-funded cash aid, including unwed mothers under 18, persons convicted of drug-related felonies, aliens entering the country after August 22, 1996, and those who fraudulently misrepresented residence to obtain benefits. TANF funds cannot be used for families with an adult who has received 60 months of assistance, except for limited exemptions. Some states have adopted time limits shorter than the federal 60-month limit for TANF assistance. A few states continue aid beyond 60 months using state or own funds. HHS data shows that a significant number of TANF families were exempt from the time limit, mainly child-only units or state-funded programs. In TANF plans, states offer \"diversion\" payments for immediate needs instead of ongoing aid. States enforce work requirements after 24 months of aid, with some opting for shorter time limits. Penalties are in place for states not meeting participation rates, with only specified work activities counting towards requirements. To meet work participation rates, TANF recipients must engage in specified work activities for a minimum number of hours weekly based on their family composition. Sanctions are imposed for non-compliance, including aid discontinuation or reduction. States have varying exemptions for single parents caring for young children, with some requiring work before the child turns one. The TANF program imposes penalties for work refusal, including aid discontinuation or reduction \"pro rata\" with the period of refusal. Penalties vary by state, with some ending benefits entirely for repeat offenses. Recipients must assign support rights to the state, and failure to cooperate can result in a 25% benefit reduction. Food stamp benefits may also be cut by up to 25% as a reinforcement of the cash penalty. States have the freedom to set income and resource limits under TANF, with most raising countable asset limits for cash recipients above the previous AFDC ceiling. Additionally, the Family Violence Option allows states to waive certain TANF rules for victims of domestic violence. States have increased countable asset limits for cash recipients under TANF, with some states excluding one vehicle from countable assets and others eliminating asset limits altogether. States also determine the amount of cash assistance provided to families with no income, with many offering incentives for work and savings. Some states have established lower maximum benefit schedules for those required to work, and several states implement a family cap for new babies born to TANF mothers. In January 2003, TANF maximum benefits for a three-person family varied by state, ranging from $170 in Mississippi to $923 in Alaska. While half of the states maintained benefits at pre-TANF levels, some states like Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, and West Virginia increased benefits. Wisconsin's W-2 program no longer considers family size for benefits, instead offering flat benefits based on required activity hours. The Wisconsin program offers benefits for 30 hours of work, with a $628 monthly payment for those unable to participate. Benefits are reduced for missed hours. Employers can receive a $300 wage subsidy, and childcare and health care plans are available for low-income families. Medicaid and other programs retained AFDC eligibility limits after the 1996 law. States must provide Medicaid coverage to those eligible for AFDC cash aid. The law increases AFDC income and resource standards based on the consumer price index since TANF enactment. It also provides 12 months of medical assistance for those losing TANF eligibility due to increased earnings. Foster care and adoption assistance funds are available for children eligible for AFDC cash aid. Nonassistance benefits must align with TANF goals and are not subject to time limits or work requirements. States determine eligibility and income limits for different services. Title IV-E of the Social Security Act provides federal matching funds to states for maintenance payments for low-income children in licensed foster care. The federal matching rate ranged from 50% to 76.62% in FY2003. The federal matching rate for foster care expenses ranges from 50% to 76.62%. States can claim federal payments for foster care if certain conditions are met, including a judicial determination of the child's welfare. In foster care, children must meet eligibility standards of the repealed AFDC program, be placed in a licensed home or institution, and have a written case plan. States determine payments to foster parents, and efforts must be made to prevent placement in foster care and reunify families when possible. Administrative costs in FY2002 accounted for 54% of federal spending for foster care. According to the Child Welfare League of America, maintenance payments for foster children vary widely among states, with average monthly payments in FY2000 ranging from $216 to $760 depending on the age of the child. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, established in 1986 and expanded in subsequent years, provides grants to assist foster children transitioning to independent living, including education and training vouchers. The Child Welfare League of America reports that maintenance payments for foster children vary by state. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program offers grants for education and training vouchers to help foster children transition to independent living. The federal government provides 100% funding for these programs through the tax system, with FY 2002 outlays totaling $5.1 billion. Taxpayers can claim a child credit if they have a dependent child under 17, with the credit phased out at higher income levels. The credit was established in 1998 at $400, increasing to $500 in 1999 and beyond. The child tax credit was established in 1998 at $400, increasing to $500 in 1999. The credit limit was raised to $1,000 per child for tax years 2003-2004 by the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The credit is refundable for up to 15% of the taxpayer's earned income above $10,000 starting in 2005. The child tax credit, established in 1998, increased to $1,000 per child for tax years 2003-2004. The credit is refundable and phased out based on income thresholds. General Assistance (GA) is a state and local program that helps low-income individuals who do not qualify for federal cash assistance programs like TANF or SSI. As of mid-1998, 25 states, including D.C., operated statewide GA cash programs with uniform eligibility rules. 20 programs were fully funded by the state, while five required cost-sharing with counties. Nine states had statewide programs with county variations, where all counties were required to operate and fund GA programs. In 10 states, counties were required to operate and fund GA programs, while one state had a uniform statewide program for the disabled. Most Virginia and many Wisconsin counties offered GA under state supervision and funding. In six states, some counties offered GA with county funding only. 18 states allowed GA for needy able-bodied adults in mid-1998, with restrictions in 13 states. Many states provided GA to disabled or elderly persons awaiting SSI approval. Many states provided General Assistance (GA) to disabled or elderly individuals awaiting SSI approval, as well as those with temporary disabilities or enrolled in drug/alcohol abuse treatment programs. Some states extended GA to \"unattached\" children not eligible for TANF. Eleven statewide programs had no categorical eligibility limits, offering aid to any needy individual not qualifying for federal assistance. In various states, income and asset limits for General Assistance (GA) eligibility vary, with some states setting limits as low as zero income for eligibility. The 1996 welfare law prohibits benefits for illegal aliens and excludes most legal aliens from GA. Some GA programs deny eligibility to legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996. Immigrants in some GA programs must apply for assistance. Since 1992, many General Assistance (GA) programs have been reduced or abolished in various states. Montana and Wisconsin made changes to their programs, while Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and D.C. ended benefits for certain groups. Six states tightened eligibility criteria for persons with disabilities, and the total number of statewide programs with time limits increased to nine. Two states removed time limits for persons with disabilities. Several states have removed time limits for persons with disabilities in their General Assistance programs. Maximum cash benefits vary greatly among states, with amounts ranging from $80 to $645 monthly. About three-fourths of states provide cash aid, while some states or counties offer only vendor payments or vouchers in special circumstances. In mid-1998, ongoing assistance was provided to recipients in various states with statewide programs, including Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Dakota, and Vermont. Most states imposed time limits on assistance, such as Arizona and Maryland with a 12-month limit out of 36, California with a 12-month limit for employable persons, and New Jersey with a 60-month lifetime limit. Other states had different limits for specific groups, such as Colorado with a 12-month lifetime limit for persons disabled by substance abuse and Pennsylvania with a 9-month lifetime limit for persons in substance abuse treatment and victims of domestic violence. In March 2003, enrollment in Massachusetts' EAEDC program increased by 5%, with benefits averaging $324. Michigan's Emergency Relief program saw a 77% enrollment increase in April 2003, with benefits averaging $377. Maryland's TEMHA program issued $2 million in vouchers in April 2003, benefiting about 14,709 persons. New York spent $68 million in April 2003 on \"safety net\" assistance for 283,958 persons. In March 2003, California paid $22.3 million in general relief to 95,177 cases, with benefits averaging $234 per case. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that direct cash assistance for noncategorical aid totaled $2.968 billion in FY2000 and $2.956 billion in FY2001. Federal outlays for veterans' and survivors' pensions reached $3.164 billion in FY2002. Federal outlays for veterans' pensions in FY2002 totaled $3.164 billion. Eligibility requires a discharge from active service of 90 days or more during a period of war, with disability unrelated to military service or misconduct. Survivor pensions are provided to spouses and children of wartime veterans who died from nonservice-connected causes, with no disability requirement for survivors. The Department of Veterans Affairs pays monthly amounts to qualified veterans to reach specified income levels, with increases for veterans with service in World War II. Since January 1, 1979, veterans' pensions have been processed under the Improved Law program, which provides higher benefits but has eliminated most exclusions, offsetting countable income dollar-for-dollar. This program accounts for 98% of pension costs and about 88% of beneficiaries. Pensions are not payable to veterans with substantial assets, and countable income can be reduced for medical and educational expenses. Pensions awarded before 1979 were paid under Old Law and Prior Law programs with complex rules regarding income and exclusions. Veterans with service in World War I or earlier receive increased levels of benefits. The Improved Law program, which accounts for 98% of pension costs and 88% of beneficiaries, provides federal matching funds to states for parents adopting low-income children with special needs. The federal matching rates range from 50% to 76.62%, with additional matching for certain expenses. The 1986 tax reform legislation amended the adoption assistance program to provide federal matching for non-recurring adoption expenses. In FY2002, outlays were $2.5 billion, with $1.3 billion from federal funds. Eligibility criteria include SSI or AFDC program standards. The federal matching program provides assistance to parents adopting low-income children with special needs, based on eligibility criteria such as SSI or AFDC program standards. The state adoption assistance agency determines the amount of adoption payment, which cannot exceed foster care costs. Children receiving assistance are eligible for Medicaid until age 18. The federal government provides 100% funding for dependency and indemnity compensation for parents of veterans who died from a service-connected cause. Countable annual income limits in 2003 are specified for eligibility, with exclusions for certain types of income. The DIC program for parents of deceased veterans provides compensation benefits based on net worth rules. The maximum monthly benefit for a sole surviving parent is $464, for both surviving parents is $334 each, and for individual surviving parents living with the other parent or spouse is $314. Additional aid and attendance allowance of $250 is provided in 2003. The General Assistance (GA) program for Indians, administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), provides a monthly allowance of $250 in 2003. Tribes can create their own GA programs with different eligibility rules and benefits, as long as they cover any cost increase and receive BIA approval. The Snyder Act ensures 100% federal funding for GA to needy Indians who are members of recognized tribes or Alaskan Natives with Native blood. Federally recognized tribes in 34 states, with 24 having BIA GA programs. Total federal obligations in FY2002 were $66.5 million. Persons eligible for General Assistance (GA) from federally recognized tribes must meet needy standards based on the state's TANF program. They cannot receive TANF or SSI, must reside in the tribe's service area, and actively seek work unless exempt. Earned income disregards are considered in benefit calculations. Certain sums of earned income are disregarded in determining General Assistance (GA) benefits, including taxes, work-related expenses, child care costs, and shelter costs. An allowance for shelter costs is also deducted from countable income. Additionally, the first $2,000 in liquid resources annually available to the household and home produce are disregarded as income or resources. Eligibility for GA must be reviewed periodically, every 3 months for persons not exempt from seeking work and every 6 months for all participants. General Assistance (GA) eligibility must be reviewed every 3 months for those not exempt from seeking work and every 6 months for all participants. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) expects a decline in the GA caseload in FY2003 and FY2004. The program provides cash payments, work experience, and training to increase self-sufficiency. GA payments are based on state need standards under the TANF program, with exceptions for certain populations. The GA program provides cash payments, work experience, and training to increase self-sufficiency. GA payments are based on state need standards under the TANF program, with exceptions for certain populations. Maximum monthly TANF benefits vary by state. GA recipients participating in the Tribal Work Experience Program receive an extra monthly payment for work experience and job skills training. The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes federally funded cash assistance for refugees and asylees in the United States for up to 3 years. Funding for cash assistance has been limited to the first 8 months since FY1992. The Office of Refugee Resettlement administers these benefits, with estimated expenditures of $41 million in FY2002. Eligibility criteria include being admitted as a refugee or asylee, or being paroled as a refugee or asylee. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, certain individuals are eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for up to 5 years after entry, including refugees, asylees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Vietnam-born Amerasian immigrants fathered by a U.S. citizen. Financial eligibility tests must be met to qualify for TANF. Refugees who meet the state's financial eligibility tests but are not categorically eligible for TANF or SSI qualify for Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA). Their participation in RCA is at the state's option after a 5-year period, similar to legal permanent residents. Employable RCA recipients must accept suitable job offers and register for employment. Refugees eligible for SSI can receive benefits for 7 years after entry, with eligibility continuing if they were receiving SSI before August 22, 1996. Refugees who are not categorically eligible for TANF or SSI may qualify for Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) based on the state's financial eligibility tests. RCA payment levels are determined by the state's TANF payment for a family of the same size. Federal funds cover food stamp benefits, administrative costs, and a majority of employment and training program costs for recipients. States are responsible for the remaining food stamp expenses. In Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas, federal funds provide grants for nutrition assistance benefits instead of food stamps. The grants are set by law and indexed for inflation, totaling $1.4 billion in FY2003. The Food Stamp program has eligibility tests including income limits, asset limitations, employment requirements, and restrictions on noncitizens. Households receiving cash aid from TANF, SSI, or GA programs are automatically eligible for food stamps for up to 5 months after leaving the program. Other households must have monthly income below the federal poverty guidelines to qualify, with adjustments made annually for inflation. Additionally, households without elderly or disabled members must have gross monthly income below 130% of the poverty guidelines to qualify. Certain income exclusions apply, and changes in income limits take effect each October. Certain payments are excluded from household income, such as vendor payments to third parties, irregular income up to $30 per quarter, income for caring for someone outside the household, nonrecurring lump-sum payments like tax refunds, federal earned income tax credits, federal energy assistance, reimbursements for expenses, children's school earnings, self-employment income costs, education assistance under Title IV, certain student aid, payments under the Workforce Investment Act, and income set aside by disabled individuals. Certain payments are excluded from household income, including vendor payments to third parties, irregular income up to $30 per quarter, income for caring for someone outside the household, nonrecurring lump-sum payments, federal earned income tax credits, federal energy assistance, reimbursements for expenses, children's school earnings, self-employment income costs, education assistance under Title IV, payments under the Workforce Investment Act, and income set aside by disabled SSI recipients under an approved plan to achieve self-sufficiency. States may also exclude income when judging TANF or Medicaid eligibility within certain limits. Counted net monthly income deducts a standard monthly deduction, 20% of earned income, dependent care expenses, out-of-pocket medical expenses for elderly or disabled household members, and shelter expenses exceeding 50% of remaining income after other deductions. The monthly net and gross income limits for the period October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004 are set out in tables for eligible households. Liquid assets must not exceed $2,000 or $3,000 if an elderly or disabled member is included, excluding certain resources like a residence and business assets. The value of a vehicle owned by an applicant household is counted as an asset based on state rules, with the fair market value above $4,650 being counted in some states. The food stamp asset test does not apply to automatically eligible TANF, SSI, and GA households; states may disregard assets not counted in their TANF or Medicaid programs. Nonworking able-bodied adults must fulfill employment-related requirements to maintain eligibility, exempting those caring for dependents. Exempt from work requirements are individuals caring for dependents, those already in another work program, those working 30 hours a week or earning minimum wage, postsecondary students, residents of drug treatment programs, the disabled, and individuals under 16 or over 60. Failure to meet requirements may result in disqualification for the household. Individual disqualification periods vary. Many able-bodied adults without dependents may be disqualified from food stamps if they received benefits for 3 months without working or participating in a work/training activity. They can re-enter the program by working 80 hours or participating in a work/training activity for 30 days. They are eligible for an additional 3-month period on food stamps if unemployed or not in a work/training activity, but only once every 36 months. States have the authority to waive the special rule for able-bodied adults without dependents in areas with high unemployment or lack of available jobs. Recipients must participate in work and training programs unless exempt. Other limitations include bans on eligibility for noncitizens, striking household members, and certain individuals. The summarized chunk includes bans on eligibility for certain individuals, such as nonworking postsecondary students without families, persons living in institutional settings (with exceptions), those who have violated welfare program rules, boarders, and those who have intentionally violated program rules or failed to cooperate. Additionally, there are restrictions on asset transfers to gain eligibility and denial of eligibility for SSI recipients. The Food Stamp Act specifies maximum monthly allotments based on a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet. Actual allotments are determined by subtracting 30% of counted monthly income. Minimum benefits are legislatively set at $10 per month for households of one or two persons. Maximum allotments for FY2004 are shown in a table. The maximum monthly food stamp allotments for FY2004 are shown in a table, with rural AK levels higher than urban AK. Legislation pending as of Oct. 28, 2003, is set to increase allotments slightly. Food stamp benefits are accessed through EBT cards for purchasing food items at approved stores. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price lunches served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. Cash subsidies consist of a basic payment for every lunch served and additional special assistance for lower-income children. The federal government also provides commodity assistance for each meal served. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price lunches served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. Cash subsidies and commodity aid are legislatively set and annually indexed. State and local government funds, children's payments, and federal subsidies help finance lunches. Charges are imposed for reduced-price lunches and lunches served to children who do not qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. States must contribute to lunch program revenues, but no matching funds are required for extra federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches. All children are eligible to receive at least a partially subsidized lunch. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price lunches served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. All children are eligible to receive at least a partially subsidized lunch in participating schools and RCCIs, with higher subsidies for free or reduced-price meals. Eligibility is based on family income, with free lunch for those at or below 130% of the poverty guidelines and reduced-price lunch for those between 130% and 185% of the guidelines. The federal government provides cash subsidies for free or reduced-price school lunches based on family income. Reimbursement rates for the 2002-2003 school year were $2.14 for free lunch, $1.74 for reduced-price lunch, and 20 cents for full-price lunch. Benefits are provided to local school food authorities through state education agencies. The federal government provides cash and commodity assistance for meals served in schools and residential child care institutions. The assistance rate is adjusted annually for inflation, with a minimum of 15.25 cents per meal served. Schools can also expand their programs to cover snacks and suppers for children up to age 18 in after-school programs, with federal subsidies varying based on family income. In FY2002, over 90% of schools and RCCIs received federal subsidies for school lunch programs, with an average daily participation of 28 million children. 13.3 million children received free lunches, 2.6 million received reduced-price lunches, and 12 million received subsidized lunches at the full-price rate. Children receiving free or reduced-price lunches made up 57% of participants but accounted for over 90% of federal spending on the program. The Child Nutrition Act provides 100% federal funding for food costs, nutrition services, and administration. Money is also allocated for breast-feeding initiatives, local agencies' infrastructure development, small farmers' market nutrition programs, and research. State allocations are based on food and administration costs, inflation, poverty indices, and special initiatives. Section 17 of the Act makes lower-income mothers, infants, and children eligible for WIC benefits if judged to be at \"nutritional risk.\" The WIC program provides nutritional support to individuals at risk, including infants, children, pregnant and nursing mothers. Recipients must meet income criteria based on federal poverty guidelines. States can set lower income limits, but not below those for reduced-price school meals. The WIC program serves individuals at risk, including infants, children, pregnant, and nursing mothers. States can set lower income limits, but not below 100% of the poverty guidelines. Federal funding limits the program's ability to serve all eligible applicants, with a priority system in place to serve those at the greatest risk first. In FY2002, the program served nearly 7.5 million women, infants, and children with selected supplemental foods. Beneficiaries of the WIC program receive supplemental foods through vouchers or checks valid for specific prescribed items. Federal regulations dictate the types and quantities of food available, with state agencies having some flexibility in designing food packages. In FY2002, the average monthly federal cost of food in a WIC package was $35. Participants also receive breast-feeding support, nutrition education, and a nutritional risk evaluation. Monthly costs for these services averaged $13 per recipient in FY2002. In FY2002, monthly NSA costs for WIC services averaged $13 per recipient. States also operate a farmers' market nutrition program providing special vouchers for fresh foods. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act offers 100% federal funding for meals and snacks in child and adult day care centers. Payments vary based on family income or provider location. Federal subsidies are provided to licensed public and private nonresidential nonprofit child care, adult care, and Head Start centers, as well as some schools and family day care homes. For-profit child care institutions are also eligible, with limitations based on serving lower-income children. Participation is voluntary for all eligible centers and homes. Participation in federally subsidized meal programs for children and elderly clients in centers and homes is voluntary. Eligibility for free or reduced-price meals/snacks is based on household income, with subsidies varying accordingly. Income eligibility guidelines are adjusted annually. Unlike school meal programs, subsidies for individuals above income limits are smaller. Federal subsidies for meals in family day care homes are generally not differentiated by family income. Participating centers receive cash subsidies for up to two meals and one snack per day per recipient. The subsidies are the same as those provided for lunches or breakfasts under the School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. The program does not regulate the fees centers charge for meals. The federal subsidy structure for family day care homes differs from that of participating centers in the School Lunch and School Breakfast programs. Day care homes receive subsidies that do not vary based on family income, with two distinct annually indexed subsidy rates. Family day care homes receive annually indexed subsidy rates under the Child and Adult Care Food Program. \"Tier I\" homes in lower-income areas or operated by lower-income providers get higher cash subsidies, while \"Tier II\" homes receive lower subsidies. Organizations sponsoring homes receive monthly payments for administrative costs, and Tier II homes can request higher Tier I rates for low-income children with proper documentation. Public and private nonprofit organizations can also participate in the program. The Child and Adult Care Food Program allows public and private nonprofit organizations to receive federal subsidies for snacks and suppers served in after-school programs to children in lower-income areas. In FY2002, thousands of child care centers and adult care centers participated in the program. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal subsidies for free or reduced-price breakfasts served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal subsidies for breakfasts served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. Subsidies are also provided for full-price breakfasts to non-needy children, with certain schools receiving higher subsidies. State and local government funds, children's meal payments, and federal subsidies help finance breakfast programs. No charge is allowed for a free breakfast, but up to 30 cents can be charged for a reduced-price breakfast. All eligible schools and institutions can participate in the program if they serve meals meeting nutrition requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal subsidies for breakfasts served to needy children in schools and residential child care institutions. Schools must meet nutrition requirements set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, offer free or reduced-price meals to lower-income children, and not make a profit on their meal program. Children with family incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines are eligible for free breakfast, while those with incomes between 130% and 185% are eligible for reduced-price breakfast. Income eligibility guidelines are adjusted annually for inflation. Children from families receiving public assistance can also be certified eligible for free breakfasts. The School Lunch program provides federal cash reimbursement to schools and RCCIs for serving breakfasts. Reimbursement rates vary based on the type of breakfast served (free, reduced-price, full-price). In FY2002, 76% of schools and most RCCIs in the program operated breakfast programs, serving an average of 8.1 million children daily. In FY2002, 8.1 million children received free breakfasts, 700,000 ate reduced-price meals, and 1.4 million were subsidized at the full-price rate. Nutrition services for the elderly under Title III of the Older Americans Act are supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program includes congregate nutrition services, home-delivered nutrition services, and commodities or cash-in-lieu of commodities. Federal funds cover up to 85% of the cost of developing and operating local projects for congregate and home-delivered meal services. The Older Americans Act provides funds to states based on their share of the U.S. population aged 60 and over. States also receive funds from HHS for congregate and home-delivered meals. In FY2003, $714 million was allocated for the nutrition program. Eligible persons are aged 60 and over, with congregate meals available for those under 60 with disabilities in elderly housing facilities. The Older Americans Act provides funds for nutrition services primarily for the elderly, including congregate and home-delivered meals for those who are homebound or isolated. Preference is given to those with the greatest economic and social need, with income and noneconomic factors determining eligibility. Providers must offer meals located close to eligible older persons, with means tests prohibited. The Older Americans Act requires providers to offer at least one meal daily, meeting minimum dietary requirements. Participants are given the opportunity to contribute towards the cost of the meal, with suggested contribution schedules available. Service providers cannot deny nutrition services based on a failure to contribute. The law prohibits providers from denying older persons nutrition services for not contributing to the cost. Voluntary contributions must be used to expand services. The Emergency Food Assistance Program provides food to emergency feeding organizations for the homeless and needy. Cash grants help with administrative costs. Commodities are allocated based on poverty and unemployment rates. In FY2002, the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) distributed $361 million worth of federally donated commodities and federal support for distribution and administrative costs. State agencies select emergency feeding organizations based on their capacity to serve needy persons. Emergency feeding organizations, such as food banks, soup kitchens, and shelters, must serve needy individuals and have the capacity to store and handle commodities. Eligibility for receiving commodity packages is based on state-set criteria, including income-based standards to ensure assistance goes to those in need. The commodities for the program are purchased by the USDA to reduce agricultural surpluses or drawn from excess holdings. In recent years, appropriated funds have been used to acquire between one-third and one-half of the commodities distributed under TEFAP; the remainder were provided from surplus purchases and Commodity Credit Corporation stocks. Benefits include commodities provided to states for food banks, pantries, and other feeding agencies for distribution to individuals for at-home consumption or to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and central feeding centers serving meals to the poor. Commodities are packaged in sizes suitable for program use, with small packages for at-home consumption and larger sizes for meal service operations. In FY2002, USDA provided various food items such as fruits, vegetables, juices, beans, and meats. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act provides federal funding for summer programs serving meals and snacks to children, with no income tests for participation. Eligibility is based on the location of the program, where at least 50% of children come from families meeting income criteria for free or reduced-price meals. Food packages include items like fruits, vegetables, beans, meats, and dairy products, with consistent size and value for all recipients. Children from families meeting income criteria for free or reduced-price school lunches are eligible for federal support in summer programs. Sponsors can receive subsidies for providing food to eligible children, regardless of their location. Sponsorship is available to various organizations, including schools, camps, and nonprofits. In summer programs, sponsors can receive subsidies for providing meals to eligible children, with subsidy rates for meals and snacks specified. In 2002, 3,500 sponsors at 30,000 sites served 1.9 million children in July. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program operates in 112 project areas, offering services to participants. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) operates in 112 project areas, providing USDA commodities and funds for food packages to low-income individuals. Funding and commodities are distributed based on caseloads, with expansion funding available for new slots or projects. FY2002 funding was approximately. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) provides funding for food packages to low-income pregnant women, infants, children up to age 6, and elderly individuals. Eligibility is based on income levels below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines for women, infants, and children, and below 130% for the elderly. Recipients must also be at nutritional risk and live within the service area. In FY2004, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) served over 75% elderly recipients. Participants receive food commodities from local agencies based on Agriculture Department guidelines. Food packages include items like infant formula, cereals, canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and more. In FY2002, 427,000 individuals received monthly food packages valued at $16-$20. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) is an entitlement program funded under the government. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) is an entitlement program funded by the government, providing food packages to eligible households through Indian Tribal Organizations and state agencies. The USDA acquires food commodities for the program, with federal spending totaling $74 million in FY2002. The program covers at least 75% of administrative and distribution costs for the projects. The FDPIR allows ITOs or state welfare agencies to operate food distribution programs for eligible households. Recipients must reside on or near a participating reservation, or within a stipulated service area in Oklahoma. Eligibility is based on financial needs tests, similar to the Food Stamp program. Grantee agencies are responsible for certifying eligibility, providing nutrition education, and distributing commodities. In FY2002, the FDPIR operated on 243 reservations and designated service areas in Oklahoma, with an average monthly participation of 110,000 persons. Recipients receive monthly food packages meeting federal nutritional guidelines, including canned meats, fruits, vegetables, juices, cereals, and more. The program provides foods valued at about $36 per person per month. Federal funding is provided to states for two farmers' market nutrition programs: one for WIC participants and the other for seniors. Money for the WIC program is a set-aside from the annual appropriation, while funds for the Senior program are mandated at $15 million a year. State grants are allocated for these programs. In FY2003, state grants for WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition and Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition programs were allocated based on needs, availability of federal funds, and states' past use of funds. Expansion of these programs depends on additional federal funding. Expansion of farmers' market nutrition programs depends on federal funding. Approved markets can participate in WIC and Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition programs. WIC recipients and lower-income elderly individuals are eligible for benefits. Administering agencies may also accept proof of participation in other means-tested benefit programs. The WIC and Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition programs issue vouchers/coupons for fresh produce, with WIC vouchers limited to $20 per year per recipient. Nutrition education activities may also be provided at market sites. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal funding for free half-pints of milk served to low-income children at schools and residential child care institutions. Approximately 5% of subsidized milk is served free to low-income children, with no matching funds required from non-federal sources. All children in participating schools and institutions are eligible for subsidized milk, and prices are lowered using federal payments. The Child Nutrition Act provides federal funding for free half-pints of milk served to low-income children at schools and residential child care institutions. Individual schools and RCCIs may choose to offer free milk to low-income children, with subsidized rates depending on eligibility. Children must meet income standards to qualify for free milk, while non-needy children and needy children in schools/RCCIs that do not offer free milk pay a determined amount. In the 2002-2003 school year, subsidized half-pints of milk were provided at 13.5 cents each to low-income children, with a net cost of 1.5-2.5 cents higher to schools/RCCIs if served for free. Approximately 112 million subsidized half-pints were served to 500,000 children through 8,000 schools and RCCIs. The program is fully funded by the federal government, with outlays of $18.5 billion in FY2002. Additionally, the Section 8 rental assistance program, authorized by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, includes project-based rental assistance and Housing Choice Vouchers. The vouchers are portable subsidies for eligible households to use with private landlords to subsidize housing costs. HUD is not entering new contracts for project-based rental assistance under Section 8, instead giving vouchers to households when existing contracts expire. Low-income families and single persons are eligible, defined as income at or below 80% of the local area median income. Extremely low-income households, with incomes at or below 30% of the local area median income, are targeted for assistance. 40% of project-based rental assistance subsidies and 75% of vouchers must go to extremely low-income households. In the project-based rental assistance program, project owners maintain waiting lists and can prioritize working families. In the voucher program, local Public Housing Authorities maintain waiting lists and can develop local preferences for prioritization. Deductions are made from gross income to determine annual countable income, including $480 per dependent, $400 for an elderly family, excess medical costs, and costs of child care and handicapped assistance. Federal regulations consider net family assets above $5,000 in determining eligibility and required rent. Assets are defined as the net cash value of various investments, excluding furniture and automobiles. The National Affordable Housing Act in 1990 increased deductions for Section 8 housing, but appropriations were needed for the changes to take effect. Section 8 recipients must recertify their incomes annually, with eligibility and rental charges based on expected family income. Different formulas are used to calculate benefit levels for project-based rental assistance and vouchers. Families receiving project-based rental assistance pay the highest of 30% of counted income, 10% of gross income, or a minimum rent. In Section 8 housing, families pay the highest of 30% of counted income, 10% of gross income, or a minimum rent set by the PHA. The federal government covers the difference between contract rent and what the tenant pays. Contract rent must be within HUD-established limits. P.L. 98-181 eliminated additional Section 8 project-based rental assistance units. In FY2002, $4 billion was allocated for 747,093 project-based rental assistance units. Families with Section 8 vouchers pay 30-40% of their adjusted income towards rent. In Section 8 housing, families pay between 30% and 40% of their adjusted income. The federal government provides a Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) based on the difference between a predetermined maximum payment standard and the household's income. The program is funded 100% by the federal government, with indirect local contributions from local housing authorities. In FY2002, HUD had $11.5 billion in budget authority for vouchers, supporting 1.96 million vouchers with an average subsidy of $5,891 per household. Public housing is publicly-owned housing for low-income families managed by local housing authorities. The federal government subsidizes operating and capital costs through regular and competitive subsidies. Competitive subsidies include grants for revitalization and safety programs. The program was authorized by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Eligibility is based on low-income status. Low-income families are eligible for public housing, with a requirement that 40% of units be occupied by extremely low-income families. Public Housing Authorities aim for an income mix and calculate annual family income with deductions for dependents, elderly, medical costs, child care, and assets above $5,000. Family assets, including real property, savings, stocks, bonds, and investments, are used to determine eligibility for public housing based on net cash value. Residents must have countable family income within a certain range and may be required to participate in a self-sufficiency program or community service. This requirement was established by the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. Households in public housing must comply with rent payment requirements, with exemptions available for certain circumstances. Tenants can choose between flat rent or income-based rent annually to encourage employment. Rental payment adjustments due to increased income are phased in after one year. The federal government provides subsidies for public housing based on the difference between operating costs and tenant rent. In FY2002, federal outlays for public housing averaged about $6,795 per unit and the program is fully funded by the government. Loan funds are allocated based on factors like rural population and low-income households. Federal obligations for loans totaled $3.5 billion in FY2002, with loans available for those without adequate housing in rural areas. The federal government provides subsidies for public housing based on the difference between operating costs and tenant rent. In rural areas, low-income families without decent housing can access Section 502 loans and interest credits. Legislation mandates that a percentage of units must be occupied by very-low-income families. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 directed the Farmers Home Administration to carry out a demonstration program. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) replaced the Farmers Home Administration to carry out a permanent program for moderate income borrowers to obtain guaranteed loans for single-family homes. Eligibility requirements include sufficient income for mortgage payments, premiums, taxes, and living expenses. Adjusted annual income is defined based on criteria used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Chief deductions include expenses for dependents, elderly families, medical costs, child care, and handicapped assistance. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) regulations define income eligibility for loans, including counting income from net family assets. Assets like real property equity, savings, stocks, and bonds are included, while personal property and business assets are excluded. Residents in rural areas may qualify for direct loans to purchase or repair modest-sized homes. Loan terms are typically 33 years but can be extended to 38 years for low-income borrowers. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) offers loans with subsidized interest rates for low-income borrowers. In FY2002, RHS provided direct loans totaling $1.080 billion to 14,727 low-income families, while private lenders gave guaranteed loans amounting to $2.419 billion to 28,364 low- to moderate-income families. Federal funds cover 25% of costs for new construction or rehabilitation under the Home Investment Partnerships program. The HOME program provides funding for affordable housing through a partnership between federal and state/local governments. Jurisdictions must submit a plan to receive funds, with federal obligations totaling $1.8 billion in FY2002. Eligibility is based on income, with at least 90% of recipient families having incomes below 60% of the area's median family income. Bond or debt financing can cover up to 25% of the matching fund requirement, with reduced funding for jurisdictions in fiscal distress. The income limits for families under the HOME program are set at 60% of the area median income, with 10% of families allowed up to 80%. Homebuyers have an income limit of 80% of the area median. Various deductions are made from gross income, including allowances for dependents, elderly family members, medical costs, child care, and handicapped assistance. Federal regulations consider net family assets above $5,000 in determining eligibility and required rent. Net family assets include cash value of real property, savings, stocks, and bonds, but not furniture or automobiles. The HOME program aims to increase affordable housing supply for low-income Americans, with a maximum rental subsidy based on income. As of September 30, 2002, $6.3 billion in HOME funds and $19.2 billion in other funds assisted 687,274 housing units and 83,939 families. The Housing for Special Populations program provides tenant-based assistance to low-income elderly and disabled individuals. Program outlays were $895 million in FY2002 and funded 100% by the federal government. In completed projects, a high percentage of tenants had incomes of 50% or less of the area median income. The Housing for Special Populations program offers capital advances for supportive housing for low-income elderly and disabled households, paired with rental assistance similar to Section 8. Eligibility is restricted to households with income at or below 50% of the local area median income. Various deductions are made from gross income to determine annual countable income, including allowances for dependents, elderly family members, medical costs, child care, and handicapped assistance. The Section 202 and Section 811 housing assistance programs require annual income recertification and are limited to elderly or disabled households. Net family assets above $5,000 are included in income calculations, based on the current passbook savings rate. Necessary items like furniture and automobiles are not counted as assets. Section 202 and Section 811 housing assistance programs are for elderly or disabled households. To qualify for Section 202, at least one member must be 62 or older, while for Section 811, at least one member must have a disability. Rent is based on 30% of counted income or 10% of gross income, with exemptions for hardship. The federal government pays the landlord the difference between the contract rent and tenant's payment. Contract rent must be within HUD-established limits. In FY2002, the federal government allocated $672 million for the Section 202 program and $223 million for the Section 811 program, supporting a total of 62,694 Section 202 units and 18,649 Section 811 units. The program is fully funded by the federal government and allocations are based on factors like rural population, housing conditions, and poverty levels. Additionally, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and Rural Housing Service (RHS) provide rental assistance payments to owners of rural rental housing to reduce rents for eligible tenants. Total federal obligations for the program in FY2002 amounted to $705 million. The Rural Housing Service (RHS) provides rental assistance to owners of rural rental housing to reduce rents for eligible tenants with adjusted family income below the very-low-income limit set by HUD. Owners must operate the property on a limited profit or nonprofit basis, with rental assistance agreements lasting 20 years for new construction projects and 5 years for existing projects. Payments cover the difference between tenants' payments and the RHS-approved rent, with tenants originally paying no more than 25% of their income in rent. Amendments in the 1983 Housing Act expanded the program. In FY2002, the federal government funded a program that provided rental assistance to about 44,298 families, with outlays totaling $579 million. The Section 236 Interest Reduction Payments (IRP) program offers mortgage subsidies to owners of multifamily properties for low-income families. Section 236 subsidized units, eligible for households with incomes below 80% of the area median income, may also receive Section 8 rental assistance. Income eligibility criteria changed in 1979 to align with Section 8 regulations, excluding certain earnings and deductions from income calculations. The Section 236 program deducts specific items from income, such as $480 per dependent, $400 for an elderly family, excess medical costs, and child care expenses. Income recertification is required annually, and subsidy amounts are based on anticipated income. Monthly rental charges are determined based on operating costs and mortgage requirements. HUD makes payments to reduce the interest rate to 1%. Tenants are required to pay the basic rent or an established fair market rental charge. The Section 236 program provides subsidies based on income, with tenants paying either the basic rent or 30% of adjusted gross income, whichever is greater. Additional assistance is available for tenants who cannot afford the basic rent. Elderly and handicapped families paying over 50% of their income for rent can receive Section 8 assistance. In FY2002, subsidies averaged $1,833 per dwelling unit, with 315,976 units benefiting. The program is federally funded, with funds distributed by formula and competitive awards. Three-fourths of formula grants go to cities and eligible states meeting specific criteria. The Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program allocates funds to states and cities based on AIDS cases and population criteria. Formula grants are given to eligible jurisdictions, with a minimum grant of $200,000. Competitive awards are available for projects not covered by formula allocations. HOPWA outlays for FY2002 were $314 million. The program aims to assist low-income individuals with AIDS. The Opportunity Act (part of P.L. 101-625) provides housing assistance to low-income individuals with AIDS or related diseases, including HIV infection. The law defines low-income as not exceeding 80% of the local area median income. The Secretary of HUD can adjust income ceilings based on construction costs or family incomes. HOPWA offers housing information to all persons with AIDS, regardless of income. A 2002 survey found that over half of households served by HOPWA have extremely low incomes. HOPWA funds can be used for various benefits and services, including housing information services and facility acquisition and rehabilitation. The Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) program provides housing assistance through rehabilitation, conversion, lease, and repair of facilities, new construction, rental assistance, short-term financial aid, supportive services, operating costs, and technical assistance. In FY2002, 68,000 households received assistance, with a projected increase to 73,000 in FY2003. The program is funded 100% by HUD. The Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) program, funded 100% by the federal government, allocates funds based on factors like rural population and housing conditions. In FY2002, $114 million was obligated for the program. Loans are provided for rural rental housing for low-income families, disabled persons, and the elderly. Occupancy requirements ensure a percentage of units are for very-low-income families. The law defines \"low-income\" and \"very-low-income\" families based on income limits set by HUD for public housing and Section 8 housing. Sponsors for rural rental housing can be nonprofit, profit-oriented, or \"limited profit\" and must demonstrate inability to obtain credit elsewhere on reasonable terms. Applicants for rural rental housing loans must be unable to obtain credit elsewhere on reasonable terms, conduct market surveys to determine eligible occupants, and have sufficient initial capital. Nonprofit sponsors and public agencies are eligible for loans up to 100% of the appraised value. Loan amounts and terms are determined by RHS, with grants allocated based on state shares of rural occupied units and very-low income households. In FY2002, Section 515 loans financed housing for about 7,284 families, funded 100% by the federal government. The Section 504 program provides repair loans at low interest rates for very-low-income rural homeowners aged 62 and older. Grants are available for elderly homeowners with income preventing loan repayment. Loans are limited to $20,000 with a 20-year term. In FY2002, the Section 504 program provided $31.8 million in loans for the repair of 55,615 homes and $30.6 million in grants for 6,170 homes owned by elderly individuals. The program is fully funded by the federal government, with funds kept in reserve at the RHS national office. Local nonprofit organizations, Indian tribes, and government agencies may qualify for low-interest loans from the Rural Housing Service to develop low-rent housing for farm labor. Applicants must demonstrate a need for farm labor housing, operate on a nonprofit basis, and show inability to obtain credit elsewhere for affordable housing. Exceptions may be made by the RHS state director. The RHS state director may make exceptions to the \"credit elsewhere\" test for low-rent housing for farm labor if there is a need in the area and no other organization can provide it. Applicants must have sufficient capital and show that income will cover expenses, improvements, loan payments, and reserves. Nonprofit organizations, Indian tribes, and local or state agencies may qualify for grants if there is a pressing need for housing. Applicants for farm labor housing must contribute at least 10% of development costs from their own resources or other sources. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 expanded the definition of \"domestic farm labor\" to include those who derive income from agricultural or aquacultural activities. Priority for housing is given to active farm laborers, followed by retired or disabled farm laborers. Farm labor housing loans and grants are available to qualified applicants to buy, build, or improve housing for farm workers. The funds can also be used for related facilities such as streets, water supply systems, and appliances. Section 514 loans have a 1% interest rate for up to 33 years, while Section 516 grants cover up to 90% of the total development cost of the project. In FY2002, $47.3 million in loans and $14.5 million in grants funded the development of 1,870 housing units for farm workers and their families. The program is fully funded by the federal government. Outlays totaled $54 million in FY2002. Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 authorized HUD to pay rent supplements for low-income tenants in privately-owned or Section 236 housing. Income eligibility is based on Section 8 rental assistance criteria for low-income families. In FY2002, HUD paid rent supplements for low-income tenants in privately-owned or Section 236 housing. Eligibility is based on income criteria, with preference given to households in substandard housing or paying over 50% of income for rent. Rent supplements are set as the difference between 30% of adjusted gross income or 30% of market rent, minus a basic rent established by HUD. In FY2002, 18,600 units received subsidies averaging about $2,900 per unit under a housing program funded 100% by the federal government. No new commitments have been made since 1973, with current spending only for existing contracts. Technical Assistance grants are available for states, political subdivisions, and nonprofit corporations from the Rural Housing Service. The TA grants are used to support self-help housing programs for low-income rural families. Applicants must show the need for such housing, have qualified personnel, and lack funding from other sources. The program targets very-low-income and low-income families, with TA funds not for hiring construction workers or purchasing materials. The TA funds support self-help housing programs for low-income rural families, with private or public nonprofit corporations eligible for 2-year site loans. Loans can be used to buy and develop rural land for building sites sold to low- and moderate-income families. Sites financed through Section 523 are for families building homes by mutual self-help, while Section 524 site loans have no construction method restrictions. Houses built on subsidized sites are usually financed through the Section 502 rural housing loan program. The RHS state director can approve TA grants up to $200,000 for eligible organizations in the housing loan program. Applicants must show that the self-help method will save at least $500 per house. The grants can be used for hiring personnel, office expenses, tools, and consultant services. Section 523 site loans have a 3% interest rate, while Section 524 site loans have the Treasury cost of funds rate. Loans can be used for buying and developing sites, constructing roads and utility lines, and providing water access. In FY2002, organizations received $26.5 million in mutual and self-help housing grants, and $0.5 million in site development loans for constructing access roads, utility lines, water and waste disposal facilities, landscaping, and parking areas. The program is funded 100% by the federal government, with obligations totaling $19.6 million. Applicants must be members of a federally recognized American Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Village. To qualify for housing assistance, applicants must be members of a federally recognized American Indian Tribe or Alaska Native Village, live in an approved tribal service area, have an annual income below 125% of the poverty income guidelines, have substandard housing, meet ownership requirements, lack other housing assistance resources, have not received assistance since October 1, 1986, and not acquired housing through a federal program. Priority is given based on income, age of occupants, disability status, and number of dependents. The Housing Improvement Program (HIP) is operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and provides grants for interim repairs to properties until standard housing is available. Grants are categorized as Category A for repairs up to $2,500 per unit and Category B for standard condition repairs up to $35,000 for homeowners or renters with undivided leaseholds. Category C grants are provided to applicants who own or lease homes that cannot be brought up to building code standards for $35,000 or less, or who own or lease land suitable for housing. The grants are used for modest replacement housing, with applicants required to have an undivided leasehold lasting at least 25 years. If the home is sold within 10 years, the full grant amount must be repaid. In FY2002, HIP grants assisted 572 families by renovating 389 homes and constructing 183 homes. The Section 235 program provides mortgage assistance to lower-income homeowners, funded 100% by the federal government. If a home is sold within 10 years, the full grant amount must be repaid, with a 10% retention option after the 10th year. The program was terminated in 1989 under P.L. 100-242. Eligibility for Section 235 assistance is based on income criteria, with certain exclusions such as 5% of gross income, earnings of minor children, and temporary income. The program provides aid to lower-income home buyers through monthly payments to reduce interest costs on new or substantially rehabilitated single-family units, condominiums, or family units purchased by displaced families. The Section 235 assistance program offers aid to lower-income home buyers by reducing interest costs on mortgages to as low as 4%. Mortgage amounts are limited based on the number of bedrooms, with potential increases in high-cost areas or for physically handicapped individuals. Assistance payments are subject to recapture under certain conditions. The Section 235 assistance program provides aid to lower-income home buyers by reducing mortgage interest costs to as low as 4%. Assistance payments may be recaptured if the recipient sells the property, defaults on the mortgage, or rents it out for longer than 1 year. The program is funded 100% by the federal government and grantees are encouraged to leverage funds from other sources. Federal obligations for the program totaled $8.6 million in FY2002, with grants available for repair and rehabilitation of single-family housing. The Section 235 assistance program provides aid to lower-income home buyers by reducing mortgage interest costs. The program is funded by the federal government and grants are available for repair and rehabilitation of single-family housing in rural areas for families with low or very-low income.

The Rural Housing Service (RHS) provides grants for homeowners to finance repairs and rehabilitation of their homes, including repair or replacement of heating systems, electrical wiring, structural supports, roofs, siding, porches, and stoops. Additionally, alterations for accessibility, additions to alleviate overcrowding or health hazards, and improvements to manufactured or mobile homes are authorized. Up to 25% of funding can be used for non-essential improvements. The Section 533 program, authorized in 1983, provides grants for improvements such as painting, paneling, carpeting, air conditioning, and landscaping. Regulations for the program were published in 1986. Funding became available in FY1994, and in FY2002, grants financed home repairs for 2,133 families. The HOPE programs were established in 1990 to assist low-income, first-time homebuyers in purchasing housing owned by government entities. Grants were awarded through FY1996 on a competitive basis. The HOPE programs, established in 1990, provided grants to nonprofit organizations and public housing authorities for economic development and homeownership goals. Recipients were required to match federal funds, and while no new funding has been allocated since FY1996, some money already committed continues to be spent. Federal outlays from current balances were $25 million in FY2000, $21 million in FY2001, and $3 million in FY2002. Grantees included Habitat for Humanity, Catholic Charities, Volunteers of America, and the Enterprise Foundation. The HOPE programs, established in 1990, provided grants to nonprofit organizations and public housing authorities for economic development and homeownership goals. Recipients included Habitat for Humanity, Catholic Charities, Volunteers of America, and the Enterprise Foundation. Eligibility for HOPE 1, 2, or 3 requires being a tenant of eligible property, resident of HUD-assisted housing, or having income below 80% of median income. HOPE 1 funds tenant management, project-related jobs, and sale of renovated units. HOPE 2 grants are for sale of multifamily properties insured by HUD or government-owned, and for economic development activities. HOPE 3 funds purchase of single-family homes held or insured by government entities. Many public housing units have been sold through various HUD programs, including HOPE 1, with over 4,700 units approved for sale since 1993. The process of selling units can take up to 10 years, with grants supporting resident organizations, counseling, and economic development activities. HOPE 1 Implementation Grants totaling $82.4 million were awarded for 30 grants between FY1992 and FY1994. Grants totaling $82.4 million were awarded for 30 projects between FY1992 and FY1994. In a FY2000 HUD report, only one-third of approved applicants had information available. Of the $8.2 million granted, $4.6 million remained unspent. Some projects are being shut down, grants terminated, and funds returned. For instance, a $1.67 million grant to Hartford, Connecticut's housing authority in FY1994 is at risk of termination for failure to execute. Another example is a $4.5 million grant to Kern County, California in FY1994 for the sale of 168 public housing units, with a remaining balance of $1.9 million as of FY2000. As of FY2000, there was a remaining balance of $1.9 million from grants awarded under various HOPE programs. Approximately 261 HOPE 1 grants totaling $113 million were made, with no information on units sold. Grants of about $75 million were awarded under HOPE 2 through FY1996. Under HOPE 3, $210 million in implementation grants were given to 258 grantees by July 1997, resulting in 2,298 homes acquired and 1,234 transferred to new buyers by August 1995. The Clinton Administration shifted focus to selling single-family homes instead of multifamily units, leading to a phasing down of specialized programs like HOPE 1, 2, and 3. The HUD has been phasing down specialized programs like HOPE 1, 2, and 3 to empower local communities in developing innovative strategies for housing and community development. HUD's FHA sells HUD-owned single-family homes to non-profits at discounts, which are then resold to low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Other HUD-owned homes are sold at 50% discounts under programs like Officer Next Door and Teacher Next Door. Federal Pell Grants, administered by the Department of Education, are a significant source of federal student grant assistance. For more information on government-assisted home buying, visit HUD's homebuyer site. Pell Grants, funded by the Department of Education, are federal grants for undergraduate students based on financial need. Grantees must meet eligibility requirements and maintain satisfactory progress in their studies. The grants are part of Title IV-A of the Higher Education Act and totaled $11.4 billion for the 2001-2002 school year. The expected family contribution (EFC) for postsecondary education is determined based on the income and assets of the student and their family. Updates to the need analysis tables were announced by the Department of Education for the 2004-2005 award year, including inflation-adjusted updates to four tables used in calculating the EFC. The expected family contribution (EFC) for postsecondary education is calculated using four tables: income protection allowance, adjusted net worth of a business or farm, education savings and asset protection allowance, and assessment schedules. Pell Grant recipients have income limits, with awards being the lesser of a maximum amount or cost of attendance minus EFC. In 2001-2002, 4.8 million students received Pell Grants averaging $2,411. Pell Grants averaging $2,411 are provided under the Higher Education Act, with restrictions on how other federal programs can consider them for eligibility. Head Start funds are allocated based on a formula and can cover up to 80% of program costs, with potential for more if deemed necessary by the Secretary of HHS. The federal share for Head Start agencies can be higher in poor counties or after a major disaster if unable to pay 20%. Agencies receiving over 80% federal share in FY1973 or FY1974 can continue. Non-federal share can be paid in cash or kind by the agency or another party. Head Start agencies operate programs for low-income families with eligibility criteria determined by HHS. FY2003 appropriations for Head Start were $6.7 billion. Head Start programs require at least 90% of children to be from low-income families, with income below the poverty line. Additionally, 10% of enrollment opportunities must be available for handicapped children. There are no asset rules for eligibility, and small, remote communities can establish their own criteria if at least half of families meet income guidelines. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to preschool children in communities with a population no greater than 1,000, that are medically underserved, and lack other preschool programs or medical services nearby. Services include educational, dental, medical, nutritional, and social services to children and their families. Head Start agencies are not allowed to charge fees, but families can voluntarily pay for services. Additionally, subsidized Federal Stafford loans are provided to students through the Federal Family Education Loan program and the Ford Federal Direct Student Loan program. Capital for FFEL Stafford loans comes from banks and private lenders, while capital for Stafford/Ford loans is provided directly by the federal government. The federal government offers subsidized loan programs for students through the FFEL and Ford direct loan programs, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These programs provide interest subsidies, reinsurance against borrower default, and forgo student interest payments during certain periods. Eligibility is not restricted to individuals with limited income, but applicants must demonstrate financial need. Institutions use a need analysis system to calculate eligibility. The methodology in Title IV is used to calculate the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) for educational expenses. Updates to need analysis tables were announced for the 2004-2005 award year, including adjustments to income protection allowance and assessment schedules. The Department of Education publishes an annual booklet explaining the EFC. The Department publishes an annual booklet explaining the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) formula for undergraduate students. Eligible students must receive grant aid before incurring loan debt. The borrower's interest rate for FFEL Stafford and Stafford/Ford loans varies annually based on the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus a premium. In the FFEL program, the lender pays a 3% origination fee to the federal government. In the Direct Loan program, borrowers pay a 3% origination fee to the federal government. Undergraduates have borrowing limits ranging from $2,625 to $5,500 per year, while graduate and professional school students can borrow up to $10,500 per year. The aggregate loan limit for all students is $65,500. In FY2002, subsidized loan disbursements totaled over $30.1 billion, with various components of federal expenditures including interest payments, special allowance payments, and reimbursements to guaranty agencies for borrower defaults. In the Direct Loan program, annual federal costs include foregone interest payments, defaults, and administrative expenses. Guaranty agencies receive allowances for administrative costs and losses due to defaults. Annual revenues offset some costs, including fees from borrowers and collections on defaulted loans. Net federal obligations for FY2002 were estimated at $4.9 billion. The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes federal funding for part-time employment for students in post-secondary education. Students can work on-campus or off-campus for public or private organizations. Institutions must allocate a percentage of Federal Work Study funds for community service jobs. Federal grants fund a portion of student wages, with the remainder covered by the institution or employer. The Federal Work Study program provides federally subsidized wages for post-secondary students with financial need. Institutions allocate funds based on FY1985 awards and aggregate need. FY2002 appropriations were $1 billion. Students' earnings are limited to their financial need, with compensation at least equal to minimum wage. Five percent of funds must be used for part-time students if their financial need exceeds 5% of all students' need. The Federal Work Study program provides federally subsidized wages for post-secondary students with financial need, with compensation at least equal to minimum wage. In the academic year 2002-2003, 1,073,000 students received FWS-supported earnings averaging $1,252.

McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement, receive $827 million in FY2002 appropriations. These programs are 100% federally funded and provide aid to low-income individuals. Eligibility requirements vary, but institutions must ensure aid meets students' financial needs for college attendance. The Upward Bound program requires two-thirds of participants to be low-income, potential first-generation college students needing academic support. Student Support Services also require two-thirds of beneficiaries to be low-income. The Student Support Services program requires at least two-thirds of beneficiaries to be disabled or low-income first-generation college students in need of academic support. The Talent Search program targets low-income potential first-generation college students aged 11 to 27. The Educational Opportunity Centers serve low-income potential first-generation college students aged 19 and above. The Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement program was established in 1986. The Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement program, authorized in 1986, assists students in gaining admission to graduate programs. Two-thirds of participants must be low-income, first-generation college students, while the rest must be from underrepresented groups. Services include instruction in various subjects, counseling, tutoring, exposure to cultural events, and career option activities. Talent Search provides information on financial aid, counseling, and tutoring to encourage high school completion and post-secondary education. Educational Opportunity Centers and McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement program provide services like tutoring, counseling, and research opportunities to help students complete high school and pursue post-secondary education. In FY2002, over 865,000 participants were served in TRIO programs, including Upward Bound, Student Support Services, Talent Search, Educational Opportunity Centers, and Ronald McNair Achievement Program.

The Higher Education Act of 1965 authorizes supplemental educational opportunity grants for post-secondary undergraduate students with financial need. Institutions have flexibility in award sizes, with priority given to Pell Grant recipients. Funds can be used for less than full-time students. Total FY2002 appropriations were $760 million. Educational opportunity grant funds can be used for less than full-time students, with awards ranging from $100 to $4,000. In the 2002-2003 academic year, around 1,189,000 students received average grants of $772. The Higher Education Act prohibits certain government programs from considering student aid when determining eligibility for benefits. Annual formula grants are provided to state educational agencies under Title I, Part C of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for programs for migratory children. State educational agencies receive funds for programs serving migratory children of agricultural workers or fishermen. Funding allocation changed in FY2003 to a fixed amount from FY2002 plus additional appropriations based on updated child counts. Most programs are managed by local school districts through subgrants, with some run by other agencies. Discretionary grants are available for program coordination. States are solely responsible for record transfer. In FY2002, appropriations were $395 million for eligible migratory students. In FY2002, $395 million was allocated for Title 1 migrant education programs serving migratory children of agricultural workers or fishermen. Eligible students are those who have moved within 3 years for temporary employment in agricultural or fishing activities.

Annual loan limits range from $4,000 to $6,000, with aggregate limits up to $40,000 for graduate students. Around 707,000 students borrowed an average of $1,790 under the program in the 2002-2003 school year. The Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnerships program, established under the Higher Education Act, provides federal formula grants to states for state student aid programs. States match these grants with their own funds to assist needy post-secondary students. State aid awards are given directly to students or through institutions, with a requirement that no state receives less funding than in FY1979. Unused funds can be reallocated to other states based on their higher education enrollments. The LEAP program, established under the Higher Education Act, provides federal grants to states for state student aid programs. States can use 20% of funds for community service work learning jobs. To be eligible for a LEAP grant, post-secondary students must meet various requirements including financial need, academic progress, and loan obligations. Part-time students may also be eligible. Maximum grants of $5,000 are available for full-time students at public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education and post-secondary vocational institutions under the LEAP program. These grants can be used for work-study jobs through campus-based community service work learning study programs. In the 2002-2003 academic year, around 171,000 students received average grants of $1,000. The Higher Education Act ensures that student aid provided under the act does not affect eligibility for other governmental programs like AFDC, TANF, or food stamps. The Higher Education Act provides federal funding for student loans and scholarships, with schools required to contribute a share to the loan fund. The Health Professions Student Loan Program offers low-interest loans for students pursuing degrees in various medical fields. The Loans for Disadvantaged Students Program also provides long-term, low-interest loans for financially needy students. The Loans for Disadvantaged Students Program (LDS) offers long-term, low-interest loans to financially needy students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various medical fields. Participating schools must have programs for recruiting and retaining minority students and faculty. Accredited nursing schools also provide loans through the Nursing Student Loan (N.L.) program. These loan programs no longer receive appropriations, and returned funds are re-awarded based on need. The Health Professions Partnerships Training Act of 1998 consolidated health professions education programs and established the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students program. Funding is provided for the new program, and schools receiving returned funds must deposit a portion into a loan fund for additional student loans. The Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program provides grants to accredited public or private nonprofit schools for scholarship assistance in various health-related fields. Schools must give preference to former EFN and FADHPS recipients and students from disadvantaged backgrounds facing severe financial hardship. At least 16% of SDS funds must be allocated for nursing scholarships. The Secretary may only grant funds to schools with programs for recruiting and retaining students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Thurgood Marshall Fellows receive counseling, preparation for law school, and financial assistance. Services available include a pre-law summer institute, mentoring programs, tutoring, academic counseling, and preparation for bar examinations. Fellows may also receive a stipend for participation in summer institutes and seminars. In FY2002, the Department of Education awarded a single grant to CLEO to support Thurgood Marshall fellows. The grant provided services for an estimated 350-450 fellows. The grants are for a 5-year period with FY2002 appropriations totaling $23 million. Students must have spent a minimum of 75 days in migrant and seasonal farmwork to be eligible for the program. The HEP program provides educational and support services to eligible participants, including those in the Title 1 Migrant Education program or the Workforce Investment Act program. Participants must be at least 16 years old, not enrolled in school, and without a high school diploma. Services include instruction in various subjects, career-oriented courses, tutoring, counseling, financial assistance, and housing.

The program is funded by federal appropriations and covers costs for room, board, tuition, administration, and insurance. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 created the Child Care and Development Block Grant, providing federally paid funds to states and entities. In FY2002, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) received $6.4 billion from discretionary funds, entitlement funds, and transfers from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. Discretionary funds are allocated to states based on factors like the number of children under age 5, children receiving free or reduced-price school lunches, and per capita income. States used to be required to reserve 25% of their allocation for child care quality improvement, but since FY1996, they can only spend up to 5% on administrative costs. Effective in FY1996, states could spend up to 5% of their allotments on administrative costs and at least 4% on improving child care quality and availability. The 1996 welfare reform law replaced AFDC-related child care programs with entitlement funding, providing $13.9 billion over 6 years. Funding amounts ranged from $2.1 billion to $2.717 billion annually. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provides combined discretionary and entitlement funding streams for child care. States are required to transfer funds to the agency administering CCDBG and follow CCDBG rules. Entitlement child care funding reserves 1-2% for Indian tribes, with the rest allocated to states based on fixed amounts and other criteria. States must meet maintenance-of-effort spending targets and provide matching funds to qualify for entitlement child care funds. They can transfer up to 30% of their TANF block grants to CCDBG. Eligibility for subsidized child care requires the child to be under 13 years old and live with a working parent. The law requires children to live with a working parent, have a family income below 85% of the state median, and prioritize those in low-income families or with special needs. States must spend 70% of funds on welfare recipients or families at risk of welfare dependency, but can also serve low-income, non-welfare, working families. Funds for child care services can be used for low-income, non-welfare, working families. States must establish a sliding fee schedule for subsidized child care, with options for care providers paid directly by the state or through certificates. Services may include center-based care, group home care, family care, and in-home care. Expenditures for TANF-funded services in FY2002 were estimated at $6.1 billion. In FY2002, TANF-funded services, excluding child care, totaled $6.1 billion, with $4.4 billion from federal funds and $1.7 billion from state-local funds. States have flexibility in using block grant funds to provide services to needy families, with a focus on ending dependence on government benefits or promoting family stability. States can also offer services to non-needy families to prevent out-of-wedlock pregnancies or support two-parent families. Most states provide support services to recipient families and other needy families not enrolled in cash aid, with income limits ranging from 150% to 250% of federal poverty guidelines. Examples of benefits/services include transportation subsidies, parental skill building services, home energy aid, housing aid, rehabilitation services, and domestic violence counseling. Some states have higher flat annual income limits for certain services, such as Colorado setting an outer limit of $75,000 for any TANF-funded service. The Social Security Act provides federal funding to states for social services, with funds distributed based on population. The FY2000 appropriation was below the ceiling level, and appropriations in FY2001 and FY2002 decreased. Services funded by TANF include teen pregnancy prevention, responsible parenthood counseling, abstinence programs, and family planning services. Some TANF expenditures cover services authorized under pre-TANF law, such as services for children in the juvenile justice system and child welfare services. Funding for social services under the Social Security Act decreased in FY2001 and FY2002 to $1.725 billion and $1.7 billion respectively. States had the authority to transfer up to 10% of their TANF block grants to the social services block grant (SSBG). Transfers to SSBG totaled $1.1 billion in FY1998, $1.3 billion in FY1999, $1.1 billion in FY2000, $920 million in FY2001, and $1 billion in FY2002. States can establish their own eligibility criteria for Title XX social services and decide how to allocate funds. State expenditure reports provide national data on SSBG fund usage in FY2001. In FY2001, states submitted data to HHS on how SSBG funds were spent, with child protective services, foster care, services for the disabled, and child day care receiving the highest percentage of spending. In FY2002, TANF child care expenditures were estimated at $2.3 billion, with 68% from federal funds and $0.750 billion from state-local funds. In FY2002, TANF child care expenditures totaled $2.3 billion, with 68% from federal funds and $0.750 billion from state-local funds. TANF-funded child care includes care for children in TANF families, former TANF families, and other low-income families. States can use block grant funds to provide child care to recipient families and other needy families to promote work or job preparation. States determine income limits for TANF-funded child care in their TANF plans. Most states provide free or subsidized child care to needy families in their TANF plans, including recipient families, former cash recipient families, and families at risk of becoming income-eligible for cash aid. Income limits for families not enrolled in the cash program range from 150% to 250% of federal poverty guidelines, with some states using a relative standard based on state median income. Wisconsin offers subsidized child care for all needy families with initial eligibility set at 185% of the federal poverty guideline. Eligibility ends when income reaches 75% of the median income. In many states, child care is provided to families with income below certain thresholds. Massachusetts offers child care to those below 85% of the state median income, while Illinois sets the limit at 200% of the poverty guideline. TANF-funded care typically has an age cutoff of 13 years, but California's TANF plan only covers children under 10. TANF no longer requires states to guarantee child care for welfare parents, but single parents on TANF cannot be penalized for refusing work if they can't find care for a child under 6. States decide on charges for TANF child care and how long to offer transitional care to families who have left the cash program. Connecticut limits child care subsidies to $325 per child monthly ($425 for a child with special needs). Some states reimburse families for child care expenses by adding the amount to the cash benefit. States like Illinois, Michigan, and South Carolina use free or co-pay rules similar to those for the CCDBG. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides funding for programs aiding the homeless under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. Federal funding for programs aiding the homeless under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act includes the Emergency Shelter Grants program, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance for Single-Room Occupancy Dwellings, Shelter Plus Care program, and Supportive Housing program. Funding is provided through formula or competitive grants to states, local governments, nonprofit organizations, and public housing authorities, with grantees required to match federal dollars. Matching requirements vary for each program. The Supportive Housing program requires dollar-for-dollar cash matching for grants involving housing units. HUD homeless assistance funds are also used for \"Supportive Services Only\" projects. Grantees must develop consolidated plans for homeless programs under a \"continuum of care\" strategy. Emergency Shelter Grants program grantees receive grants by formula, while others must compete for HUD approval. The Homeless Assistance Grant programs require agencies to compete for HUD approval of their grant proposals. Eligibility for assistance depends on decisions made by local sponsors, with some programs restricting eligibility to specific categories such as homeless persons with very low incomes, disabilities, chronic substance abuse problems, or AIDS. Grantees can use funding for activities like renovation of buildings for emergency shelters, essential social services, and initiatives to prevent homelessness. The Supportive Housing program provides assistance for homeless individuals in transitioning to independent living through various services. Other programs like Shelter Plus Care and SRO offer rental assistance. The Community Services Block Grant Act authorizes federally-funded block grants for community-based antipoverty activities. For more details on homeless assistance grants and federal programs, refer to CRS Report RL30442, Homelessness: Recent Statistics and Targeted Federal Programs. The Community Services Block Grant Act authorizes federally-funded block grants for community-based antipoverty activities. State allocations are based on funds received in FY1981 from the former Community Services Administration. For FY2003, $650 million was appropriated for the block grant, with additional funding for related activities like community economic development and job opportunities for low-income individuals. Beneficiaries must have incomes no higher than the federal poverty income guidelines. The Community Services Block Grant program provides federally-funded block grants for antipoverty activities. Beneficiaries must have incomes below the federal poverty guidelines, with states allowed to increase eligibility criteria to 125% of the guidelines. The program funds various antipoverty activities such as nutrition, emergency services, and employment services, with no rules regarding assets. Grantees also receive funds from other sources to operate antipoverty programs. The Community Services Block Grant program provides 100% federal funding allocated based on state shares of the poverty population. The FY2003 appropriation was $338.8 million, up $9.5 million from FY2002, to provide supplemental funding for states affected by the 2000 Census data. The Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 offers financial aid for legal services to low-income individuals based on various financial factors.

Exceptions are allowed for individuals with income between 125% and 150% of the poverty line in certain circumstances. The Legal Services Corporation provides legal aid to the poor based on income factors such as current income prospects, medical expenses, and other financial obligations. Beneficiaries receive assistance in noncriminal cases related to family, employment, housing, and public benefit programs. The goal is to ensure minimum access to legal services for all poor persons, with limitations on aid in criminal and most civil cases. The Legal Services Corporation provides legal aid to the poor in noncriminal cases related to family, employment, housing, and public benefit programs. Grantees are restricted from providing aid in fee-generating civil cases, lobbying activities, class action lawsuits, abortion-related litigation, and prisoner representation. The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated a restriction on LSC funding in 2001, citing a violation of the First Amendment. The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Refugee Act of 1980, authorizes federally funded social services to assist refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and Amerasians become self-sufficient.

States determine the social services offered, with exceptions for refugees to receive specific services. Congress has established a National Board to coordinate the Emergency Food and Shelter program under FEMA's direction. The National Board coordinates the Emergency Food and Shelter program under FEMA's direction, awarding funds to local boards based on unemployment and poverty rates. Funds are allocated to local jurisdictions based on the number of unemployed persons, with state set-aside programs targeting areas with sudden economic changes or high levels of unemployment or poverty. The Emergency Food and Shelter program provides federal funds to organizations serving the homeless and hungry during economic emergencies. Eligibility for assistance is determined locally, with funds used to purchase food and shelter to supplement existing resources. Total outlays for the program in FY2002 were $143 million. The Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program provides assistance for food, shelter, rent, and utilities to prevent homelessness. In FY2002, expenditures for TANF work programs totaled $2.7 billion, with a focus on work for parents and caretakers of TANF children. The TANF law allows parents and caretakers of TANF children up to 24 months of benefits without work requirements. States must ensure minimum participation rates in work activities for TANF families. States can use TANF funds for work programs to help needy families become self-sufficient. States determine eligibility and tailor activities to individual family needs. Reporting forms require states to detail TANF expenditures on work-related activities. TANF reporting forms break down expenditures on work-related activities into three categories: work subsidies, education and training, and other work activities/expenses. In FY2002, spending from TANF grants was allocated as follows: Education and training, 14.8%; work subsidies, 2.7%; and other work activities/expenses, 82.5%.
