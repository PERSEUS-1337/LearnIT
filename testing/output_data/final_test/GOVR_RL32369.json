    "content": "Congress may consider reforms to the immigration system, impacting the detention of noncitizens in the US. Views on detaining noncitizens vary, with some advocating for more detention space and others for alternatives. Immigration enforcement activities influence the need for detention resources, with the INA providing a legal framework. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows for the detention of aliens while awaiting removal from the US, with certain categories subject to mandatory detention. Detained aliens may have committed crimes or be arrested for being illegally present. Some are quickly returned, while others undergo deportation proceedings after serving criminal sentences. The report provides an overview of immigration detention in the United States, discussing the authority to detain noncitizens, resources for detention, and legislation in the 112th Congress related to detention. Policy issues surrounding detention of aliens are also addressed, including concerns about mandatory detention. The report discusses the authority to detain noncitizens, resources for detention, and legislation related to detention in the 112th Congress. It also addresses policy issues such as the justness of mandatory detention for asylum seekers and the proper limits on detention time for aliens ordered removed but unable to return home. The responsibility for detaining aliens lies with the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the Attorney General retaining the authority to arrest and detain aliens under the law. The creation of DHS transferred the administration of detention from the INS to DHS, with the Secretary of Homeland Security having the authority to administer and enforce immigration laws. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 has left the Attorney General with concurrent authority over some aspects of immigration law, including determining bond for aliens. The Board of Immigration Appeals hears appeals from decisions made by immigration officials in DHS, with the Attorney General having final say in immigration law matters that come before EOIR. The Attorney General has authority over determining bond for aliens, with the Secretary of DHS sharing this authority. The INA allows the Attorney General to issue warrants for the arrest and detention of aliens in the United States. The IIRIRA amended the INA to specify these powers. The IIRIRA amended the INA to specify levels of detention priority and classes of aliens subjected to mandatory detention. Mandatory detention is required for certain criminal and terrorist aliens pending a final decision on removal. Parole and bond decisions for aliens not subject to mandatory detention are not reviewable. Detainees are categorized into four detention categories based on guidelines established by the former INS in 1998. The IIRIRA amended the INA to specify levels of detention priority and classes of aliens subjected to mandatory detention. Aliens are categorized into four detention categories: required, high priority, medium priority, and lower priority. Aliens in required detention must be detained, while those in other categories may be detained based on space and case facts. Higher priority aliens should be detained before lower priority ones. INA Section 236A mandates detention for aliens involved in terrorist activities or endangering national security. The Attorney General must initiate removal proceedings or release the alien within seven days of arrest. Detention for certified terrorists can last up to six months if removal is unlikely. Under the INA, aliens deemed a danger to national security can be detained for up to six months. The Attorney General reviews terrorist certifications every six months. DHS is responsible for arresting and detaining aliens, with decisions on detention made within 48 hours. Aliens subject to removal orders must be removed within 90 days, with the possibility of rearrest for those paroled or released on bond. Certain aliens subject to a removal order may be detained beyond the removal period and, if released, shall be subject to terms of supervision. The INA contains both criminal and civil violations, with enforcement of civil provisions being a federal responsibility. States have a limited role in enforcing immigration law, primarily focusing on criminal provisions. State and local law enforcement officers can inquire about an immigrant's status during their normal duties. They can contact DHS ICE for assistance and detain suspects for immigration status checks. However, prolonged detention solely for immigration enforcement may be unlawful. The law allows for the detention of criminal aliens, national security risks, and asylum seekers without proper documentation until they can prove a credible fear of persecution. Section 236 of the INA mandates the pre-removal-order detention of aliens certified as terrorist suspects by the Attorney General. The Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS have discretion to detain any alien in removal proceedings and must detain those charged as terrorists. Prior to 2001, the mandatory detention provisions created in IIRIRA had led to some aliens being in indefinite administrative custody. These detainees, known as \"lifers\" or \"unremovables,\" were ordered removed from the United States but could not obtain travel documents or were refused release by immigration officials. Some detainees had been in immigration detention longer than their criminal incarceration. In 2000, before the Supreme Court ruling on indefinite detention for aliens ordered removed, INS estimated 5,000 aliens in administrative custody. The Supreme Court decision in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001) established a limit on post-removal detention, citing constitutional concerns and setting a presumptively reasonable period of six months for detention after a removal order. The Supreme Court ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001) set a presumptively reasonable period of six months for post-removal detention of aliens. The Court emphasized that after this period, if an alien shows there is no significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future, the government must provide evidence to rebut this. The decision does not mean all aliens must be released in six months, and special arguments can be made for preventive detention of terrorists or aliens in special circumstances. The Attorney General issued regulations in response to this ruling. The Attorney General issued regulations for post-removal order detention cases to determine foreseeability of removal, effective November 14, 2001. Chief Immigration Judge Michael Creppy later issued a memorandum on the Immigration Court's policy regarding these regulations, establishing four categories of aliens not foreseeable for removal but may still be detained for special circumstances like contagious diseases, adverse foreign policy consequences, security or terrorism reasons, and specific dangerousness. In Clark v. Martinez, the Court applied the rationale from Zadvydas to aliens who had not been legally admitted into the United States and were being detained beyond the statutory removal period. The six-month presumptive detention period applied to these cases. The Court distinguished between excludable aliens seeking entry and deportable aliens who had entered the United States, suggesting a potential future decision on indefinite detention. In Clark v. Martinez, the Court applied the rationale from Zadvydas to aliens who had not been legally admitted into the United States. Justice Thomas criticized the Court's departure from its constitutional rationale in Zadvydas and its suggestion that inadmissible aliens presented a different situation. The Court decided that treating inadmissible aliens differently under the removal statute would render an inconsistent interpretation of the statute. Aliens arriving in the US without valid documentation are subject to expedited removal, leading to continuous detention until removal. Detention may only be lifted for medical emergencies or law enforcement needs. Those expressing fear of persecution undergo a \"credible fear\" interview, potentially leading to parole in the US. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 mandated that aliens arriving without proper documentation and claiming asylum be detained until their \"credible fear\" hearing. This was a change from previous practices where most asylum seekers were released into the US. False asylum claims strain resources and delay processing for legitimate cases. The practice of detaining asylum seekers is debated, with some arguing it deters fraudulent claims while others believe it is too harsh. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees considers detention of asylum seekers as \"inherently undesirable\" due to potential psychological harm and lack of understanding among detainees. Some argue that alternatives to detention should be developed for asylum seekers, as the Secretary has the authority to parole detained aliens not subject to mandatory detention. Parole is available on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, and aliens not subject to mandatory detention may be released on bonds of at least $1,500. Detained aliens not under expedited removal have rights such as applying for asylum, communicating with consular officers, legal representation, medical treatment, access to legal resources, and the right to challenge detention. They can challenge custody and bond determinations before a removal order is final and appeal decisions to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Parole may be granted for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit, with release on bonds starting at $1,500 for aliens not subject to mandatory detention. The courts have given the Administration discretion in decisions regarding alien detention, facilities, and treatment. Detainees should be treated humanely, but there is no consensus on detention conditions. ICE established Performance-Based National Detention Standards in 2011 to specify appropriate conditions for immigration detainees. These standards are similar to American Correctional Association standards. The Detention Standards for alien detainees do not have the force of law, leading to a lack of legal recourse for violations. Some argue that immigration detention is perceived similarly to criminal incarceration by the public, despite being civil detention. The Obama Administration established the Office of Detention Policy and Planning in 2009 to revamp the immigration detention system. ICE faces challenges in ensuring national detention standards are upheld due to the variety of detention facilities. The Office of Detention Policy and Planning (ODPP) aims to redesign the immigration detention system to better meet the needs of ICE's detained population. The average daily noncitizen detention population increased significantly from FY2002 to FY2013, with a corresponding rise in funded beds. Congress notably increased bed space funding between FY2006 and FY2007. Between FY2002 and FY2013, Congress increased bed space funding from 20,800 to 27,500 beds. The average daily detention population closely correlates with funded bed space, reaching a peak of 429,000 foreign nationals detained in FY2011. 67.0% of detainees were from Mexico, with shorter stays compared to other nationalities like Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. In FY2011, the top three nationalities of detainees were Guatemala (9.0%), Honduras (6.2%), and El Salvador (5.5%). There are differing opinions on the detention policies of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with some arguing that too many non-threatening individuals are detained, impacting ICE's discretion in detention decisions. Others believe that more noncitizens should be detained for removal purposes to protect public safety and deter illegal border crossings and false asylum claims. In the United States, concerns have been raised about the deportation process, with issues such as detainees not appearing for immigration hearings and decisions on release possibly being based on detention space availability rather than individual cases. Moving detainees between facilities can also cause delays in hearings. The increase in the number of noncitizens in DHS detention has raised concerns about the cost of detaining noncitizens. For FY2012, it cost DHS an average of $118 a day for each detainee, excluding transportation and deportation costs. Funding for ICE's detention operations increased between FY2008 and FY2012, despite budget constraints. Congress appropriated similar amounts for custody operations in FY2010 and FY2011, funding 33,400 beds in both years. In FY2012, Congress increased the number of beds by 600 and funding for custody operations by $257 million. ICE initiated the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) in 2004 as an alternative to detention for low-risk, non-violent offenders, using electronic monitoring and home visits. In FY2012, Congress allocated $72.4 million for alternatives to detention, including the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP). Various bills in the 112th Congress proposed changes to detention policies, such as increasing detention space, regulating detainee care, and expanding alternative programs. Only one bill, H.R. 1932, received Congressional action, focusing on changes to mandatory detention provisions. The Judiciary Committee reported H.R. 1932, the Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2011, which aimed to modify post-removal order detention conditions. The bill allowed DHS to detain indefinitely, with six-month reviews, aliens under removal orders who could not be removed for various reasons related to public safety, national security, and community safety. The bill, H.R. 1932, aimed to allow indefinite detention of certain aliens under removal orders for public safety reasons, with limited habeas corpus reviews in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Proponents argued that the legislation was necessary to prevent criminal aliens from being released and committing additional crimes. The bill H.R. 1932 aimed to allow extended detention of certain aliens under removal orders for public safety reasons, with limited habeas corpus reviews in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Critics argued that existing systems could keep dangerous individuals away from the public, and the bill could lead to unnecessary and expensive detention of asylum seekers and immigrants. The number of noncitizens in immigration detention has been increasing steadily over the past decade. The law allows for detention of certain aliens under removal orders, with discretion given to DHS and the Attorney General for parole or bond release. Congressional interest includes concerns about mandatory detention, detention conditions, and limits on detention time for aliens ordered removed but unable to return home."
