    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevent Terrorists from Reuniting with Terrorist Cells Act\". Congress finds that the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay is essential for holding high-security risk individuals, providing maximum security, multiple levels of confinement, and medical care not widely available. As of the enactment of this Act, there are 198 individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, including terrorist trainers, financiers, bomb makers, bodyguards of Osama bin Laden, recruiters, facilitators, and potential suicide bombers. Detainees fall into three categories: those cleared for release but with no country willing to accept them, those tried or awaiting trial for alleged law violations. Since early 2002, 779 individuals have been transferred to Guantanamo Bay. The majority of detainees have been moved to third countries for continued detention or release, with over 550 individuals departing to various countries. As of April 30, 2009, 22 nations and regions are considered terrorist safe havens, with 4 nations as state sponsors of terrorism. Individuals from Guantanamo Bay have been transferred to some of these regions. Iraq is recognized for terrorist activity by the Department of State. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran are recognized as terrorist safe havens by the Department of State. Guantanamo Bay detainees have been transferred to or released into these countries. Sudan is also identified as a state sponsor of terrorism. Sudan and Yemen are recognized as state sponsors of terrorism and terrorist safe havens, respectively. Guantanamo Bay detainees have been transferred to or released into these countries. Approximately 90 Yemeni nationals are detained at Guantanamo Bay, with 45 qualified for repatriation. Said Ali al-Shihri, suspected of involvement in the bombing of the US Embassy in Yemen, was released from Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia in 2007. In 2007, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, trained by Al Qaeda in Yemen, attempted a terrorist attack on American soil. President Obama halted Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers to Yemen, but they can still be sent to other nations complicit in terrorism. According to a Department of Defense report from 2009, 14% of former Guantanamo Bay detainees have been confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of over 530 detainees transferred, 27 were confirmed and 47 suspected of terrorist activity. The recidivism rate for released detainees has increased. The recidivism rate of former Guantanamo Bay detainees has increased from 14% to 20% since a special report was published. Transferring detainees to terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism poses a greater threat to US national security. The global interconnectedness allows for easy movement of individuals across borders with minimal supervision. No individual detained at Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, can be transferred to nations or regions recognized as terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism."
