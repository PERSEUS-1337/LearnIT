Penalty-free distributions from retirement plans for disaster-related expenses, including repairing or replacing damaged property in presidentially-declared disasters. Qualified disaster-related distributions defined for individual retirement plans and employer contributions. Qualified disaster-related distributions are defined as distributions received by an individual to pay for the repair or replacement of qualified disaster-damaged personal property or residence within 60 days. Qualified disaster-related distributions are exempt from certain restrictions, with limitations on withdrawals for uninsured losses and property covered by insurance. The claim for compensation on disaster-damaged property must be filed with insurance. Definitions for qualified disaster-damaged property are provided. The term 'disaster area' refers to an area designated by the President for assistance under the Stafford Disaster Relief Act. Special rules apply to the replacement of a residence, including covering usual settlement costs. If a distribution fails to meet requirements due to a delay in acquiring a residence, the amount can be contributed to an individual retirement plan within 120 days. Certain rules do not apply to this contribution, and the amount is not considered in determining other factors. Conforming amendments are made to sections 401(k)(2)(B)(i) and 403(b)(11) of the Code regarding qualified disaster-related distributions. The amendments made by this section apply to qualified disaster-related distributions after December 31, 1993, for areas designated for assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act."
