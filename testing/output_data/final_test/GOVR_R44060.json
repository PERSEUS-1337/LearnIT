Authorized countries can benefit from CFF, while others must use \"full commitment financing.\" Initially exclusive to Israel, CFF has expanded to include countries like Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Portugal, South Korea, and Spain for purchasing military equipment. As of May 2015, only Israel and Egypt are authorized to use cash flow financing for their purchases of U.S. weaponry. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) administer foreign military sales using CFF. If a foreign government cancels a CFF defense contract, funds may be provided to U.S. defense contractors from a \"Termination Liability Reserve.\" Foreign governments must set aside a portion of their annual CFF funds for the reserve. Advocates of Cash Flow Financing (CFF) have praised its role in facilitating the sale of high-cost U.S. weapons systems, like fighter aircraft, to friendly foreign nations. However, critics argue that CFF commits Congress to future appropriations to cover the costs of these defense systems. Former Representative David Obey expressed concerns about the long-term implications of CFF on aid to the Middle East region. The committee is considering aid reductions to the Middle East over the next decade due to ongoing military contracts and cash flow financing. The 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt led to increased U.S. foreign assistance to Egypt, with cash flow financing being authorized by President Carter and continued by subsequent administrations. The decision to provide cash flow authorization to Egypt was made in 1979 as part of the U.S. foreign assistance following the Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt. Cash flow financing allowed Egypt to order larger quantities of military equipment over a longer period of time, beyond the initial $1.5 billion credit authorization. This practice is set to be discontinued in FY2018 according to recent announcements by the Obama Administration. Egypt received cash flow authorization in 1979 to purchase military equipment totaling $3.5 billion, with concerns raised by lawmakers about future appropriations and pressure on Congress to continue providing credit. The US has provided military assistance to Egypt for over three decades, with appropriations subject to Congress approval. Despite concerns, the relationship between the US and Egypt remains important. In March 2015, President Obama released select weapons systems to Egypt after a phone call with President al Sisi, pledging to continue seeking $1.3 billion in aid from Congress starting in fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, the President announced a shift in U.S. security assistance for Egypt towards counterterrorism, border security, Sinai security, and maritime security. Cash flow financing for Egypt's military equipment purchases will be discontinued to allow for more flexibility in tailoring assistance based on changing conditions. This decision followed a review of U.S. foreign assistance policy towards Egypt. The U.S. shifted security assistance for Egypt towards counterterrorism, border security, Sinai security, and maritime security in fiscal year 2018. This decision followed a review of foreign assistance policy towards Egypt, which raised questions about the legality and advisability of continued assistance after the ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi. Senator Patrick Leahy called for an end to authorizing Egypt for cash flow financing for military equipment purchases. The Working Group on Egypt, in a 2014 letter to President Obama, called for an end to cash flow financing for military aid to Egypt. This financing arrangement allows Egypt to demand U.S. public resources before congressional approval, limiting policy options. Additionally, a 2014 op-ed in the New York Times emphasized the need to stop Egypt from placing military hardware orders through a preferential system called cash flow finance. The President's decision to phase out cash flow finance (CFF) for Egypt is part of a broader policy approach balancing national security interests and democratic principles. This move aims to untangle contractual and legislative knots in the future, as CFF allows countries to place orders assuming Congress will appropriate funds. The relationship with Egypt is shifting towards less reliance on traditional military-to-military foundations, while maintaining some security cooperation. In recent years, U.S. military aid to Egypt has not been used for new acquisitions of major defense equipment. Cash-flow-financed FMF has been used to pay for previous purchases due to factors like a large number of FMS cases agreed upon between 2009 and 2011, political uncertainty in Egypt from 2011 to 2013, and congressional restrictions on FMF in FY2014 and FY2015 Appropriations Acts. The President's plan to eliminate CFF by 2018 aligns with recent trends and congressional action, as FMF obligations are now limited to existing sales only. It is unclear if the U.S. needs to extend credit to the Egyptian Air Force, given Egypt's existing fleet of F-16s and lack of partnership in advanced platforms like the F-35. U.S. officials may suggest Egypt allocate more FMF grants to sustainment and upgrades rather than new acquisitions. Congress could phase out CFF by specifying that FMF to Egypt should only be provided at the minimum necessary rate. The President's plan to end cash-flow financing (CFF) for Egypt by 2018 aligns with recent trends and congressional actions. There has been limited public discussion on the proposed policy changes, with some blaming President Obama for ending CFF and damaging U.S.-Egyptian relations. Despite potential reversals by the next President, support for CFF in Washington has waned. President Obama's decision to end cash-flow financing for Egypt has been criticized for damaging U.S.-Egyptian relations. The Egyptian government is seeking new international partners to diversify its military relationships and show displeasure with U.S. policy. The military has signed new arms agreements with Russia. The Egyptian military has signed new arms agreements with Russia and France, while receiving financial assistance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. It is uncertain if Egypt's reliance on U.S. military platforms will change soon. Some view a potential decrease in U.S. influence in Egypt as concerning, while others see it as a necessary rebalancing for both countries."
