    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides loan guarantees and grants to support small businesses, especially startups and microbusinesses, in accessing capital and credit. Traditional lending institutions are often hesitant to offer loans to microfirms, creating a barrier to microlending. One barrier to microlending for microfirms is the perceived risk of startups and smaller enterprises, which reduces their chances of obtaining financing. Microbusinesses require smaller amounts of capital, leading banks and investment companies to believe it is not efficient to invest in them. Microloan borrowers often struggle to find acceptable financing elsewhere, as reported in a 2007 Urban Institute survey. The SBA has provided loan guarantees since 1953 to encourage lenders to issue small business loans. Interest in a separate loan program for startups and microbusinesses grew in the 1980s due to the success of microlending institutions abroad. Congress authorized the SBA's Microloan lending program in 1991 to reach very small businesses not served by traditional lenders. The SBA's Microloan lending program was authorized in 1991 to assist women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs, as well as small business concerns in areas lacking credit. Loans are provided to intermediaries for small-scale loans averaging $10,000 for start-up or growing businesses. Grants are also given for intensive marketing efforts. The SBA's Microloan program, authorized in 1991, assists small businesses with loans through intermediaries. The program, made permanent in 1997, aims to help women- and minority-owned startups create jobs. Congressional interest in job creation has increased, leading to a focus on the program's eligibility standards and operating requirements. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the establishment of a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund, a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative, and $12 billion in tax relief for small businesses. It also made changes to the SBA's loan guaranty programs, including increasing loan limits for the Microloan program. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized the establishment of various programs to support small businesses, including the Small Business Lending Fund and State Small Business Credit Initiative. It also made changes to the SBA's loan guaranty programs, such as increasing loan limits for the Microloan program. Additionally, recent legislation has further relaxed requirements for Microloan intermediaries, allowing them to allocate more funds towards technical assistance for small businesses. The Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries was increased from $5 million to $6 million by P.L. 115-232. Several bills introduced during the 114th and 115th Congresses aimed to modify the Microloan program, including removing restrictions on the use of technical assistance grant funds and eliminating the minimum state allocation formula. The Senate bill, S. 2850, aimed to increase the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries from $5 million to $6 million and extend repayment terms to 10 years for loans over $10,000. It also sought to allow intermediaries to apply for a waiver to use more than 25% of technical assistance grant funds for borrower support. The Microloan Modernization Act of 2017, introduced in the 115th Congress, aimed to increase the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries to $6 million after the first year and eliminate the requirement for intermediaries to spend no more than 25% of technical assistance grant funds on borrower support. The House and Senate bills aimed to limit the use of Microloan technical assistance grant funds, with the House bill favorably reported and agreed to by voice vote. The Microloan program provides direct loans to nonprofit intermediary lenders without loan guarantees. The Microloan program offers direct loans to nonprofit intermediary lenders who then provide microloans up to $50,000 to small businesses and nonprofit child care centers. There are 144 active Microloan intermediaries across 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Administrative costs for the program are funded through the SBA's salaries and expenses and business loan administration accounts. Additionally, the SBA receives an appropriation for credit subsidies for its direct lending program. In FY2019, the SBA received $4.0 million for direct (Microloan) business loan credit subsidies, supporting about $42.0 million in lending to intermediaries. An additional $31.0 million was allocated for grants to selected Microloan intermediaries and technical assistance providers. Microloan intermediaries provided counseling services to 19,600 small businesses in FY2017, with an increasing trend in recent years. To qualify as an intermediary Microloan lender, the applicant must be a nonprofit organization, have experience in providing short-term loans to small businesses, and be located in the United States or its territories. The SBA Microloan program allows intermediaries to borrow up to $750,000 in the first year and $2.5 million thereafter, with a total debt limit of $6 million. The SBA approves loans based on application order, with a cap of 300 intermediaries at a time. At least $800,000 or 1/55th of available funds must be allocated for loans to intermediaries in each state during the first six months of the fiscal year. The SBA Microloan program requires at least $800,000 or 1/55th of available funds to be allocated for loans to intermediaries in each state in the first six months. Applications not funded initially due to geographic limitations will be considered in the seventh month if funds are available. The SBA may hold back up to 20% of loan funds to prioritize new intermediaries and those impacting underserved markets. If funds requested by new intermediaries exceed availability, the SBA may select a new intermediary in an unserved location. The SBA Microloan program prioritizes funding for intermediaries in underserved locations. Intermediaries do not make interest payments in the first year, but interest accrues from the loan disbursement date. Repayment must be completed within 10 years, with interest rates based on the five-year Treasury rate. The SBA may select a new intermediary in an unserved location if funds requested exceed availability. The SBA Microloan program requires intermediaries to contribute at least 15% of the loan amount in cash from nonfederal sources and provide the SBA with a first lien position on all notes receivable. Unlike other SBA loan programs, no upfront or ongoing service fees are charged. Additionally, the Intermediary's Cost of Funds is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary, with the interest rate not able to go below zero. Intermediaries in the SBA Microloan program must deposit loan proceeds, their 15% contribution, and borrower payments into a Microloan Revolving Fund. They can only withdraw funds for making microloans, repaying the SBA, and maintaining a Loan Loss Reserve Fund. This fund must equal 15% of outstanding balances until the fifth year, after which a lower loss rate may allow for adjustments. The SBA may reduce the required balance in an intermediary's Loan Loss Reserve Fund to their average annual loss rate if it is less than 15% over the preceding five years. Intermediaries must maintain the fund until all obligations to the SBA are repaid. The SBA estimated a borrower default rate of about 12% in 2007 for the Microloan program. The Loan Loss Reserve Fund helps cover borrower defaults, with the SBA's loss rate for intermediary repayment typically less than 3% each year. An intermediary may face suspension if necessary. In the Microloan program, intermediaries must meet specific performance standards to remain in the program, including closing and funding at least 10 microloans per year, maintaining a loan currency rate of 85% or more, and providing in-house technical assistance to clients. Failure to comply may result in suspension or removal from the program. Intermediaries in the Microloan program can receive a technical assistance grant of up to 25% of the total outstanding loan balance. The grant funds must be used for marketing, management, and technical assistance for Microloan borrowers, with a maximum of 50% allocated for prospective borrowers. Intermediaries must contribute 25% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources. Additionally, they must meet performance standards such as closing at least 10 microloans per year and providing in-house technical assistance to clients. The Microloan program allows intermediaries to receive a technical assistance grant of up to 25% of the outstanding loan balance, with a maximum of 50% for prospective borrowers. The SBA can temporarily waive the 25% nonfederal share requirement for grants under certain circumstances. Microloan borrowers are not required to participate in the assistance program, but intermediaries typically make it a condition for receiving a microloan. The Microloan program offers additional training grants to intermediaries with a loan portfolio averaging $10,000 or less. Nonprofit technical assistance providers can receive grant funds to support Microloan borrowers with marketing, management, and technical assistance. Up to 55 grants are awarded annually for this purpose. The Microloan program provides grants to nonprofit technical assistance providers to support borrowers with marketing, management, and technical assistance. The grants can be up to $200,000 for a term of up to five years, with the nonprofit entity required to contribute 20% from nonfederal sources. Microloan borrowers must be eligible for-profit small businesses, with an exception for borrowers establishing nonprofit childcare businesses. The SBA ceased awarding these grants in FY2005 due to duplication of services provided by Microloan intermediaries and other SBA programs. The Microloan program allows borrowers to establish nonprofit childcare businesses and receive small-scale loans averaging $10,000. Loans can go up to $50,000, with a maximum repayment period of six years. Funds can only be used for working capital and equipment acquisition, not for land or property. Loan terms vary based on the loan size. The Microloan program offers small-scale loans ranging from $10,000 to $50,000 with a maximum repayment period of six years. Loan terms depend on the loan size, intended use of funds, intermediary lender requirements, and borrower needs. Interest rates are negotiated between the borrower and the intermediary, typically ranging from 6.5% to 9%, with an average rate of 7.6% in FY2018. Each intermediary sets its own lending and credit criteria. The Microloan program offers loans from $10,000 to $50,000 with a maximum repayment period of six years. Borrowers must provide collateral and a personal guarantee. Intermediaries can charge packaging fees up to 3% for loans over a year and 2% for shorter terms, as well as out-of-pocket closing costs. The SBA does not review creditworthiness. In FY2018, the SBA approved 58 loans to intermediaries totaling $37.3 million, with an average loan amount of $643,724. Microloan intermediaries provided 5,459 loans to small businesses totaling $76.8 million, with an average loan amount of $14,071. The SBA disbursed 1,230 loans to intermediaries totaling $562.5 million by the end of FY2018, with 485 active loans and an unpaid balance of $165.3 million. The number and amount of Microloans provided to small businesses have increased in recent years, targeting new and early-stage businesses in underserved markets. Minority-owned firms received 47.4% of microloans issued, while women-owned firms received 48.7% in FY2018. In FY2018, women-owned or -controlled firms received 48.7% of microloans issued, with 38.9% of the total amount. Startup companies received 38.0% of microloans. The Microloan program's estimated borrower default rate is about 12%, but the SBA's loss rate for intermediary repayment is typically less than 3% annually. Microloans are commonly used for working capital, equipment, and inventory. The SBA's Microloan program is commonly used for working capital, equipment, inventory, and supplies. Critics argue it is duplicative of other programs and expensive, while advocates highlight its importance for low-income women and minority borrowers. President George W. Bush proposed eliminating funding for the Microloan program in multiple budget requests, arguing that the 7(a) program could serve the same clientele at a lower cost. Critics noted that a significant portion of the 7(a) program's loan guarantees were for loans under $35,000, which was the Microloan program's former limit, suggesting that the 7(a) program could effectively meet the needs of small businesses targeted by the Microloan program. Advocates argue that the SBA's Microloan program is complementary to the 7(a) loan guarantee program, as Microloan borrowers often face challenges accessing capital due to lack of credit history or lower credit scores. They believe the program is necessary despite existing counseling and training resources provided by the SBA. Advocates support the SBA's Microloan program for assisting microbusinesses, emphasizing the importance of intermediaries with expertise. They believe the program's grants for marketing and technical assistance are crucial for business success. Critics argue that the program is costly compared to other SBA programs. The SBA's Microloan program costs about $7,506 per small business assisted in FY2017, higher than the $1,316 per small business assisted in the 7(a) loan guarantee program. President George W. Bush recommended terminating the program due to its high expense. Advocates defend the program's higher cost, attributing it to the unique nature of the program and the special needs of its borrowers. Intermediaries often spend more time with Microloan borrowers due to their lack of experience with the credit application process. The SBA's Microloan program has higher costs compared to other loan programs, with advocates arguing that the unique nature of the program and the special needs of borrowers justify the expenses. Increasing interest rates for intermediaries to make the program self-financing could lead to economic hardship for borrowers, making it harder for them to grow their businesses and create jobs. The OIG released an audit of the SBA's Microloan program, identifying deficiencies in oversight that needed to be addressed for effective operation. The SBA's monitoring focused on intermediaries' loan repayments and lacked thorough analysis of fund sources and transfers. Onsite reviews were only conducted when an intermediary defaulted on their loan. The audit of the SBA's Microloan program found deficiencies in oversight, with onsite reviews only conducted when an intermediary defaulted on their loan. The program was understaffed, with 6 analysts overseeing 160 intermediaries and 460 loans. The Microloan borrower default rate of 12% was considered low given the program's high-risk nature. Duplicate loan reporting and borrowers exceeding the $35,000 limit were identified. The SBA's performance metrics were deemed inadequate, lacking outcome measures to ensure program success. The OIG recommended developing additional metrics to assist microloan borrowers effectively. The OIG found internal control weaknesses in the SBA's Microloan program, with documentation deficiencies and discrepancies in lender files. Inadequate documentation existed for the \"no credit elsewhere\" test, and supporting documentation for microloan funds was lacking. The OIG identified internal control weaknesses in the SBA's Microloan program, including inadequate documentation of how funds were used and exceeding allowable interest rates and fees. Recommendations were made to improve the information system, implement a site visit plan, and focus on outcome-based performance measures. The OIG identified internal control weaknesses in the SBA's Microloan program, including inadequate documentation of fund usage and exceeding allowable interest rates and fees. Recommendations were made to improve the information system, implement a site visit plan, and focus on outcome-based performance measures. The SBA agreed to update the Microloan program's SOP to clarify requirements and enhance monitoring of portfolio performance. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased loan limits for borrowers and intermediaries participating in the program. During the 113th Congress, bills were introduced to increase the Microloan program's loan limit for borrowers, with proposals ranging from $75,000 to $100,000. No bills were introduced during the 112th Congress regarding the Microloan program. The Ownership Act of 2014 and H.R. 5584 aimed to increase the Microloan program's loan limit for intermediaries from $5 million to $7 million. S. 1445 in the 114th Congress proposed removing the 25% limit on technical assistance grant funds and eliminating the minimum state allocation formula for the Microloan program. H.R. 2670 in the same Congress also sought to modernize the Microloan program. The Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2670) and its Senate companion bill (S. 1857) aimed to increase the Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries to $6 million, extend repayment terms to 10 years for loans over $10,000, and allow waivers for the 25% limit on technical assistance grant funds. H.R. 2670 was passed by the House in July 2015, while S. 1857 was reported by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. The Microloan program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries was increased to $6 million after the first year of participation. Requirements on how technical assistance grant funds are spent were eliminated. The SBA was required to study and report on Microloan intermediaries and make recommendations to reduce costs and increase participation. The Government Accountability Office was tasked with studying the SBA's oversight of the program and its overall performance. During the 115th Congress, P.L. 115-141 relaxed requirements for Microloan technical assistance grant funds. P.L. 115-232 increased the program's aggregate loan limit for intermediaries to $6 million. During the 111th Congress, debates focused on proposed changes to the SBA's loan programs, including the Microloan program, to improve small business access to capital and job creation. Some advocated for increased resources, while others preferred business tax reductions and fiscal restraint for economic growth. During the 111th Congress, debates focused on proposed changes to the SBA's loan programs to assist small business economic growth and job creation. Provisions enacted in various laws aimed to increase loan limits and access to capital for micro borrowers, ultimately creating jobs. The 2008 Urban Institute study found that differences in SBA financing terms were not significantly associated with increasing sales or employment among firms. Factors such as local economic conditions, zoning regulations, tax rates, and business owner's skills may also impact business performance after receiving SBA financing. The study suggests that measuring the Microloan program's effect on job retention and creation is complex due to various influencing factors and the lack of performance-oriented measures. The SBA's Office of Inspector General recommends adopting performance-oriented measures for the Microloan program, including tracking the number of borrowers remaining in business post-loan and analyzing the impact of technical assistance on borrower success. Congress could also consider surveying Microloan borrowers on their loan acquisition experiences. The curr_chunk discusses the private sector's experience in obtaining microloans from intermediaries and how this assistance contributed to job creation and business expansion."
