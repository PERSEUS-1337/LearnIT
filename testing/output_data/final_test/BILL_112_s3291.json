    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Telephone Billing Act of 2012\". Congress finds that unauthorized third-party charges on wireline telephone bills, known as \"cramming\", have been a problem since the 1990s. Multiple enforcement actions have been taken against individuals and companies for engaging in cramming, affecting millions of users. The problem of unauthorized third-party charges on wireline telephone bills, known as \"cramming\", has affected millions of users, costing them billions of dollars over the past decade. Telephone companies have placed these charges without authorization, with many illegitimate companies exploiting the billing platforms. Millions of consumers have transitioned from wireline telephone services in the last decade. Users of interconnected VoIP service, whether for residential or business purposes, are increasingly facing unauthorized third-party charges similar to wireline telephone users. Wireless users are also experiencing this issue, reporting unauthorized charges on their bills for services they did not sign up for. SEC. 3. UNAUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY CHARGES. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to prevent illegal changes in subscriber carrier sections and unauthorized third-party charges. It prohibits local exchange carriers and providers of interconnected VoIP services from placing third-party charges unrelated to telephone services on a customer's bill, unless the charge is from a certified third-party vendor or for a product/service jointly marketed/sold with their own service.

The Federal Communications Commission will establish rules within 90 days of the Act's enactment to enforce the prohibition of unauthorized third-party charges on customer bills by local exchange carriers and VoIP providers, except for charges from certified vendors or for products/services sold with their own service.
