The National September 11 Memorial and Museum Foundation has been dedicated to raising funds for and overseeing the design, construction, and operation of the Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center site since 2003. Millions of people from all over the world have visited Ground Zero to pay their respects. The Memorial at the World Trade Center site honors those who died in the 9/11 attacks and recognizes survivors and those who showed compassion. It also aims to educate future generations about the events of that day.
