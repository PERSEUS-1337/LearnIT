    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the rise of a new form of work where individuals are hired through online platforms for short-term jobs. Individuals hired through online platforms for short-term jobs are treated as independent contractors, not employees, and are not protected by state labor laws. They are unable to negotiate terms of service and the platforms take a significant portion of their earnings. The Legislature aims to balance the bargaining power between hosting platforms and workers by allowing them to negotiate for better conditions, including improved income. This new process, outlined in Chapter 4.8 of the Labor Code, seeks to benefit the economy and reduce strain on public resources. In Chapter 4.8 of the Labor Code, group activities include negotiating with hosting platforms, communicating through various mediums, restricting work, and critiquing business practices. This aims to balance power between platforms and workers for better conditions and improved income. In Chapter 4.8 of the Labor Code, group activities include negotiating with hosting platforms, communicating through various mediums, restricting work, critiquing business practices, and reporting violations to law enforcement authorities. A hosting platform connects people seeking work with those offering work, but does not include service providers that only list goods or services without involvement in transactions. An independent contractor has the right to engage in group activity with hosting platforms, and such activity is considered labor within the Business and Professions Code. Group activity by independent contractors is not subject to restrictions on combinations in restraint of trade. Group activity is defined as a \"labor dispute\" and courts can issue injunctive relief for violations of this chapter. Hosting platforms must negotiate in good faith with groups of independent contractors on various subjects, including pricing, revenue division, assignments, advertising, insurance, and more. Independent contractors can be represented by individuals or organizations in negotiations with hosting platforms, but these representatives cannot be funded by the platform. Participation in the negotiation group must be confirmed by electronic communication or a signed document, and contractors must agree to be bound by the negotiation outcomes. Written contracts for independent contractor services, made after negotiations, must include any agreements reached between the hosting platform and the contractor group. The State Mediation and Conciliation Service facilitates hosting platform obligations, provides meeting space for negotiations, offers mediation services, investigates complaints, and can take legal action for violations. The State Mediation and Conciliation Service may receive attorney's fees and costs if it succeeds in enforcing actions. A person cannot retaliate against an independent contractor for exercising their rights or participating in enforcement proceedings. If termination or adverse action is taken within one year of these activities, a detailed written statement of reasons must be provided. When terminating an independent contractor within one year of their rights exercise, a detailed written statement of reasons must be given, including facts supporting the decision and any contradicting facts known to the person. An independent contractor or their representative can take legal action in superior court for violations of this chapter, seeking remedies such as injunctive relief, reinstatement, and compensatory damages. Damages for willful violations can be tripled. The exercise of rights under this chapter cannot be used as evidence of independent contractor status in legal proceedings. This chapter does not affect worker classification or pending litigation. The provisions of this chapter are severable, meaning that if any part is deemed invalid, it will not affect the other valid provisions."
