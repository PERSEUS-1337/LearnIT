    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"STEM Gateways Act\". Congress finds that women are underrepresented in engineering and computing occupations within STEM, with only 26 percent of STEM workers being women in 2011. The number of engineering degrees awarded to African-American women has also declined since the late 1990s. Additionally, half of all STEM jobs do not require a 4-year college degree. The STEM economy offers job opportunities for workers without a 4-year college degree, paying $53,000 per year on average. However, only one-fifth of the Federal Government's $4.3 billion annual spending on STEM education supports sub-bachelor's level training. Underrepresented minorities make up only 3 out of 10 professionals in STEM fields. STEM workers earn more than non-STEM counterparts. According to the America After 3pm report, children from minority populations participate in afterschool programs in greater numbers, with girls participating equally to boys. Afterschool learning can help engage underrepresented populations in STEM fields and careers. \"Grant program authorized under SEC. 3.\" The Secretary of Education will award grants to eligible entities to implement programs promoting STEM interest and success among women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds at elementary and secondary school levels. The Secretary of Education will award grants to eligible entities to promote STEM interest and success among women, minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds at elementary and secondary school levels. Grants are limited to a 5-year period and require an application outlining the use of funds at either the elementary or secondary school level. The eligible entity must describe the programs to achieve STEM goals at the elementary school level, including program content, research, and models used. Programs should support the success of women, minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds. The eligible entity must describe programs to achieve STEM goals at the elementary school level, including recruiting disadvantaged individuals and supporting educators. Encouraging partnerships between in-school and out-of-school educators is also important. Identifying public and private partners for support is crucial. The eligible entity must describe programs at the secondary school level to achieve STEM goals, including program content, research, and models used for program design. The eligible entity must describe programs at the secondary school level to achieve STEM goals, including supporting women, girls, underrepresented minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds in STEM education and workforce training. This involves recruiting participants and supporting educators leading the programs. The eligible entity must describe programs at the secondary school level to achieve STEM goals, including supporting women, girls, underrepresented minorities, and individuals from all economic backgrounds in STEM education and workforce training. This involves recruiting participants, identifying public and private partners, partnering with institutions of higher education and informal science education providers, and planning for financial sustainability beyond the grant period. An eligible entity receiving a grant must use the funds to implement programs at elementary or secondary school levels to achieve STEM goals for women, girls, underrepresented minorities, and students from all economic backgrounds. This includes addressing workforce needs in STEM fields and analyzing job openings requiring STEM knowledge or training. Authorized use of funds for STEM programs may include activities like carrying out specific tasks, providing professional development for teachers and school personnel, and offering tutoring and mentoring programs in STEM fields. Providing tutoring, mentoring, partnerships with higher education, employers, and industry stakeholders, after-school activities, summer programs, and utilizing educational materials for STEM fields. The eligible entities receiving a grant under this Act must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the use of funds and the number of students participating in STEM programs funded by the grant. The grant can be used for educational materials, equipment, internships, and experiential learning opportunities in STEM fields. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on the impact and effectiveness of the grant program, based on reports from eligible entities detailing the use of funds and student participation in STEM programs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"educational service agency\", \"local educational agency\", \"institution of higher education\", \"community college\", \"economically disadvantaged individual\", and \"economically distressed area\".
