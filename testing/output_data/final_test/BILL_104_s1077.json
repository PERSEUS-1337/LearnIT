    "content": "The \"Hydrogen Future Act of 1995\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The findings section of the Act is outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that fossil fuels, the main energy source, are limited but have provided a tremendous supply. Additional research is needed to encourage private sector investment in new energy sources. Hydrogen is seen as a promising fuel due to its clean burning properties and potential for extraction from water. Efficient hydrogen production is a key barrier to benefiting from this future energy carrier. An aggressive research initiative on hydrogen fuel production should be maintained at the federal level. The current Federal effort to develop hydrogen as a fuel is deemed inadequate. The Act aims to advance hydrogen production and usage across various sectors, seeking input from academia and the private sector. It defines key terms and directs the Department of Energy to lead research and development efforts. The Secretary shall conduct a hydrogen energy research, development, and demonstration program to enable private sector demonstration of hydrogen use for various applications, prioritizing Federal funding based on private sector activities. The Secretary will solicit proposals for research and development activities related to hydrogen within 180 days of enacting appropriations. Proposals may be considered from contractors managing department facilities, with awards to be made within the same timeframe. The Secretary will award financial assistance competitively for worthy proposals within 180 days of submission, using peer review with protection of proprietary information. For research proposals, a commitment of at least 25 percent from non-Federal sources is required, which may be reduced for basic or fundamental research. The Secretary requires a commitment of at least 50 percent from non-Federal sources for development or demonstration proposals. Before providing financial assistance, consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce is necessary to ensure consistency with international agreements. Industry participants must certify their compliance. The Secretary mandates a 50% commitment from non-Federal sources for development or demonstration proposals. Industry participants must certify their efforts to obtain non-Federal funding and that full non-Federal funding was not feasible. The Secretary is prohibited from duplicating programs carried out by other government agencies or the private sector. The Secretary promotes the exchange of nonproprietary technology among industry, academia, and government agencies to benefit the US economy. Additionally, the Secretary is required to report to Congress. The Secretary is mandated to report annually to Congress on the Department's hydrogen research program, including an analysis by the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel and recommendations for program improvements. The Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is being amended to reorganize sections and make changes to subsections. The Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1990 is being amended to reorganize sections and make changes to subsections, including adjustments to section numbers and paragraph deletions. SEC. 8. COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION.\n\nThe Secretary will coordinate hydrogen research activities with other federal agencies and consult with the Hydrogen Technical Advisory Panel. SEC. 9. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of Appropriations: $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1996, $35,000,000 for fiscal year 1997, and $40,000,000 for fiscal year 1998. Limitation on obligating funds for energy supply research and development activities in fiscal years 1996-1998 to not exceed the amount obligated in fiscal year 1995. No authorization for appropriation of Federal funds."
