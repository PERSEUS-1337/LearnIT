    "content": "The \"Accountability in Foster Care Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. The findings section highlights key points related to foster care. The Congress emphasizes the importance of monitoring States' performance in providing for the safety, permanency, stability, and well-being of children in foster care and emancipated youth through measurable outcome data. Child welfare experts have identified serious problems with current efforts to measure program functioning related to children in foster care and emancipated youth. The Congress highlights the need for monitoring States' performance in providing for children in foster care and emancipated youth. Issues include the failure to consider factors affecting reunification success, the lack of implementation of the National Youth in Transition Database, and the importance of reliable information for effective Federal oversight of the child welfare system. The Administration of Children and Families faces challenges in monitoring State performance due to a lack of comprehensive information in State plans regarding goals, services, and youth outcomes. The Advisory Panel on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System is established. The Secretary establishes an Advisory Panel on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) to improve State performance in child welfare programs. The Panel will make recommendations for revising AFCARS to track child-specific outcomes. The Advisory Panel on AFCARS aims to improve State child welfare programs by tracking child-specific outcomes, analyzing cohort data, integrating with the National Youth in Transition Database, and developing appropriate timeframes for following children after exiting the foster care system. The Advisory Panel on AFCARS focuses on improving State child welfare programs by monitoring child well-being outcomes, proposing improvements to State performance measures, and developing a uniform reporting format for child and family services plans. The Advisory Panel on AFCARS focuses on developing services for children and families, proposing performance standards that consider differences among States and populations served, and examining the feasibility of linking AFCARS and NCANDS to understand longitudinal outcomes of children in both systems. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines the membership of the panel. The Advisory Panel on AFCARS is determined by Health and Human Services and includes representatives from state and local agencies, research organizations, universities, and private nonprofit organizations with expertise in child welfare. The Advisory Panel on AFCARS includes experts in child welfare assessment tools, representatives of Federal agencies, families of former foster children, and courts. States can use alternative measures until final regulations are in place for compliance assessment. The Advisory Board is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act's section on permanency. SEC. 4. REGULATIONS TO REVISE THE ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE ANALYSIS AND REPORTING SYSTEM. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must publish proposed regulations in the Federal Register within 12 months of the Act's enactment to revise AFCARS. The regulations will be based on Advisory Panel recommendations and allow for longitudinal analysis of child-specific outcomes, integration with the National Youth in Transition Database, and other necessary rules for AFCARS functionality. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will publish final regulations to revise AFCARS within 6 months after the required notice is published."
