President Kennedy highlighted the need for reorganization and long-term economic aid to developing countries through the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. This was in response to the declining prestige of U.S. foreign aid programs and the negative impact on administering and staffing programs abroad.

Congress regularly updated funding levels and authorization time frames through new legislation or amendments until 1985. After 1986, Congress began enacting freestanding authorities and waiving the requirement to keep authorizations current. Since 1985, Congress and the President have introduced specialized authorities in separate legislation, occasionally establishing new programs in annual appropriations acts. Some programs fall outside the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and are addressed in other legislation like the Arms Export Control Act. Some specialized authorities for foreign aid are established in separate legislation, including annual appropriations acts. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes programs and corresponding appropriations, with sections detailing policy, findings, and program requirements.
