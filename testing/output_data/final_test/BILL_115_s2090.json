    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017\" or the \"MEMA Act of 2017.\" It includes a National Flood Mapping Program. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 is amended to include partnering with other Federal agencies and private entities to utilize current remote sensing technology for the National Flood Mapping Program. The Administrator, in coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, will establish a digital display environment for flood hazard risk production and dissemination within 5 years of the Municipality Empowerment Mapping Achievement Act of 2017. The Administrator will partner with successful States and communities to adopt their techniques and technologies for nationwide application. Additionally, a digital display will be created for flood hazard areas using a spatial building database. The Administrator will partner with States and communities to adopt techniques and technologies for nationwide application. A digital display will be created for flood hazard areas using a spatial building database, including structure-specific flood risk information for lender compliance. The curr_chunk discusses various details required for flood insurance, including letter of map changes, risk premium rates, and disclosure information under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The curr_chunk provides details on the estimated cost to repair structures damaged by floods with different recurrence intervals, as well as explanations for differences in risk premium rates under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968. The curr_chunk discusses privacy requirements for a database related to flood structure mitigation methods and claims history. The Administrator is prohibited from disseminating the database to the public or private companies for use. The Administrator is required to develop a database of buildings in the national flood insurance program, including footprints and elevations data obtained from LiDAR or other methods. The Administrator is required to collect data such as elevation certificates, parcel information, flood insurance rate maps, and other necessary data to identify and reduce flood hazards for individual properties. The Administrator will obtain necessary data for establishing the environment to reduce flood hazards, including directing communities to collect information for structures in flood hazard areas, issuing guidelines, and partnering with stakeholders. The Administrator will work with stakeholders to obtain existing data that meets standards, contract with private companies for new LiDAR data, provide a premium credit for elevation certificates, and issue guidelines for integrating flood hazard risk production systems. The Administrator shall issue guidelines for the adoption and integration of LiDAR-based letter of map amendment approaches into the National Flood Mapping Program. An annual progress report on the implementation of this subsection, including cost reduction recommendations, shall be submitted to the Senate and House Committees. Reimbursement Authority is granted to State or local agencies assisting the Administrator in carrying out responsibilities under subsection (a)(2). The Administrator may reimburse State or local agencies for providing assistance under subsection (a)(2) if they comply with established standards and guidance documents."
