    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Public School Redefinition Act of 1993\" and includes findings. The Congress emphasizes the importance of improving educational services for all citizens, especially disadvantaged individuals, to enhance national and economic security. Fundamental reform is necessary to unleash the potential of teachers, students, parents, and communities. Market competition and choice can drive positive change in education, but more options are needed for all students, including those who are disadvantaged or historically underserved. The Congress emphasizes the need for educational reform to improve services for all citizens, especially disadvantaged individuals, to enhance national and economic security. Public education should focus on outcomes that benefit the public interest, not just ownership of facilities by local agencies. The purpose of this Act is to encourage the establishment of new and more effective public schools by providing federal assistance and flexibility to states, teachers, parents, and communities. It also aims to provide criteria for the establishment of such schools. The Act defines an \"eligible partnership\" as a partnership between a sponsor and a charter public school. It also defines a \"charter public school\" as a nonsectarian school with a primary focus on providing comprehensive instruction for grades kindergarten to twelfth or ages 5 to 18. A charter public school for students aged 5 to 18 must comply with various regulations, including not charging tuition, following civil rights laws, admitting students through a lottery if there are more applicants than spots available, undergoing financial audits, and meeting health and safety requirements. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education, while the term \"sponsor\" includes school boards, local educational agencies, and State educational agencies. The term \"State educational agency\" is defined by section 1471(23) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5. PROGRAM AUTHORITY. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to State educational agencies for charter public school programs. Grants can also be awarded to charter public schools in States that choose not to participate in the program. Grant funds must be used to award grants to charter public schools. Each charter public school in the State can receive a grant to plan and implement a charter public school. The State educational agency can reserve up to 5% of the grant funds for administrative expenses. A charter public school can receive a grant for a maximum of 3 years and must meet a matching requirement to qualify for the grant. Charter public schools must provide matching funds of 10% in the first year and 25% in the second and third years to receive a grant. Grants awarded must benefit students in urban and rural areas. Funds cannot be used for construction but can be used for planning, equipment purchases, and minor renovations to meet health and safety requirements. SEC. 6. APPLICATION. Each State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining the objectives of their charter public school program and steps taken to inform stakeholders about the program and available grants. The State educational agency must obtain waivers of relevant statutes and regulations hindering the establishment of charter public schools. They must also outline outcomes and requirements for partnership agreements and ensure charter schools meet the defined criteria. Each charter public school must outline specific outcomes, explain how progress will be measured, and describe the involvement of teachers, parents, and community members in planning and implementation. Schools seeking grants must submit an application to the Secretary in accordance with the outlined criteria. Each application for grants must be submitted to the Secretary with required information and assurances, following outlined criteria. SEC. 7. OUTCOMES AGREEMENT.\n\nCharter public schools must have an outcomes agreement with the sponsor in order to receive a grant under this Act. The agreement includes setting forth outcomes to achieve and specific information and assurances.\n\nSEC. 8. CONTINUATION OF FUNDING.\n\nCharter public schools receiving grants under this Act are eligible for Federal, State, and local education funding as if they were a local educational agency.\n\nSEC. 9. TERMINATION. SEC. 9. TERMINATION. The Secretary or State educational agency will stop grant payments if the charter public school is not making acceptable progress. SEC. 10. REPORTS. Charter public schools receiving grants must report annually to the State educational agency on their progress in meeting outcomes. The State agency must then report to the Secretary. Charter public schools receiving different grants must report directly to the Secretary. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and necessary sums for the following 3 fiscal years."
