    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace Authorization Act of 2017\". Congress finds that peaceful co-existence in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as between Muslims, Christians, Jews, and people of all backgrounds, is crucial for the interests of the United States, Israel, the Palestinian people, and the world. Efforts for lasting peace in the region require broad popular support among the people living there, in addition to diplomatic and political negotiations. Activities are underway to build better relations between people of different backgrounds through trust-building measures and cooperative efforts. By working together on shared goals, participants can reject violence and promote peaceful coexistence. Support for people-to-people exchanges and joint economic initiatives can help millions of citizens affected by conflict to contribute to lasting peace. The United States, along with other countries and the private sector, aim to sustain support for peace through collaborative opportunities. The establishment of an independent International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace aims to promote contact, cooperation, dialogue, economic development, and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The Fund will serve as a coordinating entity adhering to best practices for governance and accountability. The International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace aims to reject violence and build public support for peace in the region. It is a grant-making body to facilitate people-to-people relationships and joint economic development. The purposes of the Act include urging the establishment of a non-political International Fund to promote cooperation, dialogue, and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. The United States will contribute funds to the International Fund for Israeli-Palestinian Peace to support joint economic development and reconciliation efforts between Israelis and Palestinians.
