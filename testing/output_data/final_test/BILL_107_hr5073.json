    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Immigration Security and Efficiency Enhancement Act of 2002\". The Congress finds delays in processing immigration applications at the INS have led to national security issues, such as granting visas to individuals involved in the World Trade Center bombings. The INS has a backlog of 5 million applications and 40% of requests for permanent resident status are filled out incorrectly. President Clinton signed the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act into law in June of 2000. Immigrants in southern California often pay between $500 and $3,000 to submit their applications, with costs ranging from $500-$800 for naturalization applications to $2,000-$3,000 for family-sponsored green card applications. There is no certified means of identifying organizations that provide fair immigration services, leading to competition among organizations without a reliable way to distinguish between good and bad information sources. The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act was signed into law in June 2000, making electronic signatures legally equivalent to physical signatures. The State Department is introducing a web-based arms export license application system to enhance inter-agency cooperation and reduce illegal arms trafficking. The United States Government is improving immigration, visa, border patrol, and naturalization services by implementing an electronic application process through certified filing entities and e-file applications. The United States Government is enhancing security and efficiency in immigration, visa, border patrol, and naturalization services through electronic application processes. The Attorney General must submit a plan to Congress within 90 days for implementing security and efficiency enhancements in immigration processes. This includes establishing a central computer database, identifying forms for electronic submission, and conducting pilot projects for electronic submission of immigration applications. Implementation of elective electronic submission of designated immigration applications and forms is mandated within specific timeframes after the enactment of the Act, gradually increasing the volume of electronic submissions. The goal is to reach 75 percent electronic submission within 8 years, with a preference for electronic submission wherever feasible. The Attorney General will implement an electronic application process for immigration, visa, border patrol, and naturalization services, excluding applications by felons or illegal residents. An annual report on the progress of the plan must be submitted to Congress. The Attorney General will establish a state-of-the-art electronic file management system within the Department of Justice for visa, immigration, border patrol, and naturalization functions. Additionally, an immigration and naturalization filing system will be set up through certified service providers. The Attorney General will establish an electronic filing system for visa, immigration, and naturalization functions, allowing only certified organizations to submit applications. Criteria for certification will focus on promoting competition and preventing monopolies. Regulations will outline the certification criteria for service providers. The certification of service providers will include submission security, quality control, user identification verification, and logistical capabilities to participate in the system. The Attorney General can provide grants to nonprofit service providers for technology enhancement related to immigration services. The National Records Center will establish an electronic database for closed INS files to expedite record requests. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of this Act."
