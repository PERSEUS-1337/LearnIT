    "content": "The Act titled \"Homesteading and Neighborhood Restoration Act of 1995\" provides assistance for Habitat for Humanity and other self-help housing providers. The Secretary is authorized to make grants to Habitat for Humanity International and other organizations for self-help housing opportunities. Goals include ensuring assistance is used for innovative homeownership opportunities. The provision of assistance under this section aims to create self-help housing opportunities where homeowners contribute sweat equity. The assistance results in the development of at least 5,000 new dwellings that comply with local building codes and are available at below-market prices, fostering a partnership between the Federal Government and Habitat for Humanity. The Federal Government partners with Habitat for Humanity International and other organizations to efficiently develop affordable housing with minimal government intervention. Community participation, similar to Habitat for Humanity's homeownership program, involves volunteers in constructing dwellings. Dwellings are developed in diverse geographic areas with high housing needs. The Federal Government partners with organizations like Habitat for Humanity International to develop affordable housing in diverse areas with high housing needs. If the Secretary determines that goals cannot be met, they must notify the committees and propose changes. Grants under this section are allocated with 50% going to a specified organization and 50% to other organizations. Grants under this section are used for developing new affordable housing in the United States for families in need. Eligible expenses include land acquisition and infrastructure improvement. The grant funds are used for installing, extending, constructing, rehabilitating, or improving utilities and infrastructure. Costs for dwellings are not included. Any grant amounts are deposited into a fund established by the grantee organization for use in accordance with the section. Interest and earnings from the fund are considered grant amounts. Habitat for Humanity International may use grant amounts from a fund established for the organization to assist local affiliates. The Secretary may make grants to organizations or consortia that express interest and demonstrate financial capability. The Secretary may make grants to organizations or consortia that demonstrate financial capability to develop at least 50 dwellings and comply with grant agreements. After 6 months, any unused funds will be assessed to determine if they exceed the amount needed for potential grant agreements. The Secretary may provide excess grant amounts to Habitat for Humanity International for national geographic diversity in housing development. Habitat for Humanity International must ensure geographic diversity in using grant amounts. The Secretary must also ensure geographic diversity in making grants under this section. A grant under this section requires a grant agreement between the Secretary and the organization or consortium. The agreement mandates the use of grant amounts as specified, development of a specific number of dwellings (minimum of 50), and leveraging other funding sources. The grant agreement for funds under this section requires compliance with specified provisions, development of a minimum number of dwellings, leveraging of other funding sources, potential recapture of unused amounts, and inclusion of additional terms as required by the Secretary. The Secretary disburses grant amounts in two equal payments for grants exceeding $8,000,000. The first payment is made upon entering the grant agreement, with the second payment following. The second payment for grants exceeding $8,000,000 is subject to requirements such as a 30-day notice after certification by the Secretary that the first payment was used appropriately. If an organization or consortium fails to fulfill grant obligations within 24 months, the Secretary will grant any remaining funds to Habitat for Humanity International. Notification to Congress is required for this action. During the grant period, the grantee must maintain records and comply with administrative practices as required by the Secretary. Failure to report to Congress may result in the Secretary being unable to make or disburse grants. The Secretary and the Comptroller General, or their representatives, have access to audit grantee organization's records. Grants exceeding fund assistance are closed out by the Secretary. After a grant close-out, the grantee organization is not required to comply with grant provisions or account for grant use. Grants under this section are considered special project funds. A report to Congress detailing grants, grantees, housing development, and grant purposes must be submitted within 90 days of grant close-out completion. Definitions for this section are provided. Definitions for this section include terms like \"applicable committees,\" \"Secretary,\" and the definition of \"United States.\" The Secretary will use $50,000,000 from contributions for assisted housing to carry out this section. Regulations must be issued within 30 days of enactment, not exceeding 5 pages in the Federal Register."
