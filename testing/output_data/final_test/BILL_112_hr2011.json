    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Strategic and Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2011\". Congress recognizes the importance of minerals for economic growth, national security, and technological innovation. The demand for minerals has increased due to industrialization in China and India, leading to resource nationalism. The United States has vast mineral resources but is becoming more reliant on foreign sources. The United States has seen a significant increase in import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials over the past 25 years, with the number of commodities doubling from 30 to 67. This lack of a coherent national policy poses a threat to manufacturing, economic well-being, security, agricultural production, and global competitiveness. The United States faces increasing import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials, posing a threat to manufacturing, economic well-being, security, agricultural production, and global competitiveness. Proper planning and preparation are needed today to meet tomorrow's mineral needs for the nation to compete and innovate effectively. Congress declares its policy regarding the increasing import dependence for nonfuel mineral materials, emphasizing the need for proper planning and preparation to meet the nation's mineral needs for competitiveness and innovation. The United States aims to ensure a stable supply of minerals for economic well-being and national capabilities. This policy requires coordination among federal agencies to develop domestic mineral resources, support safe mining practices, and promote recycling industries. The United States aims to ensure a stable supply of minerals for economic well-being and national capabilities by supporting safe mining practices, promoting recycling industries, and minimizing duplication in the administration of laws and regulations related to mineral exploration and production. The Secretary of the Interior will provide a report on access and authorizations for mineral development. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with various federal agencies, must prepare a report on nonfossil-fuel mineral potential on lands under the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service jurisdiction, including lands restricted from mineral exploration. The report must address the mineral requirements for national security, economic, and technological needs, the reliance on foreign sources, and the implications of supply shortages. It should also detail the processing time for mineral applications on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands, and suggest measures to streamline the process. The report must address mineral requirements for national security, economic, and technological needs, processing time for mineral applications on Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands, impact of litigation on permits, and assessment of the Federal workforce with educational qualifications. The report must include an assessment of the Federal workforce's expertise in various fields related to mining and an inventory of rare earth element potential on Federal lands. It should also examine differences in financial packages between Federal and private sectors for workers at different career stages. The Secretary of the Interior must provide progress reports to Congress and the public on efforts to increase access to domestic mineral supplies and implement recommendations for rare earth element exploration and development. The curr_chunk discusses the management of critical minerals for military purposes, workforce studies, and strategic plans related to critical rare earth elements in defense applications. The National Mineral Assessment conducted by the United States Geological Survey prioritizes mineral commodities important to energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and national defense based on supply impact and likelihood of restriction. The United States Geological Survey is expanding the Global Mineral Assessment to include rare earth elements and other critical minerals. The assessment will analyze the supply chain and processes from mining to manufacturing. Coordination with foreign geologic surveys is encouraged. The Act defines terms related to mineral inventory and assessment, including qualitative and quantitative assessments based on geotechnical data. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"assessment\" as a probabilistic estimate of quantity and quality of undiscovered mineral resources in permissive areas. The curr_chunk discusses the applicability of other statutory mining policies and proposes an amendment to assess the nation's capability to meet demands for critical minerals."
