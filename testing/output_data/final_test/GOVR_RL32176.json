    "content": "During hard markets, insurance supply decreases, prices rise, and underwriting standards tighten, making it difficult for consumers to find affordable insurance. In contrast, soft markets have stable prices and insurers are more willing to take on greater risks. Legislative attention on insurance matters peaks during hard markets due to consumer complaints, but regulation is primarily left to the states under the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 primarily leaves insurance regulation to state legislatures. States have created alternative market entities to increase insurance availability. Risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups were authorized by Congress in 1981 to simplify state insurance regulation. These groups are largely exempt from normal state insurance regulations under the Liability Risk Retention Act. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress by Representative John Campbell aims to expand the Liability Risk Retention Act to include commercial property insurance. H.R. 2126, introduced on June 3, 2011, has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. This bill would broaden federal preemption for risk retention and purchasing groups, addressing the challenge of affordable insurance access for businesses. H.R. 2126 aims to expand federal preemption of state insurance laws for risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups covering commercial property risks. It proposes changes to enforcement mechanisms, adds federal corporate governance requirements, and allows the Federal Insurance Office director to determine if state regulations are preempted by the act. The bill H.R. 4802, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, aims to enhance federal oversight of risk retention groups (RRGs) and risk purchasing groups (RPGs). It includes provisions for corporate governance standards, consumer disclosure requirements, and a fiduciary duty for RRG directors. The director of the Federal Insurance Office would issue reports to Congress on state regulation compliance. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services but did not progress further. H.R. 4802, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, aimed to enhance federal oversight of risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups. It included provisions for corporate governance standards, consumer disclosure requirements, and a fiduciary duty for RRG directors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services but did not progress further. H.R. 5792, a similar bill, called for a study by the Government Accountability Office. H.R. 5792, introduced by Representative Dennis Moore, aimed to expand LRRA exemptions for commercial property insurance and implement corporate governance standards for RRGs. It was marked up by the House Financial Services Subcommittee but did not progress further in the 110th Congress. The bill aimed to expand LRRA exemptions for commercial property insurance and implement corporate governance standards for Risk Retention Groups (RRGs). RRGs must be U.S.-licensed insurance companies and state-chartered, owned by group members, and issue policies with a federally mandated warning about regulation. Members include businesses, individual professionals, and government entities facing similar risks. Risk retention groups and risk purchasing groups are groups of entities in a similar business or facing similar risks. Risk retention groups can vary in corporate structure, with some licensed as \"captive\" insurers and others as \"regular\" mutual insurers. These groups operate outside of the state where they are chartered, providing advantages in regulatory treatment. Risk purchasing groups join together to purchase commercial insurance from established insurance companies instead of creating their own insurance company. The insurance industry faces challenges operating across multiple states due to varying regulations. Some argue for a federal charter to streamline the process. Risk retention groups are exempt from state licensing requirements and other insurance regulations. Risk retention groups are exempt from most state insurance laws but still need to comply with laws on fraudulent trade practices, nondiscrimination, and unfair claim settlement practices. They must also pay state premium taxes and can be monitored for financial solvency by non-domiciliary state regulators. However, this oversight is less stringent than that for regular insurance companies. In the case of risk retention group insolvency, policyholders have no recourse to a state guaranty fund as membership in these funds is prohibited by federal statute. Risk purchasing groups are exempt from state laws that prohibit or limit insurance purchases for group members, allowing them to bypass certain regulations for consumer protection and solvency. The \"Product Liability Risk Retention Act\" was introduced in 1979 to address difficulties in product liability insurance availability. The 1981 amended version limited risk retention groups to product liability and completed operations liability coverage for specific members in the industry. The \"Product Liability Risk Retention Act\" of 1981 exempted risk retention groups from most state regulations but did not cover laws unrelated to insurance. It also allowed risk purchasing groups to buy the same insurance as risk retention groups. However, by the time the act became law, the liability market issues had mostly resolved, leading to little interest in forming such groups. In 1983, a Clarification of the Risk Retention Act was passed to address discrepancies in defining \"product liability\" between state laws and the federal statute. This clarified that the federal definitions would control for the Risk Retention Act. In the mid-1980s, Congress responded to insurance market challenges by revisiting the 1981 Risk Retention Act. The act was renamed the \"Liability Risk Retention Act\" under P.L. 99-563, expanding the scope to include most commercial liability insurance and allowing various organizations to form groups for additional insurance supply. The Liability Risk Retention Act, under P.L. 99-563, allowed groups to form for additional insurance supply, with oversight changes for risk retention and purchasing groups. Foreign-based risk retention groups were not retroactively included in the expansion, limited to product liability insurance only. Congress aimed to regulate these groups primarily by a single state regulator. The Liability Risk Retention Act allowed groups to form for additional insurance supply, regulated by a single state regulator. Market reaction was swift, with 52 risk retention groups created by 1988. The number of groups plateaued at 79 in 1991, declining to 72 in 2001. Despite this, the number of insureds and total premiums continued to increase, reaching over 172,000 insureds and $944 million in premiums by 2001. From 1987 to 2001, 142 risk retention groups were formed, with 73 retiring for various reasons such as insolvency, status changes, or market affordability. The insurance market saw a shift in 2001 due to factors like interest rate downturns and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, leading to price increases. Interest in risk retention groups grew alongside rising insurance prices. Interest in risk retention groups increased as insurance prices rose. The number of RRGs and premiums grew steadily from 2001 to 2006. However, the number of insureds fluctuated, with a decline in 2002 before increasing in 2006. Growth in RRGs during the early 2000s was prominent in the health care sector, particularly in insuring health care liability. Nursing homes saw significant growth in RRGs from 2002 to 2005. The growth of risk retention groups in the health care sector, particularly in insuring nursing homes, increased from zero in 2002 to 20 by the end of 2005. A Pennsylvania grant provided initial capital for a Vermont-domiciled RRG to insure nursing homes in Pennsylvania due to favorable chartering laws. By 2010, RRG premiums were around $2.7 billion with 262 groups and over 272,000 insureds. Despite some challenges, the liability insurance market has softened since 2005. The number of insured declined from 2001 to 2004 due to the liquidation of Tennessee-domiciled groups insuring professionals. Insolvency of a Virginia-based insurer led to the liquidation. Policyholders of reinsured companies have lower priority in insolvency cases. Risk retention groups are prohibited from participating in state guaranty funds. The insolvency of National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group, headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska but incorporated in the Cayman Islands, attracted attention due to its failure. It acted as an insurer for marketing companies and auto dealerships selling vehicle service contracts before being declared insolvent in August 2003. The group, with approximately 580 members, was grandfathered out of state regulation as it was incorporated outside the US before 1985. The insolvency of National Warranty Insurance Risk Retention Group, with approximately 580 members, had a widespread impact as they sold contracts through 5,000 auto dealerships in 49 states. The group blurred the line between insureds and owners, acting as both an administrator and insurer. The liquidation process is ongoing, with efforts to expand the Risk Retention Act provisions. Expanding the Risk Retention Act to include commercial property and casualty insurance has received support from various groups and insurance regulators. However, doubts about this expansion have also been raised, with former Nebraska's insurance director, Tim Wagner, being a prominent doubter. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) was encouraged to consider this expansion at their September 2003 meeting. The NAIC was encouraged to adopt a resolution opposing the expansion of risk retention groups due to concerns about consumer protection and regulatory authority. A \"Risk Retention Working Group\" was created to examine these issues and propose corporate governance standards for RRGs. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also highlighted problems with risk retention groups in a 2005 report. The expansion of LRRA raises fundamental questions. The debate over LRRA expansion revolves around the balance between availability and reliability of insurance. Proponents argue for expansion to address market failures, while opponents raise concerns about regulatory standards for non-traditional insurance. The key question is the impact on communities when businesses, schools, or doctors struggle to find affordable insurance. Recent legislation in Congress has addressed concerns about the reliability of risk retention groups by focusing on corporate governance structures and disclosure. Arguments are made that as owners of a risk retention group, insured parties can ensure the reliability of the insurance provided. It is also noted that the failure rates of regular insurers and risk retention groups are similar, with the failure of National Warranty being seen as a unique situation. The failure of National Warranty, an offshore group unaccountable to state regulators, is seen as a unique situation. Doubters question the impact of risk retention groups, which occupy a small fraction of the insurance market. State-regulated insurers have the advantage of participating in state guaranty funds, unlike insurers under the Liability Risk Retention Act. Congress faces a challenge in balancing availability and reliability in insurance markets, a philosophical debate on the level of regulation needed. Insurance regulation varies depending on the type of insurance and the perceived sophistication of consumers. Commercial insurance markets are typically less regulated, assuming businesses have the knowledge to make informed decisions. In contrast, individual consumer markets like homeowners and auto insurance tend to be more regulated due to the assumption that consumers may struggle to make informed choices. The insurance market is regulated differently based on consumer sophistication. State guaranty funds protect policyholders from insolvent insurers, but with a low cap on payouts. This protects individuals with low claims but only partially protects larger businesses. This cap also impacts risk retention groups. The value of guaranty fund protection for risk retention groups is less significant for businesses facing large claims compared to individuals with lower claims. Despite risk retention and purchasing groups having a small market share, they can still impact prices and availability in the insurance market. Anecdotal cases, like the Pennsylvania nursing home risk retention group, suggest that the act is expanding insurance availability, especially in local areas with limited supply. The 1986 act successfully addressed supply problems, with the Department of Commerce and GAO confirming its effectiveness. There are debates on the federal role in insurance regulation, ranging from complete federalization to a lesser federal role to address specific issues. The Dodd-Frank Act includes some insurance regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act includes insurance provisions, but the debate over the federal role in insurance regulation continues. The Risk Retention Acts aimed to address supply problems in the insurance regulatory system by enforcing mutual state recognition without broad federal regulation. These acts offer insight into how Congress may address current issues in insurance regulation."
