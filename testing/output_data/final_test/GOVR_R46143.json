    "content": "The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) in the U.S. Department of Education oversees federal student aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. FSA provided $130.4 billion in aid to 11 million students in FY2019 and manages a student loan portfolio of $1.5 trillion. It operates like a large bank and is a performance-based organization. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) is a performance-based organization established under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. It aims to improve agency performance and transparency by setting clear objectives and measurable goals. FSA operates with greater discretion than other government agencies, resembling private-sector companies in budget, personnel decisions, and procurement. However, FSA has faced scrutiny for its oversight of institutions and student loan servicers, lack of transparency, and accountability issues. The report discusses the structure and challenges faced by FSA as a performance-based organization. It highlights the interest from Congress in addressing issues related to FSA's transparency and accountability. The report also delves into the legislative history and programmatic changes affecting FSA's operations under the Higher Education Act. The report outlines HEA Title IV programmatic changes impacting FSA operations, describes FSA's current structure, and discusses issues affecting its operations as a PBO. Recent congressional and stakeholder attention has focused on these issues, with various reports examining FSA's operations. Appendices provide a bibliography of relevant reports and a list of acronyms used in the report. Federal programs are typically carried out by agencies established in statute, with structural refinements made through agency directives. Federal agencies in the executive branch are accountable to the President and must comply with general management laws. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) operates as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO), focusing on outcomes rather than outputs. PBO leaders are held accountable for meeting measurable goals within the organization. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) operates as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO), focusing on outcomes rather than outputs. FSA leaders are granted greater discretion to deviate from government-wide management processes and operate more like private-sector companies. Key features include appointment and compensation arrangements for senior managers, exemptions from certain government-wide requirements, and independence from political pressure. Political appointees lead high-level subunits within departments, appointed by the President or Secretary for an indefinite term. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) operates as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO), focusing on outcomes rather than outputs. FSA leaders are appointed based on demonstrated ability and expertise, with compensation determined by specific pay systems. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) is appointed by the Secretary of Education for a term of three to five years, based on management and IT expertise, with performance goals outlined in a performance agreement. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) may be reappointed for additional terms of three to five years based on performance. The COO can be removed by the President or Secretary for misconduct or failure to meet performance goals. Reasons for removal must be communicated to congressional committees. Compensation includes basic pay tied to SES pay levels. The COO and senior managers of FSA have compensation tied to SES pay levels, with an annual bonus not exceeding 50% of basic pay. Senior managers are appointed by the COO without competitive service provisions. Their performance is governed by annual agreements with measurable goals. Managers' total compensation cannot exceed 125% of SES pay. Executive branch employment follows civil service laws of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. The HEA provisions give FSA flexibility in staffing, classification, and pay of employees, not subject to caps on number or grade. FSA and OPM develop personnel flexibilities consistent with Title 5. COO can establish technical positions exempt from competitive service rules. Covered positions are in the excepted service, allowing alternative hiring procedures. The PBO procurement provisions of HEA require compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation and procurement statutes. Flexibilities include using experts and consultants, while abiding by applicable laws and regulations. The PBO has procurement flexibility under HEA, allowing for a two-phase process in selecting vendors. This differs from the FAR's limited circumstances. Additionally, the PBO can pursue sole-source procurement under different criteria than most agencies. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) can use \"single source\" procurement for certain systems where one vendor is deemed the most advantageous source, unlike the FAR's \"sole-source\" procurement criteria. High-level subunits within departments are typically led by political appointees, but some have independence from political leadership through various structural mechanisms. Agencies vary in their level of independence from political leadership. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) operates with a level of independence from political leadership due to specific provisions in the Higher Education Act (HEA). The appointment and removal of the FSA COO are based on abilities and expertise, without consideration of political affiliation. This allows FSA to carry out certain functions independently, with atypical specifications for the COO's removal from office. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) operates independently with control over budget, personnel, and administrative functions. Established in 1998 as the first federal PBO, FSA's structure deviates from traditional government arrangements, drawing inspiration from British government innovations in the 1980s and 1990s. The Administration's rollout of the PBO aimed to streamline the federal government and improve performance by reorganizing agencies and processes. Led by Vice President Al Gore, the NPR initiative put forth recommendations for better government service delivery and efficiency. Legislation related to the PBO was introduced in late 1995, with a focus on personnel practices, procurement, and management tools. The Vice President introduced the PBO concept in early 1996 as part of the NPR initiative to improve government service delivery through business-like practices and incentives. PBOs would be reorganized agencies with performance incentives and accountability for results, shifting focus from processes to customers and achieving outcomes. Performance-based organizations (PBOs) set clear performance measures, hold leaders accountable for results, and allow flexibility to achieve goals. The Patent and Trademark Office has PBO-like characteristics, while the Federal Student Aid (FSA) organization aligns with the PBO framework. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) organization, along with the Air Traffic Organization of the Federal Aviation Administration, has been established as a Performance-based Organization (PBO) in statute. Prior to FSA, federal student loan programs were managed by the Office of Student Financial Assistance Programs (SFAP) within the Department of Education. Interest in converting SFAP into a PBO arose in the mid-1990s due to concerns about mismanagement of student financial aid programs. The model of converting SFAP into a PBO was attractive to some congressional advocates of SFAP reform, as it addressed perceived problems while maintaining financial assistance within ED. The possibility of establishing a PBO within ED was considered before Vice President Gore's introduction of the new organizational model in 1996. Congressional committees expressed concern about difficulties in managing student financial aid programs at ED, including poor coordination and communication. Poor coordination and communication between OPE and the Senior Advisor to the Secretary for Direct Lending, low OPE staff morale, shortage of qualified IT and financial analysis employees. Issues with improving the Federal Family Education Loan program, backlog of cohort default rate appeals, confusion in the student loan community, concerns about financial statement monitoring and IT procurement, and difficulties with FAFSA processing. Secretary expressed interest in establishing SFAP as a PBO, but transition appeared premature according to ED's IG testimony in July 1996. In May 1997, the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) recommended restructuring federal student aid delivery under a PBO due to staff inexperience, outdated systems, and uncompetitive contracts. The Assistant Secretary testified in July 1997 about considering the PBO model for improving federal student aid management. The Secretary supported the PBO approach to improve management of federal student assistance programs, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, accountability, and policy control. A bill was introduced in September 1997 to establish a PBO within ED for managing information systems related to Title IV programs. The chair highlighted problems with federal student aid information systems and financial statements, advocating for a customer-focused, performance-based organization within the Department. The bill introduced in 1997 aimed to establish a customer-focused, performance-based organization within the Department to reengineer current systems and contracts. Provisions from this bill were included in the HEA reauthorization bill reported by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources in May 1998. The PBO established by the Senate bill had a broader role compared to the House committee-reported measure. The Senate bill aimed to empower the PBO to oversee student financial assistance programs under Title IV. Committee reports highlighted concerns about management problems at the Department of Education, including IT issues affecting the delivery of student aid. The House and Senate committees intended to address these issues through a change in organizational structure and management paradigm. The Senate and House committees identified management problems at the Department of Education, including IT issues affecting student aid delivery. They proposed establishing a PBO organizational structure to address these issues, such as integrating data systems, improving Title IV aid administration, and becoming Year 2000 compliant. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce aimed to increase effectiveness through these changes. The proposed change aims to increase effectiveness, economy, and efficiency by giving administrators greater management flexibility while requiring greater accountability for results. The committee expects a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) structure to improve service, reduce costs, increase accountability, provide flexibility, and integrate information systems for federal student aid programs. The committee believes a customer-based PBO operated by an experienced Chief Operating Officer can reengineer current systems and contracts effectively. The Committee believes creating a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) will lead to a more efficient and cost-effective financial aid delivery system, making it easier for students and parents to access information and select the best education option. The goal is to improve the delivery of student financial aid by dividing policy and operational functions between the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) and the new PBO. The committee aims to improve student financial aid delivery by creating a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) responsible for administrative functions. Differences between Senate and House bills regarding the PBO's authority and relationship with the Department of Education were resolved through a conference process. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 were signed into law on October 7, 1998, after a consensus measure was reached through a conference process. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 amended the PBO provisions, with the Senate Committee noting its approval of the PBO's implementation for improving efficiency in financial aid processing. The 2008 amendments expanded FSA's role in administering Title IV programs, broadening its mandate from \"operational\" to \"administrative and oversight.\" The amendments also increased FSA's responsibilities to include administration of Federal student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV. Additionally, the HEOA amended FSA's personnel and procurement flexibility provisions. Since its inception, FSA has undergone statutory and regulatory changes affecting Title IV student aid programs. In 1998, HEA Title IV authorized two federal student loan programs: FFEL and Direct Loan, each with different administrative structures. Private lenders originated FFEL loans, while secondary market purchasers handled loan servicing tasks. Under the FFEL program, state and nonprofit guaranty agencies administered various aspects such as providing technical assistance, credit counseling, and collections work. In contrast, the Direct Loan program has the federal government acting as the lender, providing loans to students and families. The Department of Education (ED) plays a central role in administering the Direct Loan program, including providing assistance to institutions, contracting with loan servicers, offering counseling to borrowers, and managing collections. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 granted the Department of Education temporary authority to purchase student loans under the FFEL program due to concerns about loan availability. The SAFRA Act terminated new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010, making the Direct Loan program the primary federal student loan program. FSA now has a larger scope of responsibility following these changes. The switch to almost 100% direct lending in 2010 fundamentally altered the federal student loan marketplace, giving FSA a larger responsibility in administering federal student loan programs. Schools had the choice to participate in the FFEL program or Direct Loan program, with the quality of administrative work potentially influencing their decisions. The transition to a single federal student lending model in 2010 shifted the responsibility to FSA, impacting schools' decisions on participating in the FFEL or Direct Loan program based on administrative quality. Schools compiled preferred lender lists, with competition driving lenders to enhance customer service. Borrowers had options to choose lenders beyond the lists. The federal student loan marketplace transitioned to a single entity model in 2010, impacting customer service incentives. Changes in Title IV aid programs increased FSA's administrative functions, including new aid benefits and income-driven repayment plans. The federal student loan marketplace transitioned to a single entity model in 2010, impacting customer service incentives. Changes in Title IV aid programs increased FSA's administrative functions, including new aid benefits and income-driven repayment plans such as the 6% interest rate cap on federal student loans during military service, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, cumulative lifetime maximums on Pell Grants eligibility, and limitations on borrower's eligibility for Direct Subsidized Loans. The FSA manages federal student aid programs, including overseeing loan servicing, disbursing aid funds, and providing information to stakeholders. The HEA mandates FSA to administer Title IV programs and implement regulations related to borrower defense to repayment discharge procedures. The FSA oversees Title IV program participants, including IHEs and third-party loan servicers. It maintains relationships with stakeholders, executive branch entities, and Congress. FSA is responsible for administrative, accounting, and financial management functions for Title IV aid programs.

FSA works with the Secretary to fulfill its responsibilities, such as processing FAFSA applications for student aid eligibility. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) manages funds from the Treasury to distribute to institutions for student aid. After disbursement, FSA may oversee administrative functions, such as reclaiming excess Pell Grant funds or assigning loans to servicers for payment collection. In cases of default, FSA may involve private collection agencies to recover payments from borrowers. In FY2018, FSA maintained contracts with vendors totaling $1.1 billion, constituting 63% of student aid administration appropriations. These contracts include servicing Direct Loans, collection of defaulted loans, and IT infrastructure support. FSA also has a contract for the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to track Title IV grants and loans. FSA plays a crucial role in managing Title IV federal student aid programs, providing information and assistance to students, families, borrowers, IHEs, third-party contractors, members of Congress, and the general public. Stakeholders rely on FSA for accurate and timely information through various websites, including www.studentaid.gov and 'Information for Financial Aid Professionals'. FSA operates online portals for customers and the 'Information for Financial Aid Professionals' website, consolidating guidance and resources for Title IV administration. It maintains repositories of program data, including the NSLDS, Data Center, and Enterprise Data Warehouse Analytics, providing access to information and analytic tools for stakeholders. FSA provides analytic tools for internal and external data requests, including Title IV program data and analysis. The Ombudsman Group within FSA offers a single point of entry for feedback and complaints about Title IV programs. FSA ensures compliance with program requirements for various participants. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees Title IV programs, ensuring that institutions of higher education (IHEs) meet eligibility requirements and properly administer the programs. IHEs and third-party contractors have key roles in program administration, with some programs delegating more administrative functions to IHEs and others to outside entities like guaranty agencies. FSA certifies IHEs' eligibility and verifies accreditation status and legal authorization to operate. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees Title IV programs, ensuring that institutions of higher education (IHEs) meet eligibility requirements and properly administer the programs. FSA evaluates IHE's accreditation status, financial responsibility, and administrative capability. It also conducts program reviews and reviews compliance audits to ensure Title IV requirements are met. FSA has the authority to impose sanctions and corrective actions on IHEs and their third-party servicers. FSA oversees Title IV programs at IHEs and their third-party servicers by imposing sanctions like fines and restrictions. They ensure contractors fulfill their terms, using tools like corrective action and contract termination. FSA contracts with various third-parties for services related to Title IV programs, using performance-based incentives to encourage desired outcomes. The FSA program uses performance-based incentives to encourage loan servicers to meet specific goals, such as ensuring borrowers are in good repayment status and providing satisfactory customer service. FSA also provides guidance to loan servicers, conducts monitoring activities, and contracts with PCAs to collect defaulted loans. PCA compensation is based on overall performance, and contracts are not easily accessible. The FSA oversees various entities involved in the administration of loan programs, including PCAs, guaranty agencies, and IHEs. PCAs are contracted to collect defaulted loans based on performance incentives. Guaranty agencies provide assistance to lenders, while IHEs handle administrative functions and award aid funds to students. FSA provides guidance, conducts monitoring activities, and ensures entities fulfill their functions effectively. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) oversees various entities involved in loan program administration, including PCAs, guaranty agencies, and IHEs. FSA's operations cover a wide range of activities and responsibilities, with statistics showing its significant scale within the Department of Education (ED). FSA accounts for a majority of ED spending and has seen an increase in full-time equivalent (FTE) staff over time, with about one-third of ED's FTEs in FY2016. In FY2016, Federal Student Aid (FSA) accounted for one-third of ED's FTEs, with the largest share of staff supported through loan servicing contracts. Funding obligations for federal student aid administration include salaries, expenses, and student loan servicing. From FY2009 to FY2019, obligations for federal student aid administration increased from $754 million to $1.7 billion, with a 47% increase since FY2011. Loan servicing costs have been the majority of student aid administration costs since FY2016. The number of FTE employees working on federal student aid administration has increased from 1,058 in FY2009 to 1,480 in FY2019, a 40% increase. Besides FSA, other offices within ED also handle student-aid related administrative activities. Contractor staff, such as loan servicing staff, support student aid administration. FSA's workload has significantly increased over the years, with approximately 12,000 contracted staff augmenting its FTE employees in FY2016. The number of federal student loan recipients with outstanding balances and the total dollar amount of principal and interest outstanding have increased over the years. FSA operates under the coordination of the Office of the Under Secretary within ED. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) program, under the coordination of the Office of the Under Secretary within the Department of Education (ED), is responsible for administering various programs related to postsecondary, vocational, and adult education. FSA's organizational structure and leadership arrangements are primarily established through administrative actions by the Chief Operating Officer (COO), with additional responsibilities delegated by the Secretary. FSA interacts with different ED offices to implement policies in aid administration, with specific roles mandated by the Higher Education Act (HEA) including the COO and the student loan ombudsman. The COO of FSA has been delegated additional responsibilities and is mandated to manage FSA's activities. Annually, the COO and the Secretary must publicly release a five-year performance plan for FSA in consultation with stakeholders. The COO is required to submit a report to Congress annually, including an independent financial audit and evaluation of performance goals. The COO of FSA is responsible for managing FSA's activities and must annually release a five-year performance plan in consultation with stakeholders. The COO also submits a report to Congress annually, including an independent financial audit and evaluation of performance goals. The COO is authorized to procure property and services, with significant autonomy in contracting functions, while the Secretary maintains responsibility for policy and regulations related to Title IV aid. The FSA's Policy Liaison and Implementation Staff (PLIS) consults with the Secretary on Title IV student aid policies and regulations, implements policy developed by ED, formulates policy recommendations, provides advice on regulations and policies, prepares drafts of subregulatory guidance, and manages the Experimental Sites Initiative. The COO disseminates information and manages FSA's activities, while the Secretary maintains responsibility for policy and regulations related to Title IV aid. The COO disseminates information to stakeholders on the student loan ombudsman and may be delegated additional functions by the Secretary to achieve FSA's purposes, including personnel actions, programmatic authorities related to Title IV programs, and the authority to compromise, waive, and write-off certain claims against individuals under Title IV programs. The COO has the authority to appoint an ombudsman to assist borrowers with student loans under Title IV. The ombudsman resolves disputes and compiles data on borrower complaints. The FSA's Ombudsman Group fulfills these requirements. The Ombudsman Group fulfills the requirements for a student loan ombudsman under Title IV, addressing customer cases related to student loans and administering informal complaint resolution processes. Other ED offices and executive branch entities may have jurisdiction over non-loan Title IV student aid programs. The Secretary of Education oversees various entities that interact with Federal Student Aid (FSA), including the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of General Counsel, which conduct audits and provide legal assistance. The Office of General Counsel (OGC) provides legal assistance to the Secretary and other ED offices, including FSA. They offer legal advice, litigation services, legislative services, and help with drafting guidance. The Office of Budget Service is responsible for ED's budget, legislative policies, and analyzing program operations. They estimate costs for student aid programs and work with FSA and other offices to analyze data for cost estimation models. The Office of the Under Secretary oversees these functions. The Office of the Under Secretary oversees policies, programs, and activities related to postsecondary education, federal student aid, and vocational education. They coordinate with FSA and OPE to develop and implement policies for Title IV aid. The Under Secretary serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary on postsecondary education matters. OPE, under the oversight of the Under Secretary, develops regulations and guidance for Title IV student aid programs in collaboration with FSA. They maintain relationships with other executive branch entities, such as the Department of the Treasury, to ensure proper functioning of the aid programs. The Department of the Treasury works with FSA to provide federal student aid, including offsetting defaulted loans with benefits like tax refunds and Social Security. FSA is exempt from transferring delinquent debts to Treasury for centralized collection, and is responsible for collecting delinquent student loan debt. The Secretary of the Treasury can exempt certain debts from centralized collection. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) plays a role in ensuring compliance with consumer protection laws for federal student loans. They have taken legal action against some federal student loan servicers for violations. The CFPB also assists student loan borrowers and collaborates with the Department of Education on oversight of proprietary institutions. However, there may be a decrease in collaboration between the CFPB and ED. In 2017, ED terminated agreements with CFPB to share data on student loan servicing market. DOJ enforces federal student loan laws, prosecuting violations and filing lawsuits. Other entities ED interacts with include FTC and IRS. The Federal Trade Commission, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Social Security Administration are federal entities that interact with the Department of Education (ED) and Federal Student Aid (FSA). FSA's Central Processing System matches student information with databases from various federal agencies to confirm aid eligibility. Additionally, FSA interfaces with the IRS Data Retrieval Tool to link tax information for income verification in repayment plans. Congress plays a significant role in guiding and affecting the operations of Federal Student Aid (FSA) programs. They can enact laws that impact FSA, amend relevant sections of the Higher Education Act, and determine funding levels during the appropriations process. Congress also exercises oversight over FSA, which may include requiring testimonies and directives regarding fund usage. Congress exercises oversight over Federal Student Aid (FSA) by requiring testimonies, reports, and investigations. They annually review FSA's progress in achieving goals outlined in its five-year performance plan. The plan focuses on improving service, reducing costs, and enhancing systems supporting student aid programs. The Secretary and FSA develop strategic objectives in consultation with stakeholders. FSA develops metrics to measure performance under strategic objectives in its five-year plan. Annual goals are set based on prior year's performance. Table 4 shows FSA's performance for each metric from FY2016-FY2019. Most goals were met, especially in usership of online resources. FSA consistently met most of its goals, including usership of online resources, aid delivery cost per application, and percentage of outstanding Direct Loans in current repayment status. Adjustments were made to goals based on performance, and progress was made in addressing congressionally identified issues. The ACSFA criticized the priorities and organizational structure of the new PBO established in 1998, noting that it failed to separate policy making and regulatory responsibilities effectively. The ACSFA criticized the PBO for not adequately separating policy making and regulatory responsibilities as intended by Congress. The PBO focused on improving customer service and providing web access to student data instead of addressing basic systems and contract problems. ACSFA recommended transferring certain functions to OPE and strengthening collaboration with FSA to ensure alignment with federal aid policies. The ACSFA criticized FSA for minimal progress on systems integration and recommended specific integration goals and schedules to reduce costs and increase efficiency. FSA developed a performance plan with strategic goals but did not clearly address all statutory purposes identified during the HEA reauthorization process. The ACSFA criticized FSA for minimal progress on systems integration and recommended specific integration goals and schedules to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Both ED's IG and GAO recommended that FSA establish clear goals, strategies, and performance measures related to systems integration. FSA disagreed with the IG's recommendation but later agreed with the GAO recommendation to revise its performance plan for measurable goals and milestones in systems integration efforts. The GAO report assessed FSA's progress in achieving its strategic goals. The GAO found that FSA had made progress in improving customer and employee satisfaction but had deficiencies in measuring unit costs. The relationship between FSA and ED was evolving, with Education providing more direction and oversight. Education was reviewing FSA's role and responsibilities as part of department-wide management. The GAO found that FSA had improved management of Title IV federal student aid programs, leading to their removal from the High Risk List in 2005. Factors cited included sustained improvements in financial management and receipt of clean financial statements for FY2002-FY2004. FSA has received praise for its financial management improvements and clean financial statements for FY2002-FY2004. Recent accomplishments include the transition to 100% direct lending and implementation of the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. However, some issues have been identified in GAO and IG reports regarding oversight of contracted loan servicers. The oversight of contracted loan servicers by FSA has faced scrutiny from various entities including Congress, ED's IG, GAO, and the CFPB. GAO has identified deficiencies in ED's implementation and communication about the PSLF program, leading to congressional interest. Concerns have also been raised about FSA's ability to address poorly performing IHEs or those at risk of closure. ED's federal student aid operations were reorganized into a PBO to address management problems, with the hope of improving performance and management flexibility. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) organization was established as a Performance-Based Organization (PBO) to improve efficiency and effectiveness in providing student aid. It aimed to operate independently from political influence, with accountability for results through performance agreements. Concerns about independent policymaking were addressed by separating policymaking functions from operational functions. While the establishment of FSA as a PBO initially addressed congressional concerns, new issues have emerged in recent years. Issues have arisen in recent years regarding oversight, transparency, and accountability of Federal Student Aid (FSA). These issues have garnered attention as Congress considers reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). Reports from oversight entities and outside organizations have highlighted options to address these concerns. While some documents refer to the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education, FSA's operations are likely relevant to addressing these issues. FSA is responsible for overseeing entities involved in federal student aid programs, including IHEs and loan servicers. Criticisms have been raised about FSA's assessment of IHEs, risk mitigation, and issue resolution. Monitoring of loan servicers has also been problematic. The FSA has faced challenges in monitoring loan servicers due to incomplete guidance, hindering compliance with loan servicing requirements and borrower assistance programs. Congressional action may be needed to address oversight issues and clarify desired outcomes for the FSA. Consideration should be given to separating operational functions from policymaking within the FSA. The FSA oversees IHE compliance with Title IV aid programs to ensure educational quality, consumer protection, and fiscal integrity. Interest in FSA's oversight has increased due to closures of large IHEs, prompting investigations by GAO and ED's IG. Investigations by GAO and ED's IG revealed that FSA staff did not always follow internal procedures for institutional review, leading to potential risks of noncompliance with Title IV requirements and abrupt closures of IHEs. Weaknesses in controls could result in failure to identify noncompliant IHEs. For instance, FSA did not conduct program reviews as per procedures, raising concerns about the adequacy of identifying noncompliance instances. Staff also failed to maintain required documentation for fiscal testing and distance education reviews at IHEs. Some FSA staff felt overwhelmed with their workload, leading to inconsistent program reviews. The IG found that FSA needed to improve processes to identify at-risk IHEs, citing delays in addressing Corinthian College's failing score appeal. The IG identified weaknesses in FSA's monitoring of at-risk IHEs, potentially allowing some to avoid sanctions. FSA implemented new tools but disbanded an enforcement office. Steps may have been taken to enhance monitoring and response practices. Compliance with Title IV requirements is crucial. Ensuring compliance with Title IV requirements is crucial for FSA's role in managing student aid programs and mitigating risks. FSA oversees loan servicers to ensure they meet federal requirements for student loans. Oversight of loan servicers is essential for FSA to ensure compliance with federal requirements for student loans and provide effective customer service. Issues with loan servicing, such as steering borrowers away from beneficial options or providing inaccurate information, have been a concern in recent years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified problems with loan payment processing, loan terms implementation, and loan servicers' accountability. GAO raised concerns about the Federal Student Aid's (FSA) monitoring of loan servicers' interactions with borrowers, highlighting potential issues with accuracy and customer service. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found issues with FSA's call monitoring and tracking of borrower complaints. FSA lacks a systematic approach to reviewing loan servicer interactions, hindering oversight and service improvement. The Education Department's Inspector General (IG) discovered that FSA did not track or analyze instances of servicer noncompliance effectively, nor did it hold servicers accountable or use available tools for oversight. The Education Department's Inspector General found that FSA did not hold loan servicers accountable for poor servicing and lacked a systematic approach to evaluating interactions between servicers and borrowers. FSA also provided insufficient guidance to servicers on loan administration, leading to potential issues in servicing federally held student loans. The Education Department's Inspector General found that FSA lacked systematic evaluation of interactions between loan servicers and borrowers, leading to potential issues in servicing federally held student loans. Additionally, gaps in guidance to loan servicers may result in inconsistent interpretations of law and procedures, impacting federal student loan administration and borrowers' ability to utilize loan features. Treasury and Congress have recommended FSA to publish a common loan servicing manual, but it has not been done. Loan servicers also face challenges due to the increasing complexity of federal student loan terms and conditions. The Education Department's Inspector General found that FSA lacked systematic evaluation of interactions between loan servicers and borrowers, leading to potential issues in servicing federally held student loans. FSA and loan servicers are working to enhance communications with borrowers regarding the PSLF program's requirements, but the program's complexity and congressionally mandated eligibility requirements pose challenges. Strengthening oversight of loan servicers may ensure borrowers receive entitled benefits, but inherent difficulties in administering loan programs may require policy changes. Loan servicer compliance with Title IV and contract requirements is crucial for FSA to ensure integrity of aid programs. FSA's strategic goal is to proactively manage student aid portfolio and mitigate risk. Performance metrics show mixed results, with unclear effectiveness in addressing loan servicing practices. Congress may need to specify desired outcomes and actions for FSA to improve oversight of IHEs and loan servicers. Congress can guide and affect FSA's efforts by amending HEA, providing stipulations on appropriations, exercising oversight through hearings, emphasizing stakeholder input, and specifying goals for FSA. These changes may involve tradeoffs between oversight and operational flexibility. The PBO model emphasizes results over processes, potentially limiting the agency's ability to make nonpolitical operational decisions. ED and FSA have made organizational adjustments to involve FSA in policymaking processes, but addressing policymaking as a byproduct of implementation remains a challenge in public administration. Issues around loan servicing illustrate the challenge of separating policymaking from operational functions in public administration. FSA designs contracts for loan servicers based on Congress and ED's policies, but the administration of these programs can impact how policies are implemented. Payment structures in loan servicing contracts may incentivize certain borrower behaviors that contradict ED's preferences, highlighting the need for increased oversight in delegated authority. By limiting discretion in delegated authority or increasing oversight, agency efficiency may be reduced, hindering the PBO model. FSA's lack of transparency in Title IV program operations has raised criticisms. Incomplete information on program performance makes it challenging for Congress and other oversight entities to make well-informed decisions. Consumers also lack complete information on Title IV programs, affecting their college and financial decisions. Calls have been made for FSA to enhance transparency by publicly releasing information. FSA's lack of transparency in Title IV program operations has raised criticisms and calls for enhanced communication. There may be tradeoffs between increasing transparency and maintaining the effectiveness of the PBO model. Privacy requirements also need to be considered when releasing data. Congress and policymakers are interested in understanding the operation and outcomes of federal student aid programs. In FY2019, FSA provided $130.4 billion in Title IV aid to 11.0 million students, managing a student loan portfolio of $1.5 trillion for 45 million borrowers. Concerns have been raised about FSA's lack of transparency in providing access to information for informed policy decisions and recommendations. The Education Department's Inspector General found that while FSA has improved access to loan portfolio information, it lacks transparency in providing details on costs related to income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs. This lack of transparency has hindered the ability of federal entities like the CFPB to fulfill their duties effectively. The CFPB's ability to conduct supervisory examinations of loan servicers may be hindered by restrictions on releasing student loan records. Loan servicers are prohibited from directly responding to information requests from third parties, including regulators like the CFPB. This guidance aligns with FSA's goal of fostering trust and collaboration among stakeholders, but there are concerns about the provision of timely and useful information to stakeholders. The provision of timely and useful information to stakeholders, particularly regarding the metric \"Ease of doing business with FSA,\" is crucial. However, it is unclear if this metric effectively captures the success of meeting the information needs of high-priority stakeholders. The general public, especially those interested in student aid, may require access to information for informed decision-making. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) may not be releasing all information on institutions' financial stability, which is crucial for consumers making college enrollment decisions. While FSA discloses some financial composite scores, not all scores are made public. This lack of transparency hinders informed decision-making for students. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) may not consistently provide all necessary information on federal student aid terms and conditions, leading to concerns about informed decision-making for students. FSA relies on loan servicers to communicate loan terms, but inconsistencies and imperfect communication may result in borrowers being unaware or confused about program requirements. The Federal Student Aid (FSA) may not consistently provide all necessary information on federal student aid terms and conditions, leading to concerns about informed decision-making for students. FSA has taken steps to increase borrower awareness of loan terms, but communication issues may still exist. Congress has directed FSA to perform customer outreach to address these concerns and improve service for students and participants in student financial assistance programs. Providing complete and accurate information aligns with FSA's goals of improving service quality for customers. FSA has succeeded in improving service quality for customers, but concerns remain about communication with customers. Some believe FSA's independence makes it unresponsive to requests for information. Access to information is seen as crucial for researchers and policymakers to evaluate policies and federal investments. Increasing access to Title IV program performance and operations information may impact the effectiveness of the PBO's business-like design. Sharing this information requires developing policies and procedures, which could lead to increased scrutiny of operational processes. Staff hours needed for dissemination may reduce efficiency in addressing the PBO's statutory purposes. The PBO's performance is measured through five-year performance plans and annual reports as mandated by the HEA. Stakeholders can assess results using different measures, promoting accountability beyond specific targets. Engagement with stakeholders allows for new insights, efficiency improvements, and accountability in operations through performance agreements and bonuses tied to goals. The provisions aim to hold stakeholders, including students, borrowers, and institutions, accountable in federal student aid. Concerns revolve around FSA's consultation with stakeholders, leveraging feedback for improvements, and responsiveness to customer needs. Improving performance agreements and stakeholder feedback utilization could enhance FSA operations and customer service, aligning with its statutory purposes as a PBO. Criticism of FSA as a PBO includes questions about its performance planning and measurement mechanisms, stakeholder engagement, and the effectiveness of performance metrics. Concerns have been raised about FSA's communication with aid recipients and its utilization of feedback for program improvements. The effectiveness and accountability of FSA in administering student aid programs, including engagement with stakeholders and assessment of performance, are questioned. This may impact students' ability to access postsecondary financial assistance, especially in terms of loan options. Private lenders are hesitant to provide loans to individuals with limited creditworthiness, unlike Title IV student loans which are more accessible regardless of credit history. Private education loans often lack favorable terms compared to Title IV loans. Criticisms of the Federal Student Aid (FSA) program highlight potential flaws in the Public Benefit Organization (PBO) model under the Higher Education Act (HEA). The Education Secretary and FSA Chief Operating Officer share responsibility for setting and measuring organizational performance, with a mutual incentive to demonstrate continuous improvement in FSA services. Potential changes in the FSA program under the PBO model could involve modifying statutory provisions related to accountability and stakeholder input. This could include more specific identification of domains and metrics in annual performance plans and evaluations, similar to provisions in other accountability systems like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The accountability system under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act could be improved by incorporating stakeholder feedback into the performance plan and evaluation process. This could involve specifying a formal input process in statute, similar to how state agencies are directed to solicit and respond to public comments when establishing performance standards for career and technical education.
