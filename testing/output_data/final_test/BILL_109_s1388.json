    "content": "The Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act of 2005, also known as the \"Regulatory Flexibility Reform Act,\" includes provisions for more detailed analyses, periodic review of rules, and clerical amendments. The Act aims to clarify and expand the rules covered by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Congress acknowledges the importance of a thriving small business sector for job creation in the economy. Regulations meant for larger entities have unfairly burdened small businesses with unnecessary costs since 1980, despite federal agencies failing to consider the differences in scale and resources. Federal agencies have failed to analyze and uncover less-costly alternative regulatory approaches, despite the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. They continue to interpret the law in a way that allows them to avoid their responsibilities. Congress intends to amend title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts of proposed and final rules, including indirect effects, are considered by agencies during the rulemaking process. Significant changes are needed in how Federal agencies develop regulations to lessen the burden on small businesses and other entities. Federal agencies should assess a full range of alternatives to limit adverse economic consequences or enhance benefits without delaying the regulatory process. SEC. 3 amends Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, to clarify the term 'economic impact' in relation to proposed or final rules. SEC. 4 introduces requirements for more detailed analyses by federal agencies to limit adverse economic consequences or enhance benefits without delaying the regulatory process. The amendment to Section 603 of title 5, United States Code requires each initial regulatory flexibility analysis to include reasons for agency action, objectives of the proposed rule, estimated impact on small entities, and compliance requirements. The amendment to Section 603 of title 5, United States Code requires the inclusion of skills necessary for report preparation, describing relevant Federal rules, estimating additional economic impact on small entities, and notifying the Small Business Administration of draft rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The amendment to Section 603 of title 5, United States Code requires including skills for report preparation, describing relevant Federal rules, estimating economic impact on small entities, and notifying the Small Business Administration of draft rules with significant economic impact. Section 604(a) of title 5, United States Code is amended to provide a detailed explanation and description in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The amendment to Section 603 of title 5, United States Code requires including skills for report preparation, describing relevant Federal rules, estimating economic impact on small entities, and notifying the Small Business Administration of draft rules with significant economic impact. Section 604(a) of title 5, United States Code is amended to provide a detailed explanation and description in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, including responses to comments on certification of proposed rules and comments filed by the chief counsel for advocacy. The agency must publish the final regulatory flexibility analysis on its website and in the Federal Register, including any changes made to the proposed rule in response to comments. Additionally, cross-references to other analyses must be included. Section 605(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to allow Federal agencies to cross-reference other analyses to satisfy agenda and regulatory flexibility analysis requirements. Section 605(b) is also amended to require a detailed factual and legal statement, and section 607 is amended to specify quantification requirements for agencies complying with sections 603 and 604. In compliance with sections 603 and 604, agencies must provide a quantifiable description of the effects of proposed rules or a general statement with an explanation if quantification is not feasible. SEC. 5. PERIODIC REVIEW OF RULES. Section 610 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require agencies to publish a plan for the periodic review of rules with significant economic impact on small entities. The purpose is to determine if rules should be continued, amended, or rescinded to minimize adverse economic impacts on small entities. The agency must publish a plan for the periodic review of rules affecting small entities, with reviews every 10 years. If the review of existing rules is not feasible by the set date, the agency head can extend it for up to 2 years. Each agency must annually report the results of its review of rules affecting small entities to Congress and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The agency must consider the continued need for each rule during the review process. During the annual review of rules affecting small entities, agencies must consider the need for the rule, complaints received, comments from relevant officials, rule complexity, overlap with other rules, economic impact, and time since evaluation. During the annual review of rules affecting small entities, agencies must consider the length of time since evaluation, changes in technology or economic conditions, and the current impact of the rule on small entities, including compliance requirements and necessary professional skills. The agency must publish a list of rules to be reviewed, including a brief description and the reason for significant economic impact on small entities. Comments are requested from the public, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, and Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman. SEC. 6. CLERICAL AMENDMENTS.
