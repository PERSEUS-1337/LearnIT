    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002\". Congress finds that terrorists can easily obtain and use radioactive material for attacks, including radiological dispersion devices and improvised nuclear explosive devices. Such attacks could have catastrophic consequences, causing economic and social damage and resulting in a large number of casualties. The key to preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism is stopping terrorists from acquiring radioactive sources, special nuclear material, or nuclear weapons. The key to preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism is stopping terrorists from acquiring radioactive sources, special nuclear material, or nuclear weapons. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, key definitions include \"appropriate congressional committees,\" \"byproduct material,\" \"IAEA,\" \"independent states of the former Soviet Union,\" and \"nuclear explosive device.\" A \"device\" is any device designed to release nuclear energy greater than one pound of TNT. A \"radiological dispersion device\" spreads radioactive material. \"Radioactive material\" includes source material, special nuclear material, nuclear by-product material, and material made radioactive in an accelerator. The term \"radioactive source\" refers to sealed radioactive material, excluding material within the nuclear fuel cycle. A \"radioisotope thermal generator\" is an electrical generator powered by the decay heat of a radioactive source. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of State. The term \"source material\" and \"special nuclear material\" have specific meanings under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL REPOSITORIES. The Secretary is authorized to propose agreements with up to five countries for temporary secure storage of radioactive sources. The Secretary can make voluntary contributions to the IAEA to fund the program, with the US share being 100% for fiscal year 2003. The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance to the IAEA for the program, with funding authorized for the Department of State for fiscal year 2003 and beyond. The National Environmental Policy Act does not apply to activities under this section. SEC. 5. The Secretary can contribute to the IAEA for radioactive source discovery, inventory, and recovery. $5,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2012. Funds remain available until expended.\n\nSEC. 6. Radioisotope thermal generator-powered facilities in the former Soviet Union. The Secretary is authorized to assist the Russian Federation in replacing RTG power units with solar or non-nuclear sources in various applications. Replacement technologies must be tested and proven in the intended environment. Up to 20% of funds can be used to replace similar RTG facilities in other countries. Authorization of Appropriations: $10,000,000 is authorized to the Department of State for fiscal years 2003-2005 to assist the former Soviet Union states. The funds can remain available until expended. SEC. 7. FOREIGN FIRST RESPONDERS. The Secretary is authorized to make agreements with foreign countries or propose agreements with the IAEA for training first responders in detecting and handling radioactive materials, understanding contamination hazards, risks, safe entry into contaminated areas, and evacuating people. The Department of State is the lead Federal entity for cooperation with the IAEA in the United States for this program. The Secretary of State will consider threat assessment findings and interim storage facility locations for activities under this subsection. $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 are authorized for the Department of State for this purpose, with funds remaining available until expended. SEC. 8. THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit an annual report to congressional committees detailing preparations at US diplomatic missions to detect and mitigate radiological attacks. The report must prioritize improvements in radiological security and consequence management at missions, with a proposed budget included. The report must be unclassified, with a classified annex if needed. Special Representative for Inspections of Nuclear and Radiological Materials is established. A Special Representative for Inspections of Nuclear and Radiological Materials is established within the Bureau of the Department of State, responsible for nonproliferation matters. The Special Representative, appointed by the President with Senate approval, will have ambassador rank and status and assist the Secretary of State in negotiating. The Special Representative for Inspections of Nuclear and Radiological Materials is responsible for negotiating international agreements to inspect cargoes of nuclear materials destined for the United States at ports of embarkation. The Special Representative will cooperate with the United States Customs Service in carrying out these negotiations. SEC. 10. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The National Science Foundation establishes a program to award grants for university-based research on detecting fissile materials, identifying radioactive isotopes in real time, protecting sites from radiological dispersion device attacks, mitigating consequences of such attacks, and attributing materials used in attacks. Grants are available to investigators at baccalaureate and doctoral degree granting academic institutions. The Director of the NSF consults with the Secretary of Energy to minimize duplication and increase synergies, including the use of the Department of Energy for development. The Department of Energy will collaborate with national laboratories and industry to develop field-ready prototype detectors. $10,000,000 is authorized for the National Science Foundation and $5,000,000 for the Department of Energy for this purpose in fiscal years 2003 through 2008. The Secretary, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, will conduct a study on the use of radioactive sources in industry and potential substitutes through a contract with the National Academy of Sciences. The Academy will submit an initial report within six months and a final report within three months after that."
