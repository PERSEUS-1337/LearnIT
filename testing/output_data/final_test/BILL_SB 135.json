    "title": "SB 135",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 19801 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to prohibit certain forms of gambling and gambling devices in California, while also acknowledging the long history of regulating gambling establishments in the state. Gambling establishments in California employ over 20,000 people and contribute $100 million in taxes. They are lawful enterprises entitled to legal protection, but gambling should not be promoted to children. Unregulated gambling is harmful to public health and safety, and only permitted by state laws and local ordinances. The state of California allows local governments to regulate gambling activities not covered by state law. No new gambling establishments can open in areas without existing ones before January 1, 1984, without voter approval. The purpose of state gambling laws is to regulate lawful gambling businesses, not to expand gambling opportunities. Public trust in permissible gambling requires comprehensive measures to ensure it is free from criminal elements, conducted honestly, and in suitable locations. Strict regulation of all aspects related to gambling establishments and equipment is necessary to maintain public trust and confidence. Licensing and regulation of gambling operations, individuals involved, establishments, and equipment is essential to protect public health, safety, and welfare. To maintain public trust in gambling, licensed establishments must remain open to the general public and access to gambling activities should not be restricted. Exclusion of unsuitable individuals is allowed, but discrimination is prohibited. State policy aims to ensure honesty, competitiveness, and freedom from criminal elements in gambling operations. In order to uphold state policy, gambling establishments and activities must be licensed, participants must be licensed or registered, transactions and processes must be approved, unsuitable individuals must be excluded, and gambling must occur in appropriate locations. Licenses and permits are considered revocable privileges without vested rights. The regulation of lawful gambling premises, including location, hours of operation, number of tables, and wagering limits, is within the jurisdiction of local governmental bodies. State regulatory agencies may intervene if local regulations are inadequate in safeguarding residents' interests. Exclusion of certain individuals from gambling establishments is necessary to uphold the strict regulation of licensed gambling. Licensed gambling operators may be required to keep records and reports of cash and credit transactions involving gambling establishments for criminal and regulatory investigations."
