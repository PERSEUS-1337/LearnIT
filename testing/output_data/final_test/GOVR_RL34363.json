    "content": "There are approximately 9,000 local election jurisdictions in the United States, varying in size and structure. The number of registered voters, polling places, and election personnel also differ significantly among jurisdictions. Despite these variations, certain patterns have emerged from surveys regarding the responsibilities and characteristics of Local Election Officials (LEOs). According to survey results, the typical Local Election Official (LEO) is a white woman aged 50-60, with a high school education, working full-time in election administration for about 10 years, earning under $50,000 annually. They are mostly members of state-level professional organizations, with good to excellent training. However, there is diversity within the LEO community, with about one-quarter being men, 5% from minority groups, 40% college graduates, and 8% with graduate degrees. Ages range from 21 to over 80, serving 1 to 45 years, with reported salaries from under $10,000 to over $120,000. About one-third were appointed rather than elected to their positions. The demographic profile of Local Election Officials (LEOs) is unique, with reported salaries ranging from under $10,000 to over $120,000. They differ from other local government employees in terms of gender and minority representation. The average tenure in their current position decreased by about one year from 2004 to 2006, with 15% of LEOs serving for two years or less in 2006. The survey showed a small increase in job turnover among Local Election Officials (LEOs) from 11% in 2004 to 15% in 2006. There was no significant change in average age. The changes were attributed to federal and state election reform, leading to increased funding, changes in voting systems, and an increased workload for election officials. Full-time work on election administration increased from 66% to 76%, and those spending over twenty hours per week on election duties increased from 41% to 47%. The survey found a small but significant relationship between the highest education level attained and the number of years in service as a Local Election Official (LEO). LEOs without a college degree averaged 11-12 years of service, while those with graduate degrees averaged 9 years. There was no significant change in the distribution of maximum education level between the 2004 and 2006 surveys. About three-quarters of LEOs belonged to at least one professional organization. In 2006, Local Election Officials (LEOs) reported belonging to professional associations, with 40% in national/international associations and 60% in state/regional ones. LEOs had varied responsibilities beyond elections, including budgeting and personnel. Initial training for LEOs was typically less than 20 hours, with only one-fifth required to pass an examination. Most Local Election Officials (LEOs) have received additional training and believe it has improved their effectiveness. Training and experience are seen as equally important for a successful election. Some LEOs feel they need more training in technical and legal aspects. The impact of HAVA requirements, increasing public attention to election administration problems, and controversies about voting system reliability may have influenced these views. Local Election Officials (LEOs) expressed the need for more training in technical and legal aspects of elections, as well as more \"hands-on\" training. They were cautious about the implementation of technology in elections, with only slight positivity towards the benefits outweighing the risks. The use of traditional voting systems like lever machines and punchcards decreased, while systems like PCOS and DREs increased, in line with HAVA requirements for improved technology. The average length of time jurisdictions have been using different voting systems varies greatly, with hand-counted paper ballots used for 80 years on average and DREs for under 10 years. This suggests that jurisdictions tend to stick with their chosen voting systems, creating stability but also potential risks of using outdated technology. The average length of time jurisdictions have been using different voting systems varies greatly, with hand-counted paper ballots used for 80 years on average and DREs for under 10 years. This suggests that jurisdictions tend to stick with their chosen voting systems, creating stability but also potential risks of using outdated technology. The problems associated with the 2000 presidential election were attributed to the continued use of outmoded or flawed technology, such as punchcard systems. Factors like legal and budgetary constraints may impede jurisdictions from taking advantage of voting technology improvements in the future. The survey asked respondents about the influence of stakeholders on decision-making. LEOs felt strongly about local elected officials' role. They were neutral about state election officials and the public. LEOs did not believe non-elected officials, professional associations, and experts should have more influence. In 2006, LEOs felt that the media, political parties, and advocacy groups had too much influence compared to 2004. In 2006, Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) believed advocacy groups had too much influence, and elected local officials should have more influence. They also thought vendors had too much influence, and fewer believed the public and independent experts should have greater influence. Their views on the roles of various government officials remained unchanged. LEOs' concerns about federal government influence are well-known, and they may have resented HAVA requirements. LEOs have become more concerned about stakeholder roles. LEOs are increasingly concerned about the influence of stakeholders like the media, advocates, and political partisans in voting system controversies. There is debate about the influence of voting system vendors in local jurisdictions, with some arguing they have too much influence. The 2004 survey showed mixed views on the importance of vendors, with LEOs trusting them but not considering them highly influential in decision-making. In 2004, most jurisdictions using computer-assisted voting had interacted with their voting-system vendors. Over 90% of LEOs considered vendors responsive and trustworthy, but some believed vendors prioritize profit over security. A quarter of LEOs felt vendors were too involved in election administration. In 2004, LEOs relied heavily on state election officials for information on voting systems, followed by other election officials, the EAC, and advocates for the disabled. Vendors were also a significant source of information, but interest groups, political parties, and media were rated lower. State, local, and federal officials were considered the most influential in decisions about voting systems. LEOs considered state, local, and federal officials as the most influential in decisions about voting systems, with vendors, political parties, and the media rated lower. Local nonelected officials were seen as less influential than vendors, while voters and advocates for the disabled were rated as more influential. LEOs believed that local elected officials should have more influence, the federal government has too much, and were neutral about state officials. Congress may consider these attitudes in overseeing HAVA implementation. LEOs had strong opinions about voting systems in the United States, with users supporting the system used in their jurisdiction. Lever machines had strong support, while DREs had some support. Users of optical scan and DRE systems showed a slight decrease in support for DREs. Overall, LEOs opposed lever machines, punchcard systems, and paper ballots, except for those using them. In 2006, support for DRE voting systems dropped, but overall, LEOs were satisfied with their voting systems. Ratings for satisfaction and performance were lower for optical scan and DRE systems in 2006 compared to previous years. Lever machines had consistent ratings for satisfaction and performance. In 2006, LEOs were satisfied with their voting systems, with slightly higher satisfaction among PCOS users. Ratings for satisfaction and performance did not significantly differ among users of different voting systems. Almost 80% agreed that their current voting system is the best available. In 2006, LEOs were satisfied with their voting systems, with slightly higher satisfaction among PCOS users. Ratings for satisfaction and performance did not significantly differ among users of different voting systems. Almost 80% agreed that their current voting system is the best available. The level of agreement was higher among optical scan and DRE users. LEOs assessed their primary voting systems on fifteen specific characteristics, with high ratings for accuracy, security, reliability, and usability. However, ratings for cost, size, storage requirements, and machine error were lower in 2006 compared to 2004, especially for optical scan and DRE systems. In 2006, ratings for usability were slightly lower, but multilingual capacity ratings were higher. Optical scan systems were rated higher for accessibility in 2006 than in 2004. LEOs switched from positive to fairly neutral about machine and voter error. DREs received the highest ratings for accessibility and ability for multiple languages. Hand-counted paper ballots were rated lowest for counting speed. Ratings for reliability, security, accuracy, and ease of use were high and similar for all voting systems. The study found surprising similarities in ratings for usability, reliability, security, and accuracy among different voting systems. Despite concerns about punchcards after the 2000 election, few jurisdictions have replaced them, leading to continued confidence in their use. The study found unexpected similarities in ratings for usability, reliability, security, and accuracy of different voting systems, challenging common perceptions. Election officials' views on system performance may differ from public opinion, potentially leading to unnecessary regulations and expenses. The controversy surrounding electronic voting systems, particularly DREs, escalated in 2003 due to HAVA promoting their use and security vulnerabilities being widely publicized. Election officials' perceptions on system performance may differ from public opinion, leading to potential unnecessary regulations and expenses. Most law enforcement officers (LEOs) believe current federal and state guidelines on electronic voting systems are strict enough, with some split on whether they are too strict or not strict enough. Users and nonusers of electronic voting systems had similar views, but nonusers were more likely to think the standards were too strict or not strict enough. LEOs were asked about their agreement with statements on DRE and optical scan systems in surveys conducted in 2004 and 2006. In 2004 and 2006 surveys, law enforcement officers (LEOs) were asked about their opinions on DRE and optical scan voting systems. Users of DREs believed in their system's security and certification procedures, while nonusers were more neutral. LEOs using optical scan systems were also more neutral towards DREs. Nonusers generally had less strong opinions compared to users. The controversy surrounding the security and reliability of DREs has led to calls for the adoption of VVPAT. LEOs using DREs showed increased usage of VVPAT from 18% in 2004 to 36% in 2006. Media criticism of voting systems was a common theme in surveys, with users and nonusers holding similar views. In 2006, the percentage of LEOs using DREs doubled to 36% from 18% in 2004. Some jurisdictions allowed voters to use paper ballots instead of DREs. In 2006, only DRE users were asked about requiring VVPAT, with 14% supporting it. Nonusers had a higher support at 68%. Strong disagreement with DREs producing VVPAT decreased from 47% in 2004 to 36% in 2006. In 2006, LEOs were asked about their willingness to use a VVPAT if reimbursed by the government, with 57% agreeing. Most respondents were only willing to spend $300 or less for the feature. Reasons for disagreeing or agreeing with DREs producing a VVPAT included concerns about printer failure, implementation complexity, and risks to voter privacy. LEOs in 2006 were more concerned about costs and printer failure, and less concerned about tampering with the VVPAT. Satisfaction with VVPAT among LEOs was high, but about one-fifth were dissatisfied. Confidence in accuracy was high among LEOs, with few expressing concerns. In 2006, most LEOs had confidence in the accuracy of HAVA requirements, with about 90% familiar with the law. While many believed jurisdictions were in compliance, some felt the law resulted in no major improvements. Support for HAVA provisions varied, with most LEOs considering them advantageous. LEOs generally regarded the major provisions of HAVA as advantageous, with varying levels of support among the provisions. Provisional voting received the highest negative ratings, while federal funding was most supported. Support declined for most provisions from 2004 to 2006, except for voter registration and identification requirements. The steepest decline in support was for the state matching-fund requirement. The perceived difficulty of implementation did not contribute to the decline in support for HAVA. The perceived difficulty of implementing HAVA provisions was moderately difficult for LEOs, with a decline in difficulty for most provisions except for certification of voting systems and military/overseas voter participation. The drop in support for the state matching-fund requirement in 2006 may have been influenced by concerns about costs and funding. About 90% of respondents believe that HAVA has increased election costs, with concerns about future funding sufficiency. LEOs are divided on current funding adequacy but express worries about future funding, with 30% extremely concerned. While HAVA has improved voter accessibility, LEOs disagree that it has made elections fairer or more reliable. The HAVA law has made elections more complex to administer, according to respondents. The Election Assistance Commission was created to carry out specific responsibilities, such as grant programs and voluntary testing of voting systems. The EAC does not have rule-making authority and does not enforce HAVA requirements. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was created to carry out specific responsibilities outlined in the HAVA law (P.L. 103-31). In a 2006 survey, local election officials (LEOs) ranked the EAC's responsibilities, with guidance being seen as most important and ensuring compliance as least important. Over 60% of LEOs reported that the EAC did not help them understand or perform their duties, with only 6% finding the agency \"extremely helpful.\" Overall, LEOs rated the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) moderately beneficial, with guidance being considered the most important responsibility but rated lowest in benefit. Research and certification were perceived as more beneficial, while funding received the highest rating. Some LEOs found EAC guidance frustrating due to delays in start-up. Some LEOs expressed frustration with delays in EAC start-up and guidance issuance, citing the need for clear plans and timelines. Others mentioned receiving brochures close to elections that were not helpful. The EAC's information on their website can be helpful, but local levels only deal with the Secretary of State, not the EAC. EAC commissioners and staff are aware of their situation and work closely with them. Some suggest exempting smaller entities from expensive HAVA equipment requirements and believe elections should be free of federal control. There is a need for more power to correct election problems, as some states struggled to meet the 2006 deadline for a statewide voter registration list. Most LEOs were familiar with their state's database, with about a third assessing themselves as \"very familiar.\" The implementation of the computerized list did not require hiring additional staff in most cases. Funding for the implementation mainly came from local governments. LEOs expressed confidence in the security and contingency plans of the statewide voter registration database. Most LEOs were confident in security and contingency plans for the statewide voter registration database, but had concerns about unauthorized access and updating records. They were neutral on the risk of identity theft and the burden on local governments. Voter identification issues, including HAVA requirements for first-time voters, have been controversial. Many states require some form of identification document for voting, with concerns about voter-identification requirements leading to debates. Some argue that requiring photo IDs could disenfranchise eligible voters, while others worry about ineligible voters casting ballots. As a local election official, respondents were asked about their support for requiring valid photo identification from all voters, their views on voter fraud, and the impact of photo ID requirements on election security and voter turnout. Results showed mild support for photo ID requirements, with 29% extremely supportive, 12% not supportive at all, and the rest spread across the scale of responses. Two-thirds of local election officials believe that requiring photo identification will enhance election security, despite few concerns about ineligible voters or fraud in their jurisdictions. 41% think it could lower voter turnout, while 56% believe it would have no impact. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, suggesting that the controversy surrounding photo ID requirements is not settled among local election officials. In 2006, local election officials perceived that HAVA made elections more complex to administer, leading to increased time spent preparing for the election compared to 2004. On average, officials reported a 15% increase in time spent on election duties. Additionally, they worked an extra 20 hours per week in the month before the election, despite it not being a presidential election year. Various issues such as voting-system malfunctions, problems with pollworkers, vendors, long lines, and media coverage were prominent concerns during this time. The survey presented a list of 16 potential problems to local election officials (LEOs) and found that DRE users reported the most malfunctions. 53% reported repairable malfunctions and 12% reported irreparable malfunctions. Jurisdictions using DREs as the primary voting system had a higher chance of malfunctions compared to those using other systems like precinct-count optical scan. The survey found that DRE users reported the most malfunctions, with 53% reporting repairable malfunctions and 12% reporting irreparable malfunctions. Users of precinct-count optical scan systems also experienced high failure rates. About one in seven users of optical scan and DREs were disappointed in vendor support, leading to higher rates of unrepairable malfunctions. Lever machines and paper ballots had lower reported failure rates compared to DREs and optical scan systems. The survey results show that current optical scan systems may not be more reliable than DREs, with some LEOs reporting malfunctions. Only one LEO reported a system being hacked. There was a high incidence of long lines at polling places, especially in jurisdictions using DREs. DRE users also reported more unfair media coverage compared to users of other systems. The incidence of problems with accurate and timely reporting of election results was low and did not differ among users of different voting systems. Reports of deliberate election fraud were few, with a rate of 0.75%. LEOs noticed no change on average in residual votes from 2004 to 2006, suggesting that the decreased confidence in voting systems was not due to an increase in voter error. The number of provisional ballots used varied greatly among jurisdictions in 2006, with one provisional ballot used for every 140 registered voters on average. About a quarter of jurisdictions used no provisional ballots, while 4% used more than 1,000. Voter error was not a result of a noticeable increase, and most LEOs reported no change in the ease of using provisional ballots compared to 2004. In 2006, most LEOs found optical scan systems easier to use, with three-quarters of jurisdictions using them for absentee ballots. Over half of jurisdictions offered early voting, with varying methods used. The rate of absentee voting has been increasing nationally, with an average of 14% of votes cast by absentee ballot in 2006. Some election officials support absentee voting as it reduces election day pressures and is easier to administer. Concerns about early and \"no excuse\" absentee voting include security risks and no increase in turnout. LEOs largely agree that absentee voting should be a voter's right and worth the costs, but are equivocal about early voting. About 10% of jurisdictions had instances of pollworkers not reporting for duty. Absenteeism among pollworkers has been cited as a significant problem on election day, with factors such as long hours, low pay, poor training, and age contributing to the issue. More than 20% of LEOs reported instances of pollworkers not understanding their jobs, with the lowest rate in jurisdictions using hand-counted paper ballots. Differences in absenteeism rates between paper and other voting systems were not statistically significant. The technology-related tasks of pollworkers in different voting systems vary, with hand-counted paper ballots requiring fewer pollworkers, polling places, and registered voters. The 2006 survey showed that most jurisdictions use pollworkers, with an average of 164 per jurisdiction. The number of pollworkers correlates with the number of registered voters and polling places. Overall, the number of pollworkers per polling place varied based on the voting system used. Jurisdictions using hand-counted paper ballots had the smallest number of registered voters, polling places, and pollworkers, while those using DREs and lever machines had the highest. Compensation for pollworkers also varied, with about 60% receiving a lump-sum payment of $100 on average, while the rest were paid an hourly wage of $7.25 on average. Regional variations in pay rates were observed, with New England states averaging $50. Regional variation in pay rates for pollworkers was observed, with New England states averaging $50 to $106 per day and the West ranging from $70 to $155. While pay did not significantly impact performance, inadequate training was believed to be a major factor in election administration problems according to most LEOs surveyed. Pollworkers received an average of 3.5 hours of training in 2006, with 10% receiving 1 hour or less. Despite this, 70% of LEOs considered pollworker training extremely important. Training covered voter check-in, accessibility, election laws, voting machine operation, and election integrity. Some pollworkers desired more training in voting machine operation and election laws. LEOs believed HAVA is changing pollworker training, with 20% reporting substantial changes. Most LEOs think HAVA has made elections more complex to administer, impacting pollworker recruitment. Concerns exist about the political contentiousness in election administration and suggestions for nonpartisan measures. LEOs were generally satisfied with election administration at the state level, with some expressing dissatisfaction. Most believed election administration is independent of partisan politics. However, over half of elected LEOs disclosed their party affiliation during their election. Views on the political contentiousness of election administration varied, with some finding it non-contentious and others extremely contentious. LEOs were divided on whether election administration should be a civil service function in their state. LEOs were divided on whether election administration should be a civil service function in their state, with more elected LEOs opposed to the idea than in favor. Steps were taken to ensure the sample in the survey was representative of local election officials as a whole. The survey results may not accurately represent the views of local election officials due to potential biases and limitations in surveys. There is uncertainty in whether officials' responses reflect their true beliefs or correspond to reality. Caution is needed in interpreting the data, as officials may be hesitant to rate their voting systems negatively or may genuinely believe in their reliability, accuracy, and security despite evidence suggesting otherwise. Additionally, it is important to be cautious in attributing cause and effect relationships. The survey results show an association between voting system and number of pollworkers, but the number of registered voters is a more important factor. Caution is needed in using survey results to shape policy decisions, as desired changes may not always lead to the most effective policies. The survey results suggest potential areas for improvement in election administration, such as education and professional involvement at the national level. Congress could address this by facilitating educational programs for local election officials and promoting professional certification. The demographic characteristics and partisanship of Local Election Officials (LEOs) have policy implications. Efforts should be made to ensure diversity among LEOs, especially in minority representation. Controversy surrounds the security of DRE voting systems since the enactment of HAVA. The survey revealed that Local Election Officials (LEOs) have differing levels of confidence in Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting systems. Those with experience in DREs are confident in their security and accessibility, while non-users are less confident and support the addition of a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) for security. This suggests a need for further education on the reliability and security of DRE systems among non-users. The survey results show that Local Election Officials (LEOs) generally support the goals of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), including the creation of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the use of new voting systems to reduce errors. However, concerns remain about the ongoing costs of HAVA implementation and the effectiveness of the EAC. Congress may need to address these issues during HAVA appropriations and reauthorization. The relationship between Local Election Officials (LEOs) and voting system vendors may not change significantly due to the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). However, HAVA's codification of voting system standards and certification processes could increase federal government influence in decision-making. LEOs have expressed concerns about the influence of vendors, media, political parties, and advocacy groups on voting system decisions. More research, including surveys of state election officials, could help address these concerns and determine the most effective federal role in implementing HAVA goals. The appropriate federal role in promoting the effective implementation of HAVA goals at all levels of government is a common suggestion of Local Election Officials (LEOs). Adjusting requirements to fit the needs of smaller jurisdictions is recommended. Specific information on how the needs and characteristics of different jurisdictions vary with size could be useful. Identifying how the duties of LEOs vary with size and other characteristics of the jurisdiction is important. Election administration is only part of the LEO's job in many jurisdictions, and it is unknown how other responsibilities might affect election administration. Periodic surveys of LEO characteristics and perceptions could be beneficial. The results presented in this report are from two surveys sponsored by CRS as part of its Capstone program at Texas A&M University. The surveys were conducted by graduate students and faculty over a two-year period. The topics were chosen based on their potential usefulness for Congress, and the survey instrument was developed collaboratively by CRS and Texas A&M participants. The Bush School team developed and administered surveys in consultation with CRS, gathering data from approximately 3,800 LEOs in 50 states after the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. A modified random-sampling regime was used to ensure representation from all states without bias. Surveys were mostly conducted electronically, with some paper surveys. The surveys conducted by the Bush School team gathered data from approximately 3,800 LEOs in 50 states after the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. Surveys were mostly conducted electronically, with some paper surveys sent via the U.S. Postal Service. The overall final response rate was 40% of the sample, with respondents answering 85-90% of questions on average. Individual response rates per state ranged between 25% and 50% for about three-quarters of states. Response rates were similar among states across the two surveys and did not vary significantly based on the number of local election jurisdictions or voting age population. The data for the report was gathered from surveys conducted by the Bush School team, involving approximately 3,800 LEOs in 50 states after the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. The surveys had a 40% response rate, with respondents answering 85-90% of questions on average. The data was analyzed using standard parametric methods after errors were corrected and irrelevant responses were discarded. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, regression, and t-tests to test hypotheses on group differences, deviations from hypothetical values, and associations. Significance was determined at \u03b1 = .01, with most results highly significant (p << .01). Graphs with 95% confidence intervals were used for display. Non-significant effects were also reported. No significant change was found between 2004 and 2006 for a specific survey item. Additional methodological details available upon request."
