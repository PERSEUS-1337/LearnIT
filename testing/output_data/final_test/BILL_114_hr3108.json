The Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2015 includes a pilot program for military use of energy savings performance contracts, a report on tactical vehicle research for energy efficiency, additional research to improve military vehicle technology, establishment of a repository for energy-related research, a study on power storage capacity, creation of an alternative fueled vehicle infrastructure fund, and a secure energy innovation program. Sec. 11. Report on military readiness for water shortages, wildfires, drought, flooding, and coastal erosion. The pilot program focuses on military use of energy savings performance contracts for mobile and nonbuilding applications. The Secretary of a military department may conduct a pilot program using energy savings performance contracts to achieve energy savings in mobile assets and nonbuilding applications. A report on the program's implementation must be submitted to Congress within two years, detailing the contracts executed and the savings achieved. The Secretary of a military department may conduct a pilot program using energy savings performance contracts to achieve energy savings in mobile assets and nonbuilding applications, which are defined as transportable vehicles, devices, or equipment that consume energy for transportation or maintaining controlled environments. The pilot program allows the use of energy savings performance contracts to achieve energy savings in federally owned equipment used for electricity generation or water transport. Secondary savings include additional energy or cost savings resulting from the energy efficiency improvements financed through the contract, such as reduced fuel delivery needs, personnel cost savings, and increased efficiency in electricity production. The pilot program allows energy savings performance contracts for electricity generation or water transport. The authority to enter into such contracts terminates on September 30, 2041. The Secretary of the Army must report to Congress on Army research since October 1, 2010, focusing on improving tactical vehicle energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. Additionally, further research is required to enhance military vehicle technology for increased fuel economy in combat situations. The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the Army and Navy, may conduct research to enhance military vehicle technology for improved fuel economy in combat. Research must consider past successes and lessons learned from previous programs. Additionally, a repository will be established for Department of Defense research efforts related to operational energy. The Secretary of Defense, with the Army and Navy, may conduct research to improve military vehicle fuel economy in combat. A centralized repository for all operational energy-related research and development efforts of the Department of Defense will be established by December 31, 2016, accessible through a Department of Defense website for collaboration among employees and program managers. The curr_chunk can be summarized as: \nEfforts to enhance collaboration between military departments on research and development, sharing best practices, and reducing redundancy. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report by September 30, 2016, on the costs and benefits of requiring 25% of National Guard and Reserve facilities to have a 21-day on-site power storage capacity for disaster support. Additionally, a Department of Defense Alternative Fueled Vehicle Infrastructure Fund will be established. The Department of Defense Alternative Fuel Vehicle Infrastructure Fund is established in the Treasury, consisting of appropriated amounts, investment earnings, and other available funds. The Secretary can invest excess funds in government obligations, and the Fund can be used by the Secretary through the Under Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense Alternative Fuel Vehicle Infrastructure Fund is established to install, operate, and maintain alternative fuel dispensing stations for Department of Defense vehicles. Definitions for alternative fuel and alternative fueled vehicles are provided in the section. SEC. 8. SECURE ENERGY INNOVATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Defense will establish a program to develop secure and reliable energy sources for military installations, including advanced energy metering and resilient power systems. Metrics will be developed to assess costs and benefits of energy projects, considering potential power losses from disasters or attacks. Each military department will assess their installations as part of the program. The Secretary of Defense will assess military installations to identify critical electrical loads, evaluate security and backup power, and explore alternative energy sources for increased resilience. Energy Savings may be used for implementation. The Secretaries of the military departments can utilize various contracts like Energy Savings Performance Contracts, Power Purchase Agreements, and Enhanced Use Leasing agreements to achieve energy intensity or renewable energy goals, as long as energy security and supply resilience also improve. SEC. 9 amends Section 2919(b)(2) of title 10, United States Code. SEC. 10 requires a report on energy efficiency provisions in military contracts. SEC. 11 requires a report on military readiness for dealing with water shortages, wildfires, drought, flooding from sea level rise, and coastal erosion. The Secretary of Defense must report on strategies to address water shortages, wildfires, drought, flooding, and coastal erosion's impact on military readiness by March 1, 2016. The report should cover how changing conditions affect operations, effective preparation methods, dissemination of best practices, and challenges faced by the Department. The Department is asked about challenges in preparedness and resilience initiatives, and if congressional action is needed for increased security. Opportunities for public-private partnerships to address these issues are also being explored."
