Congress passed the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act to protect the unique marine environments of the Florida Keys, including the only living coral barrier reef ecosystem in North America. The Act directed the development of a comprehensive water quality protection program for the Sanctuary. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act aims to recommend corrective actions for pollution sources to restore the integrity of the Sanctuary, including a balanced population of marine life and recreational activities. The Act also established a Water Quality Steering Committee to guide water quality improvement projects. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act established a Technical Advisory Committee to advise the Water Quality Steering Committee on water quality improvement projects and assign responsibilities for program implementation among relevant authorities. Dilapidated wastewater treatment and stormwater management systems are identified as major sources of pollution to nearshore waters. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies have identified wastewater infrastructure improvements as crucial for enhancing nearshore water quality in the Florida Keys. Stormwater management also needs to be improved to reduce pollutant loadings from uncontrolled runoff. The estimated cost of necessary wastewater improvements is between $184,000,000 and $418,000,000. The cost of stormwater improvements in Monroe County, Florida is estimated at $370-680 million, posing a burden on residents. Federal law changes are needed to fulfill responsibilities under the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act. Congress should authorize appropriations to supplement State and local efforts to improve water quality in the Florida Keys marine environment, in line with the goals of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act. The purpose of this Act is to protect the resources of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary by providing funds for projects to replace inadequate wastewater and stormwater systems in Monroe County, Florida. Grants will be made to the Florida Keys Aqueduct Authority or other appropriate agencies for authorized projects. Projects eligible for funding under this Act include replacing inadequate wastewater treatment systems and improving stormwater management systems in Monroe County, Florida to enhance water quality in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, in accordance with growth management ordinances and agreements between Monroe County and the State of Florida. The Water Quality Steering Committee oversees projects related to wastewater and stormwater management in Monroe County, Florida, in line with environmental standards set by the EPA. Eligible projects include centralized treatment facilities, onsite disposal systems, and stormwater management improvements. Stormwater projects eligible for funding under this Act may include systems utilizing the best available technology approved by the permitting agency. SEC. 6.

The project must comply with relevant plans, ordinances, laws, regulations, and policies, as well as agreements between Monroe County and the State of Florida. It should also provide substantial water quality benefits compared to other projects under consideration. SEC. 7. CONSULTATION.
