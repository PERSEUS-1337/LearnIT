    "content": "The United Nations \"oil-for-food\" program was established to alleviate human suffering in Iraq and encourage compliance with U.N. Security Council resolutions. It was a temporary exception to the trade embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait. The program aimed to end once Iraq complied with efforts to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs, but progress was slow, leading to ongoing sanctions and a lack of essential imports for Iraq. Living conditions in Iraq deteriorated sharply during 1991-1995 despite efforts to establish an oil-for-food plan. Iraq rejected the initial plan as too limited, leading to little progress in alleviating the suffering of its people. Iraq continued to sell oil in violation of U.N. sanctions, with the U.S. aware of these actions. On April 15, 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 986, allowing Iraq to export $2 billion in oil every six months. Iraq accepted the proposal due to fears of unrest from declining living standards. The first Iraqi oil exports under the program began on December 10, 1996. Resolution 1153 in February 1998 raised the oil export ceiling to $5.256 billion per six-month phase. Resolution 1284 in December 1999 abolished the program to provide Iraq an incentive to cooperate with U.N. WMD inspections. The United Nations Security Council abolished the export limit in Resolution 1284 in December 1999, as part of the Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) which aimed to deliver civilian goods to Iraq. The program did not restore normal economic activity or monitor Iraq's compliance with wider trade embargoes. The U.N. Sanctions Committee oversaw sanctions on Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule, and after the regime fell in 2003, the United States took control. After the fall of the regime in 2003, the United States gained U.N. support to phase out the Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) in Iraq. The program controlled Iraqi oil exports and humanitarian imports, with oversight by the U.N. Sanctions Committee. Iraq's state-owned oil company negotiated oil contracts with international companies, which were reviewed monthly. Iraq was only allowed to export oil under this program. Iraq exported oil under the Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) through an Iraq-Turkey pipeline and Persian Gulf terminals. The oil proceeds were deposited into a U.N.-monitored escrow account. Saybolt Nederland BV monitored the approved oil exports, but was not responsible for ensuring Iraq's use of approved export routes. Iraq purchased goods and services directly from supplier firms in each six-month phase of the Oil-for-Food Program. The Sanctions Committee reviewed and approved contracts for the export of goods to Iraq, with the U.S. often placing holds on exports of dual-use items. The U.S. representative consulted with government agencies to assess if requested items could be used for military purposes. Under Security Council Resolution 1409, the UN weapons inspection unit reviewed export contracts to ensure they did not contain dual-use items. US firms could buy Iraqi oil and sell goods to Iraq, including oil industry spare parts. US imports of Iraqi oil peaked just before the start of the war in February 2003. In 2003, U.S. imports of Iraqi oil were around 1 million barrels per day, primarily purchased through energy trading firms. Funds from an escrow account paid for goods via letters of credit. Cotecna monitored supplies at border crossings in Iraq. A fifth border point was established in November 2002 at Arar on the Saudi-Iraq border. Cotecna monitored goods entering or leaving Iraq under the OFFP but was not responsible for authenticating goods from bilateral trade agreements or certifying prices. The Iraqi government distributed imports through a rationing system monitored by U.N. workers. The distribution of goods in Iraq under the OFFP was monitored by U.N. workers, including personnel from various U.N. agencies. In Kurdish-controlled areas, U.N. workers and security guards oversaw the distribution process. Dual-use item exports to Iraq were supposed to be monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, but the monitoring mechanism was altered during 1998-2002. The monitoring mechanism for end-use monitoring in Iraq was altered during 1998-2002, with UNMOVIC replacing UNSCOM. UNMOVIC was supposed to perform the monitoring function but withdrew before starting. U.N. employees monitored the distribution of civilian goods during this time, causing the U.S. and Britain to closely scrutinize exports of dual-use items to Iraq. The OFFP aimed to help Iraq meet international obligations and ensure fair distribution of imports. The revenues from Iraq's oil sales were distributed as follows: 25% to UNCC for reparations, 59% for humanitarian items in Baghdad, 13% for supplies in Kurdish provinces, 3% for U.N. administration costs, and 1% to reimburse member states. Resolution 1284 aimed to improve relief for Iraqis and encourage Iraq to allow U.N. weapons inspectors back. It removed the limit on Iraq's oil exports and eased restrictions on civilian goods flow. The Sanctions Committee was directed to list items not subject to review. Resolution 1284 removed Iraq from Sanctions Committee review, allowing for accelerated approval procedures for various goods. It also laid the groundwork for foreign investment in Iraq's oil industry, contingent on cooperation with UNMOVIC. Exploration of new oil fields was still not permitted. Resolution 1284 incentivized Iraq to cooperate with UNMOVIC by offering to suspend export and import sanctions for 120 days, renewable by the Security Council. It also streamlined the approval process for oil industry spare parts and increased the value of imports to $600 million in response to improving the humanitarian situation. The Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP) eased economic hardship in Iraq, generating $64.2 billion in revenues with 3.4 billion barrels of oil sold. $39 billion worth of humanitarian supplies were delivered to Iraq under the program. The Oil-for-Food Program generated $64.2 billion in revenues with 3.4 billion barrels of oil sold. $39 billion worth of humanitarian supplies were delivered to Iraq under the program, including $6.1 billion for the Kurdish areas. Iraq's oil exports were shut down during the U.S.-led war in 2003. Major accomplishments included improving living standards by providing 2,200 kilocalories of food per person per day in Baghdad-controlled Iraq. The Oil-for-Food Program provided 2,200 kilocalories of food per person per day in Baghdad-controlled Iraq, meeting 90% of the U.N. target caloric intake. 60% of Iraq's families relied solely on the food ration to meet household needs. Malnutrition rates in 2002 were half of pre-program levels among children under five. The program also saw improvements in the health sector, including an increase in major surgeries and a reduction in communicable diseases. Additionally, the program halted the deterioration of water facilities. The UNICEF survey in Iraq showed a significant increase in infant and under five-year-old mortality rates in the southern and central regions controlled by the Iraqi government from 1984-1989 to 1994-1999. The survey results were carefully collected to ensure accuracy and showed a concerning rise in mortality rates during the specified time period. According to a UN report, child mortality increased in Iraq from 1984-1989 to 1994-1999, resulting in 500,000 more deaths among children under five. In northern Iraq, infant and under five-year-old mortality rates decreased during the same period. The report also highlighted shortages in materials and equipment in the education sector, with 1.2 million school desks distributed to address overcrowding. Iraq's literacy rate was reported at 53.7% for adults and 70.7% for youth. The United States and Britain blamed Iraq for the shortcomings of the literacy program, while U.N. administrators also criticized Iraq but attributed some deficiencies to U.S. and British policies. Contract holds on infrastructure equipment were a major issue faced by the program. The United States placed almost $5 billion of goods on hold in response to criticism, asserting that 90% of contracts were approved with minimal impact. Scrutiny was necessary to prevent equipment use in WMD programs during the absence of U.N. inspectors in Iraq. U.N. reports did not accuse Iraq of diverting imports for military use, but U.S. reports made such allegations. The U.S. smart sanctions proposal aimed to rebuild consensus to contain Iraq amid collapsing international sanctions enforcement and allegations of Iraq acquiring prohibited goods. The U.S. smart sanctions proposal aimed to ease restrictions on civilian goods to Iraq in exchange for controlling illicit trade with neighbors. The plan targeted sanctions on Iraq's strategic capabilities, not its civilian economy, to address criticism from other governments. However, disagreements among permanent members of the U.N. Security Council delayed agreement on the implementation of the plan. The Security Council reached agreement to adopt elements of the U.S. plan, creating the Goods Review List (GRL) to review dual-use items exported to Iraq. Resolution 1447 pledged to add items to the GRL within 30 days to prevent Iraq from countering a U.S. military offensive. 36 U.S.-suggested items were added to the GRL on December 30, 2002. Enhanced border control provisions were not included in the resolution due to opposition from Iraq's neighbors. The resolution did not include U.S. proposals to restrict civilian flights to Iraq or allow new foreign investment in Iraq's energy sector. Relief efforts from various organizations supplemented the Oil-for-Food Program in Iraq, with a focus on southern and central regions rather than the Kurdish north. The Oil-for-Food Program in Iraq focused on southern and central regions, with limited assistance to the Kurdish north. Various organizations provided humanitarian aid to Iraq, with the European Union giving over $200 million from 1991-2003. Many countries participated in the program by trading with Iraq. In 1998, countries exporting over $25 million worth of goods to Iraq were likely part of the Oil-for-Food Program. The program was briefly suspended in 2003 but restarted with Resolution 1472 as U.S. forces advanced towards Baghdad. Resolution 1483, adopted on May 22, 2003, lifted sanctions on Iraq and phased out the Oil-for-Food Program within six months. The program ended on November 21, 2003, and was taken over by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Iraq's oil sales are now unrestricted, with the CPA managing food distribution and contracts previously signed under the program. Since the handover of sovereignty to an Iraqi interim government on June 28, 2004, Iraq's Ministry of Trade has managed the receipt and distribution of residual contracts from the Oil-for-Food Program. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 (June 8, 2004) gave formal responsibility for final closeout to the Iraqi government. The government continues to distribute civilian necessities to needy Iraqis using funds from oil sales, as the Office of the Iraq Program, which ran the program, has closed. At the start of the war in March 2003, the program's escrow account had over $10 billion remaining due to Iraq's growing oil revenues. Iraq's oil revenues grew faster than import contracts were signed, leaving approximately $9 billion transferred to Iraq's Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). $216 million remained in U.N. accounts as of February 2005. Resolution 1483 abolished the Iraq Sanctions Committee in 2003, but Resolution 1518 established the \"1518\" Committee to locate financial assets of the former regime. Saddam Hussein's regime used illicit methods to generate funds, including selling oil to neighboring countries in violation of U.N. sanctions. Iraq allegedly violated U.N. sanctions from 1990 to 2003, exploiting loopholes to profit from oil sales and humanitarian goods. Illicit funds were used to procure banned military supplies and WMD technology. After Saddam Hussein's regime fell in 2003, allegations emerged of using oil contracts to influence foreign entities and reward supporters. Allegations of illicit fundraising and political activities in Iraq emerged after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. Investigations revealed misuse of oil vouchers granted by the former regime, with 270 individuals and entities allegedly benefiting from them. Some recipients were accused of selling the oil obtained through these vouchers. Several recipients of oil vouchers were accused of selling them for profit or supporting the former Iraqi regime politically. Benon Sevan, the executive director of the U.N. OFFP, was among the 270 entities named. Many recipients were political parties in the former East bloc states or high-ranking officials and their relatives in various countries. Russia-based entities were the most prominent on the list, including major energy firms. Some individuals denied the allegations, while others claimed the payments were legitimate commissions or donations for humanitarian work. The Iraqi newspaper named 270 entities, including Benon Sevan, in connection with alleged voucher payments linked to Saddam Hussein's regime. Some recipients denied the accusations, stating the payments were legitimate commissions or donations. The allegations aimed to expose U.N. flaws and question its advisory role in post-Saddam governance, bringing renewed scrutiny to the management of the U.N. OFFP and Saddam Hussein's efforts to manipulate the program and U.N. sanctions. The claims suggested that voucher payments were granted in exchange for favorable treatment or political support for lifting sanctions on Iraq, leading to investigations by U.S. and U.N. appointed investigators. U.S. and U.N. appointed investigators probed allegations of abuse and mismanagement in the U.N. OFFP. An independent inquiry led by Paul Volcker estimated Iraq earned $12.8 billion in illicit revenue during 1990-2003, with $10.99 billion from non-OFFP trade protocols. The Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) investigated illicit revenue in the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP), estimating $228.8 million from surcharges on oil sales and $1.58 billion from kickbacks on humanitarian contracts. Critics noted the IIC lacked legal subpoena power, but received varying degrees of cooperation. The IIC closed in 2006, with documents transferred to the United Nations for member states' access. The final report on Iraq's WMD by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) was issued in 2004 by special advisor Charles Duelfer. The report details Iraq's attempts to procure WMD-related equipment despite sanctions and the regime's funding mechanisms. It also covers Iraq's illicit oil sales and allegations of abuses of the OFFP, naming entities and individuals involved. The Duelfer report details Iraq's business dealings, based on Iraqi documents and interviews with officials. Investigations by the Treasury Department and congressional committees are ongoing regarding allegations of illicit financial dealings. Several committees, including the Reform Committee and the House International Relations Committee, have conducted inquiries and issued reports on illicit financial dealings involving BNP Paribas and U.S. energy companies in the OFFP. Iraq's \"Board of Supreme Audit\" is investigating with the help of Ernst and Young, following the assassination of the Iraqi head of the Board. Countries are investigating their nationals' involvement in financial arrangements with Saddam Hussein's regime, with Australia establishing a Royal Commission led by Terrence Cole. The Cole Commission report found that AWB made illegal payments to the Iraqi regime through a third party trucking company. In South Africa, the Donen Commission investigated ANC members' involvement in illicit oil-for-food transactions. South African Prime Minister Thabo Mbeki received the final report but has not taken further action. Indian, German, and French authorities are also investigating similar cases. The IIC report revealed that Saddam Hussein's regime earned $11 billion from illicit oil sales outside the scope of the U.N. OFFP and in violation of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. Investigations have been launched by Indian, German, and French authorities, while the UK's Serious Fraud Office has not announced any plans. Russian authorities have declined to investigate the claims based on documents from the Volcker committee. Iraq's illicit oil sales outside the U.N. OFFP were in violation of sanctions, with the U.S. and other members choosing not to take direct action before Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The IIC's final report links this inaction to political preferences. The IIC report links the lack of action against Iraq's illicit oil sales to political preferences, highlighting examples such as the United States' tolerance for trade with Jordan and Turkey, and Russia's and France's reluctance to address smuggling between Iraq and Syria. Jordan imported Iraqi oil below market prices in exchange for goods and debt write-downs, with unsuccessful attempts to gain U.N. approval. The United States supported the Sanctions Committee decision regarding Jordanian purchases of discounted Iraqi oil to preserve Jordan's economy and support for U.N. sanctions. Annual waivers of U.S. sanctions on Jordan were granted to maintain this trade relationship, which contributed to Iraq's financial survival. Iraq earned $6 billion from the Jordanian trade protocol, aiding Saddam Hussein's regime until the U.N. OFFP was established in 1996. In October 2000, Jordan cancelled an agreement with Lloyd's Registry for cargo inspection in Aqaba. Iraq began exporting oil through a repaired Iraq-Syria pipeline in late 2000. Syria paid Iraq below market price for oil exports through this route. The Iraq-Syria trade protocol allowed Syria to import oil from Iraq at below market prices, while Iraq earned illicit income from the arrangement. The United States criticized the trade as illegitimate, but may have overlooked it to gain Syria's support in the global war on terrorism. The U.N. Security Council membership in 2002 allowed Syria to block inquiries into illegal oil imports from Iraq. Iraq exported oil through Turkey in 2002, using Turkish trucks to carry oil products. The Turkish government taxed and regulated the illicit imports, and the U.S. waived sanctions on Turkey for this trade. Turkey tried to formalize the trade protocol unsuccessfully. Iraq earned $806.7 million through its trade protocol with Turkey, with reports suggesting a slowdown in commerce before the U.S.-led war in 2003. An estimated 30,000 - 40,000 barrels per day were illicitly exported through the Persian Gulf in cooperation with Iran. Funds were divided between Iraq, smugglers, middlemen, and Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Exportation through the Gulf decreased due to oil diversion to the Syrian route. The U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf and Iran's cooperation limited oil smuggling via the Gulf route. Allegations of mismanagement and abuse of the U.N. OFFP involve contractors and U.N. staff soliciting oil vouchers or bribes from Iraqi authorities. Investigations are ongoing. Investigations into the U.N. OFFP operations have uncovered flaws in contract management and auditing, as well as evidence of Iraq earning $1.8 billion in illicit funds through surcharges on oil shipments and kickbacks on approved contracts. The former Iraqi government also used a secret oil voucher system to allocate oil for sale under the OFFP to politically sympathetic individuals and entities. The IIC's February 2005 interim report found that the selection process for United Nations contractors in 1996 did not adhere to financial and competitive bidding rules. Political factors undermined transparency and competitiveness, with personal interventions and prejudiced decisions affecting the process. The IIC investigation into the selection process for United Nations contractors in 1996 focused on Kojo Annan's potential role in influencing the awarding of the OFFP goods authentication contract to Cotecna Inspection Services S.A. Cotecna executives deny his involvement and highlight their previous U.N. inspection contract wins before Kojo Annan's employment. The IIC investigation found no credible evidence that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan influenced the selection of Cotecna for the OFFP inspection contract. However, it noted that Annan did not conduct an adequate inquiry into his son's employment by Cotecna, which could have resolved outstanding questions and conflicts. The IIC investigation found that Kojo Annan intentionally deceived his father about his financial relationship with Cotecna and failed to fully cooperate with the investigation. Cotecna executives also made false statements to the public and the UN. Two IIC investigators resigned in protest over the final report on Secretary General Annan's role in the OFFP scandal. Parton's draft versions of the report were more critical of the Secretary General than the final IIC report. He was subpoenaed by multiple committees, but compliance was delayed due to court rulings. The House Committee on International Relations reviewed documents, including minutes from meetings debating Secretary General Annan's role in the Cotecna contract. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released documents showing payments from Iraqi officials to a Saybolt employee, Armando Carlos Oliveira, for falsifying shipping documents at Mina Al Bakr. Saybolt executives investigated the bribery allegation and promised to take appropriate action. Senator Norm Coleman praised Saybolt for being cooperative during the investigation. The IIC's final report confirmed that Mr. Oliveira accepted a bribe and allowed illicit oil loading. A GAO review found deficiencies in the management and internal controls of the U.N. OFFP, including lack of oversight and accountability by primary contractors. The Internal Audit Division of the U.N.'s Office of Internal Oversight Services had inadequate resources, forcing them to seek funds from OFFP management. The IAD faced funding and authority limitations, hindering their examination of key elements in oil and humanitarian contracts, potentially uncovering kickback schemes by Saddam Hussein's regime. A GAO report in March 2005 also noted constraints on internal auditors, preventing them from reporting on problems in the OFFP. The IIC report revealed that Iraq earned $1.8 billion illicitly through surcharges on oil sales and kickbacks on humanitarian and commercial contracts from June 2000 to March 2003. Iraq earned $265.3 million in surcharges on 1.117 billion barrels of oil from June 2000 to March 2003. They also collected $228.8 million from 139 companies who paid surcharges on their oil contracts. Additionally, Iraq made $1.583 billion through a kickback scheme on humanitarian and commercial goods contracts approved by the OFFP from late 2000 to March 2003. The kickback scheme in Iraq involved complex arrangements with suppliers, resulting in $1.583 billion in profits from 2000 to 2003. Suppliers delivered poorer quality goods without notifying officials, leading to second-quality humanitarian goods for the Iraqi people. 2,253 out of 3,614 companies paid kickbacks or delivered substandard goods. The Security Council addressed the issue of Iraq imposing surcharges on oil sales, which were considered illicit revenue. Some members of the Sanctions Committee proposed limiting Iraq's oil buyers to major international firms to prevent smaller traders from paying the surcharge. U.S. major oil companies were reported to have bought Iraqi oil from these smaller traders, raising concerns about countries seeking to ease sanctions on Iraq. Some U.N. member states hesitated to agree on proposed mechanisms to ease sanctions on Iraq. The Security Council implemented retroactive pricing for oil sales in September 2001, leading to a 25% reduction in Iraq's oil sales. Despite this, sales rebounded to previous levels by September 2002. Iraq occasionally halted oil sales to protest Security Council policies or challenge the U.S. and its allies, such as suspending sales in April 2002 in protest against Israel's actions. Iraq had the authority to choose the entities to which it sold oil under a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations. Iraq was granted the power to choose entities for oil sales and purchases of goods under the OFFP. The government created a clandestine oil allocation system, granting allocations to influential individuals and entities. Saddam Hussein personally selected oil buyers and providers. Iraq allocated oil vouchers based on 4.53 billion barrels but only utilized 3.43 billion barrels. The Duelfer report categorized oil allocation recipients into three groups: traditional oil companies, personalities and parties including Benon Sevan, and the Russian state. Some recipients were able to profit from oil surcharges, and some contracts were never lifted, potentially leaving some recipients without their allocated oil. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in May 2005 alleged that prominent international political figures, including Russian official Vladimir Zhirinovsky, received oil vouchers from the Saddam Hussein regime. Houston-based U.S. firm Bayoil acted as a conduit between Saddam Hussein and Zhirinovsky by purchasing oil and paying surcharges to Iraqi authorities. An indictment filed against Bayoil executives in April 2004 claimed they knowingly paid surcharges to Iraq and manipulated oil market data provided to U.N. officials. Members of the Russian Presidential Council, former French Minister Charles Pasqua, and British Member of Parliament were also implicated. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations alleged that political figures like Charles Pasqua and George Galloway participated in Iraq's oil voucher program. Pasqua and Galloway denied the allegations. Benon Sevan, former Executive Director of the Office of Iraq Program at the United Nations, was also implicated in profiting from the sale of Iraqi oil. French authorities are investigating the allegations against Pasqua and other French nationals. Benon Sevan, former Executive Director of the Office of Iraq Program at the United Nations, solicited and received oil allocations for African Middle East Petroleum Co. Ltd [AMEP]. The IIC's reports found that Sevan compromised his position by benefiting from Iraqi oil allocations, leading to his resignation in February 2005. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan waived Sevan's diplomatic immunity, and he was indicted in January 2007. In February 2005, Benon Sevan resigned from his U.N. position in Cyprus due to his involvement in receiving oil allocations. He was indicted in New York in January 2007 on bribery and fraud charges. Despite evidence of Jordan and Turkey violating U.N. sanctions by purchasing Iraqi oil, U.S. administrations provided foreign assistance to both countries from FY1994 to FY2003. Iraq's illicit oil sales to Turkey and Jordan generated $6.74 billion for Saddam Hussein's regime. The State Department's memoranda to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations explained the importance of U.S. foreign assistance to Jordan and Turkey, supporting bilateral relationships with those countries. The memoranda did not include estimates of Iraq's illicit oil sales or the possible uses of the revenue by Saddam Hussein's regime, which could have provided a more complete understanding of the costs of continuing assistance to countries violating U.N. sanctions. In reforming congressional oversight of U.S. sanctions policy, Members may consider adding specific reporting requirements to Presidential waiver authority provisions. Bills in the 109th Congress addressed allegations of oil-for-food program abuse and the IIC investigation, including S. 291, the United Nations Oil-for-Food Accountability Act of 2005, which proposed reductions in U.S. contributions to the United Nations unless cooperation with U.S. inquiries was certified. Legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 4369) aimed to withhold $100 million in U.S. contributions to the United Nations annually until the Secretary of State ensured that the unedited archives of the IIC were transferred to a non-UN entity and made accessible to the public for five years. The United Nations Reform Act of 2005 (H.R. 2745) proposed tying future U.S. financial contributions to the UN to the creation of an Independent Oversight Board to review the IIC's findings and identify areas for further investigation. H.R. 2745 was passed in the House on June 17, 2006 (Roll no. 282) with companion legislation introduced in the Senate (S. 1394)."
