    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program is established to provide funding to approved relative caregivers for in-home care of children ineligible for AFDC-FC payments, matching the amount paid for eligible children. Counties can choose to participate, agreeing to the program terms. Funding is intended to be appropriated annually from January to December. Effective January 1, 2015, participating counties pay approved relative caregivers a monthly rate equal to foster care providers' basic rate for caring for a child meeting specific requirements in California. Counties must notify the department by October 1 to participate in the program. Until January 1, 2020, participating counties will pay approved relative caregivers an annual clothing allowance of $240 for each eligible child, for up to three years. Any income or benefits received by the child or caregiver that would offset the basic foster care rate will be deducted from non-CalWORKs funds provided to the caregiver. Participating counties recoup overpayments in the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program using applicable standards. Collected overpaid funds are remitted to the state after deducting county share of CalWORKs portion and other county funds included in the payment. The county must notify the department in writing of its decision to participate in the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program by October 1 each year to be eligible. Failure to do so without good cause will prevent the county from participating in the program for the upcoming calendar year. The county must confirm making monthly payments to approved relative caregivers for eligible children as specified. The county is responsible for additional costs if state and federal funds are insufficient for payments. A county opting out of the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program must give 120 days' notice to the department and 90 days' notice to caregivers about payment reductions. The department presumes counties opt out of the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program if funding is reduced below a specified amount, unless a county notifies within 60 days. Counties must give 90 days' notice to caregivers about payment reductions. The Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program allows for funding to be used from regional CalWORKs grants, General Fund resources, and county funds as needed. Any payment reductions due to a county's decision to not participate in the program are exempt from state hearing jurisdiction. Funding is intended to fully support approved relative caregivers who are caring for children not eligible for AFDC-FC payments. The General Fund appropriates $15,000,000 for January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2015. From July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, an amount is allocated based on various factors including CalWORKs funding adjustments and foster care provider rate increases. For each 12-month period starting from July 1, 2016, the General Fund appropriates funds for CalWORKs based on previous allocations, adjustments for base caseload, and increases in foster care provider rates. The General Fund appropriation for CalWORKs must be at least $30 million or two times the amount appropriated in subparagraph (A). If the appropriation in subparagraph (A) is insufficient to fund the base caseload of approved relative caregivers, it will be increased to fully fund the caseload for a specific period. Funds for the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program are allocated to counties based on the number of approved caregiver placements. If funds are not fully utilized, counties can request reimbursement from the department. An approved relative caregiver receiving payments from the Approved Relative Caregiver Funding Option Program cannot receive additional CalWORKs payments for the same child. Payments from the program are not considered income for determining other public benefits. Prior to referral to the local child support agency, the county human services agency must determine if an applicant or recipient has good cause for noncooperation. If good cause is claimed, child support services will be suspended until the claim is determined. The local child support agency will take necessary measures to protect the applicant or recipient and their children. If a parent fails to cooperate without good cause, their family grant will be reduced by 25 percent. The county human services agency must determine if referring a child support case is in the best interest of the child, considering if it will hinder reunification efforts or compromise the parent's ability to meet the child's financial needs. No appropriation shall be made for implementing this act under Section 15200 of the Welfare and Institutions Code."
