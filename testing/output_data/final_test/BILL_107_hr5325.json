    "content": "The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" is also known as the \"Second Opinion Coverage Act.\" It amends the Public Health Service Act to include coverage of second opinions in group health plans. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" requires group health plans to provide or authorize a second opinion by a qualified healthcare professional when requested by a participant, beneficiary, or healthcare provider. Reasons for a second opinion include questioning the reasonableness of surgical procedures or a diagnosis threatening loss of life or bodily function. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" mandates group health plans to offer a second opinion by a qualified healthcare professional when requested. Reasons for seeking a second opinion include unclear clinical indications, ineffective treatment plans, and difficulty in diagnosing a condition. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" requires group health plans to provide a second opinion from a qualified healthcare professional promptly upon request. An appropriately qualified health care professional is defined as a primary care physician or specialist with relevant clinical background and expertise. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" mandates timely provision of second opinions for individuals facing imminent health threats, with a maximum 72-hour response time. Plans must establish response timelines for emergency cases within 90 days of enactment, and update them within 30 days of any changes, available to the public upon request. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" requires group health plans to provide timely second opinions for participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees upon request. The individual is responsible for copayments, and if seeking a second opinion from a specialist, it must be provided by a qualified healthcare professional within the same physician organization. The \"Second Opinion Coverage Act of 2002\" mandates group health plans to offer timely second opinions from specialists of the individual's choice within the network. If no suitable provider is available, the plan must cover the cost or negotiate fees for the second opinion. If unauthorized, the enrollee is responsible for additional opinions. The plan or issuer must authorize a second opinion from a qualified health professional outside of their network, taking into account the participant's ability to travel. The second opinion provider must provide a consultation report with recommendations, and the plan can authorize additional medical opinions independently. The plan or issuer must notify the participant of denial for a second opinion and provide information on filing a grievance. Services must be obtained from participating providers unless authorized by the plan. Referrals may be limited to the plan's network of providers. The section specifies that health care plans with preferred provider contracts are exempt from certain requirements if access to second opinions is not limited. Additionally, group health plans must comply with notice requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act are also mentioned. Amendments to ERISA include adding a new section to Subpart B of part 7 of title I, exempting health care plans with preferred provider contracts from certain requirements if second opinions are not limited. Group health plans must comply with notice requirements under ERISA. \"SEC. 714. COVERAGE OF SECOND OPINIONS.\" Section 714 of the Act amends section 731(c) by including sections 711 and 714. The provisions of section 2707 apply to group health plans and insurance coverage in the same manner as if included in this subsection. The requirement is considered a material modification in the plan, with notice to be provided within 60 days of the first plan year. Section 732(a) of the Act is amended by including sections 711 and 714. The table of contents is also amended to include a new item after section 713. \"Sec. 714. Coverage of second opinions. Internal Revenue Code amendments include a new section 9813 for coverage of second opinions.\" \"Section 9813 of the Public Health Service Act requires coverage of second opinions. Section 4980D(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include this requirement. A new section 2753 is added to provide coverage of second opinions for individual health insurance under Part B of title XXVII.\" In general, section 2707 applies to health insurance coverage in the individual market as it does in the group health plan market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to those under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Section 2762(b)(2) is amended to include additional sections. Effective dates apply to group health plans and insurance. Effective dates for the amendments apply to group health plans starting on or after January 1, 2003, and to individual health insurance coverage on or after that date. There is an exception for group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment of the Act. The coordination of administration among the Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services is ensured through an interagency memorandum of understanding. Plan terminations are determined based on the date of the last collective bargaining agreements or January 1, 2003, with exceptions for plan amendments made to conform to new requirements. The memorandum of understanding ensures coordination among the Secretaries of Labor, Treasury, and Health and Human Services for regulations and enforcement policies to have the same effect and avoid duplication of efforts."
