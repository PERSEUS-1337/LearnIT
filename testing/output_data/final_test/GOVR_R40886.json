    "content": "Health care reform is a top priority for the 111th Congress due to concerns about the uninsured and rising health care costs. Improving access and controlling costs will require changes to financing and delivery. Experts highlight the system's failure to consistently provide high-quality care. The National Priorities Partnership identified four major challenges, including improving patient safety and eradicating disparities in care. The challenges in healthcare include reducing disparities in care for racial and ethnic minorities and low-income groups, addressing chronic diseases that affect a large portion of the population, and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care that drives up costs. The Institute of Medicine estimates that a significant portion of healthcare spending is wasted on unnecessary and unsafe care. Various proposals have been made to improve healthcare delivery and address these challenges. Healthcare delivery reform proposals aim to promote healthier lifestyles and change disease management by expanding the primary care workforce, encouraging preventive services, and enhancing chronic care management. The current system prioritizes specialty care over primary care, leading to fragmented care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Care coordination is crucial to avoid waste and ensure appropriate use of medications and therapies. Health workforce policy is a key component of healthcare reform, focusing on transforming the delivery system to prioritize primary care, disease prevention, and chronic illness management. Concerns about a future physician shortage exist, but simply adding more physicians may not improve accessibility or quality of care. Physician supply varies across the country based on physician preferences rather than patient need. Health policy analysts recommend training more primary care physicians and developing integrated care systems to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. Clinical preventive services, such as immunizations and screening tests, are key in reducing healthcare costs and improving health. The concept of a medical home, involving partnerships between patients and primary care physicians, aims to improve care quality and coordination across different settings and types of care. Disease management programs, focused on specific conditions like diabetes, help patients manage their own care through education, monitoring symptoms, and following treatment plans. These programs share similarities with the medical home model. Health care delivery reform requires mechanisms like performance measurement, public dissemination of performance information, HIT adoption, and alignment of payment incentives with high-quality care. Providers need financial incentives to improve care quality. Providers are paid based on the volume of billable services, rather than the value or quality of care they provide. Public and private payers are increasingly linking payments to performance on quality measures. Policymakers aim to expand pay-for-performance initiatives to incentivize changes in the health care delivery system. The use of performance measures to track care quality is growing, but concerns about data development and use persist. Public reporting of quality information is crucial for informed patient choices. Congress took a step towards health care delivery reform with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, which included funding for biomedical research. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 included $17 billion for biomedical research and health-related programs, with $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research. It also incorporated the HITECH Act to promote the adoption of Health Information Technology (HIT) for electronic sharing of clinical data. $2 billion was allocated for HIT grant programs. HIT is essential for health care reform, including interoperable electronic health records and computerized systems for ordering tests and medications. The promise of Health Information Technology (HIT) lies in its potential to overhaul the delivery of care by enabling providers to render care more efficiently, improve quality by identifying harmful drug interactions, and provide large amounts of clinical data for research and performance measurement. Senator Max Baucus introduced a comprehensive plan on October 19, 2009 to support HIT development and the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers. Senator Max Baucus introduced the America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, a comprehensive health care reform bill aimed at improving quality and efficiency in health care. The bill includes provisions for private health insurance, prevention and wellness, quality measurement, transparency in Medicare, fraud prevention, and revenue raising. The report summarizes workforce, quality, prevention, and other provisions in Titles I, II, III, IV, and VI of S. 1796, grouping them under various headings such as health workforce, care quality, information technology, prevention, maternal and child health services, disparities, emergency care, veterans' health, elder justice, and miscellaneous. Background on current law is provided for context, with references to the Secretary of HHS. A companion report summarizes similar provisions in the Affordable Health Choices Act. The curr_chunk discusses Medicare payments for graduate medical education in teaching hospitals, including direct and indirect payments. DGME payments cover residency training costs, while IME payments compensate for higher patient care costs in teaching hospitals. Medicare payments for graduate medical education in teaching hospitals, including direct and indirect payments, compensate for higher patient care costs and residency training costs. In 2008, Medicare paid an estimated $9 billion to over 1,100 teaching hospitals to educate and train around 90,000 residents, equivalent to about $100,000 per resident. Medicare GME payments are seen as crucial for shaping health workforce policy by linking subsidies to delivery system reform and encouraging training of generalists. Medicare caps resident positions for GME payments at 1996 levels, but a 2003 act allowed redistribution of unused positions. Medicare does not dictate the type of resident physicians trained or link GME payments to specific goals. Medicare GME payments are not tied to specific goals in medical education, allowing teaching hospitals to receive payments for residents rotating in non-hospital settings if certain criteria are met. Time spent in non-patient care activities at non-hospital sites is not included in payment calculations. Jointly operated residency programs cannot include time spent by residents at non-hospital sites if costs are only incurred for a portion of the residents. Regulatory requirements discourage rotations in certain situations. S. 1796 aims to address the imbalance in residency programs by establishing criteria to reduce resident limits for hospitals with unused positions and redistributing them to other qualifying facilities, exempting rural hospitals with fewer than 250 beds from this redistribution. The bill aims to redistribute residency positions to address program imbalances, exempting rural hospitals with fewer than 250 beds. Hospitals qualifying for increased positions must maintain base primary care residents and allocate 75% to primary care or general surgery. Allocation factors include filling speed, participation in innovative care models, and criteria for qualifying facilities. The section addresses the redistribution of residency positions, exempting rural hospitals with fewer than 250 beds. It establishes criteria for calculating DGME and IME payments, requiring all resident time to be counted towards payments, with specific requirements for patient care activities in non-hospital settings. Medicare would count non-patient care activities in non-hospital settings towards DGME payments, including resident leave time. IME payments would also consider resident time in hospital settings for certain activities. The section directs the Secretary to establish a process for redistributing medical residency slots. The bill aims to redistribute medical residency slots from closing hospitals to increase residency limits for other hospitals, prioritizing those in the same area. It also includes provisions for a national workforce strategy, funding for health workforce projects, teaching health centers, and Medicare payment adjustments. The bill includes provisions for a national workforce strategy, funding for health workforce projects, teaching health centers, and Medicare payment adjustments. It requires the establishment of a Workforce Advisory Committee to develop a strategy for recruiting, training, and retaining a healthcare workforce to meet the country's healthcare needs. The bill includes provisions for a national workforce strategy to address health care needs in the United States. It establishes a Workforce Advisory Committee to develop recommendations for legislation and administrative action. Additionally, it introduces two demonstration projects to address health professions workforce needs. The bill includes provisions for two demonstration projects aimed at addressing health professions workforce needs. The first project would provide education and training opportunities in the health care field for low-income individuals, while the second project focuses on developing training competencies for personal or home care aides. $85 million would be appropriated for these projects for FYs 2010 through 2014. The bill includes provisions for two demonstration projects addressing health professions workforce needs. The second project would amend SSA Sec. 501(c)(1)(A)(iii) to appropriate $5 million for FYs 2009 through 2012 for family-to-family health information centers. Additionally, a new section would authorize grants to teaching health centers under Title VII, Part C of the PHSA. The bill includes provisions for grants to teaching health centers to establish primary care residency programs, with a maximum award of $500,000 for two years. Priority would be given to programs at federally Qualified Health Centers, Rural Health Centers, Indian health centers, and residencies focused on rural and underserved practice. Funding would also prioritize programs with an affiliation agreement with an Area Health Education Center. Funding amounts would be $25 million for FY2010, $50 million for FY2011 and FY2012, and SSAN for subsequent years. The bill includes provisions to amend PHSA Sec. 338C(a) allowing up to 50% of teaching time to count as full-time service for NHSC obligations. It also amends Medicare statute to make payments to teaching health centers for graduate medical education costs. The Secretary would establish a program for medical residency training programs, determining payment basis and funding calculations. $230 million would be transferred from the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for fiscal years 2011 to 2015. Additionally, a graduate nurse education demonstration program in Medicare would be established, providing reimbursement for educational and clinical instruction costs to eligible hospitals. Medicare would reimburse advanced practice nurses for training costs, including clinical instruction and other related expenses. Training would focus on primary care, preventative care, chronic care management, and other nursing services for Medicare-eligible individuals. Clinical training would primarily take place in non-hospital community-based settings, with waivers available for hospitals in rural or underserved areas. Payment would be capped at the cost of training for increasing the number of advanced practice nurses. The government would allocate $50 million annually from 2012 to 2015 to cover training costs for advanced practice nurses in qualified programs. Stakeholders are working on improving healthcare quality by refining metrics, reporting quality performance, and implementing value-based payment policies. Efforts to improve healthcare quality include using metrics for payment policies and provider accountability. S. 1796 addresses quality measurement, comparative effectiveness research, and Medicare/Medicaid nursing homes. Current law lacks national priorities for performance improvement, but the Secretary must contract with a consensus-based entity for various duties. AHRQ has statutory authorities to develop quality measures and promote healthcare quality improvement through research. They are responsible for developing, testing, and disseminating quality measures, including health and functional outcomes. Current law does not require multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures. S. 1796 proposes a process for multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures for CMS programs like PQRI and RHQDAPU. It includes sections for a national quality improvement strategy, an interagency working group, a repertoire of quality measures, and formal endorsement and implementation procedures. The national quality improvement strategy proposed in S. 1796 aims to establish national priorities for improvement and a strategic plan to achieve them. The Secretary must ensure that these priorities address goals such as reducing health disparities and improving federal payment policy. Recommendations from consensus-based entities and the Interagency Coordinating Working Group on Health Care Quality will be considered in identifying these priorities. The strategic plan will include provisions for coordination among HHS agencies, agency-specific plans, and annual benchmarks. The national quality improvement strategy proposed in S. 1796 aims to establish national priorities for improvement and a strategic plan to achieve them. The Secretary would update the national strategy not less than triennially and the first report would be due to Congress not later than December 31, 2010. The Secretary would create an Internet website to make public information regarding the national priorities for health care quality improvement. The section requires the President to convene a working group of federal representatives to collaborate on developing strategies for health care quality improvement. The Working Group, chaired by the Secretary, would submit annual progress reports to Congress and make recommendations publicly available. The Working Group, chaired by the Secretary, would facilitate quality measure development by identifying gaps and awarding grants to develop measures. The Secretary would prioritize measures assessing certain characteristics. Entities eligible for grants or contracts under this section must demonstrate expertise in developing and evaluating quality measures, consider input from payers and providers, and ensure measures are free and publicly available. The Secretary can use funds to update and test quality measures endorsed by a consensus-based entity. Authorization for appropriations is set at $75. The section authorizes $75 million for fiscal years 2010-2014 for a new Quality Measure Endorsement program under Title XVIII of the SSA. A qualified entity will identify gaps in quality measures, update endorsed measures, and recommend national priorities for performance improvement to the Secretary. The entity will evaluate evidence, convene stakeholder groups, and provide reports on gaps and areas with insufficient evidence for quality measure endorsement. The Quality Measure Endorsement program under Title XVIII of the SSA authorizes $75 million for fiscal years 2010-2014. A qualified entity will recommend national priorities for performance improvement to the Secretary and provide guidance on selecting measures for public reporting or federal health programs. The Secretary must establish a pre-rulemaking process to obtain input on measure selection, with the entity transmitting guidance to the Secretary annually. The Secretary can use endorsed quality measures after considering guidance from multi-stakeholder groups. For non-endorsed measures, the Secretary can use them if they are submitted for endorsement and go through a consultation process. The Secretary must review quality measures every three years to decide whether to continue using them. The Secretary can use quality measures endorsed by multi-stakeholder groups and establish a process to disseminate them to workforce programs and training curricula. Technical assistance will be provided to providers required to report on measures under Title XVIII of the SSA, with funding transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. The ARRA allocated $1.1 billion for comparative effectiveness research and established the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research. S. 1796 proposes creating a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to improve clinical evidence for informed health decisions. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute aims to enhance clinical evidence through research and evidence synthesis. Its 15-member Board, appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General, includes representatives from various healthcare sectors. The Institute can collaborate with federal agencies and private research entities, appoint expert advisory panels, and establish a methodology committee to develop and improve research methods. The methodology committee of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute is responsible for developing and improving research methods, establishing standards for clinical outcomes measures, risk-adjustment, and other aspects of research. It would also contract with the IOM to examine methods for assessing and comparing aspects of health care delivery systems in a scientifically valid and standardized way. The Institute would disseminate research findings to clinicians, patients, and the public in a useful manner for making healthcare decisions. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute would be prohibited from disseminating practice guidelines, coverage recommendations, or policy recommendations. The Secretary would not deny coverage based solely on the Institute's research. A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund would be created to fund the Institute's activities. Funding would come from various sources including Medicare Trust Funds and fees levied on beneficiaries. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute would receive funding from various sources, including Medicare Trust Funds and fees on insured and self-insured health plans. The FCCCER would have additional responsibilities in supporting the Institute and coordinating with them. Accountability requirements for Medicare certified skilled nursing facilities and Medicaid certified nursing facilities would be enhanced. The changes in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and Medicaid certified nursing facilities (NFs) would require additional information on ownership, staff compliance training, and ethics programs. The Secretary would establish new requirements for compliance and ethics programs, enhance information on the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website, and develop wage and benefit reporting requirements. Additionally, a standardized complaint form for facilities would be created. The Secretary would develop a new standardized complaint form for SNFs and NFs, require electronic reporting of staffing information, conduct a study on the Five-Star rating system, establish civil money penalties for quality of care issues, and implement a national monitoring program for large SNF and NF chains. The Secretary would establish new requirements for SNF and NF administrators to inform residents and stakeholders of planned facility closures. Demonstration projects on culture change and information technology in SNFs and NFs would be conducted. Nurse aide training requirements would be revised to include dementia and abuse prevention. A nationwide program for background checks on direct patient access employees of LTC facilities would be established. The nationwide program for background checks on direct patient access employees of LTC facilities would be established, with the Secretary required to enter agreements with participating states. Certain LTC providers would need to obtain state and national criminal history background checks on prospective employees. The Secretary of the Treasury would transfer funds to HHS for a nationwide program for background checks on LTC facility employees. The HITECH Act incentivizes the use of certified EHR systems through bonus payments for eligible professionals and hospitals. The HITECH Act incentivizes the use of certified EHR systems for exchanging clinical information and reporting quality measures. Eligible professionals for Medicare incentives include physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, and chiropractors. For Medicaid incentives, eligible professionals include non-hospital physicians, dentists, nurse mid-wives, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, FQHCs, and rural health clinics with specific patient volume criteria. The HITECH Act incentivizes the use of certified EHR systems for healthcare providers. S. 1796 proposes EHR provisions to extend incentives to free clinics and study methods to encourage EHR use among providers. The proposed legislation would amend the eligibility criteria for Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentives to include healthcare professionals working in free clinics. Additionally, it aims to promote electronic record keeping and claims processing in the healthcare system. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandated standards for electronic health care transactions between providers and plans, including claims and payment advice. A final rule in 2000 adopted existing standards for most transactions. Updated versions of these standards were published in 2009. The compliance deadline for adopting updated HIPAA electronic transactions standards is January 1, 2012. The health care payment and remittance advice transaction (ASC X12 835) can accommodate electronic funds transfer (EFT) for payment. While EFT is common in the health care sector, there is no federal mandate for Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurance. Providers are not mandated to conduct transactions electronically, but health plans increasingly require it for compliance with HIPAA standards. The Administrative Simplification Compliance Act of 2001 mandated Medicare claims to be submitted electronically in the HIPAA standard format, with exceptions for small providers. Unique identifiers for providers and employers have been adopted, while the health plan identifier is still under review. Congress has blocked the development of a unique individual identifier. This section aims to establish a timeline for consensus-based operating rules for each HIPAA transaction. The section aims to establish consensus-based operating rules for HIPAA transactions, including EFT for health claims payment, with deadlines for adoption and enforcement. Operating rules are defined as necessary business guidelines for electronic information exchange, relying on recommendations from a non-profit entity. The Secretary must adopt operating rules for remaining HIPAA transactions by July 1, 2014, to take effect by January 1, 2016. A committee will review and provide recommendations for updating HIPAA standards biennially. Health plans must certify compliance with current standards by December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2015. The Secretary must ensure that health plans comply with current standards and operating rules for HIPAA transactions. An outside entity may verify compliance, with the Secretary conducting audits. Penalty fees will be assessed for non-compliance, collected by the Secretary of the Treasury. Unpaid fees will accrue interest and be considered debts owed to federal agencies. The section would amend SSA Sec. 1862(a) to require Medicare payments to be made electronically by January 1, 2014. It also mandates a report to Congress on electronic transactions in Medicare and Medicaid by July 1, 2013. Additionally, a unique health plan identifier rule must be established by the Secretary, with an interim final rule effective no later than October 1, 2012. Prevention interventions, including clinical and community services, can improve patient and population health. Medicare and Medicaid cover various preventive services. Clinical preventive services may not result in cost savings but rather a net cost. Current law supports evidence review processes for prevention interventions and covers certain services under Medicare and Medicaid. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force assesses the effectiveness of clinical preventive services and makes evidence-based recommendations. Beneficiary cost-sharing can impact the utilization of preventive services, with reduced costs recommended for screening mammography. Medicare and Medicaid cover certain preventive services to improve patient and population health. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provides evidence-based recommendations for preventive services, with ratings ranging from A to I. Medicare covers services for diagnosis and treatment of illness, while coverage of preventive services typically requires legislation. Medicare Part B and Medicare Advantage provide coverage for preventive services outlined in the SSA. The USPSTF recommendations play a role in adding coverage for additional preventive services under MIPPA. Medicare covers preventive services recommended by the USPSTF with applicable cost-sharing. The Secretary can't modify criteria for coverage but can add services. Medicare also includes an initial preventive physical examination (IPPE) for health promotion and disease detection within one year of Part B enrollment. Routine health examinations are not covered. Medicare covers preventive services with cost-sharing, including vaccines like influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B. The beneficiary is responsible for coinsurance and an annual deductible, which may be waived for some preventive services. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 expanded coverage for other vaccines under Part D. Medicare Advantage plans cover all services under traditional Medicare and may offer additional coverage, including preventive services not covered by traditional Medicare. Cost sharing in MA plans is generally lower, with more services covered, offset by beneficiary premiums and plan savings. Cost sharing per enrollee for covered services cannot exceed the actuarial value of deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments under traditional Medicare. While the aggregate cost sharing in an MA plan must equal traditional Medicare, the plan may set different amounts. Beginning in 2011, Medicare would cover personalized prevention plan services, including a comprehensive health risk assessment, under Part B. The plan may set different amounts for specific services, such as lower deductibles for hospital inpatient services or waived co-payments for preventive services. The personalized plan includes elements like medical history review, screening schedules, identified risk factors, medication lists, and provider information. Optional elements could include testing and treatment for chronic conditions, cognitive impairment assessment, and referrals for services recommended by the USPSTF. Medicare would cover personalized prevention plan services, including a comprehensive health risk assessment, under Part B. Enrolled beneficiaries are eligible for personalized prevention plan services once a year without cost sharing. During the first year of Part B enrollment, beneficiaries could receive either the IPPE or personalized prevention plan services, but not both. The Secretary would develop guidance and conduct outreach for personalized prevention plan services and health risk assessments. Preventive services covered by Medicare include colorectal cancer screening services. Medicare would cover personalized prevention plan services, including a comprehensive health risk assessment, under Part B without cost sharing. The coverage would also include colorectal cancer screening services and waive beneficiary coinsurance requirements for most preventive services, with Medicare covering 100% of the costs. The section authorizes the Secretary to modify coverage of preventive services recommended by USPSTF, waive deductibles for certain preventive services, and prohibit payment for services graded D by USPSTF. It does not apply to services for diagnosis or treatment. The section appropriates funds for provider and beneficiary outreach programs on covered preventive services, a GAO study on Medicare preventive services utilization, and a study on vaccine coverage impact under Medicare Part D. It also mandates a Medicare demonstration project to test incentive programs for beneficiaries. A Medicare demonstration project is proposed to test incentive programs for beneficiaries aimed at reducing health risks associated with lifestyle choices. The project would focus on tobacco cessation, weight management, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes prevention, falls prevention, and other approaches as determined by the Secretary. $15 million would be appropriated annually to CMS for this program from 2010 to 2015, with funds remaining available until expended. Incentives provided to beneficiaries would not affect their eligibility for federal benefits. Medicaid covers \"well-child\" and preventive services for eligible children under 21 through EPSDT services. Family planning, pregnancy-related services, and optional screening services for eligible adults are also provided. These services include diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services recommended by a physician for physical or mental health. States have the option to cover tobacco cessation services and may establish nominal cost-sharing requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to apply higher premium and cost-sharing obligations to certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Specific groups like children, pregnant women, and individuals with special needs are exempt from these charges. Some groups, such as children, pregnant women, and individuals with special needs, are exempt from premium provisions and service-related cost-sharing under the DRA and traditional Medicaid. States can exclude coverage of certain drug classes under the optional Medicaid prescription drug benefit. Medicaid programs may cover tobacco cessation counseling for pregnant women. Starting in 2013, Medicaid can provide additional diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitation services, including clinical preventive services recommended by the USPSTF and immunizations for adults. States can elect to cover additional services and vaccines recommended by the USPSTF and ACIP for adults without cost-sharing to receive increased federal assistance. This includes counseling and drug therapy for tobacco cessation for pregnant women starting in October 2010. The text chunk discusses the coverage of tobacco cessation services for pregnant women under Medicaid, including counseling, drug therapy, and FDA-approved products. Cost-sharing for these services is prohibited, and states can receive grants to incentivize Medicaid beneficiaries to participate in cessation programs. The initiative aims to award grants to states for Medicaid beneficiaries to join programs promoting healthy lifestyles, managing cholesterol, blood pressure, weight loss, smoking cessation, and diabetes prevention. The program must be tailored to Medicaid beneficiaries' needs, address co-morbidities like depression, and test behavior modification approaches. $100 million would be allocated over five years starting in 2011, with the Secretary able to waive certain Medicaid requirements. Outreach, evaluation, and reporting requirements are also included. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 included provisions to improve care under Medicaid and CHIP, including a demonstration to reduce child obesity with a $25 million appropriation from FY2010 to FY2014. The Secretary would provide guidance to states and healthcare providers. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for states to provide information on preventive and obesity-related services to Medicaid enrollees, including screening and counseling. Employers and insurers are interested in reducing healthcare costs through wellness programs that incentivize healthy behaviors. Wellness programs offered by employers may be subject to federal laws such as HIPAA, ERISA, PHSA, and IRC. The curr_chunk discusses nondiscrimination requirements under HIPAA, ERISA, PHSA, and IRC for group health plans and insurance issuers. It clarifies that premium discounts and modifications are allowed for wellness programs. The curr_chunk explains the two categories of wellness programs under HIPAA regulations. The first category rewards participation without additional standards, while the second category requires meeting health standards for rewards. This section amends various regulations to allow rewards for meeting health standards in wellness programs. This section of the regulations addresses wellness programs that require individuals to meet health standards for rewards. The reward must be capped at 30% of the cost of employee-only coverage, with the possibility of increasing it to 50% at the discretion of the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury. The regulations address wellness programs that must promote health or prevent disease and comply with certain requirements. It includes a provision for a 10-state pilot program to apply wellness program provisions to health insurers in the individual market. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Treasury and the Secretary of Labor, would be required to submit a report to Congress on the Maternal and Child Health block grant program. This program allocates funding to states based on a formula for maternal and child health programs. States must report on activities and progress towards health indicators for comparison between states. Early childhood home visitation programs aim to improve maternal and child health, social, emotional, and cognitive development, and family functioning. Visitors, such as nurses or professionals, provide support in homes on a voluntary basis. Programs operate in all 50 states and may start during pregnancy or after birth, continuing until the child is two years old or enters kindergarten. The federal government supports early childhood home visitation programs through various funding sources like Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and others. A new provision would require states to conduct a needs assessment to receive MCH block grant funds for FY2011, identifying communities with risk factors for maternal and child health. The federal government supports early childhood home visitation programs through various funding sources like Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. A new provision would require states to conduct a needs assessment to receive MCH block grant funds for FY2011, identifying communities with risk factors for maternal and child health. The needs assessment would focus on poverty, crime, domestic violence, high drop-out rates, substance abuse, unemployment, and child maltreatment, as well as gaps in early childhood home visitation programs. It also aims to assess the state's capacity for providing substance abuse treatment and counseling services. Additionally, the provision instructs the Secretary to award competitive grants to support early childhood home visitation programs for improving maternal and child health and school readiness. Grantees would need to establish quantifiable benchmarks for measuring improvements in eligible families over three- and five-year periods. Grantees participating in the program must demonstrate improvement in specified areas or face grant termination. They must submit progress reports by December 31, 2014, and prioritize evidence-based service delivery models. Up to 25% of the award can fund new program models. The program requires grantees to prioritize services for at-risk families, maintain spending levels, and undergo evaluation by an expert panel. The Secretary must report on program activities by December 31, 2015. The section appropriates $1.5 billion for the home visitation grants program between FY2010 and FY2014. Funds will be used for improvement demonstration, technical assistance, and recommendations for further action. 3% of the funds will be allocated for research and evaluation, and 3% for home visitation services to Indian families. The funds will be available until September 30, 2014, and research types like epidemiology and clinical research are encouraged. The section discusses funding for home visitation grants program and emphasizes research on postpartum depression and related conditions. It suggests conducting a longitudinal study on the mental health consequences for women after resolving a pregnancy in various ways. Additionally, it proposes creating a new section for services to individuals with a postpartum condition and their families. The new section authorizes grants for eligible entities to establish systems for delivering services to individuals with postpartum conditions and their families. Grant funds can be used for education, outpatient services, inpatient care management, and improving healthcare and social services. Grantees must agree not to supplant existing funds or pay for services covered by other payers. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit private organizations, hospitals, and community-based organizations. The new section authorizes grants for eligible entities to establish systems for delivering services to individuals with postpartum conditions and their families, including education, outpatient services, inpatient care management, and improving healthcare and social services. Grantees must not duplicate any other HHS activities or programs. Additionally, PHSA Title XX allows for voluntary teen pregnancy prevention and counseling programs through demonstration grants to public or nonprofit private entities. The PHSA Title X authorizes grants for family planning services, education, and research. PHSA Sections 318 and 318A provide grants for services to address sexually-transmitted diseases in women. SSA Sec. 510 supports abstinence education programs through state formula grants. States must match funds for teaching abstinence to low-income children. Sec. 510 of the PHSA provides funding for abstinence education programs, requiring states to match federal funds. The program received $50 million annually for five years but has not been reauthorized. A new section, PHSA Sec. 513, would establish a grant program for evidence-based education on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation topics. Each state would receive funding based on a formula grant for FY2010 through FY2014. The funding allocation formula for healthy life skills under PHSA Sec. 513 would provide each state with an amount based on youth population size. States must apply for funds in FY2010 and FY2011 to be eligible for allocations from FY2010 through FY2014. Unexpended funds would be used to award grants to local organizations in FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. Faith-based organizations or consortia can apply for grants. The funds appropriated for PHSA Sec. 513 would be used for various purposes including grants for teen pregnancy prevention strategies, grants for Indian tribes, establishing a national resource center, research, training, and evaluation. $75 million would be allocated for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2014. Additionally, $50 million would be appropriated for abstinence education. The federal government allocated funds for various purposes under PHSA Sec. 513, including teen pregnancy prevention strategies, grants for Indian tribes, a national resource center, research, training, and evaluation. $50 million was specifically designated for abstinence education from FY2010 to FY2014. Federal initiatives like the National Healthcare Disparities Report and HealthyPeople 2010 rely on federally sponsored data, with the Office of Management and Budget issuing guidance on data collection and standards for race and ethnicity classification. The 1997 revised standards and 2000 provisional guidance set new data collection standards for race and ethnicity, including an ethnicity question and a five-category race item. Federal agencies were advised to adopt the standards by January 1, 2003 for various data collections. The guidance aimed to facilitate implementation and compare data collected under different standards. The 2000 OMB guidance addressed data collection standards for race and ethnicity, including categories for reporting purposes. The standards do not apply to state and municipal public health departments or Medicaid, but they do apply to CHIP with the option for waivers under special circumstances. CMS mandates reporting of primary language information for Medicaid. The CMS mandates reporting of primary language information for Medicaid beneficiaries, but not for CHIP enrollees. Data on access to care for disabled individuals is not required by current law for federal health care programs. Data on access to care for the disabled is collected in federally sponsored surveys, but analysis is limited by survey items and sample size. The Secretary would be required to establish procedures for collecting data on race, ethnicity, and sex. The Secretary must establish procedures to ensure data collection on race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language complies with OMB directives. Procedures for CMS Administrator to collect data on access to care for individuals with disabilities, including surveying healthcare providers. Employees trained in disability awareness and caring for patients with disabilities. Data collection efforts include measuring race, ethnicity, and subpopulations like those with disabilities. Sample surveys may not have sufficient size for reliable estimates for small subpopulations. Sample size affects the level of analysis and precision, with oversampling and combining data from multiple years used to improve estimates. The need for sample size is tied to the cost of data collection efforts. The Secretary is required to develop reports for Congress on best approaches for collecting disparities data under Medicare. Federally funded surveys must collect data on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability to compare health disparities. Quality reporting in federal health programs must include data on individuals by these factors. A new section on addressing health care disparities would be added to the SSA. The new SSA Sec. 1945 would require the Secretary to evaluate data collection methods for health care disparities, including protecting patient privacy and improving program data on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability. Reports on data collection methodologies and recommendations for identifying disparities under Medicaid and CHIP would be submitted. The new SSA Sec. 1945 requires the Secretary to evaluate data collection methods for health care disparities, including protecting patient privacy and improving program data on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability. Recommendations for improving the identification of health disparities for Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries would need to be implemented within 24 months. HHS is actively engaged in facilitating data sharing through various efforts. Several laws govern the privacy and protection of health data, such as the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act of 1974 and HIPAA protect individuals' health data by limiting disclosure without consent and setting security standards for electronic health information. OMB guidance under the E-Government Act also addresses confidentiality and data protection. The E-Government Act and CIPSEA establish policies for federal statistical collections and safeguarding confidential information. It requires sharing data on demographics and disabilities collected under health programs with federal and state agencies. PHSA Title XXVIII, Subtitle B created the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response within HHS. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) advises the HHS Secretary on bioterrorism and public health emergencies. The Emergency Care Coordination Center (ECCC) within ASPR coordinates efforts to improve emergency medical care delivery. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospital emergency departments to examine and treat individuals with emergency medical conditions or in labor. EMTALA mandates that hospital emergency departments must provide care to individuals with emergency medical conditions or in labor. It also prohibits discrimination and delays in treating emergency patients, with trauma care experts emphasizing the importance of the \"golden hour\" within the first 60 minutes after an injury. Trauma systems aim to provide access to trauma centers within this critical time frame to improve patient outcomes, although the distribution of trauma centers across states and regions varies widely. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a Working Group on Access to Emergency Medical Care, which would include representatives from various sectors to address barriers in timely patient admission and healthcare delivery systems. This initiative aims to improve access to trauma centers, especially in rural areas where access lags. The Working Group on Access to Emergency Medical Care aims to address barriers in healthcare delivery systems, improve patient flow in hospitals, and develop recommendations for admission standards. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest integrated health care delivery system in the nation. The VA health care system is a public system where the government owns facilities and employs providers. Eligibility is based on veteran status, disabilities, income, and other factors. Care can be provided by private providers under certain circumstances. Enrolled veterans receive a standard benefits package without paying premiums or fees. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay premiums or enrollment fees. Most veterans are required to pay copayments for nonservice-connected conditions, except those rated 50% or more service-connected disabled. VA may collect charges from third-party insurers for medical care. Nothing in the bill would prevent veterans from accessing quality health care from the VA. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs would conduct a study on the impact of certain sections in Title VI of S. 1796 on veterans' medical care costs and access to devices and drugs. Reports would be submitted to relevant committees by December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2015. Older individuals in domestic and institutional settings face abuse, neglect, and exploitation, with the exact number of victims unknown. Efforts to collect data on elder abuse at the national level face challenges due to varying state definitions and lack of a uniform reporting system. Independent research studies estimate that around 450,000 persons aged 60 or older experienced abuse or neglect in domestic settings in 1996. Congressional interest in addressing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation dates back to the 1960s, with hearings and reports highlighting the need for federal intervention. Reforms have included federal assistance to state Adult Protective Services programs and amendments to the Older Americans Act. The Elder Justice Act was introduced in 2002 to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at a national level, combining law enforcement, public health, and social services. Congress has enacted legislation for child abuse and domestic violence but not specifically for the elderly. The Elder Justice Act was introduced in 2002 by Senator John Breaux to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. Similar measures were introduced in subsequent Congresses, with provisions also included in the 2006 reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. In the 111th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2009, with key provisions summarized in the bill. The Elder Justice Act, introduced in 2002, addresses abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. The current section includes provisions amending Title XX of the SSA, protecting residents of long-term care facilities, and establishing a national nurse aide registry. It inserts new \"Elder Justice\" provisions under a new \"Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice\" subtitle, with two parts: \"National Coordination of Elder Justice Activities and Research\" and \"Programs to Promote Elder Justice.\" The proposed Title XX, Subtitle B, Part I would establish an Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation. Subpart A would include a new Sec. 2021 \"Elder Justice Coordinating Council\" chaired by the HHS Secretary and the Attorney General, along with heads of federal departments related to elder abuse. Subpart B would add a new Sec. 2025 awarding grants for forensic centers. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council would be responsible for administering programs related to elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It would make recommendations to coordinate activities of various agencies and submit reports to Congress every two years. An Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation would also be established to create a plan for the development of elder justice. Funding would be authorized for the Council's functions. The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation would create a multidisciplinary plan for the development of elder justice, focusing on prevention and improving the quality of long-term care. The Board would consist of 27 members with expertise in the field and would be authorized to appropriate funds for its functions. Additionally, a new section on \"Research Protections\" would be added for research purposes. The proposed legislation aims to establish guidelines for researchers working on elder abuse issues and allocate funds for the authorization of appropriations. It also includes provisions for the establishment and support of Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation Forensic Centers through grants awarded by the Secretary in consultation with the U.S. Attorney General. The legislation aims to establish and operate forensic centers for elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Funding would be authorized to develop forensic expertise, markers for abuse detection, and capacity building for healthcare professionals and law enforcement. Funding of $4 million in FY2011, $6 million in FY2012, and $8 million for each of FYs 2013 and 2014 is proposed for these activities. The proposed legislation aims to establish grant programs and activities to promote elder justice, including enhancing long-term care by providing incentives for direct care employees to seek training and certification. Grants would also be used to provide increased compensation or benefits to certified employees. The Secretary would award grants for training and technical assistance to promote retention and develop accountability measures to benefit direct care workers in LTC facilities. Grants would also assist in offsetting costs related to implementing certified EHR technology to improve patient safety. The Secretary would develop accountability measures to improve patient safety and reduce adverse events in LTC facilities by adopting electronic standards for clinical data exchange. Within 10 years, procedures for electronic submission of clinical data by LTC facilities must be in place. Regulations would be promulgated to implement these measures. The Secretary would promulgate regulations for LTC facilities to adopt standards for clinical data transactions. States receiving funds under Part B must conduct necessary data collection and reporting. $20 million for FY2011, $17.5 million for FY2012, and $15 million for each of FYs 2013 and 2014 would be authorized. Sec. 2042 focuses on Adult Protective Service Functions and Grant Program, ensuring funding for APS offices investigating elder abuse and disseminating data. The section focuses on Adult Protective Service Functions and Grant Program, providing funding for APS offices investigating elder abuse, disseminating data, conducting research, and offering training. It authorizes appropriations of $3 million for FY2011 and $4 million for each of FYs 2012-2014. Grants would be awarded to enhance APS programs and for demonstration programs, distributed based on the number of elderly individuals in each state. The section authorizes grants for APS programs to detect and prevent elder abuse, financial exploitation, and related training. It allocates minimum percentages of annual appropriations to states, DC, and territories. Grant awards can be used for testing training modules and methods for detecting abuse. $100 million is authorized for annual APS program grants and $25 million for demonstration grants for FYs 2011-2014. Sec. 2043. Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Grants and Training. Requires the Secretary to award grants to entities with expertise in abuse and neglect in LTC facilities to improve state LTC ombudsman programs. Authorizes appropriations of $5 million for FY2011, $7.5 million for FY2012, and $10 million for FYs 2013 and 2014. Establishes programs for ombudsman training on elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Authorizes $10 million for each of FYs 2011-2014. Sec. 2044. Provision of Information Regarding, and Evaluation of, Elder Justice Programs. Eligibility for grants under Part B requires providing information for evaluation and reserving funds for validated evaluations of funded activities. The Secretary must evaluate activities funded under the grant program and conduct appropriate audits. Reporting requirements are set forth, including assisting individuals seeking employment in LTC facilities. A report must be submitted to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and congressional committees, compiling state reports and recommendations for action. The SSA would be amended to include an option in a state's TANF plan to assist individuals in direct care employment in LTC facilities or elder care-related occupations. States adding this option must provide an overview of the assistance. The provision establishes a National Training Institute for Surveyors and grants to state survey agencies to improve training for surveyors investigating abuse, neglect, and property misappropriation in Medicare and Medicaid-funded LTC facilities. $12 million would be authorized for FYs 2011-2014 for these activities. Additionally, grants would be awarded to state survey agencies for designing and implementing complaint processes. The provision would authorize $5 million for each of FYs 2011-2014 to implement complaint investigation systems in Medicaid and/or Medicare participating facilities. It would also require reporting of crimes in federally funded LTC facilities receiving at least $10,000 annually, with owners or operators mandated to notify covered individuals to report any suspicion of a crime against a resident or individual receiving care. Suspected crimes must be reported to the Secretary and law enforcement entities. The provision mandates reporting of suspected crimes in federally funded LTC facilities, with penalties for failure to report. The Secretary can impose civil money penalties or exclude individuals or facilities from federal health care programs for non-compliance. Retaliation against employees for reporting is prohibited, with penalties for facilities that retaliate. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for LTC facilities to post employee rights, conduct a study on a national nurse aide registry, and submit a report to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. It also mentions that appropriate congressional committees would need to take action based on the study's recommendations. The section authorizes funding for a study not to exceed $500,000 and prohibits government entities from paying for services related to assisted suicide or euthanasia. It also prohibits discrimination against healthcare entities that do not provide such services. The HHS Office of Civil Rights would receive complaints of discrimination for not providing health care items or services for causing death. An annual fee would be imposed on certain entities for branded prescription drugs. This does not apply to withholding medical treatment, nutrition, abortion, or pain relief items. Covered entities would pay a total of $2.3 billion annually to the Secretary of the Treasury, which would be transferred to the Medicare Part B trust fund. Each entity's payment would be based on the proportion of their branded prescription drug sales for specified government programs compared to the total sales of all covered entities. Different percentages of sales would be taken into account based on the total sales amount. The Secretary of the Treasury would calculate the proportion to be paid by covered entities based on annual reports from HHS, Veterans Affairs, and Defense. Reports would include total branded prescription drug sales for Medicare Parts B and D, Medicaid, VA programs, and TRICARE. An annual fee of $4 billion would be imposed on certain medical device manufacturers and importers in the US, excluding sales of class II devices under $100 and class I devices. Covered entities would pay their share annually to the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury would calculate the proportion to be paid by covered entities based on their gross receipts from medical device sales. Entities with sales of not more than $5 million would not be taken into account, while those with sales of more than $25 million would have 100% of their sales taken into account. Penalties could be imposed for failure to submit required reports."
