    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Ia Drang Valley campaign in Vietnam from October 23 to November 26, 1965, involved intense battles between the US Army and North Vietnamese Army. The soldiers displayed exceptional heroism and bravery, deserving of recognition through appropriate decorations. One significant battle lasted 4 days from November 14 to November 18, 1965, marking the first battalion-sized Army engagement with the North Vietnamese Army regulars. The soldiers in the Ia Drang Valley campaign fought valiantly against an overwhelming force of North Vietnamese Army regulars. Historical literature from the early 1990s documents acts of heroism and bravery by US Army soldiers, many of whom were never officially recognized. Units suffered substantial losses, with some companies experiencing casualties exceeding 90 percent of their strength. The campaign in the Ia Drang Valley faced challenges in collecting detailed information for award recommendations due to restrictions in law and Army regulations. Requests for review of award recommendations were denied, hindering timely recognition of acts of heroism, sacrifice, and bravery by US military personnel. Restrictions hinder timely recognition of military personnel for acts of heroism, sacrifice, or bravery that are belatedly documented by witnesses. The Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign, defined by this Act, refers to military operations by the US Armed Forces in Vietnam from October 23, 1965, to November 26, 1965, including Army units' direct support. Waiver of restrictions aims to facilitate timely recognition of military personnel for acts of heroism, sacrifice, or bravery. The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the Army may award decorations to individuals for acts in the Ia Drang Valley (Pleiku) campaign while on active duty in the Army. This includes decorations authorized by Congress or the Department of Defense before the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. REVIEW OF AWARD RECOMMENDATIONS. The Secretary of the Army is required to review recommendations for awards within a specified time frame and report to Congress upon completion of the review. The Secretary of the Army reviews recommendations for awards within a set timeframe and reports to Congress. The report to Congress includes a summary of each recommendation, review findings, and the final action taken on each recommendation."
