A new regularization scheme is proposed to push the RNN towards a line attractor configuration for long short-term memory and slow time scales. This approach performs well on benchmarks like sequential MNIST and enables reconstruction of dynamical systems with different time scales. Recent advancements in machine and deep learning methodologies, particularly those based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), aim to retrieve generating dynamical equations directly from observed time series data. However, vanilla RNNs struggle with capturing long-term dependencies and slow time scales. Various solutions have been proposed to address these issues, such as initialization schemes and constraints on the recurrency matrix. Additionally, a new regularization scheme has been introduced to push RNNs towards a line attractor configuration, enabling better performance on benchmarks and reconstruction of dynamical systems with different time scales. In machine learning, RNNs face challenges in capturing long-term dependencies and slow time scales in data. Line attractor configurations are proposed to address this issue, enabling long-term maintenance of values. Special RNN architectures with gating mechanisms and memory cells are suggested solutions. Simplifying models for easier analysis and interpretation is also considered important. Recent solutions to the vanishing vs. exploding gradient problem in RNNs involve initializing or constraining the recurrent weight matrix to be identity, orthogonal, or unitary. These constraints aim to establish line attractor dimensions from the start or ensure their stability throughout training. However, mere initialization procedures may lead to unstable line attractors for many problems, while orthogonal or unitary constraints can be too restrictive. The constraints of initializing or constraining the recurrent weight matrix in RNNs aim to establish stable line attractor dimensions during training. However, orthogonal or unitary constraints may be too restrictive for reconstructing line attractors effectively. The text discusses the regulation of flow velocity within a tunnel until it reaches a stable fixed point at the intersection of nullclines. It also presents a 2-unit solution to an addition problem using ReLUs in the positive quadrant, emphasizing line attractor configurations in piecewise-linear RNNs. The text introduces a regularization method for ReLU-based RNNs to achieve line attractor configurations in state space. This approach outperforms LSTM on machine learning benchmarks and efficiently captures slow behavior in systems with different time scales. It addresses long-range dependency issues in RNNs by preventing error gradients from exploding or vanishing during training. RNNs tend to either converge to fixed points or diverge over time, leading to vanishing or exploding gradients. Gated memory cells have been designed to address this issue, but they are complex to analyze. Le et al. (2015) observed the challenges in this area. Initialization of recurrent weight matrices in RNNs has been a topic of interest in DS. Le et al. (2015) found that initializing the weight matrix to the identity in ReLU-based RNNs can match LSTM performance. Talathi & Vartak (2016) suggested initializing the matrix with a largest absolute eigenvalue of 1 for better computational freedom. Later work enforced orthogonal or unitary constraints on the matrix during training, showing superior long-term memory performance compared to LSTMs. RNNs with orthogonal recurrence matrix are limited in computational power compared to LSTMs. The approach is to establish line attractors in state space and implement regularization terms in loss functions to encourage desired dynamics during training. This differs from simply initializing the system for good performance. The underlying difference in data science reconstruction is that the model must reproduce attractor geometries independently. Previous work focused on inferring latent trajectories and ahead predictions, while others attempted to approximate the flow field using basis expansions or neural networks. Some approaches in data science reconstruction focus on estimating system's latent states and parameters, considering stochastic dynamics in biological systems like the brain. Fully probabilistic models for reconstruction based on neural networks may lack interpretability. In data science reconstruction, previous approaches using neural networks lack interpretability and do not address the long-range dependency problem. A latent RNN model is proposed to infer the underlying dynamic system from dense time series data, incorporating sparse experimental inputs or perturbations. The latent RNN model considered here is motivated by firing rate models in computational neuroscience. It involves membrane voltages, synaptic coupling among neurons, and a voltage-to-rate transfer function. By making specific parameter choices, a line attractor system can be achieved, potentially enhancing long short-term memory properties.

Specific parameter choices can lead to a line attractor system with enhanced long short-term memory properties. The system's fixed points can be solved analytically, and stability can be determined from the eigenvalues of the matrix. Additionally, a discrete piecewise-linear system can be transformed into an equivalent continuous-time system, making PLRNNs more amenable to rigorous DS analysis.

The observation model for real-valued and multi-categorical observations is initialized based on a neuroscientifically motivated network architecture, encouraging an identity mapping for a subset of units while stabilizing the configuration with specific L2 regularization. The latent RNN model introduces specific L2 regularization for parameters A, W, and h to divide units into memory units and flexible units, maintaining simplicity while approximating any underlying DS. A common value is assumed for the regularization factors, allowing a trade-off between line attractor tendency and sensitivity to inputs. The latent state dynamics are assumed to be deterministic for comparability with other approaches like LSTMs or iRNN. The latent RNN model uses deterministic latent state dynamics, implicit Gaussian assumption, and stochastic gradient descent for training. The Adam algorithm is employed with specific parameters, and SGD is stopped after 100 epochs. For DS reconstruction, the latent RNN aims to approximate the true generating system of equations. The latent RNN model aims to approximate the true generating system of equations for DS reconstruction. The parameters are solved by maximum likelihood using an efficient EM algorithm, starting from the ELBO to the log-likelihood. The latent RNN model uses an EM algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution, with a fixed-point iteration scheme to optimize the parameters efficiently. The latent RNN model employs an EM algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution and optimize parameters efficiently through a fixed-point iteration scheme. The expectation values are solved for analytically, and a stepwise annealing protocol is used to shift the burden of fitting observations from the observation model to the latent RNN model during training. The machine learning benchmarks used MSE or cross-entropy as performance metrics for prediction error evaluation on left-out test sets. The ability to infer underlying attractor geometries and state space properties is essential, not solely based on prediction error like MSE on the time series. The model should be able to reproduce attractor geometries freely even without data guidance. The underlying attractor is chaotic, trajectories quickly diverge, and prediction errors are not meaningful. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to assess agreement in attractor geometries, not precise matching of time series. The true and reproduced probability distributions across states are compared to quantify how well an inferred PLRNN captures the dynamics. The rPLRNN model is evaluated by comparing the power spectra of true and generated time series. Numerical experiments show its performance on benchmarks requiring long short-term information maintenance. The dataset consists of training and test samples of input series with random distributions and indicator bits placed at specific times. The target output is the sum or product of the inputs. Additionally, the MNIST dataset contains hand-written digit images presented sequentially for a time series problem. In sequential MNIST, images are presented pixel-by-pixel in a time series of fixed length. The rPLRNN model outperforms other models on machine learning benchmarks for addition and multiplication tasks. The rPLRNN outperforms all other tested methods, including LSTMs, in terms of MSE or percentage correct. Results show that networks learn tasks in an all-or-none fashion, with either high success or complete failure. In sequential MNIST, the LSTM performs best, but the rPLRNN is comparable. The rPLRNN generally outperforms initialization-based models, suggesting a loss of line attractor subspace during training. The study examines the impact of noise levels and task complexity on performance during training. Reconstruction of a 2-time scale DS using a biophysical bursting neuron model is analyzed. The regularization approach is tested to identify DS with different time scales near line attractors. Multiple arbitrary time scales can be achieved by tuning systems in the vicinity of line attractors. In theory, multiple arbitrary time scales can be achieved by tuning systems near line attractors. A biophysically motivated bursting neuron model was used to generate time series data for the rPLRNN inference algorithm. Stronger regularization led to better reconstruction of the dynamic system, as shown by a decrease in KL divergence between true and generated state distributions. The regularization in the model led to a decrease in KL divergence between true and generated state distributions, improving the reconstruction of the dynamic system. Increasing the regularization parameter \u03c4 resulted in a reduction in MSE for lower frequency components, indicating better mapping of slowly evolving dynamics. The model was able to capture both stiff spike dynamics and slower oscillations simultaneously. In this work, a solution to the long short-term memory problem in RNN was introduced by adding regularization terms to the loss function to encourage the formation of a 'memory subspace' for storing arbitrary values for long periods. This approach allows the RNN to capture slow time scales in the data by slightly departing from a perfect line attractor. The regularization in the RNN allows for departure from a perfect line attractor, facilitating the learning of arbitrary time constants. The rPLRNN performs well on benchmarks and aids in identifying challenging dynamics with different time scales. Future work will explore a wider range of DS models and empirical data with diverse temporal and dynamical phenomena, potentially replacing the EM algorithm with black-box variational inference for better scaling. The EM algorithm efficiently exploits the model's piecewise linear structure for smaller-scale problems requiring high precision, such as those in neuroscience or physics. The exact PLRNN parameter settings for solving the addition problem with 2 units are provided. By translating the discrete into an equivalent continuous time PLRNN, the system of ordinary differential equations is derived to model the time series data. The text discusses solving systems of linear ODEs for subregions defined by index sets, using eigendecomposition and general solutions for inhomogeneous cases. It also mentions converting discrete to continuous PLRNN for a nonlinear oscillator. The text discusses converting discrete to continuous PLRNN for a nonlinear oscillator using a fixed-point-iteration algorithm for solving a maximization problem. It involves a Gaussian latent PLRNN and observation model, resulting in a piecewise Gaussian joint density. The algorithm iterates between recomputing D \u2126 and refining the solution by quadratic programming steps. Numerical experiments have shown the algorithm to be fast and efficient, providing an estimate of the state covariance at z *. In the M-step, the solution to the maximization problem can generally be expressed in a specific form for the latent and observation models. A proxy for assessing agreement in attractor geometries can be obtained in situations where no ground truth is available by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution over latent states. The Kullback-Leibler divergence can be used to assess agreement in attractor geometries when no ground truth is available. It involves sampling from the prior density and the posterior distribution, approximating them with Gaussian mixtures, and numerically approximating the integral through Monte Carlo sampling or a variational approximation. The neuron model in section 4.2 is described by \u03c3(V) = 1 + .33e, with different parameter settings leading to various dynamical phenomena such as regular spiking, slow bursting, or chaos. The system exhibits different limiting behaviors in attractor geometries, with agreement in time series initially suggesting a perfect fit. The system exhibits different limiting behaviors in attractor geometries, with trajectories diverging despite identical dynamics, resulting in a high MSE."
