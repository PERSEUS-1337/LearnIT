    "content": "The \"Marine Debris Act Amendments of 2016\" cite the NOAA Marine Debris Program's amendments to work with federal agencies on outreach, education, and international efforts to reduce marine debris. Assistance for severe marine debris events is also addressed. The Marine Debris Act Amendments of 2016 allow for assistance in severe marine debris events, with the Administrator authorized to provide funding for cleanup and response efforts. The Administrator can provide funding for cleanup and response efforts in severe marine debris events, with the Federal share not exceeding 75 percent of the cost of the activity. The Sense of Congress on international engagement to respond to marine debris is highlighted in Section 4. The President should work with foreign countries to address marine debris by studying how waste enters oceans, improving waste management, assessing economic impacts, and promoting reduction efforts. The President should collaborate with foreign countries to reduce marine debris by signing new international agreements to mitigate land-based waste reaching the ocean and increase investment in waste management infrastructure. Consider appointing a senior State Department official to the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee. The Marine Debris Act was established under section 5 (33 U.S.C. 1954). SEC. 5 amends the Marine Debris Act to include the Department of State on the Interagency Marine Debris Coordinating Committee. SEC. 6 authorizes appropriations for the Act. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2017 through 2021: $10,000,000 for Administrator (sections 3, 5, and 6) and $2,000,000 for Secretary of the Department of the Coast Guard (section 4). Administrative costs limited to 10 percent. Reauthorize and amend the Marine Debris Act to promote international action to reduce marine debris and for other purposes."
