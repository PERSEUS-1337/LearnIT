    "content": "Many approaches to causal discovery struggle to differentiate between Markov equivalent graphs using only observational data. Causal discovery is framed as a Bayesian model selection issue, with a parameterization based on the independence of causal mechanisms to distinguish between Markov equivalent graphs. An empirical Bayesian approach is used to set priors, prioritizing the actual causal graph over alternatives. Bayesian modeling allows for the inclusion of unobserved confounding variables, with a variational algorithm to approximate the marginal likelihood. This Bayesian approach enables the use of Bayesian inference in challenging scenarios. The discovery allows Bayesian inference methodology to be applied in causal structure learning, focusing on scoring causal graphs to identify the unique causal generative graph. Selecting the correct causal network simplifies causal inference tasks in a Bayesian framework, but the challenge lies in adopting a prior selection policy. In causal structure learning, a key challenge is selecting a prior policy that discriminates between Markov equivalent graphs and assigns higher likelihood to the true causal network. This is addressed by assuming independence of cause-effect mechanisms and assigning independent priors to cause and effect variables in a Bayesian model. In causal structure learning, selecting independent priors for cause and effect variables breaks likelihood equivalence between Markov equivalent graphs. This is crucial for assigning higher marginal likelihood to the actual causal network. An empirical Bayesian approach is used to select hyperparameters that lead to higher marginal likelihood for the true causal network. The current approach in causal structure learning combines advantages from various existing approaches in the literature, based on mechanism independence and not assuming causal sufficiency. It can work on arbitrary graph structures with latent variables and discriminate between Markov equivalent structures. This approach diverges from other Bayesian methods. The approach in causal structure learning distinguishes itself from other Bayesian methods by its ability to distinguish between Markov equivalent causal graphs, use marginal likelihood instead of surrogate scores like BIC, and model non-linear relationships. An example model for continuous observations and latent categorical confounders is introduced in Section 2, followed by a variational inference algorithm for approximating marginal likelihood in graphs with latent confounders in Section 3. Testing on real datasets and conclusions are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. The text discusses causal structure learning with edges representing cause-effect relationships between variables. It defines sets of continuous and discrete random variables in the network, along with parent vertices and conditional distributions. The approach assumes categorical distributions for discrete variables and linear basis functions models with Gaussian noise for continuous variables. The focus is on graphical structures without a specific constraint. The text discusses a generative model for observations from a network, focusing on graphical structures without continuous variables as parents of categorical variables. Parameters are declared as random variables to simplify cause-effect mechanisms, with conditional distributions dependent on these parameters. Independence of conditional distributions is tied to the independence of parameters in the model. The generative model defines independent conjugate prior distributions on parameters, with variational Bayesian inference approximating the posterior distribution by minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence. This leads to establishing a tight lower bound for the marginal log-likelihood, known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In variational Bayesian inference, the ELBO is maximized by restricting Q to factorized distributions. This results in further factorized variational distributions due to conjugacy. The variational algorithm iteratively calculates expected sufficient statistics and updates parameters. In Section 4.1, the performance of variational Bayesian approach is tested in bivariate causal discovery. Section 4.2 discusses identifying latent confounder in a multivariate data set using a Bayesian approach to causality. The accuracy of VB for causal direction determination is measured using the CEP data set. Hyperparameters were varied systematically in 36 different settings, detailed in Appendix D.1. The algorithm tested on the CEP data set achieved a mean accuracy of .78\u00b1.09 and AUC score of .84\u00b1.13 using 10 \u00d7 3 cross-validation. The accuracy and AUC values were calculated based on weights from Mooij et al. (2016) and compared with other methods. In experiments using a different data set, the ability of the approach to identify a latent confounder was examined. The data involved diagnostic measurements from patients with varying thyroid activity levels. The causal structure was known, with thyroid activity causing the other variables. By ignoring the thyroid activity variable, it became a latent confounder, allowing testing of the approach's ability to identify it. The study examined the performance of a method in identifying latent variables, specifically focusing on thyroid activity. Results showed high accuracy (.93) in identifying the latent causal variable, demonstrating the potential of Bayesian model selection in causal research. The value of Bayesian modeling for causal research is significant, especially in setting priors empirically. Future research should focus on assigning priors without labeled data. Different variable types and distributions can also be explored for causal discovery. Identifying Markov equivalent graph structures in generative models is crucial, but not always achievable with certain equations. In causal research, Bayesian modeling is valuable for setting priors empirically. Identifying Markov equivalent models can be achieved by breaking symmetry with priors on parameters, making them identifiable even when distribution equivalent. In causal research, Bayesian modeling is valuable for setting priors empirically. Identifying Markov equivalent models can be achieved by breaking symmetry with appropriate priors, leading to identifiable models. The section defines graphical structures for causal structure learning in the bivariate case, allowing for the existence of exogenous variables combined into a single latent variable. The relationship between observable dependent variables x1 and x2 is determined by the causal Markov condition. The causal Markov condition categorizes the relationship between variables x1 and x2 into three cases: x2 causes x1, they do not cause each other but a latent variable r1 causes both, or they are marginally correlated with a spurious relationship. Graphical models depict these hypotheses, showing that even when the latent common cause is known, direct causal relationships result in dependent variables with implicit cause-effect directions. The models' uniqueness lies in explicitly modeling parameters as random variables, creating Markov inequivalent graphs. Including latent variables and independent parameters leads to distinct conditional independence properties for each graph. These properties make the graphs identifiable. Additionally, basic distributions like Gamma(\u03c1; a, b) are briefly described in this section. The section discusses various probability distributions such as the Multivariate Beta function, Dirichlet density, Multivariate Normal distribution, Normal-Gamma distribution, and Multivariate Normal-Gamma distribution. It includes definitions, expected sufficient statistics, and cross entropy for each distribution. The Normal-Gamma distribution is decomposed into a marginal Gamma distribution and a conditional Normal distribution. The curr_chunk discusses the Normal-Gamma density and its decomposition into a marginal Gamma distribution and a conditional Multivariate Normal distribution. It also summarizes basic conjugate models related to the example model, evaluates equations for variational posteriors, and simplifies notation for expectation operators. The curr_chunk discusses variational inference algorithm VB-CN and the expression of ELBO as a sum of expectation terms. It evaluates expectations explicitly starting with the Gaussian log-likelihood term and then negative cross entropy values of exponential family distributions. The curr_chunk discusses modifying expressions for cross entropy and entropy of exponential family distributions using variational parameters. It describes setting hyperparameters for categorical distributions and their adaptation to causal graphs. The hyperparameters of Gamma distributions for precision of observed variables were allowed to vary with the condition a \u2265 b, with values restricted to 1, 10, and 100. The constraint prevented a from exceeding 100 to avoid an overly large sample size. The b parameter was constrained to be not smaller than 1 to avoid imprecise Gaussian distributions. Model comparison in hyperparameter settings requires consistency criteria to be met. Permuting labels of pairs should not affect marginal likelihoods. The prior parameters of variables must be identical when their parental graphs are homomorphic to solve inconsistency issues. Different hyperparameter settings were used for calculating marginal likelihoods of different relationships. 540 data pairs were generated for 36 hyperparameter combinations and different rank values for the linear model. The study generated 540 data pairs with 36 hyperparameter combinations to compare hypotheses using variational Bayes algorithm. Results showed high accuracy and AUC, indicating successful identification of data generating graph. Hyperparameter selection was challenging due to unlabeled data set, but experiments with spurious relationship hypothesis were conducted. The study identified spurious data sets (19, 91, 92, 98) using hyperparameters with high accuracy. Scatter plots showed correlated pairs that could be separated into independent clusters, indicating spurious correlation. Confounding variables influencing cluster affiliations were evident. The fourth pair, measuring initial and final speeds, had a slightly different correlation pattern. The study identified spurious data sets using hyperparameters with high accuracy. The fourth pair, measuring initial and final speeds of a ball on a ball track, showed a spurious correlation with a latent variable indicating marginal independence of X and Y."
