    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Governors Island Preservation Act of 2001\". Congress finds that in August 1776, Governors Island fortifications provided cover for George Washington's Continental Army during the Battle of Long Island. New York ceded control of the island to the Federal Government in 1800 for defense purposes. During the War of 1812, Castle Williams and the Southwest Battery deterred a British attack on New York City. In 1901, fill from the Lexington Avenue Subway excavation was used on the island. Governors Island's history includes its role in the Civil War, World War I, and World War II, serving the United States Army until 1966. In 1966, the Army relocated, and the United States Coast Guard took over, playing a key role in the Coast Guard's Atlantic coast efforts for 30 years. The Coast Guard ceased operations at Governors Island in 1997, leaving 225 buildings unoccupied and exposed to New York Harbor's elements. Castle Williams is named after Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, who built the fort, and Fort Jay is named after John Jay. The Governors Island National Monument, established in 2001, includes Castle Williams and Fort Jay. The State of New York and the city of New York have agreed on a redevelopment plan for the island.
