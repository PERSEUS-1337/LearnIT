Application of state laws regarding fees, charges, guarantees, and warranties to rent-to-own transactions.

This includes restrictions on interest rates, fees, and credit insurance premiums for similar credit or retail sales. In rent-to-own transactions, sellers can charge termination fees and reasonable fees for recovery of items not returned voluntarily upon termination.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act applies to credit transactions and the extension or denial of credit, treating payments owed as debt. \"SEC. 1006. DISCLOSURES.\" The seller must provide specific information on each item available for purchase in a rent-to-own transaction, including the cash price, itemized services, annual percentage rate, payment schedule, and total payments required for ownership.

PROHIBITIONS AND ENFORCEMENT. Prohibitions under a rent-to-own contract include not threatening criminal prosecution, using coercion to collect payments, harassing consumers, disclosing information to third parties, or engaging in fraudulent behavior.

The Federal Trade Commission will issue regulations to implement subsection (b). \"SEC. 1008. CIVIL LIABILITY.\" Any seller failing to disclose terms under section 1006 is liable to the consumer for actual damages, $250 for each failure, and legal fees. For violations of this title or other requirements, the seller is liable for actual damages, $2,500 per violation, and legal fees. An action under this title can be filed in any US district court within 24 months of the violation. This does not prevent a person from asserting a violation more than 2 years later as a defense in a collection action. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2001 applies to rent-to-own contracts entered into after regulations are issued by the Board. It does not apply to motor vehicle leases or sales subject to the Truth in Lending Act. The Board must issue necessary regulations within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Rent-To-Own Reform Act of 2001 does not override state laws regarding rent-to-own transactions, except where there is inconsistency. Consumer lease provisions of the Truth in Lending Act do not apply to rent-to-own transactions, except for motor vehicle leases or sales."
