    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community-Based Health Care Retraining Act\" and includes a Health Professions Training Demonstration Project. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to include a Health Professions Training Demonstration Project for communities with employment decline and shortage of healthcare professionals. The Health Professions Training Demonstration Project aims to support communities underserved by the healthcare system, such as rural or minority populations, by providing training for healthcare professionals who are terminated, laid off, or facing unemployment. The Health Professions Training Demonstration Project supports underserved communities by providing training for healthcare professionals who are terminated, laid off, or facing unemployment, and are unlikely to return to their previous industry or occupation. The Health Professions Training Demonstration Project aims to support underserved communities by providing training for healthcare professionals facing termination, layoff, or unemployment, with a focus on increasing the number of instructors and vacant positions in the community. The term 'health care professional' refers to individuals involved in delivering health care services, including disease management, nutrition services, dental care, and long-term care in home or community settings. The term 'health care professional' includes individuals in health care professions with shortages in the community, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Tribal college or university is defined as a Tribal College or University under the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will establish a health professions training project and provide grants to eligible entities for training programs in covered communities. Grants will range from $100,000 to $500,000 for a 5-year period. Eligible entities must meet specific criteria to receive a grant. To qualify for a grant under this program, an entity must be a partnership between a local workforce investment board serving the community and an institution of higher education, in collaboration with a health clinic, long-term care facility, or a healthcare facility run by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. To be eligible for a grant under this program, an entity must submit an application to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including a proposal to establish or expand a training program for healthcare employment. The entity can be a tribal college, labor organization, local economic development entity, or joint labor-management partnership. The entity applying for the grant must provide information on the long-term viability of the training program, the need for training and support services, how the grant funds will be used, meeting program requirements, and graduation rates of training programs. The applicant must provide details on the training programs, retention measures, completion time, capacity limitations, stakeholder engagement, including the healthcare industry, labor organizations, and local industry. The Secretary selects eligible entities for grants based on criteria determined by the Secretary of Labor, prioritizing those serving communities with the greatest need and potential benefit. The Secretary prioritizes eligible entities for grants based on criteria such as serving terminated or laid off workers from industries with significant decline in employment, and having a history of successful partnerships with various organizations. Entities receiving grants must use the funds for training and support services for covered workers, including implementing training programs and providing support services like tuition assistance and distance education programs. The curr_chunk discusses increasing capacity at educational institutions to train individuals for employment as health professionals by expanding facilities, course offerings, hiring faculty, and providing student loan repayment programs. The curr_chunk discusses grant funds being used for various purposes such as establishing clinical education opportunities, purchasing equipment, and conducting recruitment. Funds for facility expansion can only be used for renting or modernizing existing facilities, not for building new ones. At least 50 percent of the grant funds must be used for activities related to training individuals for health professions. The Federal share of grant costs decreases over five years, starting at 95% in the first year and decreasing to 55% in the fifth year, unless the entity shows a need to spend over 50% on specific activities. The eligible entity must provide the non-Federal share of the cost in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, or services. Not more than 1 percent of the funds provided shall be used for evaluation of training programs, with eligible entities using the grant funds for evaluation or documentation purposes. An eligible entity must provide data on the success of the training program, including completion rates, employment rates of participants, addressing healthcare community needs, and any other relevant data. The Secretary will compile and submit a report to Congress containing information on the evaluation of the training program. $25,000,000 will be allocated for a demonstration project as described in the subsection."
