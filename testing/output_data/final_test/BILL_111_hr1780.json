    "content": "The Act titled \"Smart Planning for Smart Growth Act of 2009\" aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through transportation efficiency by amending Title I of the Clean Air Act. The Act \"Smart Planning for Smart Growth Act of 2009\" requires each State to submit goals for transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions reductions within 3 years. Metropolitan planning organizations in areas with a population exceeding 200,000 must submit plans to achieve these goals. The Administrator will establish standardized models and methodologies through regulations. The Act requires each State to develop greenhouse gas reduction goals in consultation with relevant agencies and metropolitan planning organizations. The Administrator will establish standardized models and methodologies through regulations within a specified timeline. The State must develop greenhouse gas reduction goals in consultation with relevant agencies and metropolitan planning organizations, with public involvement. The goals should cover 10- and 20-year periods and establish targets to reduce mobile source greenhouse gas emissions, stabilizing and decreasing levels after a designated year, possibly 2010. The State must establish greenhouse gas reduction goals for 10- and 20-year periods with public involvement. Goals should target reducing mobile source emissions, stabilizing and decreasing levels post a designated year, potentially 2010. Goals must be updated every 4 years, covering statewide and metropolitan planning organization areas with populations over 200,000. Planning must be based on Administrator's models, addressing mobile sources, economic development, and scenario analysis with public involvement. The State must establish greenhouse gas reduction goals for 10- and 20-year periods with public involvement, targeting mobile source emissions. Goals must be updated every 4 years, covering statewide and metropolitan planning organization areas with populations over 200,000. Planning must involve regional coordination with various agencies and consultation with State and local entities. The State or metropolitan planning organization must consider transportation and land use planning strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes efforts to increase public transportation, update zoning regulations to support development close to job centers, and use existing infrastructure efficiently. Implementation of a `complete streets policy' ensures accommodation for all transportation system users and addresses safety. Construction of bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure facilities and projects promoting telecommuting are also included. Projects to promote telecommuting, flexible work schedules, congestion pricing, intermodal freight system strategies, parking policies, travel demand management projects, restriction of certain roads to high-occupancy vehicles, reduction of vehicle idling, policies for retrofit technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administrator will publish goals and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources. Enforcement measures may be imposed if a State fails to submit required goals or plans. The Administrator can impose a prohibition on areas under section 179(b)(1) but not based on the content or adequacy of submitted plans. Competitive grants may be awarded to develop or implement plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Priority is given based on the amount of emissions. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, determines greenhouse gas emission reductions and other relevant factors. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. Definitions include 'metropolitan planning organization' and 'scenario analysis'. The curr_chunk discusses projections and scenarios for improving access to goods and services, including employment, education, and healthcare, as well as the potential impact on vehicle miles traveled, mobile fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions. It also clarifies that the section does not infringe upon the land use authority of state or local governments."
