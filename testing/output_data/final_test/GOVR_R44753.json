    "content": "The Pacific Islands region, also known as the South Pacific or Southwest Pacific, is strategically important for the U.S. It includes U.S. Pacific territories and relations with Australia and New Zealand. Congress oversees Compacts of Free Association with the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. The U.S. has economic interests in fishing and provides foreign assistance for climate change adaptation in the region. The Southwest Pacific region covers 20 million square miles of ocean and 117,000 square miles of land area, including 14 sovereign states with approximately 9 million people. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the largest country in the region, with 80% of the land area and 75% of the population. The region's GDP is around $32 billion, with per capita incomes ranging from lower middle income to upper middle income. Despite weak political institutions, many Pacific Island countries have experienced greater political than economic success since gaining independence. Most Pacific Island countries have limited resources and face challenges such as lack of skilled labor, poor infrastructure, and remoteness from international markets. Some areas are also threatened by natural disasters and rising sea levels. The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) fosters cooperation between 18 member states and territories, addressing key issues like climate change and regional security. The PIF Secretariat is in Suva, Fiji. The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) includes Melanesian countries and organizations like Fiji. American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Marianas have observer status with the PIF. The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) includes Fiji, the Kanak Socialist Liberation Front (FLNKS) of New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. The MSG aims for common positions and solidarity on regional issues, including FLNKS independence in New Caledonia. The United States has friendly relations with Pacific Island countries and works with Australia to advance shared strategic interests and maintain regional stability. New Zealand, France, Japan, China, Russia, India, and Indonesia have significant interests in the Southwest Pacific region. The Pacific Islands are divided into spheres of influence, including those of the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and France. The American sphere extends through parts of the Micronesian and Polynesian subregions. In the Micronesian region, U.S. territories Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, along with the Freely Associated States, are strategically important for U.S. security interests. Military bases on Guam and Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands form a defensive line in the Pacific known as the \"second island chain.\" This region played a significant role in World War II, and some analysts believe the island chains serve to contain China. Australia focuses on the Melanesian nations south of the equator, such as Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. New Zealand has ties with Tokelau, Samoa, Cook Islands, and Niue. Australia and New Zealand cooperate on regional security. France administers French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna. U.S. policymakers emphasize the strategic importance of the Pacific Islands region. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Matthews highlighted the changing strategic context of the region. Since the end of World War II, friendly relations have been maintained with Pacific island countries. However, the shifting strategic environment in Asia and beyond has led to uncertainty about the United States' commitment to the region. Former Representative Matt Salmon emphasized the importance of U.S. attention to the Pacific countries for regional security and international cooperation. China's growing engagement in the South Pacific region has raised concerns about long-term strategic implications. However, experts argue that China's influence has not significantly impacted political sway, with Australia remaining the dominant power in the region. Chinese military assistance remains modest compared to Australia, and China has not actively projected \"hard power.\" U.S. objectives in the region include promoting economic development, good governance, addressing climate change, and supporting regional organizations. The Obama Administration increased engagement in the Southwest Pacific as part of its \"rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on areas like climate change, regional aid, illegal fishing, peacekeeping, and natural disaster response. Congress oversees U.S. policies in the region, foreign aid programs, U.S.-Palau economic assistance agreement, and support for the U.S. tuna fleet. The Obama Administration increased engagement in the Southwest Pacific as part of its \"rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. diplomatic outreach to the region included high-level meetings with Pacific leaders, focusing on trade, investment in energy, sustainable growth, peace and security, women's empowerment, and climate change. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were among the U.S. officials who met with Pacific Island leaders to address these issues. In 2014, Secretary Kerry visited the Solomon Islands after floods. In 2015, President Obama met with leaders of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Papua New Guinea at the Paris Climate Conference. In 2016, Assistant Secretary Russel led a U.S. delegation to the Pacific Islands Forum in Micronesia, discussing climate change, fisheries, sustainable development, economic integration, and human rights in West Papua. The region heavily relies on foreign aid, with major donors being Australia, New Zealand, the United States, France, and Japan. In the Southwest Pacific, major aid donors include Australia, New Zealand, the United States, France, and Japan. The United States provides assistance mainly to the Freely Associated States. China is also a significant source of foreign aid, focusing on concessional loans and infrastructure projects. The U.S. government administers foreign assistance to Pacific Island countries through USAID offices in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Assistance includes environmental programs, military training, disaster preparedness, fisheries management, HIV/AIDS programs, and strengthening democratic institutions. USAID also partners with regional organizations for climate change responses and supports local-level interventions in nine Pacific Island countries. The United States also provides support for natural disaster mitigation. The United States provides support for natural disaster mitigation and response capabilities, weather and climate change adaptation programs, and military training in Pacific Island countries. USAID's Regional Development Mission-Asia carries out environmental programs in the region, particularly in Papua New Guinea. The Obama Administration requested $1 million in Foreign Military Financing for a regional program to promote peacekeeping activities and military professionalism in the Pacific Islands. For FY2017, U.S. assistance in the Pacific Islands aims to improve democratic development and governance through engagement with regional bodies. Funding from the South Pacific Tuna Treaty supports U.S. tuna fishing access in the Southwest Pacific, with economic assistance totaling $21 million per year to Pacific Island parties. In January 2016, the U.S. temporarily withdrew from the agreement citing non-viable terms. In 2016, the U.S. temporarily withdrew from the South Pacific Tuna Treaty due to non-viable terms. U.S. boats resumed fishing in the region with fewer fishing days allotted. Talks to renegotiate the treaty resulted in an agreement in principle in June 2016 to establish more flexible procedures for commercial cooperation. Congress oversees the Compacts of Free Association governing U.S. relations with Pacific Island nations. U.S. economic commitments to these nations totaled nearly $200 million in FY2015. The Compacts of Free Association governing U.S. relations with Pacific Island nations, including Palau and the Marshall Islands seeking additional compensation for damages related to U.S. nuclear testing. In the early 1980s, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia chose free association with the United States over territorial or commonwealth status. The Compacts of Free Association were approved by the governments of the United States, the Marshall Islands, and Micronesia in 1985 and with Palau in 1986. These agreements aimed to establish democratic self-government, promote economic development, and enhance national security. The FAS are sovereign nations with their own foreign policy, but the United States has obligations to defend them and regulate certain aspects of their international relations. The United States has the authority to defend the Freely Associated States (FAS) and can reject the strategic use of the FAS by third countries. FAS citizens have access to U.S. federal programs, can reside and work in the U.S., and are eligible to serve in the U.S. armed forces. The Marshall Islands hosts a key U.S. military facility, the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site. The U.S. military and 12 FAS citizens serving in the armed forces died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau were part of the U.S.-led coalition in Operation Iraqi Freedom. FAS economies rely on U.S. support, with the Department of the Interior providing economic assistance. Compacts with Marshall Islands and Micronesia included $2.5 billion in aid from 1987 to 2003, with amendments in 2003 extending assistance for 20 years and establishing trust funds for sustainable revenue post-2023. The United States provided significant grant assistance and trust fund contributions to the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. The U.S.-Palau Compact of Free Association included economic assistance, road construction, and access to various federal services and programs. Total U.S. assistance to Palau between 1995 and 2009 exceeded $850 million. U.S. assistance to Palau totaled over $850 million, including grant assistance, road construction, and a trust fund. The Compact economic assistance was set to end in 2009, but due to the global financial crisis, the trust fund value decreased. In 2010, an agreement was reached for $215.75 million in direct economic assistance, pending approval by Congress. The 2010 agreement with Palau provided for $215.75 million in direct economic assistance over 15 years. U.S. support, including projected assistance, could total $427 million. Congress has not yet approved the renewal agreement due to budgetary reasons. Assistance continued at 2009 levels from FY2010 to FY2016, pending approval. During the 114th Congress, two bills were introduced to extend Compact assistance to Palau. S. 2610 and H.R. 4531 would provide additional funding and reschedule U.S. assistance. The conference report to accompany S. 2943 emphasized the importance of enacting the Compact Review Agreement for U.S. national interests. The Compact Review Agreement is crucial for US national security interests. Between 1946 and 1958, the US conducted atomic tests in the Marshall Islands, leading to radioactive fallout. Residents were evacuated and some areas deemed unsafe for habitation. The US conducted atomic tests in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958, leading to radioactive fallout. Some areas were deemed unsafe for human habitation. Despite remediation efforts, Bikini and Rongelap atolls remain uninhabited. The Compact of Free Association established a $150 million Nuclear Claims Fund and a Nuclear Claims Tribunal to adjudicate claims for personal injury and property damages. The US government has made efforts for resettlement and compensation for the hardships suffered by the displaced people. The United States has provided over $600 million for nuclear claims, health programs, and environmental cleanup in the Marshall Islands. The Nuclear Claims Fund was depleted by 2009 and was not enough to cover awards for compensable injuries. The Marshall Islands government and affected atolls argue for greater U.S. compensation for loss of land, personal injuries, and property damages due to nuclear tests. The Marshall Islands have claimed that nuclear tests caused health issues like miscarriage, birth defects, and cancer. They requested $1 billion in compensation from the US for personal injuries and property damages due to radiation exposure. The Marshall Islands sought $1 billion in compensation from the US for health issues caused by nuclear tests, but lawsuits filed in 2006 seeking additional compensation were dismissed by the courts. In 2009, the Marshall Islands found that U.S. jurisdiction was removed by Section 177 of the Compact. In April 2010, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. In April 2014, the Marshall Islands filed suits against the United States and other nuclear powers for failing to meet disarmament obligations. The lawsuits aimed for action on disarmament, not compensation. A federal court in California dismissed the Marshall Islands' suit in 2015, citing lack of standing and stating the issue should be resolved by the political branches of government. Policymakers have expressed concerns about China's increasing influence in the region. China's growing political and economic presence in the Southwest Pacific has raised alarms among some observers. China is becoming a significant player in the Southwest Pacific, aiming to displace traditional actors like the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Analysts believe China seeks to be a leading power in the Western Pacific and conducts signals intelligence monitoring in the region. Despite some concerns, Australian assistance to the South Pacific remains larger than China's involvement. China's engagement in the Pacific Islands is driven by a desire for international support and access to raw materials. It has filled a void left by decreased U.S. attention in the region and has established diplomatic missions in all eight Pacific Island countries. China-Taiwan \"dollar diplomacy\" has declined since the late 2000s. China has become a significant provider of foreign aid in the Southwest Pacific, offering $150 million annually on average over the past decade. They have held economic development forums and established strategic partnerships with Pacific Island countries. Despite China's increasing presence, Australia remains the primary foreign aid donor in the region, providing around $7.7 billion between 2006 and 2014. Between 2006 and 2014, Australia provided $7.7 billion in foreign aid to the Southwest Pacific, surpassing the aid provided by the United States, China, New Zealand, Japan, and France. China's foreign assistance in the region mainly consists of preferential loans for infrastructure projects, with Papua New Guinea being the largest recipient. Chinese assistance in the Southwest Pacific region includes 218 projects since 2006, such as roads, ports, hospitals, and educational facilities. Other aid areas are public health, education, fisheries, and environmental conservation. Some critics argue that Chinese infrastructure projects lack quality and transparency, potentially exacerbating corruption. Some concerns about Chinese loans and aid activities in the Southwest Pacific region include lack of transparency, corruption, debt burdens, and environmental harm. There are also issues with Chinese economic projects not benefiting local labor or poverty reduction. China's economic interests in the region include energy production, mining, fisheries, timber, agriculture, and tourism, with the largest investment being the Ramu Nickel mine in Papua New Guinea. The influx of Chinese traders and shop owners in urban areas has caused resentment among some native residents. China's presence has reduced the regional influence of Australia, the United States, and European countries, although this is disputed by some experts. The $1.6 billion Ramu Nickel mine in Papua New Guinea is a major Chinese investment in the Southwest Pacific region. Australia has played a critical role in promoting security and economic development in the region, addressing challenges such as slow economic growth, social issues, and climate change. Australia plays a crucial role in promoting security and economic development in the Southwest Pacific region, addressing challenges such as slow economic growth, social issues, population growth, and climate change. It is important for Australia to support the development of national resilience in the region to reduce instability, through defence cooperation, aid, policing, and building regional organisations. Australia also provides humanitarian and security assistance when needed. New Zealand's Pacific identity, derived from its geography and population with Polynesian or Pacific Island backgrounds, strengthens its relationship with the region. The June 2016 New Zealand Defence White Paper highlights New Zealand's ongoing interest in the South Pacific. New Zealand maintains a strong interest in the South Pacific region due to its historical and constitutional links with its South Pacific partners. The region faces economic, governance, and environmental challenges, indicating a potential need for the Defence Force to deploy for responses beyond humanitarian assistance. New Zealand works closely with Pacific Island states on various levels to protect and advance its interests. New Zealand plays a key role in promoting peace and stability in the Southwest Pacific, providing significant foreign assistance to the region. In 2015, Wellington pledged to increase aid by $100 million, reaching a total of $1 billion over three years. New Zealand also supports sustainable economic development and fisheries management in the Pacific Islands Forum. France's decision to stop nuclear testing in the region is also significant. France's decision to stop nuclear testing in the South Pacific in 1996 led to improved relations with the region. Despite withdrawing much of its regional military presence, France still maintains 2,800 personnel and 7 ships in the area. France is part of the Quadrilateral Defense Coordination Group with the US, Australia, and New Zealand to coordinate maritime security. Recently, France signed a $39 billion deal to provide 12 submarines to the Australian Navy. Other external actors like Russia and India are also becoming more active in the Southwest Pacific. India and Indonesia are increasing their presence in the Southwest Pacific region. India is considering establishing a satellite monitoring station in Fiji, while Indonesia aims to strengthen its relations with Melanesian countries through the Pacific Islands Forum. Indonesia has faced criticism for human rights abuses in West Papua, including harassment of human rights groups and arrests of independence activists. Some Melanesian countries have shown support for West Papua. Indonesia has faced criticism for human rights abuses in West Papua, including harassment of human rights groups and arbitrary arrests of independence activists. Some Melanesian countries support self-determination for West Papua. Pacific Island countries seek international support for climate change impacts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. assistance in the region focuses on climate change adaptation and strengthening governmental capacity. The Pacific Islands are highly vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise. The Pacific Islands face unique challenges due to climate change, including rising temperatures, sea-level rise, contamination of freshwater resources, coastal erosion, extreme weather events, coral reef bleaching, and ocean acidification. Projections suggest continued increases in temperatures, frequency of extreme weather events, and changes in rainfall patterns. Some areas are only 15 feet above sea level, posing a threat to countries like Kiribati and Tokelau. If sea levels continue to rise as projected, Kiribati, Tokelau, and Tuvalu may be uninhabitable by 2050. Experts predict displacement of many Pacific Islanders in the coming decades. Kiribati is buying land in Fiji for potential relocation. Rising sea levels may make parts of the Marshall Islands unfit for human habitation. Bikini Islanders seek to resettle in the U.S. due to lack of resources and frequent bad weather on their current islands. The Department of the Interior has proposed using the U.S. resettlement fund for Bikini Islanders to support their relocation to the United States. Pacific Island states were active in influencing the outcome of the 2015 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, resulting in the Paris Agreement with commitments to limit temperature rise. Twelve Pacific Island countries signed the Agreement in 2016, reaffirming the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius. The Pacific Islands Forum 2016 annual meeting continued to focus on climate change. The Pacific Islands Forum 2016 annual meeting focused on climate change, with leaders emphasizing the importance of the Paris Agreement and urging countries to ratify it to address the urgent need to limit global temperature increases. Leaders called for ambitious climate action across all sectors and encouraged support for key obligations under the Agreement. Ocean acidification, caused by carbon dioxide absorption in seawater, is a significant threat to Pacific Island states. Coral reefs, vital for fisheries and tourism, are declining rapidly, with some experts predicting their ecological extinction by the end of the century. The Southwest Pacific is also facing challenges with tuna populations. The Southwest Pacific is home to the largest tuna fisheries in the world, with over half of the global tuna consumption coming from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean. Many Pacific Islands lack the resources to monitor and protect their fisheries, leading to poaching issues. The global black market for seafood is valued at $20 billion, with one in five fish caught illegally. To combat poaching, the United States and nine Pacific Island states have ship rider agreements for enforcement. The United States and Pacific Island states have ship rider agreements for enforcement in the Southwest Pacific, where tuna fisheries are abundant. New Caledonia and Bougainville are set to hold referenda on independence, raising concerns about U.S. assistance for elections and potential conflicts. New Caledonia, a French territory, may become an independent state, with a diverse population including Kanaks and Europeans. Bougainville's developments could impact U.S. relations with Papua New Guinea. In the late 1980s, the indigenous Kanaks clashed with pro-France settlers in New Caledonia. A referendum in 1987 saw New Caledonians voting to remain with France. The Bougainville conflict began over disputes related to the Panguna copper mine, with key grievances including environmental damage and dissatisfaction with mine revenue sharing. The Bougainville conflict arose from islanders' dissatisfaction with mine revenue sharing, leading to a decade-long war with thousands of casualties. A peace agreement brokered by New Zealand in 1997 paved the way for a referendum on self-determination, scheduled for June 2019, with concerns that some factions may still hold onto weapons."
