The \"Federal Asthma Assessment and State Tracking Act of 2002\" (FAAST Act) aims to address the serious impact of asthma on Americans, with millions of lost workdays and school days annually. Asthma mortality, morbidity, and hospital discharge rates have significantly increased over the past two decades. In 1996, the prevalence rate of asthma was higher in blacks compared to whites. The prevalence rate of asthma in blacks was 69.6 per 1,000 persons, a significant increase from 1982. Asthma incurs an annual economic cost of $12.7 billion, with inpatient hospital services being the largest direct medical expenditure. ASTHMA SCREENING FOR EARLY HEAD START AND HEAD START PROGRAMS. Asthma screening program for Early Head Start Programs allows entities to conduct asthma screening tests for eligible children upon enrollment, ensuring appropriate testing for age and risk factors. Reimbursement for these screenings is also addressed. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse entities for 100% of the cost of asthma screening tests for eligible children receiving medical assistance under a State plan. The subsection includes reimbursement for testing devices and supplies approved by the FDA, as well as administering tests and related services. This applies to Head Start programs covering infants and toddlers under 3 years old. The subsection amends U.S.C. 9837(b) by adding a new paragraph (12) requiring agencies opting for a program under section 645A(h) to comply with its requirements for each eligible child in the Head Start program. SEC. 3. ASTHMA SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include asthma screening and treatment for children in public schools. The Secretary will award grants to local educational agencies for asthma health screening and case management programs. Eligible agencies must submit an application, and preference will be given to those in high asthma incidence areas. Program elements include asthma screening and treatment for children in public schools. Local educational agencies receiving grants under this section must determine if enrolled children have had asthma screening tests, provide tests if needed, and offer treatment or referrals for asthma management. Reimbursement is available for children enrolled in or eligible for Medicaid. The Secretary will reimburse local educational agencies for 100 percent of the cost of tests, treatments, or education provided to children eligible for Medicaid, regardless of any payment limitations under title XIX of the Social Security Act. The costs of tests conducted under this section include reimbursement for testing devices and supplies approved by the FDA, and administering tests and related services as determined by the State agency responsible for title XIX of the Social Security Act. Children eligible for or receiving child health assistance under a State plan under title XXI of the Social Security Act are covered. The Secretary shall reimburse the local educational agency administering the program under title XXI of the Social Security Act for 100 percent of the cost of the performance, regardless of any other provisions or limitations under the Act. The Secretary will reimburse the local educational agency for 100 percent of the costs related to the program, including data reporting. Definitions for terms like 'local educational agency' are provided. $15,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2008 for children not covered by certain health insurance plans. Evaluations are required within 4 years. The Secretary will prepare a report for Congress within 4 years to assess if grants have effectively identified and treated high-risk asthma children. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT PROVIDED TO CHILDREN ELIGIBLE UNDER MEDICAID OR SCHIP. Medicaid rules amended to allow payment for asthma screening and treatment for children in public schools receiving medical assistance under the State plan. The amendment allows payment for asthma screening and treatment for children in public schools receiving medical assistance under the State plan, without prohibiting or restricting such payments. The amendment allows for asthma screening and treatment in public schools for children receiving medical assistance under the State plan, regardless of school participation in specific programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a demonstration program for model asthma treatment centers in conjunction with State Medicaid programs. The program will be based on scientifically validated asthma treatment models and prioritize communities with high prevalence of uncontrolled asthma."
