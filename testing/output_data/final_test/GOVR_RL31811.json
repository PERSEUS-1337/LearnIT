    "content": "The Senate passed the conference report on H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which includes $17.48 billion for Foreign Operations. This amount represents a 7.4% reduction from the President's request but is 7.9% higher than the previous year's spending. President Bush signed the measure into law on January 23 (P.L. 108-199). The President could potentially access $575 million from Iraq reconstruction funds to support his FY2004 proposal without tapping into the $17.48 billion provided in H.R. 2673. This would result in a $850 million difference between the request and the conference agreement, representing a 4.5% cut. Despite the reduction, spending for international HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs would increase to $1.646 billion. When combined with other appropriations, the total for global HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases would be $2.4 billion. The conference agreement on H.R. 2673 includes $2.4 billion for global HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, with $550 million allocated to the Global Fund for AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. Additionally, $1 billion is provided for the Millennium Challenge Account, and Senate language reversing the President's \"Mexico City\" abortion-related restrictions on international family planning programs was dropped. The conference agreement on H.R. 2673 includes $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) with conditions, and the annual Foreign Operations appropriations bill influences U.S. foreign assistance budget and policy making. It funds bilateral development assistance programs managed by USAID and other foreign aid agencies. Several smaller independent foreign aid agencies, such as the PeaceCorps and the Inter-American and African Development Foundations, are funded within Foreign Operations. This includes USAID's disaster program, State Department's refugee relief support, aid programs in the former Soviet Union and Central/Eastern Europe, security assistance for Israel and Egypt, contributions to the World Bank and other regional multilateral development banks, and voluntary payments to international organizations. The Foreign Operations bill funds international organizations, export promotion agencies, and foreign aid programs. It serves as a key legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and policy making. Congress has not passed a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leading to appropriations committees expanding their role in shaping foreign policy. The Foreign Operations appropriations legislation has played a significant role in shaping US foreign aid policy since the Cold War. It has been used to allocate resources, implement aid in the global war on terrorism post-9/11, and impose restrictions on the Administration. The House bill was H.R. 2800, the Senate bill was S. 1426, and Foreign Operations was merged into the conference agreement. President Bush submitted his FY2004 federal budget request to Congress on February 3, 2003, including funding proposals for Foreign Operations Appropriations programs. The White House requested FY2003 emergency supplemental funds for military operations in Iraq, relief and reconstruction of Iraq, ongoing U.S. costs in Afghanistan, aid to coalition partners in the global war on terrorism, and homeland security. House and Senate Appropriations Committees held hearings on the FY2004 and FY2003 supplemental requests, approving the supplemental (P.L. 108-11) on April 12. Another Iraq military operations and reconstruction supplemental for FY2004 (H.R. 3289) was requested on September 17 and cleared by Congress on November 3 (P.L. XXXX). The House and Senate passed the FY2004 Foreign Operations bill (H.R. 2800) in July and October. A conference committee met on November 17 to resolve outstanding issues, mainly related to international family planning funding and policy. After resolving these issues, the bill was incorporated into other legislation instead of filing a separate conference report. The House and Senate Appropriation Committees decided to include the Foreign Operations bill in H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2004. The bill was approved by the House on December 8 and the Senate on January 22, 2004, before being signed by the President on January 23. Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated over the past 27 years, peaking in FY1985 at over $33 billion in constant FY2004 dollars. Foreign aid spending increased slightly in FY1998, but from the following year onwards, Foreign Operations appropriations have been trending upward due to resources allocated for special foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives. Funding for regular foreign aid programs also rose modestly during this period, with supplemental spending for special activities like Central American hurricane relief and Kosovo emergency assistance. Foreign aid appropriations saw significant growth from FY1999 to FY2004, with funding levels reaching unprecedented highs. The average annual funding level during this period was $17.29 billion, representing a 24% increase from previous years. Supplemental funding for front line states in the war on terrorism and Afghanistan/Iraq totaled $7.5 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively. The Foreign Operations bill, signed in January 2004, along with an earlier Iraq supplemental, brought appropriations to $38.7 billion, the highest since the 1960s. Supplemental resources for Foreign Operations programs have become a significant channel of funding for U.S. international activities, responding to unanticipated contingencies. Supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle is often necessary for foreign aid and defense resources. Supplemental appropriations for Foreign Operations have been crucial for major foreign policy events, such as the Camp David accords, Central America conflicts, Africa famine, and the Gulf War. Congress has approved over $1 billion in supplemental appropriations each year since FY1999, providing relief for various crises like Hurricane Mitch and Kosovo refugees. In FY1999, Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch, Kosovo refugees, and embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania received $1.6 billion in aid. This was followed by a $1.1 billion supplemental in FY2000 for the President's counternarcotics initiative in Colombia. In FY2001 and FY2002, $1.4 billion was allocated for foreign aid activities, with an additional $1.15 billion in FY2002 for Afghan reconstruction and other \"front-line\" states in the war on terrorism. The $7.5 billion Iraq War supplemental in FY2003 represented nearly one-third of the Foreign Operations budget. The Foreign Operations budget for FY2003 was 1.06% of the total U.S. budget, higher than the usual 0.75%, mainly due to the $7.5 billion supplemental for Iraq reconstruction and aid for coalition partners. In FY2004, foreign aid is projected to increase to 1.66% of the budget. Foreign Operations consumed 2.8% of discretionary budget authority in FY2003, expected to rise to about 4.45% in FY2004. In FY2004, foreign aid funds represented 4.45% of the total U.S. budget, an increase from previous years. Appropriations Committees allocate funds to subcommittees within the International Affairs budget function, with Foreign Operations funds typically making up about 65% of the function total. In FY2004, the House and Senate agreed on a budget framework with a discretionary budget authority target of $28.65 billion for the International Affairs function, matching the President's request. This decision has significant implications for the budget limitations of the House and Senate Foreign Operations subcommittees when they mark up their annual appropriation bills. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees received sufficient resources to fully fund the Administration's foreign policy budget proposal, including the Foreign Operations request. The Committees could allocate the $28.65 billion among the five subcommittees differently than proposed by the President. Appropriation Committee leaders debated how to distribute discretionary funds and address a $5 to $7 billion gap in spending requirements. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees negotiated a common framework to allocate resources, reducing Defense spending by $3 billion and moving $2.2 billion in advance appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee made additional funding adjustments beyond the basic framework, exceeding the President's requests for some subcommittees. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made funding adjustments beyond the President's requests for various subcommittees. The House Committee cut Foreign Operations by $1.769 billion, the largest reduction among the subcommittees. The Senate Committee allocated $18.446 billion for foreign assistance, $1.3 billion more than the House and $450 million below the President's request. The Senate allocated $18.446 billion for foreign assistance, $1.3 billion more than the House. Conferees received a revised allocation of $17.2 billion to resolve funding differences. Congress included $700 million in additional funds for Pakistan, Jordan, and Afghanistan in the Iraq reconstruction supplemental. This will allow the President to fully fund FY2004 proposals for these countries using both supplemental and regular Foreign Operations resources. Less money will need to be drawn from the Foreign Operations bill for these country aid programs than originally anticipated. The conference agreement of H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, included $350 million for the Millennium Challenge Account, in addition to the $17.2 billion allocation. This resulted in a potential $1 billion cut to the President's overall request for Foreign Operations, impacting new initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account and the Global AIDS program. The White House emphasized that the budget package should not reduce funding for its top spending priorities. President Bush requested $18.89 billion for FY2004 Foreign Operations, a 16.7% increase from FY2003. The budget proposal aimed to restore funding for key priorities like the Millennium Challenge Account. Congress later approved an additional $7.5 billion for FY2003 supplemental foreign aid, including support for Iraq reconstruction and the global war on terrorism. The FY2004 budget proposal requested $18.89 billion for Foreign Operations, with a focus on new initiatives totaling $2.7 billion, including the Millennium Challenge Account and Global AIDS Initiative. Other programs saw a more modest 4% increase. In response to the terrorist attacks in September 2001, American foreign aid programs shifted focus towards supporting key coalition countries and global counter-terrorism efforts. Approximately $17.9 billion was appropriated for Foreign Operations in FY2002 and FY2003 to assist front-line states in the war on terrorism, implement anti-terrorism training programs, and address post-conflict needs in Iraq and surrounding countries. The FY2004 budget continued the priority of fighting terrorism with $4.7 billion, or 25% of Foreign Operations resources allocated to assist front-line states. The FY2004 budget proposal included substantial aid packages for front-line states, with anti-terrorism programs increasing by 45% from FY2003 levels. However, it did not include follow-on funding for Iraq relief and reconstruction. Congress approved $2.5 billion in FY2003 supplemental resources for Iraq, seen as a down payment for long-term needs. The financial burden of Iraq reconstruction and management of operations remained uncertain. The Administration did not amend its FY2004 budget request to include additional funds for Iraq reconstruction. Instead, a $21.5 billion supplemental spending package was proposed for Iraq and Afghanistan. The new Millennium Challenge Account aimed to transform economic assistance to developing nations, starting at $1.3 billion in FY2004 with plans to reach $5 billion by FY2006. President pledged to implement the Global AIDS Initiative, promising $15 billion over five years, with $10 billion as additional funding. The initiative aims to increase U.S. assistance for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS in heavily afflicted countries in Africa and the Caribbean. The Global AIDS Initiative, with $450 million in FY2004, falls short of the anticipated $3 billion per year pledged by the President. Some question the State Department's role as coordinator of international HIV/AIDS programs. A new Famine Fund with $200 million for FY2004 is proposed for emergency assistance. The Administration proposed a new Famine Fund with $200 million for FY2004 to provide emergency food and disaster relief support. Critics questioned the necessity of the fund, citing existing programs and authorities that serve similar functions. Additionally, a new initiative called the U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Crises was proposed, with a $100 million contingency fund to respond quickly to unforeseen foreign crises. The Administration proposed a Complex Crisis Fund with $150 million for FY2003 to support peace and humanitarian intervention in conflict situations like ethnic cleansing or genocide. Congress deferred consideration of the fund and allocated resources for Iraq reconstruction instead. The FY2004 proposal aimed to increase aid in key areas while cutting resources for some programs. Security assistance and military financing would see a $648 million increase, with a focus on aid for Turkey and the Middle East. Peace Corps funding would rise by $64 million to support 10,000 volunteers by FY2004. Contributions to international financial institutions would also grow. Contributions to the World Bank and other international financial institutions would increase by $259 million, covering all scheduled U.S. payments and clearing $196 million of U.S. arrears. The request also included an 18% increase for the World Bank's International Development Association and the African Development Fund as a \"results-based Incentive Contribution.\" Debt reduction would grow to $395 million, with $300 million for canceling bilateral debt owed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo under the HIPC initiative and $75 million for the HIPC Trust Fund to address shortfalls. The Administration sought increased funding for international narcotics control, including $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. However, there was a reduction in assistance to Former Soviet states and Eastern Europe, with a proposed decline of $179 million or 24% from FY2003 levels. This reflected a shift in focus towards Central Asian states. The Administration's budget proposed a reorientation in aid towards Central Asian states, leading to cuts in aid for Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia. Aid levels for Eastern Europe were also set to decrease, with reductions for Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. Funding for the Export-Import Bank was expected to decline, but carry-forward resources could still support lending at a higher level than in the previous year. The Administration's budget proposed a reorientation in aid towards Central Asian states, leading to cuts in aid for Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia, as well as reductions for Eastern Europe. Funding for the Export-Import Bank was expected to decline, but carry-forward resources could still support lending at a higher level than in the previous year. Assessing the Administration's request for bilateral development and health assistance was complicated, with an increase of $205 million for development and health resources in FY2004. Excluding the new Global AIDS Initiative and Millennium Challenge Account funds, overall funding for USAID's core accounts would have declined by $245 million in FY2004. The FY2003 foreign operations appropriations showed that most development programs, except for HIV/AIDS, would receive similar or lower funding compared to FY2002. Critics raised concerns that the increase in HIV/AIDS resources came at the expense of other health activities. The table summarizes the discretionary funds allocated for foreign operations. In FY2003, foreign aid allocations shifted post-9/11, with Israel and Egypt remaining top recipients. Economic and military aid used to maintain international coalition against terrorism. FY2004 aid distribution followed similar patterns. Pakistan, a key ally, received increased assistance. Since lifting aid sanctions in October 2001, the United States has transferred over $1.9 billion to Pakistan, a key coalition partner on the border with Afghanistan. Other top aid recipients include Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India in the war on terrorism. The Andean region also receives significant aid for counternarcotics initiatives. Additionally, countries in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union like Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo, Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia are aid recipients. The United States provides foreign aid to countries in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, including Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Georgia. Funding levels for these countries are expected to decrease slightly. The House passed a $17.12 billion spending bill for FY2004 foreign aid programs, which was $1.8 billion below the President's request but $900 million higher than FY2003 levels. The bill included $1.27 billion for international HIV/AIDS, $30 million above the President's request, with $400 million allocated for the Global Fund. The House bill provided $1.9 billion for HIV/AIDS, $20 million less than the Administration's proposal, with $500 million available for the Global Fund. The House bill for FY2004 foreign aid programs proposed $200 million for the Global Fund, restored cuts to bilateral tuberculosis and malaria, and increased spending for non-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases. It allocated higher funding for core bilateral development programs, trade capacity building activities, and basic education. However, it reduced funding for non-health programs, resulting in small cuts for activities like agriculture, economic growth, environment, and democracy promotion. The House bill for FY2004 foreign aid programs allocated $350 million for basic education, reduced the President's request for the Millennium Challenge Account to $800 million, set family planning resources at $425 million, provided $25 million for the UN Population Fund with conditions, fully funded amounts for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, allocated $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative, and set Peace Corps funding at $314 million. Peace Corps funding for FY2004 is set at $314 million, $19 million higher than FY2003 levels but $45 million below the Administration's budget. Funding for the former Soviet Union is at $576 million, $179 million less than FY2003. Additional funds for East European assistance were increased by $17 million, with a focus on Bosnia, Serbia, and Montenegro. The House bill increased international disaster assistance to $315.5 million, with $80 million designated for famine relief. No funds were allocated for extending debt relief. The legislation fully funds requests for HIPC debt relief and tropical forest conservation. Lawmakers adopted amendments to clarify the role of the State Department HIV/AIDS Coordinator and reduce funding for the International Military Education and Training program by $600,000. The proposal aimed to cut IMET assistance to Indonesia. The proposal aimed to cut IMET assistance to Indonesia due to lack of progress in investigating an ambush in 2002. Congress approved funding for IDA-13 but required further authorization for the money transfer. Congressman Alcee Hastings proposed using diplomatic tools to prevent North Korea's aggression. The House debated increasing assistance for Africa, particularly for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, aiming to raise funding from $2 billion to $3 billion. Various proposals, including a failed amendment for $1 billion in emergency funds for HIV/AIDS programs in Africa, were considered but not adopted. The House debated proposals to increase funding for HIV/AIDS programs in Africa, including amendments to transfer funds from the Millennium Challenge Account. Various amendments to shift money to HIV/AIDS and provide emergency funding for African economic assistance were proposed but ultimately failed. The House debated shifting funds to HIV/AIDS programs, with a House floor amendment losing on a vote of 195-226. The Senate approved an $18.38 billion spending bill for FY2004 foreign aid programs, $500 million below the President's request but $2.2 billion higher than FY2003. The Senate allocated $1.47 billion for international HIV/AIDS, including $250 million for the Global Fund. The Senate approved an amendment increasing total resources for HIV/AIDS by $287 million, with funds allocated to the Global Fund and new Global AIDS Initiative account. Additionally, cuts to bilateral tuberculosis and malaria were restored, increasing spending for non-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases. Funding for HIV/AIDS was a primary issue of debate during Senate consideration. The Senate approved an amendment by Senator Dewine, increasing total resources by $287 million. However, proposals by Senator Durbin and Senator Bingaman to add $200 million each for HIV/AIDS and other development activities were rejected. The Senate measure was $550 million higher than the President's request and $415 million above the House bill, with additional funding for basic education, environmental activities, and microenterprise. The Senate bill increased funding for various areas above the President's request, including the Millennium Challenge Account, family planning resources, and the UN Population Fund. It also overturned abortion-related restrictions, provided funding for Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, and reduced funding for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. Peace Corps funding was set at $310 million. The Senate bill increased funding for various areas above the President's request, including the Millennium Challenge Account, family planning resources, and the UN Population Fund. It also provided funding for the former Soviet Union, East European assistance, and debt relief for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Additionally, it appropriated $100 million for the Famine Fund but deleted funding for the emergency complex crises fund. The Senate bill allocated funds for various areas above the President's request, including debt relief for the Democratic Republic of Congo. A conference committee reached agreement on most issues in disputes related to international family planning funding and policy issues. The Foreign Operations bill was merged into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The House passed H.R. 2673 on December 8, with the Senate following on January 22, 2004. The President signed the consolidated appropriation on January 23 (P.L. 108-199), providing $17.48 billion for Foreign Operations, including a 0.59% rescission and additional funds for the Millennium Challenge Account. This represents a $1.4 billion reduction from the President's request but is higher than approved in FY2003. Congress also allocated $300 million for Pakistan and Jordan in the Iraq reconstruction supplemental. The conference agreement on H.R. 2673 includes authority for the President to transfer $130 million from Iraq reconstruction funds for economic aid for Turkey and the Middle East Partnership Initiative. By utilizing these additional funds, the President could fund his original FY2004 proposal without drawing on the $17.48 billion provided in H.R. 2673, resulting in a 4.5% cut from the FY2004 request. The conference agreement on H.R. 2673 increases spending for international HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs to $1.646 billion, with a total of $2.4 billion when combined with other appropriations. Additionally, there is a $400 million contribution to the Global Fund for AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, exceeding the President's request. Funds are also allocated for the Millennium Challenge Account, with $650 million in Division D and an additional $350 million in Division H. The conference agreement on H.R. 2673 includes $1 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), with an additional $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) under certain conditions. The Senate provisions on international family planning were dropped to avoid a veto from the President. The final Foreign Operations bill includes $432 million for bilateral family planning assistance, $3.2 billion for USAID's core aid accounts, $255 million for international disaster and famine aid, $326.5 million for basic education programs, $731 million for the Andean Counter Drug Initiative, full funding for aid to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, and $405 million for Afghanistan. The President's requests for aid include $405 million for Afghanistan, $325 million for the Peace Corps, $95 million for debt reduction, $913 million for the World Bank's International Development Association, and a nearly $75 billion request on March 25, 2003. The President's request on March 25, 2003, included nearly $75 billion for FY2003 supplemental, with $7.6 billion for Iraq reconstruction and relief, aid to coalition partners in the war on terrorism, and USAID administrative expenses. The proposal was divided into Iraq relief and reconstruction ($2.85 billion) and aid to coalition partners and other nations in the war on terrorism ($4.7 billion), with plans for the Defense Department to oversee Iraq governance. The proposal for the Defense Department to oversee Iraq governance after the end of hostilities sparked controversy among critics, who argued that aid programs should remain under the State Department's policy direction. They expressed concerns that NGOs and international organizations would be hesitant to receive direction and funding from the military, potentially hindering relief efforts. Additionally, placing reconstruction funding in a Presidential account raised questions about the White House's influence. The White House had significant discretion over reconstruction funding, with $543 million for humanitarian expenses, $1.7 billion for reconstruction needs, and up to $200 million for foreign aid reimbursement. The Administration aimed for flexibility in distributing appropriations to respond to changing circumstances and unanticipated contingencies, potentially transferring funds to the Department of Defense for reconstruction efforts. The Administration planned to redirect resources for reconstruction efforts to the State Department and USAID. Congress approved $2.475 billion for the Relief and Reconstruction Fund, allowing the President to allocate funds to various federal agencies for Iraq reconstruction. The funds allocated for Iraq reconstruction were initially intended for the State Department and USAID, but were later directed to the Coalition Provisional Authority under the Secretary of Defense. Despite initial expectations, the White House argued for DOD control over reconstruction resources, leading to agreement by conference committee members. The enacted supplemental bill allocated DOD funds for Jordan, Pakistan, and other cooperating states supporting U.S. military operations. Additionally, funds were provided for drug interdiction in Colombia and MEPI, with changes in funding due to Congressional reductions in ESF funding. The House bill included funding for an Islamic Partnership and Outreach Program, and the Administration altered military grant recipients for Central European nations post-supplemental enactment. The enacted supplemental bill allocated military grants to various countries: Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Slovenia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia, and Ukraine. Specific amounts were allocated to replenish foreign aid accounts for prepositioning food and medicine stocks in the region. The conference agreement directed full reimbursement of USAID and State Department accounts from the Iraq Fund, providing $143.8 million for international disaster assistance. Congress increased the State Department's refugee reserve account to $80 million to address needs in the Persian Gulf region and other global requirements. The supplemental appropriation proposal provided about $4.7 billion in additional aid to countries contributing to the war in Iraq. The supplemental appropriation proposal provided about $4.7 billion in additional aid to 23 countries and regional programs contributing to the war in Iraq and cooperating in the global fight against terrorism. Key recipients included Jordan receiving $700 million in economic grants and $406 million in military transfers, Israel receiving $1 billion in supplemental military aid and $9 billion in economic loans guaranteed by the U.S., and Turkey receiving $1 billion for economic grants. The supplemental appropriation proposal includes aid for Turkey ($1 billion for economic grants), Afghanistan ($325 million for various purposes), Egypt ($300 million for economic grants with potential access to $2 billion in loan guarantees), and Pakistan ($200 million in military grants and law enforcement). Additionally, Egypt would receive a cash transfer of $379.6 million from previously appropriated aid. The Administration requested $150 million for a U.S. Emergency Fund for Complex Emergencies, managed by the White House. Congressional Action on International Assistance included $4.52 billion in additional aid, with a reduction in funding for the emergency account. Congress earmarked funding for Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Philippines. Turkey may receive up to $1 billion in aid, contingent on cooperation with the US in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The aid package for Turkey could reach $8.5 billion with loan options. The enacted supplemental included $9 billion for Israeli loan guarantees with added conditions. Loans for Israel may be issued in $3 billion allotments in FY2003 to FY2005, with added conditions by Congress. One condition prohibits loan resources from supporting activities in areas not administered by Israel before June 5, 1967. This is similar to a condition from a 1992 loan guaranty package. The loans would not require additional appropriations as economic grants would cover loan fees. The enacted supplemental appropriation provided $167 million, including $30 million for economic aid for the Philippines. The Administration modified its plans for fund allocation after enactment. Congress reduced Economic Support Fund appropriations by $20 million, resulting in $100 million less than requested for economic assistance. Non-earmarked programs included $50 million for the Palestinians and $25 million for Djibouti. The Administration allocated $50 million for the Palestinians, $25 million for Djibouti, and $200 million for the Middle East Partnership Initiative. However, they reduced funding for the Initiative to $100 million. Military aid grants to Central Europe were also modified, with additional funds for Albania, Macedonia, and Ukraine, and increased amounts for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria. Funds were cut for Hungary and Slovenia. These changes reflect the Administration's views on countries' support for U.S. operations in Iraq. The supplemental proposed $1.4 billion for the Defense Department to pay countries supporting U.S. military operations in Iraq or the war on terrorism, drawing congressional scrutiny over oversight and foreign aid policy. Defense officials argue that regular military aid resources face competing demands. Defense officials argue that competing demands on regular military aid resources have delayed reimbursement to key friends providing services to American forces. Congress approved funding in the FY2002 supplemental, but the FY2003 draft legislation does not include a 15-day prior notification requirement. The Defense Department requested $150 million to support \"indigenous forces\" assisting U.S. military operations, with decisions made by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. Indigenous forces are defined as irregular forces conducting military operations in enemy-held territory. The Defense Department requested $150 million to support \"indigenous forces\" in enemy-held territory, with decisions made by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. This funding would provide a hedge in case of a prolonged conflict, potentially transferring arms and equipment to Kurdish and other forces in Iraq. The Committee observed that the Secretary of State has the primary responsibility for U.S. military assistance programs and that the Administration had the necessary authorities under existing foreign aid laws. H.R. 1559 provided $1.4 billion for nations supporting U.S. military operations in the global war on terrorism but did not authorize the $150 million for aid to indigenous forces. The annual debate on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill usually focuses on major policy and spending issues, with combating global terrorism being a top priority since the September 11, 2001 attacks. The American foreign assistance prioritizes fighting terrorism, with Secretary of State Powell emphasizing its importance in the FY2004 Foreign Operations request. Economic and security assistance aims to indirectly address factors that terrorists exploit for recruitment. The United States has provided over $5.9 billion to \"front-line\" states in the global war on terrorism post-9/11, with additional funding in FY2003. The Administration proposed $4.7 billion for this purpose. Since September 11, the United States has allocated $7.4 billion in regular and supplemental spending bills. The Administration proposed $4.7 billion for \"front-line\" states in FY2004, with an additional $1.2 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction. This totals $5.9 billion, excluding Iraq reconstruction funds. Prior to the attacks, only $3.4 billion was provided to these states in regular FY2001 appropriations. Increased foreign aid has been evident in countries like Jordan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Oman, Yemen, and Djibouti. Foreign aid in the war on terrorism can be provided through various means, such as transferring assistance to coalition-partner governments like Pakistan and Afghanistan to combat domestic dissent and extremist attacks. Security assistance can also be used to support nations facing terrorist threats internally. However, caution is advised in establishing close aid relationships with governments that have questionable human rights records and lack accountability to their people. Congressional support for additional foreign aid resources aimed at countering terrorism has been observed, but some Members have raised concerns about potential corruption. Some Members criticize Administration efforts to include legislative language waiving restrictions on aid transfers to \"front-line\" states. They suggest identifying specific obstacles and seeking congressional waivers for those issues, as done in the case of providing aid to Pakistan in 2001. Congress approved specific waivers for countries engaged in missile proliferation, led by military coups, or behind in debt payments. Table 8 shows U.S. Assistance to Front-Line States in the War on Terrorism since September 11, 2001. The aid includes funds allocated for programs under the Foreign Operations spending measure and food assistance from the Agriculture appropriation bill. In addition to bilateral aid, global programs targeting anti-terrorism efforts and security for USAID employees are funded through the Foreign Operations appropriation bill. Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) has been maintained by the State Department since FY1984. The State Department has maintained the Anti-Terrorism Assistance (ATA) program since FY1984 to enhance international cooperation in fighting global terrorism. Over 23,000 officials from 112 countries have participated in ATA projects. Funding for the $38 million annual ATA program in FY2001 increased after September 11, with an additional $45.5 million allocated from the Terrorism Emergency Response Fund. Congress approved $38 million for FY2002 and $64.2 million for FY2003 to support three ATA program strategies. The State Department sought $106.4 million for ATA programs in FY2004 to expand training activities in the U.S. and in participant nations like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Indonesia. They planned to launch a Mobile Emergency Training Teams (METT) initiative for VIP protection and crisis response operations. Reprogramming funds in FY2002 delayed the start of METT. The State Department launched the Terrorist Interdiction Program (TIP) in response to the 1998 bombings of American embassies. TIP aims to strengthen border security in vulnerable countries by installing monitoring technology, training officials, and sharing criminal information. The budget for TIP increased post-9/11, reaching $14 million in FY2002. The State Department's budget for the Terrorist Interdiction Program grew to $14 million in FY2002. After falling to $5 million in FY2003, the request for FY2004 was $11 million to expand operations in new countries. Following the September 11 attacks, workshops were conducted in 18 countries with $3 million from emergency spending. The $2.5 million budget request for FY2004 would finance workshops, including three in Greece before the 2004 Olympic games. An interagency review group identified 19 countries with a significant terrorist financing threat, allocating $3 million from the Emergency Response Fund. The State Department allocated $10 million from the FY2002 supplemental appropriation to expand the training and technical assistance program for combating terrorist financing activities. The Treasury Department is utilizing approximately half of its $10 million FY2003 \"Technical Assistance\" program for these purposes. In FY2004, Treasury proposed $5 million for combating terrorist financing activities. USAID maintains about 97 overseas facilities with a high threat of terrorist activity, especially since the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Agency officials are concerned about ensuring adequate security in these locations. The State Department's Foreign Buildings Operations office, responsible for financing USAID secure facilities, faced construction delays due to competing priorities and congressional directives. USAID requested a new Capital Investment Fund in FY2003 for security enhancements at co-located sites, but Congress reduced funding to $43 million. USAID planned construction projects in Kenya, Guinea, Cambodia, and Georgia. USAID proposed a $146.3 million Capital Investment Fund request for FY2004, with $20 million for information technology needs and the rest for construction of co-located facilities at new embassies. Resources were requested for co-located missions in Zimbabwe, Armenia, Mali, and Uganda, with funding drawn from State Department appropriations. Security upgrades for overseas missions were provided from USAID operating expenses. Security upgrades for some USAID missions have been deferred due to funding shortfalls. For FY2003, USAID estimated spending $7.1 million for security needs, compared to $6.75 million in FY2002. Aid Restrictions for Terrorist States are included in annual Foreign Operations spending bills. The FY2003 funding measure included restrictions on U.S. aid to countries supporting terrorist groups. Sec. 527 prohibited assistance to countries granting sanctuary to terrorists, while Sec. 543 prohibited aid to governments providing military equipment to terrorist-supporting countries. Humanitarian assistance could still be provided despite these restrictions. The Foreign Operations conference agreement provides funding for various U.S. assistance programs, including counter-terrorism, USAID construction projects in specific countries, and bilateral security and military aid for \"front-line\" states. Congressional action includes small reductions in Foreign Operations accounts. The Foreign Operations conference agreement includes funding for U.S. assistance programs, with small reductions in accounts for \"front-line\" states. Turkey's aid package is reduced, with the possibility of transferring additional funds from the Iraq reconstruction program. Previous House action would have posed funding challenges for some \"front-line\" states. The House reduced the ESF recommendation by $275 million (10.8%), impacting \"front-line\" states like Afghanistan, Egypt, and Jordan. The legislation also reduced amounts available for MEPI by $100 million. Non-earmarked countries, including Pakistan, Turkey, Indonesia, the Philippines, and India, would have faced about a 21% cut in ESF funds. The Senate bill also included ESF reductions, with a cut of $120 million (5%), affecting aid to non-earmarked recipients by about 18% below requested amounts. President Bush proposed increasing foreign economic assistance starting in FY2004 to create a new Millennium Challenge Account. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) would provide funds to developing nations pursuing political and economic reforms in areas like good governance, healthcare, education, and entrepreneurship. It aims to increase foreign aid spending significantly, based on the belief that economic development thrives with free market and democratic principles. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to provide funds to developing nations based on their policy performance and accountability. It differs from previous aid programs in its size, competitive process, segregation of funds from U.S. foreign policy objectives, and solicitation of program proposals solely from qualifying countries. If fully funded, there could be a $5 billion increase in foreign aid spending by FY2006. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to provide funds to developing nations based on their policy performance and accountability. If fully funded, there could be a $5 billion increase in foreign aid spending by FY2006, resulting in a $19.3 billion foreign aid budget. In real terms, U.S. economic assistance in FY2006 would be $18.2 billion, the highest amount since FY1979. The nominal increase between FY2003 and FY2006 would be about 47%, while in real terms, FY2006 funding would be nearly 38% more. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) aims to increase U.S. aid to developing nations based on performance indicators related to good governance, economic freedom, and investing in people. Participation is limited to eligible countries with low per capita incomes, expanding to include lower-middle income countries by FY2006. Emphasis is placed on fighting corruption to qualify for assistance. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was proposed to manage the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a new independent entity separate from existing government agencies. The MCC would have a staff of about 100, led by a CEO confirmed by the Senate, overseen by a review board chaired by the Secretary of State. The decision to create a new organization for the MCA was a highly debated issue during early congressional discussions on the President's foreign aid initiative. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was proposed to manage the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a new independent entity separate from existing government agencies. The Administration argued for a \"fresh\" organizational structure for the MCA to ensure effective management, while critics raised concerns about potential fragmentation of policy development and consistency if it is placed outside the formal U.S. government foreign aid structure. Some suggested that USAID should manage the MCA, while others proposed the State Department as a suitable location. The Administration sought $1.3 billion for the MCA's first year in FY2004, with a commitment to a $5 billion budget by FY2006. The FY2004 budget request for the Millennium Challenge Account was lower than promised in 2002, with a phased funding plan leading to $5 billion by FY2006. Congressional appropriations provided $800 million in the House and $1 billion in the Senate, both below the $1.3 billion request. The Senate also included authorizing legislation in H.R. 2800. The House-Senate conferees agreed to provide $650 million for the Millennium Challenge Account in FY2004, half of the requested amount. The White House objected and lawmakers added back $350 million, bringing the total to $1 billion in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes $1 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account, with $650 million in Division D and $350 million in Division H. The Senate and House debated separate bills for authorization, which was eventually added to the Senate-passed Foreign Operations measure. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee previously reported legislation providing funding for the MCA in FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved legislation providing funding for the Millennium Challenge Account, with $1 billion in FY2004, $2.3 billion in FY2005, and $5 billion in FY2006. An amendment by Senators Biden and Hagel to establish the MCA within the State Department was approved, despite opposition from Secretary of State Powell. Senator Lugar proposed an alternative structure in new legislation, S. 1240, creating a Millennium Challenge Corporation headed by a CEO reporting to the Secretary of State. The Senate approved legislation for the Millennium Challenge Account, creating a Board of Directors with the Secretary of State as Chairman. The CEO of the Corporation would report directly to the Secretary of State for foreign policy guidance. The revised legislation was included in the Foreign Affairs Authorization, Fiscal Year 2004. The Administration did not object to the revised legislation, which allowed low-middle income nations to participate in the MCA program if appropriations exceeded $5 billion annually. The House International Relations Committee reported an MCA authorizing measure, H.R. 2441, with significant differences from the Senate and Administration. H.R. 2441 authorized $1.3 billion for FY2004, $3 billion for FY2005, and $5 billion for FY2006, creating a new Millennium Challenge Corporation with changes to the Board of Directors and CEO authority. The Board of Directors for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was restructured under H.R. 2441, with key changes including the addition of new members appointed by the President, and the CEO being responsible for determining eligible countries. Additionally, low-middle income countries could participate in the MCA program starting in FY2006. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was restructured under H.R. 2441 to allow low-middle income countries to participate in the MCA program from FY2006. The House passed H.R. 1950, incorporating MCA authorization, and the Senate added its version to the Foreign Operations Appropriations measure. Conferees in H.R. 2673 resolved differences and created the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The conferees agreed to create a Millennium Challenge Corporation with a CEO reporting to the Board of Directors. Low-middle income countries can participate in MCA programs from FY2006, with a cap of 25% of funds allocated. Authorization for FY2004 and FY2005 was approved, with no mention of FY2006 funding. The Millennium Challenge Corporation authorization was delayed until January 23, 2004, with a requirement for consultation with Congress and public disclosure of eligibility criteria. MCA operations will start later than expected, with a 90-day period between naming candidate and eligible countries for MCA assistance. Eligibility criteria and selection process details must be shared with Congress and published in the Federal Register. Public hearings may also be conducted. The selection of MCA eligible countries will likely not be announced before May 1, 2004. The Senate bill S. 925, which includes the Millennium Challenge Account authorization, is still pending. The House bill H.R. 1950 also includes MCA authorizing text. The House International Relations Committee incorporated MCA authorizing text into H.R. 1950, which was passed by the House on July 16. There is ongoing disagreement between the executive branch and Congress over allocating the core budget for USAID development assistance and global health programs. Congressional priorities include child survival, basic education, and combating HIV/AIDS. Congress has pushed for increased funding in these areas, while the Administration has objected to diverting funds from other development sectors. Congress and the executive branch have disagreed over funding priorities for development aid. Congress has increased appropriations for its priorities, leading to reductions in resources for other sectors. While recent years saw increased overall development assistance, the Administration argues that this limits their flexibility. The Bush Administration introduced revised USAID core goals in 2001, focusing on Global Health, Economic Growth and Agriculture, and Conflict Prevention and Developmental Relief. They also launched the Global Development Alliance (GDA) to promote public/private partnerships in development programs. USAID works to coordinate and integrate efforts with non-governmental partners to enhance development initiatives. The Global Development Alliance (GDA) was established to enhance development efforts with non-governmental partners. Despite initial ambitious funding requests, the GDA has received modest allocations, underscoring the importance of funding debates for development aid resources. President Bush announced plans for major foreign aid initiatives post-9/11, aiming to boost funding for development assistance programs. The Security Strategy established global development as a key pillar of U.S. national security alongside defense and diplomacy. The Administration proposed $2.84 billion for core development assistance in FY2004, representing an 8% reduction from the previous year, except for HIV/AIDS, democracy programs, and some economic activities. In FY2004, development assistance funding increased significantly with new initiatives like the Global AIDS Initiative and the Millennium Challenge Account, totaling $4.6 billion, a 49% increase from FY2003 levels. This growth was driven by activities outside of USAID's core development programs. In FY2004, total development aid increased to $4.6 billion, a 49% rise from FY2003. Supporters welcomed new initiatives like the Global AIDS Initiative and the Millennium Challenge Account, but were concerned about reductions in USAID's core development accounts. The latter support various development needs in over 55 countries, while the former focus on specific areas like HIV/AIDS and economic development in select countries. The FY2004 budget request for development assistance faced criticism for cutting amounts for \"core\" programs, with increases for HIV/AIDS coming at the expense of other development areas. Funding for infectious diseases, child survival, reproductive health, and vulnerable child programs were all reduced under the President's budget request. The Administration proposed reducing funding for infectious diseases, child survival, and vulnerable child programs from $27 million to $10 million in FY2003. Congress restored most of the funds cut by the President, with USAID receiving $154.5 million for non-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases. Other core development sectors saw varied budget changes, with agriculture programs increasing by 4% to $268 million, economic growth activities rising less than 1%, and democracy and local governance growing by 20%. Funding for core development areas in FY2004 would see declines in environmental activities by 6%, basic education by 2%, and higher education by 17%. Human rights and conflict prevention programs would be reduced by over one-third. However, resources for these sectors could increase significantly with the selection of Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) programs. The $1.3 billion allocated for FY2004 will support selected \"best performing\" low-income countries. In FY2004, funding for core development areas saw declines in environmental activities, basic education, and higher education. Human rights and conflict prevention programs were also reduced. However, resources could increase with the selection of Millennium Challenge Account programs. The largest growth area for development assistance was in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs funded by USAID. In FY2004, funding for core development areas declined in environmental activities, basic education, and higher education. However, there was an increase in resources for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care programs. The total request for HIV/AIDS in FY2004 was $1.92 billion, with an additional $680 million sought from non-Foreign Operations accounts. The President proposed a $200 million contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, which was a controversial issue. In FY2004, Congress increased the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS to $350 million and authorized \"up to\" $1 billion for FY2004. The House approved $3.43 billion for core bilateral development programs, exceeding the President's request by $140 million. The bill also added over $320 million to the Child Survival and Health account but reduced non-health programs by nearly $30 million. The House provided $1.27 billion for international HIV/AIDS, $30 million above the President's request and $395 million higher than FY2003. $1.9 billion was allocated for HIV/AIDS in both bills, with $500 million for the Global Fund. Funding was also restored for bilateral tuberculosis and malaria programs. The House bill increased funding for non-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases and trade capacity building activities. It also allocated $259 million for basic education, higher than previous years. The total amount directed for basic education across all Foreign Operations accounts was $350 million. The Division H of the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2004 mandates a 0.59% rescission for each account. It includes $53.5 million for AIDS-related programs in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. The Senate provided about $3.85 billion for bilateral development programs, exceeding the President's request and the House bill. The Senate allocated $1.54 billion for international HIV/AIDS, including $250 million for the Global Fund, surpassing the President's request. They also funded programs under the Global AIDS Initiative account and restored cuts to bilateral tuberculosis and malaria. The Senate bill proposed increasing spending for non-HIV/AIDS infectious diseases, with tuberculosis receiving $80 million and malaria funding set at $85 million. Other areas emphasized in the bill included basic education programs, environmental activities, and microenterprise, all set above the President's request. In Division H of H.R. 2673, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, lawmakers allocated $3.7 billion for development aid, $400 million higher than the President's request. Funding was increased for HIV/AIDS, infectious disease programs, basic education, family planning, and biodiversity. Congress set specific funding targets for 29 programs in the final legislation. The final legislation allocated $2.4 billion for global HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, with an additional $400 million for the Global Fund. This funding exceeded the President's request by $300 million. The final legislation allocated $550 million to the Global Fund for AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis, surpassing the Administration's proposal of $200 million. This funding was part of a $2.4 billion allocation for global HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, with an additional $400 million specifically for the Global Fund. Funds for AIDS Initiative are drawn from various economic aid programs, including Economic Support Fund, aid to Eastern Europe, and former-Soviet assistance. The FY2003 estimate for Trade Capacity Building was $449.1 million, with the conference agreement providing $503 million. The FY2003 estimate for Microenterprise programs was $160 million, with the conference agreement supporting the Senate Appropriations Committee report for funding at the authorized level for FY2004 ($200 million). The conference agreement supports the Senate Appropriations Committee report on funding for various Foreign Operations accounts, including Plant Biotechnology, Dairy Development, Basic Education, Environment activities, and Drinking Water activities. Funding levels for these programs vary, with some seeing increases over previous years. The conference agreement provides funding for various Foreign Operations accounts, including Energy Conservation/Climate Change, Iodine Deficiency Disorder, bilateral HIV/AIDS programs, Injection Safety Programs, Blood Safety Programs, bilateral tuberculosis programs, and bilateral Malaria programs. Funding amounts vary across these programs. The conference agreement provides $101 million for bilateral Malaria programs, $432 million for Family Planning/Reproductive Health programs. The Administration requested $425 million for bilateral population assistance for FY2004. Funding for U.S. population assistance and family planning programs overseas has been a contentious issue in Congress for nearly two decades. The contentious family planning issues debated in Congress focus on contributing to the UN Population Fund and applying abortion-related restrictions to USAID population aid grants. The most recent attention has been on the White House decision to block the US contribution to UNFPA due to concerns over forced abortion and sterilization practices in China. In 1985, Congress passed the Kemp-Kasten amendment barring U.S. funds to organizations involved in coercive abortion or sterilization programs. Despite being present in China, President Clinton determined in 1993 that UNFPA was not managing a coercive program. Congress has allocated around $25 million annually for UNFPA, with fluctuations based on spending in China. President Bush requested $25 million for UNFPA in FY2002. In FY2002, Congress allocated \"not more than\" $34 million for UNFPA in the Foreign Operations bill. The White House withheld UNFPA funds in January 2002 due to concerns about coercive practices in Chinese counties where UNFPA operates. An investigation team found evidence of forced abortions and sterilizations in UNFPA counties. The UNFPA-commissioned review team found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive family planning practices in China. Despite ongoing concerns about coercive practices in China, there are differing opinions on UNFPA's involvement in the country. The State Department sent its own investigative team to review UNFPA programs in China in May 2002. The investigative team led by former Ambassador William Brown found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive practices in China. Chinese leaders prioritize population control and are concerned about loosening controls. Recommendations include releasing $34 million to UNFPA and withholding funds until China ends coercion in population programs. The investigative team found no evidence of UNFPA supporting coercive practices in China. Despite the recommendation to release $34 million, Secretary of State Powell decided to withhold funds and redirect them to other family planning activities. The State Department's analysis determined that UNFPA's involvement in such programs, knowingly or unknowingly, could trigger the application of Kemp-Kasten. The State Department's analysis found that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program could lead to the implementation of coercive abortion practices. Critics opposed the decision due to concerns about the impact on voluntary family planning programs in multiple countries. The full analysis and report can be found on the State Department's website. The US denied funding to UNFPA in FY2003 due to concerns about its involvement in China's family planning program. Congress later allocated $34 million to UNFPA in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2003, with conditions to be met. The US denied funding to UNFPA in FY2003 due to concerns about its involvement in China's family planning program. The Administration transferred $34 million from FY2002 and $25 million from FY2003 to USAID for bilateral family planning programs. The State Department's justification for withholding funds cited lack of evidence that UNFPA no longer supports coercive practices. The President was required to certify this before restoring funding. The FY2004 Foreign Operations request also did not include funding for UNFPA. The FY2004 Foreign Operations request did not propose funding for UNFPA, but placed $25 million in \"reserve\" for voluntary contributions to international organizations. The \"Mexico City\" Policy, dating back to 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related activities and coercive family planning programs. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush Administrations restricted funds for foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. Several groups, including International Planned Parenthood Federation-London (IPPF-London), became ineligible for U.S. financial support due to restrictions on abortion-related activities. President Clinton reversed the policy in 1993, allowing funding for family planning organizations as long as no U.S. money was used for abortion-related work. The House and Senate had opposing positions on the Mexico City policy between 1996 and 2000, causing delays in enacting Foreign Operations spending measures. The Senate rejected House provisions on the Mexico City policy, leading to interim arrangements that allowed the Foreign Operations measure to move forward. The compromise removed restrictions but reduced population assistance to $385 million annually. President Clinton reluctantly agreed to a modified version in FY2000. President Clinton reluctantly agreed to a modified version of abortion restrictions in FY2000, allowing waivers for $15 million in grants to organizations. This had minimal impact on USAID family planning programs, except for a $12.5 million reduction in population assistance. In FY2001, Congress allowed the new President to set policy, delaying the obligation of $425 million in appropriations until after February 15, 2001. President Bush rescinded President Clinton's 1993 memorandum on January 22, 2001, reinstating the Mexico City Policy. He emphasized that taxpayer funds should not be used for abortions and maintained $425 million funding for population assistance. The restrictions were intended to not limit organizations from providing medical care. On February 15, 2001, USAID issued guidelines implementing the President's directive on population aid funds. Critics oppose the certification requirement, fearing cutbacks in services by family planning organizations, leading to more unwanted pregnancies and abortions. They also argue that the new conditions strain relations between the U.S. Government and foreign NGOs. Critics argue that U.S. policy imposes a \"gag\" order on foreign NGOs and multilateral groups regarding abortion laws in developing nations. Supporters of the certification requirement believe it closes the loophole of organizations using USAID funds for permitted activities while diverting other sources for abortions or lobbying. Since the reinstatement of the Mexico City policy in 2001, efforts to reverse it have been unsuccessful. The House approved $425 million for family planning programs, with conditions for UNFPA contributions to ensure no funds are used in China and no support for abortions. The Kemp-Kasten amendment terms were also included. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2004 Foreign Operations bill, including changes to international family planning funding and policy. The bill provided $445 million for bilateral family planning activities and reversed the Mexico City policy for foreign NGOs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2004 Foreign Operations bill, providing $445 million for bilateral family planning activities and reversing the Mexico City policy for foreign NGOs. Non-U.S. NGOs can receive U.S. funds for health services as long as they comply with local laws and U.S. laws. Foreign NGOs using non-U.S. government funds for advocacy may face restrictions similar to U.S. NGOs. The White House threatened to veto the bill if it included provisions lifting current prohibitions on overseas NGOs. The Senate bill earmarked $35 million for UNFPA in FY2004, subject to Kemp-Kasten limitations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $432 million for family planning assistance, with $34 million earmarked for UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten conditions. Funds cannot be used in China and must be kept separate. The conference agreement directs how previously withheld funds for UNFPA will be disbursed, resolving a dispute over their use. $34 million from FY2002 will go to family planning programs in twelve countries, while $25 million from FY2003 will support a new initiative for victims of trafficking in persons. The House voted to delete certain authorizing legislation related to Foreign Operations appropriation. The House voted to delete an amendment restoring U.S. funding to UNFPA from the Foreign Operations appropriation bill. The amendment would have required the President to find that UNFPA does not \"directly\" support coercive activities to receive funding. This would have made it harder for the President to block funding for UNFPA. The Senate added an amendment to reject the President's Mexico City policy in the Foreign Relations Authorization for FY2004 bill. The Administration opposes the amendment and threatens to veto the bill if it remains. Congress also considered requests for additional reconstruction aid for Afghanistan in 2003. The Administration requested $550 million for economic and military support for Kabul in February 2003. In the President's $87 billion FY2004 supplemental request, $799 million additional aid was proposed for Afghanistan. The total FY2004 aid package for Afghanistan amounted to nearly $1.6 billion, including appropriations from various acts. The FY2004 aid package for Afghanistan has reached nearly $1.6 billion, addressing ongoing security concerns, infrastructure destruction, and humanitarian needs. Reconstruction efforts and aid priorities have been ongoing since December 2001, highlighting the complex tasks ahead for the United States and the international community in balancing counterterrorism efforts with humanitarian assistance. The international community has provided significant aid for Afghanistan's reconstruction, with a long-term commitment needed for stability. Reconstruction costs are estimated to be over $15-$30 billion in the next decade. Key developments post-9/11 include security plans, the presence of ISAF, and the formation of Afghan security forces. The challenges facing Afghanistan post-9/11 include the lack of security due to former commanders maintaining control and ongoing fighting, hindering national government control, humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction progress. The three key themes for Afghanistan's recovery are demobilization of militias, political framework establishment, and reconstruction strategy creation. The ISAF, established by the Bonn agreement, has reached its agreed strength of about 5,500 with NATO assuming command in August 2003. Calls for ISAF expansion and deployment to other cities due to ongoing threats to Afghanistan's internal security. In October 2003, the U.N. Security Council formally backed an expansion of ISAF outside of Kabul by adopting Resolution 1510. U.S. forces, along with French and British forces, are training a new Afghan National Army to enable the Kabul government to maintain security independently. The targeted size of the army is 70,000, expected to take several years to achieve full strength. Japan and UN-led process of demobilization and integration of combatants also ongoing amidst continued fighting and insecurity. The Pentagon initiated the establishment of \"provincial reconstruction teams\" (PRTs) in Afghanistan in December 2002, involving U.S. military personnel to provide security for reconstruction efforts and extend Kabul government influence. Six PRTs are already operational, attracting NGOs due to improved security, marking a shift from relying solely on Afghan national army development or ISAF expansion for security. The United Nations has established a database to track security incidents in Afghanistan, aiming to provide timely information to aid organizations. The success of intervention and assistance depends on the strength of the central government. Humanitarian and reconstruction efforts face challenges in maintaining operations amidst complex needs and reconstruction issues. Afghanistan is facing challenges in resettlement, food security, shelter, and winter assistance, as well as reconstruction problems like rebuilding infrastructure and addressing landmines. The country is preparing for presidential elections in 2004 and parliamentary elections in 2005. The operating environment presents urgent challenges due to collapsed infrastructure, rugged terrain, extreme weather, and a large number of refugees and IDPs. The United States and other countries are assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, including training the new army and providing advice on judicial reform and establishing a national police force. UNHCR continues to assist refugees and IDPs, but concerns have been raised about the infrastructure's ability to support the returnees. Stronger links between humanitarian and reconstruction projects are needed for Afghans to move towards permanent resettlement. Germany is helping establish a national police force in Afghanistan, while the United States, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are financing the rebuilding of a major roadway. There have been complaints about the slow pace of pledged funds. The distribution of funds, whether multilaterally through U.N. agencies or bilaterally, impacts implementation. Increased funding for Afghan reconstruction efforts could have both positive and negative implications. It may lead to progress in security, road construction, and reconstruction before the 2004 elections, potentially benefiting moderates. However, concerns exist about potential corruption, absorption capacity, and effective allocation of additional funds. The international community's decisions and contributions could be influenced by increased funding, possibly leading to the expansion of ISAF beyond Kabul. The Tokyo Pledging Conference in January 2002 saw 61 countries and 21 international organizations pledging $1.8 billion for Afghan reconstruction. The U.S. government pledged $297 million from existing sources, raising concerns about potential support for the Karzai government before the 2004 elections. The Tokyo Pledging Conference in January 2002 saw 61 countries and 21 international organizations pledging $1.8 billion for Afghan reconstruction. Following the conference, the U.S. government approved an additional $970 million in assistance to Afghanistan through supplemental and regular appropriation bills. Kabul became one of the largest recipients of American aid, with a total of $686 million allocated in FY2002 and further assistance in FY2003. In FY2003, Congress passed over $700 million in appropriation acts, with $647 million for Foreign Operations programs. Congress increased levels beyond Administration requests, including $40 million for road construction in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized an additional $3.3 billion for Afghanistan over four years, including humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. The legislation includes funding for Afghanistan and other countries, with a call for an expanded International Security Assistance Force and an additional $1 billion authorization. The Administration requested $550 million for Afghanistan in FY2004, with a supplemental request of $1.2 billion in September 2003 as part of a larger $87 billion proposal for military operations and reconstruction programs in Iraq. In September 2003, the Administration requested $1.2 billion in additional assistance for Afghanistan, with $799 million for new appropriations and $390 million from previously appropriated funds. The new funding aimed to double U.S. assistance to Afghanistan in FY2003, focusing on projects with immediate impact on Afghan lives, including security measures and support for the Afghan government. The Administration requested $1.2 billion in additional assistance for Afghanistan in September 2003. This included $799 million for new appropriations and $390 million from previously allocated funds. The funding was intended for various projects such as reinforcing the Afghan government, completing a major highway, and supporting social programs and infrastructure. The White House also sought to increase the military drawdown limit from $300 million to $600 million. The House approved not less than $600 million for Afghan reconstruction in FY2004. The House and Senate approved over $600 million for Afghan reconstruction in FY2004, with a focus on supporting Afghan women and training the Afghan National Army and police. Efforts for continued support in Afghanistan include training for the Afghan National Army and police, combating narcotics production, bolstering democratic institutions, supporting opportunities for Afghan women in the economy and politics, and providing humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated $405 million for Afghanistan, exceeding the President's request. The FY2004 supplemental provides $50 million for peacekeeping activities in both Iraq and Afghanistan, with a total of $405 million earmarked for Afghanistan in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The specific account allocations listed in the conference report's Statement of Managers total $403 million. In the Foreign Operations bill, $405 million was allocated for various activities in Afghanistan, including reforestation, judicial reform, support for Afghan women, and assistance for communities affected by military operations. Congress did not provide funding for counter narcotics, law enforcement, and peacekeeping programs in H.R. 2673 due to higher appropriations in the FY2004 reconstruction supplemental. The Senate approved $799 million for Afghan reconstruction, while the House increased spending to $1.174 billion in H.R. 3289. The House and Senate agreed to increase funding for Afghan reconstruction to $1.174 billion in H.R. 3289, with additional allocations for Experts and Policy within the Elections and Improved Governance category. The enacted legislation also included funding for various projects in Kabul, such as a USAID interim facility and an annex to the U.S. embassy. The enacted legislation increased reconstruction funding by $365 million, with significant changes in allocations for infrastructure, governance, and social services. It included a $60 million earmark for women's programs, addressing issues like education, sexual abuse, and trafficking. President Bush submitted a response to concerns about delays and expansion of Iraq reconstruction activities. President Bush requested $20.3 billion for additional Iraq reconstruction and security funding in September 2003, part of an $87 billion package covering military costs and rehabilitation efforts in Afghanistan. Earlier in April, roughly $3 billion was approved for relief and reconstruction in Iraq. The funds included $2.48 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, supporting various sectors like water, electricity, and education. Additionally, $489.3 million was allocated for repairing oil facilities in the Department of Defense budget. The FY2004 supplemental funding aimed to support ongoing reconstruction efforts. The FY2004 supplemental funding of over $5 billion was intended to address urgent needs in Iraq, focusing on security, infrastructure, and judicial system reform. The funds would be used for training and equipment for security personnel, developing a new Iraqi army, and improving infrastructure such as electricity, oil facilities, water, transportation, and healthcare. Administration officials identified these as the most pressing needs for the next 12 months. The Administration's FY2004 supplemental funding of over $5 billion aimed to address urgent needs in Iraq, focusing on security, infrastructure, and judicial system reform. However, other important areas like government reform, agriculture, economic development, education, and civil society were not included in the funding request. Only $300 million was allocated for programs to support the private sector and job training. The conference agreement excluded funding for Iraq traffic police and reduced funding for prisons and other items. The conference agreement for the FY2004 supplemental funding excluded various items such as funds for consultants, emergency supplies, solid waste management, environmental restoration projects, a nationwide telephone numbering system, postal information architecture, housing communities, and a children's hospital in Basra. The FY2004 supplemental funding excluded funds for a children's hospital in Basra and American-Iraqi health care organization partnerships, but included additional funding for clinics and hospital modernization, micro-small-medium enterprises, and education in Iraq. The Bush Administration's key policy objectives in Iraq included restoring basic human services and the country's economic and political reconstruction. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) is responsible for administering Iraq and implementing assistance efforts. The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in Iraq, headed by L. Paul Bremer, is responsible for administering the country and implementing assistance efforts. It has appointed a 25-member Iraqi Governing Council with specific powers and duties, encouraging the establishment of local councils to address community needs. The CPA aims to lead Iraq towards self-rule and has initiated the process of formulating a national constitution. Since the U.S. occupation began in April, progress has been made in reconstituting civil and economic institutions in Iraq with CPA funding. Schools, hospitals, and essential services are functioning, while infrastructure projects and job programs aim to stimulate the economy. However, the occupation authority has faced criticism for failing to restore order, security, and implement political and economic reforms promptly. These challenges are interconnected, as reconstruction efforts rely on a stable environment. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address infrastructure and security concerns in Iraq that were hindering progress. The Administration initially believed reconstruction costs could be covered by Iraqi and existing U.S. resources. A national budget announced by the CPA allocated $8.2 billion for the rest of the year, with $3.9 billion expected to come from oil revenue, taxes, and state-owned enterprise profits. The $20.3 billion supplemental request for Iraq's reconstruction would be covered by frozen assets, the Development Fund for Iraq, and U.S. assistance. The Administration's reassessment indicated a greater need for funding due to lower expected revenue sources. The request was nearly 20% larger than Iraq's annual national budget. The $20.3 billion supplemental request for Iraq's reconstruction was intended to meet immediate needs in 2004. The World Bank and UNDP assessed reconstruction costs at $36 billion over four years, with an additional $19.4 billion estimated by the CPA. Total projected costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with $17.5 billion needed in 2004 alone. The United States may face increased financial demands if Iraqi oil revenues are not enough to meet projected needs. The Administration initially expected Iraq to cover most reconstruction costs through oil exports, but production challenges have lowered expectations. Current production rates are around 2 million barrels/day, with a goal of reaching 3 million by the end of 2004. Administration estimates prewar production levels at 2.5-3 million barrels/day. Ambassador Bremer and Undersecretary of State Larson projected Iraq's oil revenue to be $12 billion in 2004 and $19 billion in 2005. The Institute of International Finance predicted that oil revenue may not cover Iraq's operational budget in 2004, leaving nothing for reconstruction. $503 million was allocated in 2003 for oil facility repairs, with a $2.1 billion request for 2004. Additional funds were also allocated for Iraqi security forces. The $2.1 billion supplemental funds for Iraqi security forces aimed to prevent sabotage of oil facilities. There was a debate on whether reconstruction assistance should be in the form of loans or grants, with the Administration proposing grants while others suggested loans repaid from future oil revenues. Iraq's pre-war debt obligations of roughly $200 billion were a concern during congressional hearings, leading to an agreement to suspend debt servicing through 2004. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 protected Iraqi oil exports from creditor attachment until 2007. The debate also focused on who could assume responsibility for new sovereign debt, with the possibility of the World Bank managing a reconstruction trust fund. The World Bank may require a sovereign Iraq authority to assume debt obligations for project lending. The Coalition Provisional Authority currently signs for loans. Legal scholars debate whether an occupying power can incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign. Lawmakers converted $10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans. Lawmakers converted $10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans, with the possibility of restoring them as grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Various amendments were proposed in both the Senate and House, including using Iraqi oil to secure financing and establishing a Trust Fund within the World Bank for loans and loan guarantees. Representative Wamp proposed withholding half of Iraq's funds until after the election of a new Iraqi leader, while Representative Obey's amendment was defeated. The House and Senate conferees agreed to provide all Iraq reconstruction aid as grants rather than loans. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency in the early reconstruction contracts and the waiver of normal competitive bidding requirements. Some legislators requested the GAO to investigate contracting agencies' procedures. Some American firms and international organizations were excluded from Iraq reconstruction contracts by USAID and other agencies. Only a few select firms were deemed to have the necessary skills, with subcontractors likely to make up a significant portion of the total contract cost. Congressional action on the supplemental funding could impact contributions from international donors. The supplemental funding for Iraq reconstruction could influence international donors' contributions at the upcoming conference. Some argue that a large U.S. aid pledge could encourage more donations, while opponents fear that offering aid as loans may lead other donors to do the same, worsening Iraq's debt. The supplemental focuses on infrastructure and security, areas that other donors are less likely to support, as they typically prioritize social sectors like education and health in nation-building efforts. The international donors were hesitant to provide assistance for Iraq reconstruction due to concerns about being seen as supporting a unilateral U.S. policy. To address this, a proposal was discussed to create Iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the U.N. or World Bank, with a multilateral management board overseeing fund distribution. Undersecretary of State Alan Larson represented the U.S. in these discussions. Management of Iraq Reconstruction Funds by U.S. Agencies was a significant issue during congressional debate on the $2.475 billion appropriation in P.L. 108-11. The White House wanted to maintain flexibility over the distribution of resources, allowing the President to transfer funding to the Defense Department. This proposal sparked controversy, with critics arguing that aid programs should remain under the State Department's policy direction. The White House initially faced opposition from Congress over control of reconstruction funds for Iraq, but ultimately, Congress agreed to allow allocation among five agencies, including the Department of Defense. The $20.3 billion Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund was managed by L. Paul Bremer under DOD guidance. However, the White House later established the Iraq Stabilization Group, led by the National Security Advisor. The Iraq Stabilization Group, led by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, was established to expedite reconstruction efforts and resolve decision-making disputes in Washington. The State Department's role in reconstruction policy was expected to increase, with State Department staff in Iraq growing from 55 to about 110. Despite this, Ambassador Bremer would still report to the Secretary of Defense. Congress debated placing the CPA under the Secretary of State's authority, but the Senate tabled the amendment while the House added a provision to prevent coordination of defense or reconstruction activities by a U.S. government officer not authorized. The House Committee proposed ensuring that coordination of reconstruction activities in Iraq be led by a confirmed U.S. official, blocking National Security Council Advisor Rice from the role. The White House argued that the Defense Department still controlled reconstruction efforts. The provision was ultimately removed in conference negotiations. The Administration's request for Iraq reconstruction in FY2004 faced challenges from Congress regarding the prioritization and costs. Some congressional staff questioned the inflated price tag, suspecting it was to avoid returning for more funds. Senate amendments to redirect funds to other programs were not adopted, while the House proposed a $1.655 billion cut in reconstruction funding. The House bill proposed a $1.655 billion cut in Iraq reconstruction funding, reducing resources for activities deemed un-executable, low priority, or likely to receive funding from other donors. The President did not request additional funding for Iraq reconstruction in the FY2004 Foreign Operations Appropriations, and contracts awarded with appropriated funds were required to be subject to full and open competition. Conferees meeting on the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2004 addressed Iraq reconstruction funding matters. The House bill proposed a $1.655 billion cut in Iraq reconstruction funding, reducing resources for activities deemed un-executable, low priority, or likely to receive funding from other donors. Conferees meeting on H.R. 2673 decided to drop the House contract provision in Sec. 572, believing the issue had been adequately addressed in the FY2004 supplemental measure. The Senate-passed measure followed the President's funding requests, while the House bill reduced the recommendation by $1.65 billion and added sections requiring more detailed reporting to Congress on reconstruction activities. The House measure also placed limits on non-competitive contracting procedures. The White House announced the establishment of the Iraq Stabilization Group, led by national Security Advisor Rice. House and Senate negotiators agreed on total Iraq reconstruction funding similar to the House-passed amounts, with a focus on reducing funds for expensive or low priority activities. The conference agreement, approved in the House on October 29, included providing the entire aid package as grants, rather than as a loan as proposed by the Senate bill. The $10 billion loan in the Senate bill could potentially be converted to a grant if international creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. The FY2004 supplemental appropriations for Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terrorism were discussed in Congressional action. Various reports were mentioned, including CRS Report RL32090. The Millennium Challenge Account and Foreign Assistance Authorization Act were also part of the discussion.

The curr_chunk provides information on U.S. assistance in various countries such as Egypt, Haiti, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, the Middle East, Africa, and Palestine. The curr_chunk lists various reports on U.S. assistance in countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, North Korea, East and South Asia, and the Middle East. It also includes links to organizations like the World Bank, African Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank. The curr_chunk provides a list of international organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, and United Nations Development Program. The curr_chunk lists various U.S. government agencies and departments involved in international development and foreign aid, including UNAIDS, USAID, and the U.S. Department of State. The curr_chunk provides information on foreign operations budget authority, including reductions in accounts for regular FY2003 Foreign Operations and funds appropriated in the Iraq War Supplemental. The curr_chunk discusses the funds included in H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, with reductions in accounts for regular FY2004 Foreign Operations and funds for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 0.59% rescission represents a $103.6 million reduction from the approved amount. Amounts for Child Survival and Health exclude a $120 million contribution to UNICEF for consistency in comparisons. The FY2004 bill placed UNICEF funding in the International Organizations and Programs account, adjusting previous amounts. The House-passed bill included funding for the Global AIDS Initiative and famine prevention. The Administration request included the Ireland Fund. The enacted bill includes $650 million for the Millennium Challenge Account in Division D of P.L. 108-199, plus $350 million more in Division H, for a total MCA appropriation of $1 billion. The 0.59% across-the-board rescission reduces the total to $994.1 million. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill does not include funding for all foreign aid programs, as food aid and the Export-Import Bank are funded through other appropriations bills. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill and the official \"foreign aid\" budget are nearly identical. Changes in funding levels are sometimes due to technical budget accounting changes rather than policy decisions. For example, in FY1981, export credit programs began to be counted as appropriations. In FY1985, the full amount of military aid loans had to be appropriated. Congress changed how Federal credit programs are \"scored\" in FY1992, affecting the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in Foreign Operations. The data in Figure 2 illustrates general trends in Congressional decisions on Foreign Operations appropriations over the past 25 years. OMB estimated $3.5 billion for Iraq reconstruction, including $500 million from DOD for oil facility repairs. The World Bank website provides the full report on Iraq's Joint Needs Assessment. Various sources discuss the political and financial aspects of funding Iraq's economic revival. The legal status of foreign economic interests in occupied Iraq was discussed by various experts, including L.Paul Bremer and Pieter H.F. Bekker. The occupation of enemy territory and the law of belligerent occupation were also referenced. Additionally, Under Secretary of State Alan Larson emphasized that Iraq's reconstruction is an international responsibility. Secretary of State Alan Larson emphasized Iraq's reconstruction as an international responsibility. White House and Pentagon's roles in Iraq and Afghanistan missions were discussed in various news articles. GOP expressed concerns over the cost of rebuilding Iraq."
