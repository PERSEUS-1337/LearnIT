    "content": "The \"School Lunch Protection Act of 1993\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds an alarming number of instances of price-fixing and bid-rigging in food purchases for school lunch and breakfast programs. The Antitrust Division has filed numerous criminal cases related to bid-rigging conspiracies and similar activities involving dairy products sold to schools or the Department of Defense. Multiple grand juries in States are also investigating these activities. The Antitrust Division has prosecuted numerous cases of bid-rigging and price-fixing in food purchases for school programs, resulting in convictions and fines totaling $100 million. Despite this, the Secretary of Agriculture has not taken action against convicted dairy companies and individuals involved in bid-rigging for school contracts. Effective education and monitoring programs can help prevent such activities in the future. Reducing bid-rigging in school lunch programs can save millions of dollars annually for school districts, parents, and taxpayers. The Comptroller General of the United States recommends bid-rigging awareness training as an effective deterrent. A General Accounting Office report addresses concerns about bid rigging in the school lunch program. SEC. 25. DUTIES OF THE SECRETARY RELATING TO ANTICOMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES.
