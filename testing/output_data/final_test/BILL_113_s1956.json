The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act\" allows discharge boards to review and potentially change a covered member's discharge characterization to honorable if it was based on Don't Ask Don't Tell or a similar policy. The Secretary of Defense must ensure consistency in these changes across military departments. The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act\" allows discharge boards to review and potentially change a covered member's discharge characterization to honorable if there were no aggravating circumstances, such as misconduct, except for specific offenses related to sexual orientation or identity. The \"Restore Honor to Service Members Act\" allows covered members to request a review of their discharge by providing relevant documents or an affidavit if documents are not available. The appropriate discharge board must make efforts to locate specified documents within the Department of Defense records. The absence of such documents cannot be used to deny a discharge characterization change. Covered members can easily request a review of their discharge, and the board will review all relevant laws and records after a request is made. The appropriate discharge board must review all relevant information, including service records and oral testimony, to consider changing the discharge characterization of a covered member. If additional materials are needed, the board can request them in writing from the member or the Department of Defense. The discharge characterization of a covered member can be changed to honorable after a review conducted by the appropriate discharge board. The Secretary of Defense will reissue a revised DD-214 form for each member whose discharge characterization is changed, reflecting specific codes and authorities.

For members discharged before secretarial authority, the form will reflect universal authority at the time of discharge. Members with changed discharge status will be treated without regard to their original discharge.
