    "content": "The Animal Emergency Planning Act of 2015, also known as the \"Animal Emergency Planning Act,\" was enacted to address the need for disaster planning to protect animals and minimize the impact of disasters. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy emphasized the importance of preparedness for animals during disasters, as lack of planning can have devastating effects on both animals and those who care for them. The Act aims to ensure that commercial animal users demonstrate readiness to protect the animals under their care. The Animal Welfare Act is amended to include a new section requiring covered entities to develop and implement emergency contingency plans for animals. The Animal Welfare Act now mandates covered entities to create and follow contingency plans for the humane handling of animals during emergencies or disasters. Covered persons include research facilities, dealers, exhibitors, handlers, carriers, and Federal research facilities. The plan must identify potential emergencies, outline specific response tasks, and ensure proper care and housing of animals. The Animal Welfare Act requires covered entities to establish contingency plans for handling animals during emergencies. Plans must include evacuation instructions, chain of command, and annual reviews to ensure adequacy. Each covered person must train personnel in their roles outlined in the contingency plan, communicate plan changes within 30 days, and document personnel training. They must submit their contingency plan and related documentation annually to the Secretary and carry a copy while traveling. The Secretary of Agriculture must promulgate regulations within 30 days to implement section 30 of the Animal Welfare Act. The Act does not preempt state laws that offer equal or greater protection for animals. The amendments made by this Act provide equivalent or greater protection for animals, and apply to covered persons defined in section 30(a) of the Animal Welfare Act 30 days after enactment."
