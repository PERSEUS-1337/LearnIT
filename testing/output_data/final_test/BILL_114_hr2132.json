    "content": "ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFIT PILOT PROGRAM. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to energy-efficiency improvements for nonprofit organizations applying for grants. It defines an energy-efficiency improvement as a measure that reduces energy use from outside the building, including repairs or installations like roofs or lighting systems. An energy-efficiency improvement for nonprofit organizations applying for grants can include repairs or installations such as roofs, windows, doors, and heating, ventilation, or air conditioning systems. It can also involve renewable energy generation systems like solar, wind, or biomass. Nonprofit buildings, owned and operated by nonprofit organizations, can include hospitals, youth centers, schools, social-welfare program facilities, faith-based organizations, and other nonresidential buildings. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program to award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements. Grants may be awarded based on applications meeting specified criteria. The Secretary will award grants for retrofitting nonprofit buildings with energy-efficiency improvements based on performance-based criteria prioritizing energy savings, cost-effectiveness, evaluation plan, financial need, and matching contribution percentage. Each grant awarded shall not exceed 50% of the energy-efficiency improvement or $200,000. Grants require cost sharing. The grant awarded under this section requires a 50% non-Federal cost-sharing requirement, which can include in-kind contributions. $10,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020. Amendments are made to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 for fiscal year 2016 with an additional $150,000,000. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 authorizes $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2017 and 2018."
