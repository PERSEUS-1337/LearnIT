These species hold significant economic, ecological, recreational, and cultural importance to the nation. Thirteen salmon and steelhead species in the region are protected under the Endangered Species Act. The Federal Government, including Bonneville Power Administration's ratepayers, has spent over $8 billion on salmon recovery in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. Salmon and steelhead are vital economic resources supporting jobs in coastal and inland communities, serving as indicators of ecosystem health in multiple states. Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy levels will bring significant economic benefits to communities in several states. The original range of Snake River salmon included habitat in central Idaho, northeast Oregon, southeast Washington, the mid- and lower Columbia River, coastal waters of Alaska, California, Oregon, and Washington, upper Columbia River, upper Snake River Basin, southern Idaho, southeast Oregon, and northern Nevada. The United States Government has treaties with Indian tribes and Canada to restore salmon populations. Construction of Federal dams on the lower Snake River has impacted salmon and steelhead populations. Recent studies show that Snake River salmon and steelhead populations are declining rapidly, with some populations facing extinction within the next 20 years. Scientists recommend removing the 4 lower Snake River dams in Washington to protect and restore these endangered species. Recent studies recommend removing the 4 lower Snake River dams in Washington to protect and restore endangered Snake River salmon and steelhead populations. However, it is understood that dam removal alone is not a solution for the recovery of all salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. Other actions are necessary to further protect and restore these fish. The removal of the dams would impact electricity generation, freight shipping, and water supply systems, requiring benefits to be replaced through other means to protect local communities, farms, and the regional energy supply system. Studies have shown that the Northwest has abundant clean renewable energy sources to replace the power produced by the 4 lower Snake River dams. If these dams are removed, their energy benefits should be replaced with cost-effective renewable sources, energy efficiency, and conservation. The removal of the dams would open up 140 miles of free-flowing river, benefiting inland Northwest communities and improving freight transportation systems. A Federal court has found that the 4 lower Snake River dams violate water quality standards under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Sediment buildup behind Lower Granite Dam poses a flood risk to Lewiston, Idaho. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that protecting the area could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Global warming impacts are also a concern. Global warming is already affecting Pacific salmon populations, with Snake River salmon being crucial for their survival in the face of warming temperatures. A report commissioned in 2000 suggested that removing the 4 lower Snake River dams is a cost-effective way to restore wild salmon populations in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. The Columbia and Snake River Federal hydrosystem have been deemed illegal by Federal courts. The purpose of this Act is to protect and recover wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead to self-sustaining levels, while ensuring reliable, clean renewable energy and an economically sustainable salmon recovery program. It also aims to efficiently manage salmon recovery through biologically effective measures and rapid response to new actions. The Act aims to protect and recover wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead through efficient management measures and rapid response to new actions. Scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts is mandated by Section 3 of the Act, which aims to protect and recover wild Columbia and Snake River salmon and steelhead through efficient management measures and rapid response to new actions. The Secretary of Commerce must arrange for scientific analysis of federal salmon recovery efforts, including reviewing Snake River dam removal, to achieve recovery of salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia and Snake River Basin. The National Academy of Sciences will submit a report on the analysis within 12 months of the Act's enactment to relevant government agencies. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will report to Congress on the scientific analysis conducted under this section. SEC. 4. STUDY OF RAIL, HIGHWAY, AND BARGE IMPROVEMENTS. The Secretary of Transportation will analyze necessary rail, highway, and Columbia River barge improvements to maintain efficient transportation for shippers affected by the potential removal of the lower Snake River dams. Input will be gathered from stakeholders to address any cost increases and minimize impacts on shippers. The analysis of necessary rail, highway, and Columbia River barge improvements will be completed within 12 months after the enactment of this Act, based on input from stakeholders to address cost increases and minimize impacts on shippers. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change, will conduct a peer-reviewed analysis of energy replacement options for the 4 lower Snake River dams if they are removed. The analysis will include clean renewable energy resources, energy efficiency, conservation, and combined heat and power projects. A report will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. The Army Corps of Engineers will analyze riverfront revitalization opportunities if the 4 lower Snake River dams are removed, focusing on Lewiston, Idaho, and Clarkston, Washington. The analysis will include engineering options, costs, and peer review, with a report due to Congress within 12 months. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study on the impacts of removing the 4 lower Snake River dams on irrigation systems, cooling systems, and private wells. A report will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. Additionally, there will be an analysis of salmon recovery authorized and studied. The Secretary of the Army may remove the four lower Snake River dams and re-evaluate the feasibility study to address climate change impacts, replacement of energy output with renewable resources, and options for keeping irrigated acreage intact. Options for keeping currently irrigated acreage intact and under irrigation in a dam removal scenario, costs associated with Lower Granite Dam reservoir sediment/flood risk mitigation in a non-dam-removal scenario, passive use values related to dam removal and non-dam-removal scenarios, and alternate methods for removing the 4 lower Snake River dams are to be evaluated and reported to Congress within 20 months. The report must include determination of engineering options and costs, to be submitted for peer review to ensure accuracy. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. Clean renewable energy resources defined in this Act include incremental electricity from efficiency improvements in hydroelectric projects, wind, solar, geothermal energy, landfill gas, wave/ocean/tidal power, gas from sewage treatment facilities, and biomass energy from various organic sources. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of clean renewable energy resources, excluding certain types of wood waste and municipal solid waste. It also defines Federal salmon recovery actions and lower Snake River dams. The curr_chunk defines the 4 lower Snake River dams in Washington and populations of salmon and steelhead in the Columbia and Snake River basin listed under the Endangered Species Act."
