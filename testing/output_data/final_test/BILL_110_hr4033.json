    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act\". Congress finds that Langston Golf Course, Rock Creek Golf Course, and East Potomac Golf Course are owned by the United States and have a long history of serving the public in the nation's capital. East Potomac Golf Course, opened in 1920, initially had segregated play with African-Americans only allowed on Mondays. Rock Creek Golf Course opened in 1923 as a 9-hole course and was completed as an 18-hole course in 1925. Langston Golf Course opened in 1939 as a segregated facility for African-Americans, named after John Mercer Langston, the first African-American Congressman from Virginia. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and has been the home course of the Royal Golf Club and the Wake Robin Golf Club. The National Park Service has faced challenges in maintaining golf courses compared to other facilities. The National Park Service struggles to manage and maintain three historic golf courses due to concession restrictions that hinder revenue generation. These courses, with valuable historic components, face deterioration and limited public use, jeopardizing their preservation. Despite being undervalued assets, they can be modernized for affordable public use if restrictions are lifted. The National Park Service seeks private investment through long-term leases to modernize and maintain historic golf courses for affordable public use, bypassing traditional concession restrictions. SEC. 3. MANAGEMENT OF GOLF COURSES. Definitions for Rock Creek and Langston golf courses are provided, including their locations and boundaries within Washington, DC. The term \"East Potomac\" refers to the federally owned golf course and related facilities located in Washington DC. The Secretary of the Interior will ensure that month-to-month concessions contracts are continued for Rock Creek and Langston until the lease for East Potomac expires. The lease for Rock Creek, Langston, and East Potomac golf courses will commence when the lease for East Potomac expires. The lease requires the courses to be operated and maintained in a way that retains their historic nature, keeps fees affordable, allows for cross-subsidization, and includes a long-term ground lease. The Secretary will solicit proposals for the lease. The Secretary will solicit proposals through a competitive process to procure the lease for Rock Creek, Langston, and East Potomac golf courses. The lease must be entered into within 180 days after the effective date of the Act or 30 days after the expiration of the concession contract for East Potomac. The participation of disadvantaged business enterprises among the equity partners of the sponsors of the proposals is encouraged. The National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 applies. The Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998 does not apply to proposals, leases, and agreements under this Act."
