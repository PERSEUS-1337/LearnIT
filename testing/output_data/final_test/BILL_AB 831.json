    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges California's reliance on WASC accredited private nonprofit colleges for higher education. The Cal Grant maximum award for students attending these institutions has not increased significantly since 1999, facing multiple cuts over the years. If adjusted for inflation, the 2014 award level would be $13,346. The proposed maximum award for the 2015\u201316 award year for academically qualified, low-income students attending private nonprofit WASC accredited institutions in California is the lowest since 1997\u201398. The Cal Grant Program effectively supports historically underrepresented students from low-income families, ensuring predictable and stable funding to maximize the state's investment in higher education. Legislative action is needed to adopt a formula that provides predictability and parity for students at private nonprofit colleges. Section 66021.2 of the Education Code is amended to ensure student access to higher education through the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program. Starting from the 2001-02 academic year, Cal Grant A or B applicants can receive awards based on financial need if they meet specified criteria. To qualify for a Cal Grant award, a student must demonstrate financial need, achieve a specified GPA, and meet all eligibility criteria. The maximum Cal Grant A award for UC or CSU students covers mandatory systemwide fees. The maximum Cal Grant B award for eligible students equals mandatory systemwide fees in the attended segment, plus the access award. For community college students with waivers, the award is only for the access award in the first year. The maximum Cal Grant A award for students at nonpublic institutions equals the tuition award level established in the Budget Act of 2000. The maximum Cal Grant B award includes tuition award and access costs, with exceptions for the first year of enrollment. The maximum Cal Grant B award for students attending private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions is set at 75 percent of base funding per Cal Grant student at UC and CSU, plus the maximum award at those segments. For the 2015-16 award year, the maximum award is $9,084, and for the 2016-17 award year, it is 70 percent of the previous amount. For the 2017-18 award year, the maximum Cal Grant B award is 80% of the calculated amount, for 2018-19 it is 90%, and for 2019-20 and beyond, it is 100%. Private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions receiving Cal Grant maximum awards must submit performance metrics to the Association of Independent California Colleges and Universities. The association will collaborate with public higher education segments to determine the metrics' form and content, ensuring consistent data collection and reporting. A cumulative report with this data will be provided to the Legislature, Governor, Department of Finance, and Legislative Analyst's Office annually. Private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions must provide specific data for each institution participating in the program. The data required from private nonprofit postsecondary educational institutions includes the number of undergraduate and graduate students, percentage of California residents and transfer students, number of Pell Grant and Cal Grant recipients, ethnic composition of Cal Grant recipients, median institutional aid amount, and percentage of Cal Grant recipients among undergraduates. The curr_chunk provides information on graduation rates, number of degrees awarded, and recipients of Pell Grant and Cal Grant at the institution. It includes details such as disaggregated graduation rates for Pell Grant and Cal Grant recipients, as well as the number of degrees awarded in various categories. The Cal Grant C award must be used for occupational or technical training starting from the 2000-01 academic year. The Cal Grant T award is designated for one year of full-time attendance in a teacher credentialing program approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. An institution in California participating in the Cal Grant Program must maintain its level of need-based financial aid for undergraduate students at or above the 2000-01 academic year. The program aims to supplement the federal Pell Grant program and does not guarantee admission to a specific institution or program. Section 69432 of the Education Code is amended to include various types of Cal Grant Program awards, with maximum award amounts specified in the annual Budget Act. Starting from the 2013-14 award year, maximum tuition award amounts for Cal Grant A and B awards at private postsecondary institutions are outlined. For new recipients attending private postsecondary educational institutions, the maximum tuition award amounts are $4,000 for for-profit institutions and $9,084 for nonprofit institutions in the 2014-15 award year. For subsequent years, the amount is $8,056 for nonprofit institutions. Renewal award amounts are calculated differently, and there are changes in the maximum tuition award amounts starting from the 2015-16 award year. Starting from the 2015-16 award year, new recipients attending private for-profit postsecondary educational institutions accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges will receive a maximum tuition award of $8,056. This act is an urgency statute to immediately set Cal Grant award amounts for students attending private nonprofit institutions before the 2015-16 award year."
