    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program that provides medical assistance primarily for low-income individuals. In FY1999, total program outlays were $180.9 billion, with the federal government financing about 57% of all costs. The 105th Congress made changes to the program through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33) aimed to achieve Medicaid savings of $13 billion between FY1998 and FY2002 by reducing supplemental payments to hospitals serving Medicaid and low-income patients. It also increased states' flexibility in managing Medicaid programs, allowing for enrollment in managed care plans without a federal waiver and phasing out cost-based reimbursement for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics over 6 years. Additionally, the Act included Medicaid coverage for additional children. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (P.L. 106-113) included the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA 99), which made changes to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). This bill allowed for increased Medicaid payments to hospitals and extended access to a fund for Medicaid eligibility determinations resulting from welfare reform. The BBRA 99 extended Medicaid payments to hospitals and modified cost-based reimbursement for FQHCs and RHCs. SCHIP, established in BBA 97, provides federal funding for uninsured children below twice the poverty level. States can use SCHIP funds for health insurance or Medicaid expansions. States with approved SCHIP plans receive annual federal allotments based on a distribution formula. The SCHIP program, established in BBA 97, provides federal funding for uninsured children below twice the poverty level. States have flexibility in defining eligibility criteria for targeted low-income children. All states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have approved SCHIP plans, with various Medicaid expansions and separate state programs. BBRA 99 made changes to improve data collection, evaluate outreach practices, and modify the formula for distributing federal funds. BBRA 99 made changes to the formula for distributing federal SCHIP funds among states and increased amounts for U.S. territories. BBA 97 established the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) as a permanent provider under Medicare and Medicaid, offering health and long-term services to eligible beneficiaries without cost-sharing requirements. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program (Title V of the Social Security Act) provides formula block grants to states and territories for primary care services to mothers and children, Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and Community Integrated Service Systems (CISS) grants. Activities include research, training, genetic services, and improving maternal and child health. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant Program aims to reduce infant mortality and improve maternal and child health through integrated services at the community level. States must match federal funds received, with a minimum of 30% allocated for children with special health care needs. Title V authorizes $705 million annually, with BBA 97 creating diabetes grant programs for research and treatment. Each program receives $30 million annually from FY1998 to FY2002. The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1998 established a trust fund to make payments to individuals with blood clotting disorders who contracted HIV between 1982 and 1987. The fund received $655 million in appropriations to pay eligible claims. In late 2000, legislation was introduced by the House Committee on Commerce and the Senate Committee on Finance affecting programs such as the Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 5291) and the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000 (S. 3165). The Consolidated Appropriations Act 2001 (H.R. 4577) was passed on December 15 and included the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 5661) with significant changes to Medicaid. The legislation introduced in late 2000 by House and Senate committees included important changes to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as well as other health programs. Key provisions included adjustments to disproportionate share hospital (DSH) funding for states, applying the 175% hospital-specific DSH limit to certain public hospitals nationwide for a 2-year period, and providing additional funds for state public hospitals with high low-income utilization rates. The bill introduces major Medicaid provisions, including a new payment system for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics, modifications to HHS rules on payment limits for certain facilities, and an extension of transitional medical assistance. It aims to close loopholes in federal Medicaid payments and expands the entities qualified to make Medicaid decisions. The bill extends Medicaid presumptive eligibility rules for children and redistributes unused SCHIP funds to states. It also authorizes SCHIP Medicaid expansions and clarifies funding sources for benefits provided during presumptive eligibility periods. The agreement increases annual appropriations for the MCH Services Block Grant and extends funding for Special Diabetes Programs for Type I Diabetes and Indians. The agreement includes increased appropriations for MCH Services Block Grant and extends funding for Special Diabetes Programs. It also provides for a direct appropriation of $475 million for the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 would decrease federal outlays by $16.6 billion over 5 years and $69.2 billion over 10 years, with significant savings from revisions to Medicaid's upper payment limit. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 would decrease federal outlays by $16.6 billion over 5 years and $69.2 billion over 10 years. The provisions in the bill include changes to these programs, with detailed information available in related reports."
