    "content": "The United States Border Patrol (USBP) established a physical barrier in the San Diego sector in 1990 to deter illegal entries and drug smuggling. The initial 10-foot-high welded steel fence covered the first 14 miles of the border, starting from the Pacific Ocean. The 10-foot-high welded steel fence in the San Diego sector was constructed with the help of the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers. It was successful but costly, leading to the need for a multi-tiered enforcement system integrating infrastructure, manpower, and new technologies to control the border region. The concept of a three-tiered fence system was recommended in a 1993 study to control the border region. Congress responded with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, authorizing the construction of a triple-layered fence near San Diego. Section 102 of IIRIRA authorized the construction of barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego to deter illegal crossings. The AG was given broad authority to install physical barriers and roads in areas of high illegal entry. The term \"vicinity of the United States border\" was not defined, and specific characteristics for designating high entry areas were not specified. Section 102 of IIRIRA authorized the construction of barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border near San Diego to deter illegal crossings. The AG was given broad authority to install physical barriers and roads in areas of high illegal entry. The subsection does not specify the characteristics of high illegal entry areas. Section 102(b) mandated the construction of a three-tiered barrier near San Diego, with provisions for easements, safety features, and an appropriation not exceeding $12 million. Section 102(c) waived the Endangered Species Act for barrier construction. Section 102(c) waived the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act to expedite construction of barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. Apprehension statistics are used as a performance measure by the USBP, but may not provide a complete picture due to focus on events rather than individuals and the unknown number of successful evasions. Apprehensions data offer insight into the reality faced by USBP agents and trends in unauthorized migration along the border. Despite the construction of fences in the San Diego sector, apprehensions remained stable in the early 1990s. However, after increased enforcement measures in 1996, apprehensions dropped significantly, especially in areas with fencing. For example, apprehensions in Imperial Beach and Chula Vista stations decreased by 94% from 1993 to 2004. The San Diego sector saw a reduction in apprehensions due to increased resources such as more agents, underground sensors, and vehicles. This was part of the USBP's strategy to redirect unauthorized migration away from population centers to remote border regions. In contrast, the Tucson sector in Arizona experienced a significant increase in apprehensions in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, border fences in the San Diego sector led to a drastic reduction in apprehensions, proving successful in reducing cross-border smuggling and migration. However, opponents argue that the decrease in apprehensions was also due to increased manpower and resources, with unauthorized migration being rerouted to less-populated sectors. Only nine out of 14 miles of authorized fence were completed by 2004, with environmental concerns and litigation delaying the final three-mile stretch leading to the Pacific Ocean. The USBP proposed filling \"Smuggler's Gulch\" with dirt to extend the triple-fence across it. The completion of the border fence in the San Diego sector was delayed due to environmental concerns raised by the California Coastal Commission (CCC) in 2004. The CCC determined that the project did not align with the California Coastal Management Program and could have adverse effects on the environment, including the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve and endangered species. Congress did not specify a particular design in the IIRIRA and the CBP failed to present a convincing argument that the less environmentally damaging alternative projects it rejected would have prevented compliance with the IIRIRA. The 107th Congress expressed its sense that completing the 14-mile border project should be a priority for the Secretary of DHS. The 108th Congress considered measures to waive environmental laws, but no bill passed both chambers. The 109th Congress subsequently passed the REAL ID Act of 2005, authorizing the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all legal requirements. The REAL ID Act of 2005 authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive legal requirements for expeditious construction of barriers and roads under IIRIRA \u00a7102. District courts have exclusive jurisdiction to review claims against the Secretary's actions, with Supreme Court review possible. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 expanded the waiver authority to apply to all barriers under IIRIRA. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 expanded the waiver authority to apply to all barriers under IIRIRA, authorizing five stretches of two-layered reinforced fencing along the southwest border totaling roughly 850 miles. The San Diego fence project is permissible under the general fence authorization in IIRIRA. Legislation in the 110th Congress sought to expressly authorize the construction of the San Diego fence. CBP, along with the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard, have begun acquiring the necessary land for the San Diego border fence construction. The San Diego fence project, authorized under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, is estimated to cost $127 million for its 14-mile length. Construction costs vary, with the first 9.5 miles costing $31 million and the remaining 4.5 miles projected to cost $96 million. The Department of Homeland Security plans to hire private contractors to expedite construction. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act provides funding for the construction of the border fence in San Diego, with $35 million allocated. For FY2007, $30.5 million was recommended for the San Diego fence. Congress has also allowed DOD to assist in counter-drug activities, including building fencing and roads to reduce narcotics flow into the country."
