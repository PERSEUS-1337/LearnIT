    "content": "The \"Local Zoning Decisions Protection Act of 2017\" nullifies certain rules and notices related to fair housing by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It prohibits the use of federal funds for these purposes. SEC. 3 prohibits the use of Federal funds for a database on racial disparities or affordable housing access. SEC. 4 requires Federalism consultation and reporting. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must consult with State and local officials, as well as public housing agencies, to develop recommendations in line with the Fair Housing Act. Consultation requirements include providing notice and opportunities for participation, and seeking input from a diverse range of perspectives in the United States. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must collaborate with State and local officials, as well as public housing agencies, to develop recommendations aligned with the Fair Housing Act. This includes promoting transparency, seeking timely input, and exploring alternative means to achieve Federal objectives. Within 12 months of the Act's enactment, a draft report with recommendations must be published in the Federal Register. The draft report in the Federal Register must include recommendations developed with consensus among the Secretary, State and local officials, and public housing agencies. If consensus is not reached on a regulatory proposal, the report will note the areas of agreement and disagreement. The Secretary will make the draft report available for public review and comment for 180 days. A final report will be prepared within 12 months, addressing comments received and describing the results of the consultation process. The Secretary will publicly release the final report online within 12 months of the enactment of the Act. Definitions for \"Secretary,\" \"local government official,\" \"State official,\" and \"public housing agency\" are provided in the Act. The term \"agency\" is defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937."
