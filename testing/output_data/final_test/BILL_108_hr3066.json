    "content": "The Act titled \"Clarifications to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\" eliminates the requirement for the \"validation notice\" in formal pleadings and codifies the consumer validation notice. Section 809 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is amended to include an alternative version of notice in subsection (e), which must include the amount of the debt, the name of the creditor, and a statement regarding disputing the validity of the debt within 30 days. The office assumes the debt is valid unless disputed in writing within 30 days. Verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment will be provided upon request. The office will also provide the name and address of the original creditor if different from the current creditor. SEC. 4. Amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to clarify that collection activities can continue within the first 30 days. SEC. 5. Clarifies references to \"attorney\" and \"reasonable time.\" SEC. 5 amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by specifying that \"attorney\" is now \"attorney at law\" and \"a reasonable period of time\" is now \"30 days.\" Subsection (c) of section 805 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is amended to state that if a consumer notifies a debt collector in writing to stop communication regarding a debt, the debt collector must comply, except for one final communication for specific purposes. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act allows a consumer to request in writing for a debt collector to stop communication, with exceptions for one final communication for specific purposes. If the consumer sends the request by mail, notification is considered complete upon receipt. The \"Brady Amendment\" to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act clarifies that a debt must be disputed in writing by the consumer. Additionally, the amendment requires that any validation of debts must be done in writing."
