The \"Working Families Child Care Act of 1997\" finds that quality child care is a major obstacle for working parents, especially the working poor who receive the least assistance. Low-income families spend a significant portion of their income on child care, with many states having waiting lists for child care services. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $1.4 billion decrease in child care expenditures. Some states have waiting lists for child care services, with low-income families facing financial difficulties. The implementation of work requirements under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 will result in a $1.4 billion decrease in child care funds for working poor families. Certain states lack important types of child care, such as infant care, school-age care, care for children with disabilities, and child care for parents with unconventional work hours. A 1995 State study found shortages of child care for infants, children with special needs, and all types of child care in inner cities and rural areas. Only one-third of schools in low-income neighborhoods offer school-age child care, compared to 52 percent in more affluent areas. Eighth-graders left home alone for 11 or more hours a week show increased use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. Existing child care arrangements do not fit the work schedules of many working women, with 1 in 5 full-time workers and 1 in 3 women working nonstandard hours. Only 10 percent of child care centers provide care. Only 10 percent of child care centers and 6 percent of family day care providers offer child care on weekends. One-third of working mothers below the poverty level and one-quarter of mothers with incomes below $25,000 work on weekends. Less than 30 percent of Head Start programs operate full-time, full-year. Assistance for low-income working families is being addressed through an amendment to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990, specifically focusing on funding of grants. Authorization of $2 billion for fiscal years 1997-2002 to provide child care services for families in need, funded through grants to States. Authorization of $2 billion for fiscal years 1997-2002 to provide child care services for families in need, funded through grants to States. Grants for child care supply shortages. Grants for Child Care Supply Shortages: States must use 100% of funds from 1997-2002 to address shortages in child care services in specific geographic areas. Child care activities described in this clause include infant care programs, before- and after-school child care programs, resource and referral programs, nontraditional work hours child care programs, extending pre-kindergarten program hours, and any other child care programs deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Authorization of Appropriations for Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to allocate $500,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1997 to 2002 to address child care supply shortages. A conforming amendment is made to adjust section 658(c)(3)(A) by changing \"(D)\" to \"(E)\". SEC. 5. REPORT ON ACCESS TO CHILD CARE BY LOW-INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. The amendment to the Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 requires reporting on the total number of families eligible for assistance but did not receive it, along with obstacles, and the total number of families that received assistance and how it was provided. The Child Care Development Block Grant Act of 1990 now requires reporting on the total number of families eligible for assistance, with a focus on access for low-income working families. The Act and its amendments take effect as if included in the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996."
