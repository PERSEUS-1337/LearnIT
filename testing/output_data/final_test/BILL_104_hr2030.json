    "content": "The \"Parental Choice in Television Act of 1995\" allows parents to choose television programming for their children. The Congress finds that television has a significant influence on children's values and behavior, with some children exposed to up to 11 hours of TV a day. Studies show that children exposed to violent programming at a young age are more likely to exhibit violent behavior later in life. Children in the United States are exposed to a high amount of violent and sexual content on television, leading to concerns about the impact on their behavior and attitudes. Parents are worried about the influence of such programming and support technology that allows them to control what their children watch. The government aims to empower parents by providing them with tools to block harmful video programming for children. This includes establishing a Television Rating Code to give parents timely information and technological means to restrict violent or sexual content. The Commission established a committee with representatives from television broadcasters, producers, cable operators, public interest groups, and other private sector individuals to create rules for identifying and rating video programming containing sensitive material for children. Additionally, rules were implemented for distributors to transmit signals with program ratings, allowing parents to block inappropriate content. The Act requires televisions to have circuitry enabling parents to block inappropriate programming for children. Televisions manufactured or imported in the US with screens 13 inches or larger must allow viewers to block channels, programs, and time slots, as well as all programs with a common rating. Additionally, regulations are in place for shipping or importing televisions with blocking capabilities. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include regulations on shipping, manufacturing, and importing apparatus described in section 303(w). The rules prescribed by the Commission must be followed, except for carriers transporting the apparatus without trading it. The Commission oversees industry standards for blocking technology, ensuring apparatus can receive rating signals conforming to specifications. The Commission will take action to maintain blocking service availability as new video technology emerges. Amendments are made to Section 330(d) of the Act. The Commission will enforce industry standards for blocking technology and ensure devices can receive rating signals. Amendments to Section 330(d) of the Act will take effect one year after enactment, pending distributor compliance with voluntary rating rules for video programming. The FCC will set the effective date for implementing regulations on manufacturing provisions after consulting with the TV industry."
