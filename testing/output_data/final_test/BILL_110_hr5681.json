The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2007. The tax credit for qualified research expenses can be up to 20% of the expenses exceeding 50% of the average expenses from the previous 3 years.

For basic research payments, the taxpayer can receive a 100 percent credit instead of 80 percent. A basic research payment is defined as cash paid by a corporation to a qualified organization for basic research under a written agreement. The term 'qualified organization' refers to educational institutions that conduct basic research under written agreements. Certain scientific research organizations that are described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a), organized primarily for scientific research, and not a private foundation, qualify as tax-exempt organizations. Scientific tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6), exempt from tax under section 501(a), promote scientific research by qualified organizations through written research agreements, and expend most of their funds on basic research. Scientific tax-exempt organizations promote basic research by providing grants or contracts to qualified organizations described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). Established before July 10, 1981, a tax-exempt organization must meet specific requirements to make grants for basic research and elect to be treated as a private foundation for tax purposes. The tax-exempt organization must meet requirements to make grants for basic research, defined as original investigation for scientific knowledge advancement without specific commercial objectives, excluding research outside the US and in social sciences, arts, or humanities. The tax-exempt organization must meet requirements to make grants for basic research, which is treated as a trade or business payment in the taxable year it is made. Certain corporations, such as S corporations, personal holding companies, and service organizations, are not eligible. Section 41 of the Code is amended by removing subsection (e). The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by removing subsections (e), (f), and (g) in Section 41 and making adjustments to Section 45C(b)(1)(B)(ii).

A study will be conducted by the Secretary of the Treasury on taxpayer compliance with substantiation requirements for claiming the credit under section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code. The study will assess record-keeping, impact of non-compliance on IRS oversight, enforcement, and burdens on other taxpayers. The results will be reported to the Committee. The Secretary will report the study results to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, with recommendations for improving compliance with requirements."
