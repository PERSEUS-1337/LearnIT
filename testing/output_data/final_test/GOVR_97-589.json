    "content": "The Constitution vests federal legislative power in Congress and sets the process for passing legislation. Judicial interpretation of statutes is authoritative and can guide future cases and legislative actions. The Supreme Court's approach to statutory interpretation focuses on the text itself. This report emphasizes \"textualist\"-based means of interpreting legislative language, which considers the \"law\" to be embodied in the language of the statute and its plain meaning. Textualism eschews explanatory legislative materials and extrinsic sources, focusing solely on the statutory language. Despite its prevalence, textualism is not the only approach to statutory analysis, as this report also briefly discusses \"intentionalist\"-based means of interpretation. The report discusses textualist and intentionalist approaches to interpreting statutes, highlighting that textualism focuses on the plain meaning of the statute while intentionalism considers broader legal contexts. The Court may use multiple methods of statutory analysis in opinions, critiquing differing viewpoints. Neither textualism nor intentionalism is strictly limited to the enacting Congress's actions. When interpreting statutes, the Supreme Court uses content-neutral canons and presumptions to determine legislative intent. These rules and conventions help the Court consider broader legal contexts and congressional deliberations, aiding in choosing among drafting options. The Supreme Court uses content-neutral canons and presumptions to determine legislative intent when interpreting statutes. Congress can amend a statute to override the Court's interpretation, but this process can be lengthy and uncertain. The Court applies the \"plain meaning rule\" to statutes that are clear and unambiguous, emphasizing that legislative power resides in Congress. The interpretive process of statutory language involves analyzing specific words and phrases, considering how they are used in other parts of the statute, and understanding the overall structure and purpose of the law. The focus is on the text itself, with less emphasis on legislative history or external aids. The \"plain meaning rule\" now holds more weight in statutory analysis, making the text the primary source for interpretation. Statutory text is now considered both the starting and ending point for interpretation, with a focus on the whole statute within its broader context to further statutory purposes. Justice Scalia emphasized the importance of interpreting provisions holistically, as ambiguity can often be clarified by the rest of the statutory scheme. Chief Justice Taney also described this process in 1850. The interpretation of statutory directives is shaped by the whole law, including definitions, findings, purposes, and relationships to other directives. Courts may also consider the broader body of law. However, legislative realities like bundled deals and omnibus bills can limit the application of \"whole act\" methodologies. The Supreme Court often cites general rules or canons in its decisions. The Supreme Court uses general rules of construction to interpret statutory meaning, presuming that Congress is aware of these rules. The primary goal of statutory construction is to fulfill the legislative purpose expressed in the text. Justice Jackson emphasized the importance of interpreting the text in line with the overall legislative policy, using language canons as analytical tools for understanding meaning. The \"language\" canons of construction are analytical guides based on linguistic principles for interpreting unclear text. These canons consider factors like ordinary meaning, context, and statute structure to infer meaning. They provide different perspectives and insights, but are intrinsic aids only, not precluding consideration of contrary evidence. Different views can offer well-reasoned interpretations. The language canons are intrinsic aids for interpreting unclear text, not rules of law. They offer different perspectives but are limited in utility as a stand-alone method of statutory construction. Professor Karl Llewellyn emphasized the importance of considering current circumstances in applying a statute, criticizing the idea of there being only one correct answer. The language canons are tools for interpreting unclear text, not strict rules. They provide different perspectives but are limited when used alone. Professor Karl Llewellyn argued that there can be more than one correct answer in interpreting statutes, suggesting that judges may choose canons to support their desired outcome. Statutory construction should be narrow, canons are rules of thumb to determine legislation meaning. Courts must presume legislature's intent in unambiguous statutes. Interpreting a statute involves understanding ordinary vs. specialized language usage. Statutory construction relies on the meaning of terms as understood by Congress when the statute was passed, whether defined in the statute or based on accepted legal meanings. When Congress borrows terms of art, it adopts the cluster of ideas attached to each word unless instructed otherwise. Words not defined in statutes are given their ordinary meanings, often from the dictionary. The Court has used dictionary definitions to interpret terms like \"marketing\" and \"principal\" in various legal contexts. The Supreme Court has used dictionary definitions to interpret terms in legal contexts, including the meaning of \"cognizable\" in the Federal Tort Claims Act. Context is crucial in determining the interpretation of terms, as seen in cases where the broadest dictionary meaning or common understanding was debated. The Supreme Court has used dictionary definitions to interpret terms in legal contexts, including the meaning of \"cognizable\" in the Federal Tort Claims Act. In close cases, the Court may look beyond the words of a statute for guidance and consider the statute's broader purpose or fit with other laws. Judge Learned Hand emphasized the importance of understanding the purpose or object of statutes for their interpretation. In legal interpretation, the use of \"and\" and \"or\" in statutes may not always follow strict grammatical rules. The choice of definite or indefinite articles can also impact meaning. Additionally, the words \"shall\" and \"may\" typically indicate mandatory and permissive actions, respectively, within a broader statutory context. The use of \"shall\" and \"may\" in statutes indicates mandatory and permissive actions, respectively, within a broader statutory context. The context often determines whether a directive is mandatory or permissive, and specific terms in a statute usually prevail over general terms. Specific terms in a statute typically override general terms. In a case discussing this principle, the Court ruled that time spent preparing pretrial motions does not extend the Speedy Trial Act's trial deadline. Despite the Act allowing delays from various proceedings, time spent on motions does not count towards this. The interpretation of language in subparagraph (D) on delays due to pretrial motions does not include time spent preparing motions before they are filed. Context is crucial in interpreting statutes, with the principle noscitur a sociis guiding that words grouped together should have related meanings. For example, the term \"discovery\" in a tax provision was limited to activities related to oil and mineral extraction, not patented cameras or pharmaceuticals. Similarly, the term \"defalcation\" in a bankruptcy code provision was inferred to require intentional wrongdoing based on its placement in a list of fraudulent activities. The term \"defalcation\" in a bankruptcy code provision was inferred to require intentional wrongdoing based on its placement in a list of fraudulent activities. The term \"administrative\" in a phrase regarding reports was broadly construed to include state bodies, and the term \"report\" was interpreted to cover raw contractor documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Noscitur a sociis can be a factor in interpretation but is not a strict rule. The principle of noscitur a sociis can guide interpretation but is not a strict rule. Ejusdem generis states that general words following specific items apply only to similar items. Punctuation may be disregarded to determine the true meaning of a statute. The modern Court recognizes that punctuation may clarify the meaning of a statute, but still enforces the plain meaning regardless of punctuation. In a case where punctuation was deemed a scrivener's error, the Court departed from the plain meaning based on evidence from the law's structure, language, and subject matter. The Court assumes legislative drafters write precisely, following grammar rules, but multiple grammatical principles may apply in interpretive challenges. The interpreter faces interpretive challenges when multiple grammatical principles may apply, leading to different interpretations. For example, the \"rule of the last antecedent\" states that a limiting clause should modify only the noun it immediately follows. This was applied in a case where the Court upheld the government's position that a claimant was ineligible for SSI based on the availability of work in the national economy. The Court upheld the government's position that the claimant was ineligible for SSI based on the availability of work in the national economy. The phrase \"which exists in the national economy\" only applied to \"other kind of substantial gainful work.\" Additionally, a provision in the federal criminal code mandates restitution for the victim's losses, including specific types of loss and any other losses as a proximate result of the offense. The Court emphasized the importance of following grammatical rules in statutory drafting to ensure every clause and word is given effect. Statutes should be construed to avoid rendering any language superfluous. Statutes should be construed to avoid rendering any language superfluous, with a presumption that changes in statutory words indicate a change in meaning. This principle is especially important in criminal offenses, where every word describing an element should be given significance. Differences in interpretation may arise when trying to give effect to all statutory language, balancing distinctions between similar terms without distorting their meaning. The presumption against surplusage also applies to redundancies across statutes. The presumption against surplusage in statutory interpretation guides the avoidance of redundancies across statutes. Courts should not add language that Congress has not included, and terms appearing multiple times in a statute are generally read the same each time. This principle is strongest when a term is repeated within the same sentence or in inter-related programs. The general presumption is not rigid and should be applied consistently within the same section of a statute. The general presumption in statutory interpretation is not rigid and can be overridden by context and statutory history. When Congress includes specific language in one section of a statute but omits it in another, it is presumed to have done so intentionally. This principle was cited by the Court in a case involving access to courts for Guantanamo detainees. The exclusion of language in one statutory provision, when included in other provisions of the same statute, may lead to negative inferences. The Court has applied this principle in various cases, such as distinguishing among different categories of veterans benefits and drug offenses. However, the maxim does not definitively establish the meaning of the language. The Court sometimes contrasts a party's interpretation of language with clearer expressions of the same concept. Using specific terms or not in a statute may influence liability. However, unclear language doesn't always help determine its meaning in context. Congressional statutes may reflect intentional choices or compromises that don't necessarily indicate a different outcome. Congress may not always address all issues directly when legislating on a subject, and silence does not always indicate intent. Congressional silence can signify ruling out a specific application, expecting no further clarification is needed, or simply not considering an issue at all. The Court does not credit inferences drawn from congressional silence when contrary to other evidence of intent. Congress is expected to address major issues directly, not hide important decisions in vague terms. For example, when the Court ruled FDA couldn't regulate tobacco as drugs, it stated Congress wouldn't delegate such a significant decision in a cryptic manner. Negative inferences can also be drawn from statutory silence. The negative inference principle, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, applies when Congress specifically taxes certain ticket sales but not others, leading the Court to refuse extending the coverage. The Court does not imply additional exceptions to a general prohibition if Congress has already enumerated specific exceptions. This principle was used in a case involving a statute requiring payment of an attendance fee to a witness, where it was applied to an incarcerated state prisoner testifying at a federal trial. The principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius applies when Congress specifically taxes certain ticket sales but not others, leading the Court to refuse extending the coverage. In a case involving a statute requiring payment of an attendance fee to a witness, it was found that the general language 'witness in attendance' includes prisoners, despite exceptions for detained aliens and incarcerated witnesses. The Court also determined that a statutory listing may be exemplary, not exclusive, allowing for attorney's fees and costs to be awarded in cases not involving bad faith and harassment. The Court determined that the FDCA does not categorically bar the award of costs to any class of defendants prevailing in FDCA actions, subordinating general canons of statutory construction in some circumstances. The principle of de minimis non curat lex is considered in determining if an activity is a minor deviation from a prescribed standard. The Court prioritizes substantive canons of construction over general linguistic principles, favoring certain results unless rebutted. These canons protect values from the Constitution, federalism, and judicial administration. Congress is presumed to legislate with knowledge of existing common law, which remains in force unless clearly indicated otherwise. When Congress establishes civil actions for violations of antitrust laws and RICO, common law principles of \"proximate cause\" are incorporated to determine liability. Showing a direct and immediate connection between violation and harm is necessary, not just a \"but for\" relationship. Congress adopting common law on abandonment of property in the Bankruptcy Code means all judge-made corollaries and exceptions are also adopted. If Congress intends to change a judicially created concept, it must make that intent specific. In bankruptcy cases, the Court has held that Congress must make specific intent clear when changing judicially created concepts. The presumption of continuation of common-law rights and causes of action can be overcome by general reference to a statute's purpose. The validity of a patent is presumed valid and can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence. The Justices have disagreed on whether certain language in statutes indicates an intent to overcome the presumption of continuation. The Federal Employers' Liability Act holds railroads liable for employee injuries caused by carrier negligence, superseding common law rules. The Supreme Court determines if federal law supersedes state law based on congressional intent and the preservation of state police powers. The Supreme Court faces challenges in interpreting federal regulatory statutes regarding preemption of state law. Questions arise about conflicts, congressional intent, and field occupation. The Court considers these issues on a case-by-case basis, showing deference to states in interpreting Congress's intent. The Supreme Court ruled that state judges are not considered \"employees\" under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, citing the Tenth Amendment and Guarantee Clause to protect state sovereignty. Congress must clearly state its intention to abrogate states' Eleventh Amendment immunity, with limited authority to do so. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress's general legislative powers under Article I cannot circumvent the constitutional limitations of federal jurisdiction by the Eleventh Amendment. The principal source of power to abrogate state immunity lies in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Despite restrictions, Congress can authorize suits against states and incorporate state law into federal law. Sovereign immunity waivers must be clearly expressed in statutory text. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot bypass federal jurisdiction limitations with general legislative powers under Article I by the Eleventh Amendment. The power to abrogate state immunity lies in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Sovereign immunity waivers must be clearly expressed in statutory text, separate from legislative history. Money damages availability when immunity is waived varies in interpretation, with some cases requiring unambiguous statements for liability. In cases involving immunity, the issue may be whether a sovereign state has extended immunity to substate or private entities. To claim immunity, it must be shown that the extension was a foreseeable result of clearly articulated statutory language. Retroactive application of civil statutes is generally disfavored unless there is clear direction by Congress. \"Statutory provisions do not apply retroactively unless there is clear congressional intent. The prohibition on ex post facto laws prevents retroactive application of penal laws. Courts must interpret statutes to avoid constitutional doubts. Every reasonable construction must align with Congress's intent.\" The intent of Congress is to save statutes from unconstitutionality. The majority view prevails, and legislation of Congress is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States to avoid clashes with other nations' laws. The 2010 securities fraud case reinforced the presumption against extraterritorial application of U.S. securities law. The Court ruled that no fraud-related cause of action was available for foreign transactions in foreign securities, as Congress had not indicated intent to cover those transactions. This decision aimed to prevent unintended clashes with other nations' laws. The Supreme Court's ruling in a 2010 securities fraud case reinforced the presumption against extraterritorial application of U.S. securities law. The Court found that jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute over a foreign tort against a foreign national was limited, with the majority citing the presumption against extraterritoriality as a barrier. However, four concurring Justices took a more neutral approach, considering the ties each case has to the U.S. before determining jurisdiction. The Supreme Court considers ties to the U.S. in determining jurisdiction over cases involving alleged torts, with a strong presumption for judicial review of administrative actions unless there is clear evidence of intent to preclude it. The Court interprets preclusions narrowly, allowing for review of regulations and practices even when judicial review of individual cases is barred. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 embodied the presumption of reviewability in statute, allowing for judicial review of final agency actions unless statutes preclude it or the agency action is committed to agency discretion by law. The second exception applies in cases where statutes provide no meaningful standard for review. The Court in Webster v. Doe examined the National Security Act's language on the Director of Central Intelligence's discretion to terminate employees, concluding that courts generally cannot review such decisions. However, the Court clarified that constitutional claims could still be reviewed unless Congress explicitly states otherwise. Executive agencies interpret statutes to implement regulatory policies and processes. Courts must decide how much deference to give agency interpretations of the law. When reviewing agency decisions, courts typically defer to reasonable agency interpretations unless the statute compels a specific outcome. Courts defer to reasonable agency interpretations under the Chevron rule, announced in 1984. Recent decisions clarified that Chevron deference applies only to formal agency processes authorized by Congress. Other agency interpretations are reviewed under pre-Chevron principles. Congressional intent is crucial in interpretation, with the first question being whether Congress has directly addressed the issue. The Chevron rule requires courts to defer to agency interpretations if Congress has not directly addressed the issue. This deference is a significant departure from previous approaches to statutory construction. The Chevron rule requires courts to defer to agency interpretations if Congress has not directly addressed the issue. Courts may defer to \"reasonable\" agency interpretations, but the Supreme Court has also found that Congress has settled some matters, leading to no need for deference. The determination of whether Congress has \"directly spoken\" leaves room for interpretation between express delegation and legislative resolution, with factors like oversight, anticipation, compromise, or implicit assumptions playing a role. The Supreme Court has ruled that in certain circumstances, Congress may not have intended to delegate decision-making to agencies, especially in cases of significant economic and political importance. This was exemplified in a case where the Court found that the Food and Drug Administration did not have the authority to regulate tobacco products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Congress had directly addressed the issue. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress may not have intended to delegate decision-making to agencies in cases of significant economic and political importance. In a case regarding the regulation of tobacco products, the Court found that Congress had directly addressed the issue through tobacco-specific legislation and rejection of proposals to give jurisdiction to the FDA. The Court also stated that agency interpretations under Chevron deference are not dependent on the timing or consistency of the interpretation. The Supreme Court has established that agency interpretations outside of Chevron deference contexts can still be respected based on their persuasiveness and expertise. Factors influencing the weight of such interpretations include thoroughness, reasoning validity, consistency with past statements, and technical expertise on complex matters. The Supreme Court has established that agency interpretations can be respected based on their persuasiveness and expertise, considering factors like reasoning validity, consistency, and technical expertise on complex matters. Congress usually specifies if one statute is intended to repeal or supersede another, ensuring clarity in the legislative process. Courts will try to harmonize conflicting federal statutes to give effect to each if possible, only applying the rule that the later statute prevails if irreconcilable conflicts exist or if the later act clearly substitutes the earlier one. Repeals by implication are not favored and are rarely found unless intent is clear. The presumption against implied repeals favors protecting old statutes from inadvertent destruction but can pose challenges for new statutes. If two laws from the same session of Congress conflict, the later enactment will prevail. Legislative intent, not effective dates, determines which is the \"later\" law. Repeals by implication are disfavored, especially when based solely on an Appropriations Act. The \"rule of lenity\" dictates that ambiguous criminal statutes should be interpreted in favor of the defendant. This rule places the burden on Congress to clarify laws clearly and prevents courts from creating criminal law. If statutory language is clear, the rule of lenity does not apply. The rule of lenity applies to ambiguous criminal statutes, placing the burden on Congress to clarify laws clearly. Intent is a required element in criminal offenses, with a presumption in favor of a mens rea requirement. The Court may interpret a scienter requirement broadly and recognizes exceptions for \"strict liability\" in public welfare statutes. The Supreme Court emphasizes the importance of scienter in criminal offenses, stating that more than just omitting a phrase from a statute is needed to remove an intent requirement. While there is a general presumption of mens rea applying to all elements of an offense, context can rebut this presumption. The Court has not recently relied on the principle of broadly construing remedial statutes, as it is challenging to apply and open to interpretation. This leads to uncertainty in determining the scope of application for such statutes. The Supreme Court has not recently relied on broadly construing remedial statutes, which can be challenging to apply and open to interpretation. The scarcity of this principle in the Court's current lexicon may reflect substantive preferences of the Justices and recognition of its limitations. The Court may instead employ more specific presumptions or analyze statutes without relying on canonical supports. The categorization of statutes as \"remedial\" or \"civil rights\" can lead to a more detailed analysis of their purposes. Statutes benefiting Indian tribes are to be liberally construed in favor of Indians, but specific considerations can override this principle. The title of a statute can help resolve ambiguities in its text, even though it cannot grant additional powers. The text discusses how headings and preambles in legislation can provide limited interpretive aid but cannot override the plain meaning of the text. While headings may shed light on the section's basic thrust, they cannot confer powers or control the words of the act unless they are ambiguous. Preambles in legislation can help resolve ambiguity by reflecting congressional intent. Courts may consult legislative purposes to interpret statutory language. For example, the RICO statute's purpose influenced the Court's interpretation of the term \"enterprise.\" Legislative findings in the Americans with Disabilities Act also guided the act's coverage. The Americans with Disabilities Act's coverage is determined by the number of Americans with physical or mental disabilities. Congressional intent and legislative findings play a role in interpreting statutory language. \"Sense of Congress\" language may not create legal rights but can reflect congressional statements. In the appropriate context, \"sense of Congress\" language can have the same effect as statements of congressional purpose, resolving ambiguities in the law. Savings clauses preserve remedies under existing law but do not create new causes of action. If there is a conflict, the savings clause yields to the new law, and courts will try to give it some effect without undermining the new law. In some cases, courts must reason from the scope and purpose of the new statute. For example, the Court held that savings language preserving \"any remedy or right of action ... under existing law\" applied only to federal, not state remedies, to avoid negating the new law's effect. Even clear savings language will not be allowed to thwart an important element of a regulatory scheme. The Court sometimes struggles with the scope of \"notwithstanding\" clauses in statutes, which can override certain provisions of the law. For example, a directive to proceed with timber sale contracts \"notwithstanding any other provision of law\" was interpreted to only override environmental laws, not federal contracting requirements. This ambiguity can lead to challenges in interpreting the intended scope of such clauses. The phrase \"notwithstanding any other law\" in statutes may not always require disregarding all other laws, as courts have interpreted it to only override specific provisions. It is more effective to specify which laws are to be disregarded. Additionally, \"notwithstanding\" clauses cannot prevent subsequent legislation from superseding them. Some federal statutes implicitly create private causes of action, based on the principle that every right must have a remedy. The Court now only implies a private right of action if Congress intended to create one, raising questions about why it was not done explicitly. The Court is hesitant to find implied private remedies for violations of conditions on funding, and when found, limits them, leaving room for Congress to expand. Interpretational difficulties may arise when one statute incorporates provisions of an existing statute. Courts must determine the validity of a statute if one section is held unconstitutional. If the remaining provisions are fully operative, the invalid part may be dropped. Congress has the option to expand statutes with \"narrow dimensions.\" A severability clause in a statute may reinforce the presumption of severability, but it does not guarantee that the remaining valid portions will be fully operative. Congress sometimes includes non-severability language, which can make remaining sections null and void if a part is held unconstitutional. Case law is limited, but courts should honor a clearly expressed non-severability directive. If a statute lacks consequences for noncompliance with timing provisions, federal courts will not enforce it. As a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, federal courts typically do not impose coercive sanctions. Deadlines without specified consequences are seen as more suggestive than mandatory, serving as a prompt for action rather than a strict bar to tardiness. Agency actions taken after a deadline are generally upheld as valid, with courts hesitant to impose sanctions that would undermine the underlying duty. However, in some cases, courts may order compliance with statutory directives after a missed deadline, backed by the possibility of contempt for non-compliant agency officials. Congress determines the jurisdiction of federal adjudicatory bodies under the Constitution. Congress determines the subject matter a federal adjudicatory body can hear, including statutory deadlines and preconditions. The Court distinguishes between rules of \"jurisdiction\" and \"claim-processing requirements,\" with noncompliance often resulting in courts upholding agency actions taken after a deadline. Key to the distinction between \"jurisdictional\" rules and \"claim-processing requirements\" is whether Congress clearly states a limitation as jurisdictional. Filing deadlines for administrative reviews are often considered non-jurisdictional and can be waived. Different schools of statutory interpretation view text differently, with textualists emphasizing Congress' chosen words as the law. The \"plain meaning rule\" emphasizes the importance of statutory language in interpreting laws, with courts enforcing it strictly when the language is clear. Differences in interpretation arise regarding whether the rule is mandatory or prudential, leading to debates on the clarity of language and the need for further inquiry into legislative intent. The plain meaning rule prioritizes statutory language in interpreting laws, with disagreements arising over its application. Even when the language is clear, Justices may differ on the interpretation, sometimes looking to legislative history for clarification. The exception to the rule is when a plain meaning would result in an \"absurd result,\" but even then, there can be disagreement on consulting legislative materials for insight. Courts vary in their approach to using legislative history for interpreting statutes, with some judges more willing to deem statutory language as ambiguous and resort to legislative history for guidance. This can lead to tensions between clear language and perceived intent, as judges may differ in their reliance on extrinsic aids for interpretation. Since the 1980s, some Court opinions have questioned the reliability of using legislative history to interpret statutes due to the fragmented nature of modern congressional processes. This skepticism is fueled by concerns about the potential bias in published history caused by partisanship. Some believe legislative history may be biased by partisanship, interest groups, or federal agencies. Others argue for focusing on statutory text for judicial independence. Recent views suggest attributing an \"institutional purpose\" to legislation despite unknown individual motives. Congressional committees are seen as providing accurate information for Members to consider legislation. The legislative history includes a variety of materials such as comparing current statutes to predecessors and analyzing differences in language and structure. This can involve committee reports, hearings, floor debates, and other records of deliberations on legislation. Comparing different versions of a provision as it progresses through the legislative process is also common. Courts may refer to congressional materials for background information, context, and explanations of legislative language. The reliance on these materials varies based on the circumstances of a statute's passage and its clarity. Committee reports are considered more authoritative, especially those of conference committees. The nature of the issue before a court also influences the materials consulted. Committee reports, particularly those from conference committees, are viewed as more reliable and persuasive than statements made during floor debates or hearings. In floor debates, statements from sponsors and floor managers carry the most weight, followed by committee members. Statements from members not associated with the bill or opponents have less influence. Hearings are useful for background information but may not clarify specific language. Courts may refer to this hierarchy to interpret unclear statutes, although other factors can also play a role. When interpreting statutes, courts may consider committee reports, especially from conference committees, as more reliable than floor debates or hearings. Courts may also consult legislative history to understand the context and meaning of statutory terms, although the extent of this analysis can vary depending on the issue at hand. The meaning of statutory terms can be controversial due to conflicting indications in legislative history. The concern is whether the history accurately explains the language in the statute or if it goes beyond the text. Courts do not rely on unenacted approvals, beliefs, or desires as laws. The legislative history of a statute can provide solid ground for interpreting ambiguous text, with courts considering the sequence of changes in bill language. While rejection of amendments or versions can be significant, there is no general \"rejected proposal rule.\" Courts may attribute significance to Congress's rejection of bill language if it aligns with the position urged upon the court. Silence in published legislative history is usually not significant. Silence in published legislative history is seldom significant, as there is no requirement for every permissible application of a statute to be expressly referred to. The absence of any indication of intent to effect a major change in established law may be important to the Court. Subsequent Congresses may comment on or revisit a statute as circumstances change, but views expressed in their documents are generally disregarded. The legislative history of a statute is the history of its consideration and enactment, and subsequent legislative history is considered a contradiction in terms. The Court is cautious about inferring intent from subsequent Congress actions, as they may not reflect the views of the enacting Congress. However, if a later Congress expresses its views in a statute, those views must be followed. Later enactments may clarify the interpretation of earlier statutes. Subsequent legislation can clarify the interpretation of earlier statutes, with congressional intent playing a significant role. The Court gives weight to later statutes in statutory construction, especially if they align with the original intent. Congress has the power to override the Court's interpretation through subsequent legislation, but the extent of this override may not always be clear. When Congress acts to overturn a Court decision, it may raise questions about the Court's reasoning. A Supreme Court decision on Title VII's statute of limitations is challenged by Congress with a new provision. The impact of the Court's interpretation in a previous case on a new discrimination lawsuit is debated. The Supreme Court's interpretation in a previous case may still impact a new discrimination lawsuit, as Congress may ratify that interpretation when reenacting a statute. Congress may ratify a judicial interpretation when reenacting a statute if the interpretation is widely accepted. The reenactment presumption is only valid if Congress thoroughly reviewed the statute and made changes. The Court may require other evidence of congressional awareness before considering reenactment significant. Congress may have overlooked the issue or left it for the courts to resolve. Congressional inaction is sometimes seen as approving an administrative or judicial interpretation, but there is no general presumption of acquiescence. The Court may infer acquiescence when Congress is aware of controversy around an interpretation. However, post-enactment explanations or opinions by committees are often disregarded. The Court has emphasized that post-enactment explanations or opinions by committees are not given much weight in determining legislative intent. Individual statements by members of Congress or committees after the enactment of a statute are not a substitute for clear legislative intent at the time of enactment. It is the role of the courts, not the legislature or a committee, to interpret enacted statutes. The President's role in enacting statutes is limited to approving or vetoing a bill in its entirety, without the ability to amend or selectively sign provisions. Post-enactment explanations by individual members carry little weight in determining legislative intent, as it is the courts' role to interpret enacted statutes. The President's role in enacting statutes is limited to approving or vetoing a bill in its entirety. Recent Presidents have used signing statements to express their views on the law's implementation, but these statements do not have immediate legal effect. The tension between the political branches over accountability is evident in these statements. In the enduring tension between political branches over accountability and control of executive agencies, Administrations assert that signing statements carry weight as legislative history. Presidents can comment on a statute's meaning in a signing statement, reflecting their involvement in legislative processes. This can help complete the picture of a bill's purpose. The use of signing statements by Presidents to comment on a bill's purpose may be helpful in understanding legislative intent, especially in cases where there is no published congressional documentation or in compromise situations. However, controversy may arise when the President's interpretation conflicts with congressional history, as Congress does not have the opportunity to respond to these statements during the legislative process. Despite the lack of legal weight given to signing statements by the Supreme Court, they still play a role in shaping the interpretation of laws. The use of signing statements by Presidents to influence statutory interpretation by courts is a recent development. Courts have not been particularly receptive to them, even though they are cited occasionally. Judicial reluctance to consider signing statements does not contradict judicial deference to agency action. The use of signing statements by Presidents to influence statutory interpretation by courts is a recent development. Courts have not been particularly receptive to them, even though they are cited occasionally. Judicial reluctance to consider signing statements does not contradict judicial deference to agency action. By statute, agencies are authorized to \"speak with the force of law\" through formal processes, but Congress has not authorized the President or agencies to do so through signing statements. Signing statements may influence agency implementation of statutes, but it is the implementation, not the signing statement itself, that is measured against statutory requirements. Signing statements may be considered analogous to informal agency actions, entitled to respect only to the extent that they have the power to persuade."
