    "content": "Exploration in environments with sparse rewards is a challenge for reinforcement learning. We propose an unsupervised agent that learns a pixel grouping model to derive geometric intrinsic reward functions. These policies form a basis set of behaviors for consistent exploration and can be used in a hierarchical reinforcement learning setup to solve for extrinsically defined rewards. Our approach shows competitive performance in various domains, including navigation in 3D environments and Atari games. In DRL research, exploration in environments with sparse feedback is a challenge. Agents typically use local exploration strategies like epsilon greedy or entropy based schemes. A new agent architecture and loss functions are developed to autonomously learn visual abstractions and ground temporally extended behaviors. The approach includes an information theoretic loss function and a neural network. The approach involves using an information theoretic loss function and a neural network to learn visual groupings from raw pixels and actions. It also includes a hierarchical action-value function agent that explores options based on learned visual abstractions. The encoder outputs spatial discrete VQ grids, and segmentation masks are extracted for visual entities. Affine geometric measurements like centroid and area are computed for each entity. Off-policy learning is used to train the action-value function. The hierarchical action-value function agent uses off-policy learning to control measurements for behaviors like approaching or avoiding objects, moving objects, and positioning avatars on the screen. It solves a semi markov decision process and can scale to navigation in 3D environments and challenging Atari games from raw pixels. Learning visual abstractions in computer vision has a long history, with recent advancements in neural networks and instance segmentation algorithms for spatio-temporal groupings of pixels from raw videos. Deep learning approaches typically require supervised data, but structured deep generative models offer a way to learn disentangled representations from raw videos. Recent work has also framed segmentation as a mutual information maximization problem. Recently, segmentation has been framed as a mutual information maximization problem in BID8, where the mutual information is computed between the original image segmentation and its transformed output. This approach is limited to enforcing pixel-label constraints, while recent papers have proposed promising techniques for continuous variables. Our work is most similar to hierarchical-DQN BID9, but it requires hand-crafted instance segmentation and lacks a distributed agent architecture for learning intrinsic rewards simultaneously. Object-Oriented-MDPs BID3 utilizes object-oriented representations for structured learning. Object-Oriented-MDPs BID3 uses object-oriented representations for structured exploration, requiring prebuilt symbolic representations. HRA BID22 utilizes prebuilt object representations to achieve state-of-the-art policies on Pacman. Count-based exploration algorithms have shown impressive results on hard Atari games. The Horde architecture BID19 proposes learning Generalized Value Functions (GVFs) using off-policy learning, later extended with neural networks. Our approach automatically constructs GVFs or a UVFA using abstract entity-based representations. Our work focuses on constructing GVFs or a UVFA using abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The agent's objective is to maximize the expected sum of rewards over time in a discrete MDP with visual inputs. In this work, the focus is on constructing GVFs or a UVFA using abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize the expected sum of rewards over time with visual inputs. The VQ distinguishes frames in the same temporal segment, encodes action elements, represents color information, and assigns entity ids to locations for computing intrinsic rewards. The text discusses using abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize rewards with visual inputs. The measurements for natural 3D navigation and Atari game play include centroid coordinates and entity mask area. Temporal changes in these measurements create intrinsic reward functions, inducing structured exploration in the MDP. The agent architecture leverages this additional structure for improved exploration. The agent architecture leverages abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize rewards with visual inputs. It utilizes a top-level MDP M represented by Q meta, which outputs actions at time t. The implementation models composite actions E + 1 and M, with separate Q functions for each abstraction or entity. The agent relies on an abstraction model that assigns each pixel in the image to one of E separate abstractions. The agent architecture utilizes abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process to maximize rewards with visual inputs. It assigns pixels in the image to separate abstractions to create visual abstraction. The function f is used to compute abstract representations of the current state, with one way to train it being representative of the current state. The agent architecture utilizes abstract entity-based representations in a Markov Decision Process to maximize rewards with visual inputs. It assigns pixels in the image to separate abstractions to create visual abstraction. The input is separately passed through a CNN and LSTM network, with outputs fed to Q task, Q meta, and options bank with Q functions. Q meta and Q task are trained with external task reward, while the options bank is trained with computed measurements. Q meta outputs actions every T steps, selecting from Q functions or the Q task policy. All Q functions are trained simultaneously from a shared replay buffer. In this work, the aim is to train a function to be injective for constraining the representation, allowing a decoding function to distinguish between states. Classification losses are used to promote distinguishability between different states at different levels of the representation, maximizing mutual information between random variables. The approach involves choosing appropriate random variables and sampling strategies to specify the right representation invariances. The main focus is on preserving global information in representation learning. A non-parametric classifier is trained to distinguish frames from the same trajectory and different trajectories. This process helps in preserving relevant moving elements while removing irrelevant information like textures and background elements. The goal is to maximize mutual information between random variables in the representation. Preserving controllable, local appearance information in representation learning by training to predict actions taken in transitions and aligning abstract representation with appearance changes for hard exploration Atari games. To align abstract representation with appearance changes, a shallow CNN encoder is used to create embeddings of local color and texture structure. The goal is to maximize mutual information between the abstract representation and appearance changes. Positive pairs of spatially aligned embeddings are used, while negative pairs are created by sampling appearance embeddings from other locations. A weighted sum of classification losses is minimized to learn the agents' abstract representation. The text discusses the modeling of q g using cosine similarity over embeddings and the representation of the agent by three sets of Q functions: Q meta, Q task, and Q 1,1 to Q e,m. Each Q function has a corresponding policy denoted by \u03c0, and Q meta acts every T steps while Q task and Q e,m act at each environment time step. The text discusses training Q functions Q task, Q meta, and Q e,m using deep Q networks. Experiences are stored in a shared buffer for sampling trajectories. The Q-learning objective involves minimizing loss functions for each Q function. Parameters are learned using stochastic gradient descent. In experiments, Q(\u03bb) is used with stochastic gradient descent to learn all parameters by sampling experience trajectories from a shared replay buffer. The implementation is inspired by a batched actor critic agent with a central GPU learner and multiple actors. There are 3 types of actors for baseline exploration, with different exploration parameters. High exploration is considered independently for base and meta policies. In a 3D navigation domain with sparse rewards and hard exploration requirements, actors are split into groups with different meta and base policies for stable learning. The goal is to reach a green sphere in one of four rooms based on a hint. The learning algorithm uses Q(\u03bb) with stochastic gradient descent and multiple actors with different exploration parameters. The learning algorithm uses Q(\u03bb) with stochastic gradient descent and multiple actors with different exploration parameters to navigate a 3D environment with sparse rewards. Inputs include N episodes, base and meta exploration parameters, commitment length T, and cost function parameters. Experience replay buffer D and parameters for metacontrol agent, task agent, and options models are initialized. Abstract features are computed from the state, intrinsic rewards are calculated, and optimization is done using RMSProp. Results are comparable to strong baselines within a limited time budget. The agent needs to associate hints with its position in the environment by exploring far regions in the maze. The policy bank enables this exploration, allowing the agent to solve the task successfully. Additionally, querying the environment representation helps determine different elements like walls, floor, and the target sphere. Agents using intrinsic rewards based on this information or the proposed abstraction inference method can also solve the task effectively. The agent uses the abstraction inference method to evolve its policy, relying more on Q task over time for optimal behavior. It outperforms the baseline on hard exploration Atari games and visually challenging environments like \"DMLab-30\" levels. In the \"DMLab-30\" levels, the agent achieves 33 points, outperforming the baseline Q learner which only achieves 9 points. Structured exploration helps in achieving better scores in memory tasks. Another experiment on the \"keys doors\" task shows competitive results between methods. Our representation was not sufficient for learning a better policy due to noise in abstraction inference and planning aspects. The agent was outperformed by the baseline on the watermaze task, likely because of exploring straight trajectories instead of circular ones. Unsupervised structured exploration schemes for model-free DRL agents show competitive performance on various environments using raw pixels. Balancing structure or inductive biases with performance remains an open question, with the current solution being augmenting the meta-controller with Q tasks and an options bank for sub-behaviors. The typical strategy for agents is to rely on the options bank early in training and then use this experience to train the Q task policy for optimality. New unsupervised architectures and losses are expected to narrow the gap between optimal desired behaviors and the options bank. Learning visual entities from pixels remains a challenging problem in unsupervised learning and computer vision. Novel sampling schemes in the proposed architecture are expected to improve entity discovery results. Other unsupervised video segmentation algorithms and discrete latent variable models could also boost the discovery process. The encoder for abstractions consists of 3 convolutional layers with 64 features each, followed by a 1x1 convolutional layer with 8 outputs. The VQ layer sits on top with 8 elements. The global loss involves convolutions, max pooling, and ReLU non-linearity to generate a global embedding. The image embedding uses a two-layer convnet with 8 filters. The agent architecture includes a 3-layer convolutional stack with 512 hidden units and an LSTM on top. The agent architecture includes a 3-layer convolutional stack with 512 hidden units and an LSTM on top. The LSTM output is fed into various Q function layers and a policy bank. The setup is similar to previous work, with multiple actors sending trajectories to a shared learner for batch processing. The main difference is the use of a value-based Q(\u03bb) loss instead of actor-critic with off-policy correction. The baseline agent has the same architecture and loss, excluding the meta control Q function and options bank."
