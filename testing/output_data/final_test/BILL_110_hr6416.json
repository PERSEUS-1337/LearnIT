    "content": "The \"Just and Lasting Peace in Sudan Act of 2008\" defines key terms such as the Government of Sudan and SPLM, and specifies the appropriate congressional committees. Congress acknowledges the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, with over 450,000 killed and 2,500,000 displaced since 2003. The Government of Sudan continues to commit atrocities, hindering humanitarian access. Southern Sudan suspended its participation in Sudan's government in October 2007. The Government of National Unity in Sudan has been slow in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, particularly in regards to the Abyei Boundary Commission recommendations. The ABC, chaired by former US Ambassador Donald Peterson, submitted its final report in 2005. According to the CPA, the lack of administration in Abyei has hindered activities and services, leading to potential conflict. The Government of Sudan has a history of signing agreements but failing to honor them, making accountability for atrocities difficult. The Government of Sudan refuses to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and protects indicted individuals. Special Envoy Richard Williamson met with a Sudanese delegation led by Nafi Ali Nafi, who has ties to international terror and domestic atrocities. Nafi was involved in giving safe haven to Osama bin Laden in the 1990s and supporting a group that attempted to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. One of the assassins involved in a failed attempt was flown to Sudan on Sudan Airways. SEC. 4. CODIFICATION OF EXISTING SANCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF A JUST AND LASTING PEACE IN SUDAN. Sanctions against the Government of Sudan will remain in effect until the President certifies that Sudan has met certain conditions, including implementing peace agreements. The Government of Sudan must meet several conditions to lift sanctions, including implementing the Abyei Boundary Commission recommendations, paying retroactive oil revenue shares, handing over indicted individuals to the ICC, ending atrocities in Darfur, allowing UNAMID forces deployment, cutting ties with terrorist organizations, and holding officials accountable for crimes in various regions. The Government of Sudan must meet conditions to lift sanctions, including holding officials accountable for supporting terrorist groups. The President of the United States will establish a monitoring mechanism to ensure compliance. Congress believes relations should not be normalized until conditions are met for at least one year."
