    "content": "During the Cold War, the U.S. active duty force remained above 2.0 million personnel, peaking at over 3.5 million during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. However, from 1989 to 1999, the force steadily decreased to 1.4 million. Despite expectations of reduced military requirements, new missions in places like the Persian Gulf, Somalia, and Afghanistan stretched U.S. ground forces thin. Concerns about readiness and increased demands for a smaller force have been raised for over a decade. The House Armed Services Committee identified issues with military readiness due to turbulence in the armed forces, challenging the Administration's claims of high readiness. Various studies highlighted problems with operating tempo and personnel demands. Congress mandated compensation for over-deployed soldiers, but this was waived after September 11, 2001. Technological advances were seen as improving combat effectiveness against conventional forces. The 2003 Iraq War saw advances in combat effectiveness against conventional forces, but manpower was still needed for stability operations. The occupation phase involved 220,000 troops, with indicators showing stretched forces and extended tours for personnel. During the 2003 Iraq War, manpower shortages led to extended tours for personnel. Efforts were made to increase the Armed Forces by 83,700 personnel for five years, with proposals to add divisions or increase Army soldiers. In January 2004, the Chief of Staff of the Army was authorized to temporarily increase Army end strength by 30,000 personnel in response to internal and external pressures. General Schoomaker argued against a permanent, legislated increase in troop numbers, citing the burden it would create on defense budgets. He initiated organizational changes to create more combat \"modules\" within divisions, aiming to increase the number of available brigades from 33 to 48. He also implemented a \"unit manning\" policy and shifted away from rotating individuals to deployed units. General Schoomaker implemented organizational changes to create more combat \"modules\" within divisions, aiming to increase the number of available brigades. He shifted towards a unit manning policy and reduced air defense, artillery, and ordnance unit strength while increasing military police, civil affairs, and transportation capabilities. Additionally, he converted soldier positions to civilian roles to make more soldiers available for deployment and sought to find more positions in the future. The Army and DOD also worked on rebalancing the mix of Active Duty and Reserve Component forces to increase fairness and flexibility in deploying the total force. After resisting efforts to increase military manpower, Secretary Rumsfeld eventually resigned, and President Bush planned to expand the size of the U.S. armed forces to meet global challenges. This decision came after the Iraq War had lasted over three years, and the need for adequate forces remained difficult. In 2007, congressional calls to permanently increase the end strengths of the Army and Marine Corps were finally heeded. The Department of Defense announced plans to permanently increase the end strengths of the active Army by 65,000 and the active Marine Corps by 27,000 to ease strains from ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This increase will allow for the creation of additional combat teams and units to fill shortages and meet high demand. The Act for Fiscal Year 2008 authorizes a permanent increase in military end strength to address current and future requirements. Debate surrounds the optimal size and composition of the military, with some viewing ongoing conflicts as long-term and necessitating a robust force. Factors such as federal deficits and budget constraints may also impact the discussion. Competition for funding within DOD will continue, with a focus on constraining personnel costs to prioritize research and procurement for future weapons. The debate on military end strength includes concerns about recruitment and retention of junior officers and NCOs, which may impact the ability to create additional Army and Marine units authorized by the Administration. The military end strength is influenced by Congress through allocating forces among the Services. Ground combat forces are crucial due to ongoing efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as potential threats from nations like Iran, Syria, and North Korea. Special Operations Forces (SOF) are being strengthened for the War on Terrorism. In Iraq, U.S. mechanized infantry and armored forces have shown success against enemy forces, including in urban areas. Some suggest maintaining units with Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. The Army believes its current force structure is sufficient for counterinsurgency and stabilization operations, while the Marines have established a Marine Corps Training and Advisory Group for training and equipping advisor teams. The debate within the DOD revolves around whether forces should handle a \"full spectrum\" of military operations or if specialist units should be created for the complex global security environment. Section 941 of the Conference Report for H.R. 1585 mandates a quadrennial review of DOD roles and missions, focusing on core mission areas, service capabilities, force requirements for counterinsurgency, stabilization, and advisory missions. The review may recommend the formation of specialized units to address these mission areas. The DOD is debating whether to have forces handle a \"full spectrum\" of military operations or create specialized units for specific mission areas. Section 941 of the Conference Report for H.R. 1585 mandates a review of DOD roles and missions, focusing on core mission areas and potentially recommending the formation of specialized units."
