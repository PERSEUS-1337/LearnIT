The Congress finds that potassium iodide is effective in preventing radiation-induced thyroid diseases, recommended by experts and proven safe after the Chernobyl accident. Despite its efficacy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not made it readily available. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's inaction has delayed the stockpiling and distribution of potassium iodide for 22 years. The safety and efficacy of potassium iodide were established in 1978, approved for over-the-counter sale. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the Federal Government was criticized for not stockpiling potassium iodide. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission delayed stockpiling and distributing potassium iodide for 22 years despite declaring it necessary for emergency response plans. Initially recommended for use as a protective action, the Commission later planned against stockpiling due to cost-benefit concerns. On November 22, 1982, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff argued against stockpiling potassium iodide, citing cost-benefit analysis. However, on July 24, 1985, the Commission issued a policy reversing its support for stockpiling, deeming it not worthwhile. On June 16, 1989, a Nuclear Energy Commission employee challenged the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's potassium iodide policy. On March 29, 1994, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff recommended stockpiling potassium iodide near nuclear power plants but a deadlocked vote prevented adoption. On September 9, 1995, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission employee petitioned for potassium iodide to be included in State emergency plans. On June 16, 1997, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff proposed making potassium iodide available to States at Federal expense. Despite the effectiveness of potassium iodide in preventing thyroid cancers, the Commission stated there was no new information warranting a policy change. On March 31, 1998, the staff recommended denying a petition for rulemaking regarding potassium iodide's side effects and liability concerns. In April 1998, the Federal Emergency Management Agency criticized misleading statements about potassium iodide made by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In July 1998, the Commission rejected staff recommendations and approved the use of potassium iodide in emergency planning for nuclear accidents. In January 2001, the Commission revised its emergency response regulations. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission revised its emergency response regulations to include potassium iodide as a protective measure for the general public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The Commission found that potassium iodide is a reasonable and inexpensive supplement to evacuation and sheltering. The Commission decided to fund initial purchases of potassium iodide but left distribution decisions to the States after the events of September 11, 2001. The events of September 11, 2001, highlighted the need for immediate measures to protect the public from potential terrorist attacks on nuclear power plants. A uniform national policy should be established for stockpiling and distributing potassium iodide, removing obstacles to its immediate distribution on a national level. SEC. 2. RULEMAKING. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include a new section on Potassium Iodide. The Commission is required to establish stockpiles of potassium iodide tablets for population protection near nuclear power plants and within specific distances. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include a new section on Potassium Iodide, requiring the establishment of stockpiles near nuclear power plants for population protection in case of a release of radionuclides. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include a new section on Potassium Iodide, requiring the establishment of stockpiles near nuclear power plants for population protection in case of a release of radionuclides.
