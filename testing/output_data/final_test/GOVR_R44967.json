    "content": "The Constitution's tripartite division of federal power ensures separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The Founders saw this separation as crucial for protecting liberty and preventing tyranny of shifting majorities in adjudicating individual rights. The Framers designed an independent judiciary to avoid legislative interference in judgments. The Framers recognized the imperfection of the separation of powers and granted Congress powers in Article III of the Constitution, such as the Exceptions Clause allowing Congress to make exceptions to the Supreme Court's jurisdiction. Congress can also establish inferior federal courts with limited jurisdiction and regulate federal court jurisdiction through legislation. Congress has the power to control the work of the courts by enacting laws that retroactively change legal rights. This includes influencing pending cases and altering outcomes based on new retroactive laws. Additionally, Congress can impact the effect of federal court injunctions through legislation, creating a tension in Article III between an independent judiciary and legislative control. The Supreme Court has had to determine when Congress's powers impermissibly invade the powers of the judiciary, as seen in the Reconstruction-era case United States v. Klein. This case involved compensation for property seized during the Civil War under the Abandoned and Captured Property Act of 1863. During the Reconstruction era, individuals who had not aided the rebellion could claim proceeds from captured property by receiving a presidential pardon and taking an oath of loyalty. Klein, as an administrator of a deceased Confederate participant's estate, filed a claim for confiscated cotton proceeds. The Court of Claims ruled in favor of the estate, leading to a government appeal to the Supreme Court. This case, United States v. Klein, dealt with the balance of powers between Congress and the judiciary regarding compensation for seized property during the Civil War. The Supreme Court reviewed a similar case, United States v. Padelford, involving a person who participated in the rebellion, took the loyalty oath, and sought proceeds of captured property. The Court held that receiving a pardon made him \"innocent in law,\" entitling him to the proceeds. Congress added a proviso to an appropriations bill related to Court of Claims judgments, stating that a presidential pardon could be used as evidence in suits for proceeds. The Court of Claims treats a presidential pardon as conclusive evidence of aiding the rebellion, leading to dismissal of the suit. The Supreme Court loses jurisdiction if a favorable judgment is based solely on a pardon. The government requested Klein's case to be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction after an appropriations bill became law in July 1870. The Supreme Court found Congress's attempt to strip jurisdiction based on evidence of a pardon unconstitutional. Congress can withhold the right of appeal, but cannot dictate the outcome of a case based on specific evidence. The Klein Court ruled that Congress overstepped its bounds by trying to dictate the outcome of a case based on a pardon, leading to the dismissal of the suit. The Court questioned the jurisdiction-stripping proviso and emphasized that Congress cannot force a specific verdict in a case. The Klein Court's ruling suggests that Congress cannot dictate the outcome of a case or how the law should be applied. Legal scholars have debated the meaning of Klein's language, with some interpreting it narrowly to only prohibit Congress from directing unconstitutional results in certain cases. The Klein Court's ruling prohibits Congress from influencing the outcome of a case or dictating how the law should be applied. It also restricts Congress from using its jurisdictional powers to compel a court to decide a case in a way that goes against constitutional provisions. The Supreme Court's 1980 ruling in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians further addressed the implications of Klein on legislation affecting disputes between the Sioux Nation of Indians and the United States. The Sioux Nation of Indians and the United States entered into the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, establishing the Great Sioux Reservation. The treaty required a new agreement for any cessation of reservation land to be legally binding. The United States sought to renegotiate the treaty due to the discovery of resources in the Black Hills region. In 1876, a U.S. commission and Sioux leaders agreed in the Manypenny Agreement for the tribe to cede the Black Hills region to the United States in exchange for provisions. The agreement, signed by only 10% of adult male Sioux, was seen as a breach of the Fort Laramie Treaty. Decades later in 1920, Congress allowed the Sioux Nation to bring claims against the United States in the U.S. Court of Claims regarding the Black Hills cessation. The Sioux Nation brought a lawsuit against the United States for the taking of the Black Hills without compensation. The Court of Claims dismissed the lawsuit, but the Indian Claims Commission later found in favor of the Sioux Nation. However, the Court of Claims partially reversed the decision citing the doctrine of res judicata. The Court of Claims affirmed the Commission's ruling that the Sioux Nation was entitled to at least $17.5 million for the lands surrendered and gold taken by trespassing prospectors. Congress amended the Indian Claims Commission Act to grant jurisdiction to review the merits of the 1877 Act as a taking of the Black Hills. The Sioux Nation was entitled to compensation due to the government's actions being considered a taking. The Supreme Court addressed whether Congress had overstepped its bounds in amending the Indian Claims Commission Act regarding the Sioux Nation's $17.5 million judgment for the Black Hills. The Court ruled that the amendment did not infringe on judicial power and allowed the Court of Claims to decide the takings claim based on evidence and law. The Supreme Court ruled that Congress can waive the res judicata effect of a prior judgment without violating separation of powers. In Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society, the Court explored the impact of Congress enacting laws on pending litigation, distinguishing it from the case of Klein where Congress decided in the government's favor. Industry groups and environmental groups contested the management of federal lands in Oregon and Washington, home to the endangered northern spotted owl. The environmental groups claimed inadequate protection for the owl, while industry groups argued that protection measures overly restricted timber harvesting. Various environmental statutes were invoked in the lawsuits, including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Congress passed the \"Northwest Timber Compromise\" as part of an appropriations package, establishing harvesting rules for the disputed lands. Section 318(b)(6)(A) directly addressed the pending cases. Section 318(b)(6)(A) directly mentioned the pending cases regarding the management of federal lands in Oregon and Washington for the northern spotted owl. The language was interpreted by environmental and industry plaintiffs as instructing courts to conclude that compliance with the Northwest Timber Compromise would meet statutory requirements. The federal parties complied with the Northwest Timber Compromise, satisfying statutory requirements central to lawsuits. Environmental and industry plaintiffs challenged Section 318(b)(6)(A) as unconstitutional for directing court outcomes in pending cases. District courts found the provision constitutional, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled it unconstitutional under Klein, stating it did not amend environmental laws and infringed on Article III court functions. The Supreme Court disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's ruling on Section 318(b)(6)(A), stating that it did not direct court outcomes in pending cases but replaced legal standards without instructing courts on how to apply them. The Supreme Court in Robertson concluded that Congress can create new standards for compliance with statutes, allowing contested land to be managed under new laws. This decision did not raise separation-of-powers issues. In Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., the Court considered whether legislation directing courts to reopen final judgments intrudes on the judiciary. Congress enacted an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in response to Supreme Court rulings establishing a statute of limitations for Section 10(b) claims. The amendment, known as Section 27A, nullified the Court's ruling and directed courts to reinstate pending cases. Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act directed courts to reinstate cases dismissed due to Lampf and Beam Distilling, allowing investors to reopen suits for securities fraud. However, the Supreme Court ruled that Section 27A violated the separation of powers by retroactively reversing final decisions. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act violated the separation of powers by retroactively reversing final decisions in securities fraud cases. This decision was based on concerns similar to those in the Klein case, where Congress was seen as encroaching on the judiciary's powers to render final judgments. The Supreme Court in Plaut emphasized the need for an independent judiciary, separate from the legislature, to preserve the integrity of judgments. The ruling did not change the Congress's ability to modify the effects of court injunctions. Miller v. French further explored Congress's power to alter previously issued injunctions under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) requires courts to automatically stay court-ordered injunctions upon receiving a motion to terminate the injunction. The PLRA governs lawsuits by prisoners challenging conditions of confinement and outlines requirements for obtaining and terminating prospective relief, such as an injunction. In Miller v. French, inmates at an Indiana prison obtained an injunction in the mid-1980s to rectify conditions violating the Eighth Amendment. The state moved to terminate an injunction under the PLRA in 1997, leading to objections from inmates citing separation-of-powers principles. The district court and Seventh Circuit agreed that the PLRA's automatic stay provision violated these principles, as it restricted the equitable powers of federal courts. The Federal Judiciary has the power to decide cases, subject to review by superior courts. The Seventh Circuit found that Section 3626(e)(2) violated principles of Klein by mandating the termination of previously ordered relief. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating that the section complies with Plaut and distinguishes between reopening suits for damages and altering prospective injunctions. In Miller, the Court explained the distinction between continuing executory decrees and prospective relief. Miller further explained that prospective relief under a continuing executory decree, like the district court's injunction against the prison, remains subject to alteration due to changes in the underlying law. The Court concluded that the automatic stay provision in Section 3626(e)(2) helps implement the change in the underlying law for prisoner litigation, which restricted courts' authority to issue and enforce prospective relief concerning prison conditions. Section 3626(e)(2) establishes new standards for the enforcement of prospective relief in PLRA lawsuits, altering the relevant underlying law. The Supreme Court also found that Section 3626(e)(2) did not violate Klein's admonishment that Congress cannot dictate a rule of decision. The Supreme Court's 2016 opinion in Bank Markazi v. Peterson addressed separation-of-powers limitations on Congress's authority to regulate federal court jurisdiction. The case involved an amendment to the \"terrorism exception\" to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which allows suits seeking monetary damages for personal injury or death caused by state-sponsored terrorism. Claimants often face difficulties enforcing judgments under this exception due to restrictions on using foreign-state property for satisfaction. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 allows judgments to be satisfied using \"blocked assets\" of a terrorist party seized under certain acts. President Obama blocked assets of an Iranian financial institution in 2012, but difficulties enforcing judgments against Iranian financial institutions persisted. Difficulties enforcing judgments against Iranian financial institutions led to the enactment of Section 502 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. This section mandates the execution of certain Iranian financial assets to satisfy judgments for damages caused by terrorism. The assets identified in the Bank Markazi litigation are subject to this law, which does not apply to other assets or lawsuits. The Bank Markazi litigation involved over 1,000 victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism seeking $1.75 billion from assets held by the Central Bank of Iran. The district court ordered Bank Markazi to turn over the bond assets, despite Bank Markazi's argument that Section 8772 violated the separation of powers. The court disagreed, stating that judges can still make the required ownership findings independently. The Second Circuit affirmed that Section 8772 allows judges to make ownership findings independently, without congressional interference. The Supreme Court agreed, rejecting Bank Markazi's argument that the statute violated the separation of powers. Bank Markazi contended that Section 8772 allowed Congress to dictate court decisions, but the Court disagreed, citing the case of Klein. The Supreme Court upheld Section 8772, allowing judges to make independent ownership findings without congressional interference. The Court rejected Bank Markazi's argument that the statute violated separation of powers, citing Klein but emphasizing Congress's power to apply new legal standards to pending cases. The Supreme Court upheld Section 8772, allowing judges to determine ownership independently. The Court emphasized Congress's authority to establish new legal standards for specific cases, clarifying that victims of Iran-sponsored terrorist attacks can seize Iranian assets. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that Section 8772 was unconstitutional as it effectively predetermined outcomes. The dissent in Patchak v. Zinke argued that Section 8772 unconstitutionally allowed Congress to predetermine outcomes in specific cases, raising concerns about separation of powers and congressional overreach. The Court examined whether a statute directing federal courts to dismiss a lawsuit promptly after substantive determinations violate separation of powers. Patchak involved a challenge to the DOI's decision to place land in trust for the Gun Lake Tribe under the IRA. David Patchak sued DOI officials under the APA, claiming lack of authority. The Supreme Court reversed the district court's dismissal of Patchak's suit, determining that he had prudential standing to sue under the APA. The case was remanded for resolution on the merits. President Obama later signed the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act in 2014. The Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act ratified the DOI's decision to place the Bradley Property in trust for the Gun Lake Tribe. It reaffirmed the land as trust land and stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear claims related to the property. The Gun Lake Act was passed to address concerns about the legality of the DOI's decision regarding the Bradley Property. It referenced Patchak's lawsuit and voided it, leading to the dismissal of the case by the district court. The D.C. Circuit upheld the dismissal, stating that Congress had removed federal court jurisdiction over Patchak's complaint. The court rejected Patchak's constitutional challenges to the Gun Lake Act, stating that it did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine by removing the judiciary's authority to review certain cases. Patchak argued that the Act directed the result of his lawsuit under existing law, but the court disagreed. The court rejected Patchak's constitutional challenges to the Gun Lake Act, stating that it did not violate the separation-of-powers doctrine by removing the judiciary's authority to review certain cases. The circuit court explained that the Gun Lake Act provided a new legal standard that federal courts were obligated to apply, leading to the dismissal of Patchak's lawsuit related to the Bradley Property. In a 4-2-3 ruling, the Supreme Court concluded that the jurisdiction-stripping provision of the Gun Lake Act does not violate Article III of the Constitution. The Supreme Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit's ruling on the Gun Lake Act, with Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurring. Patchak argued that the Act violates the separation of powers, similar to the statute in Klein. The government disagreed, stating Patchak's reliance on Klein was misplaced. The government argued that Patchak's reliance on Klein in challenging the Gun Lake Act was misplaced. They distinguished the statute struck down in Klein from the Act's jurisdiction-stripping provision, stating that Congress was within its authority to withdraw jurisdiction over the Bradley Property. The government argued that Patchak's reliance on Klein in challenging the Gun Lake Act was misplaced. They asserted that the Act ensures no party receives a judgment on the merits by removing the court's jurisdiction. Justice Thomas's opinion in Klein and its progeny established that Congress violates Article III when it compels findings under old law, but does not violate it when changing the law. Justice Thomas disagreed with the argument that the Gun Lake Act violated Article III by directing a specific outcome in court cases. He viewed the Act as a neutral change in jurisdiction that fell within Congress' authority, citing that it did not compel findings under old law but simply altered the legal landscape. The Act was described as a jurisdiction-stripping statute that did not infringe on the judiciary's power. The Gun Lake Act, according to Justice Thomas, does not violate Article III by directing a specific outcome in court cases. He sees it as a neutral change in jurisdiction within Congress' authority, differentiating it from the law in Klein. The Act is considered a jurisdiction-stripping statute that does not infringe on the judiciary's power. The Gun Lake Act is seen as a jurisdiction-stripping statute by Justice Thomas, different from the law in Klein. The Act removes cases from judicial review without infringing on the judiciary's power. Justice Breyer concurred, stating that Section 2(b) provides an alternative legal standard for courts to apply, achieving the same result as Section 2(a) which is constitutional. Both provisions result in the Bradley Property remaining in trust for the Gun Lake Tribe. Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor concurred in the judgment, stating that the Gun Lake Act restored the United States' immunity from suit, making it impossible for Patchak to challenge the Act. Congress reinstated sovereign immunity for all suits related to the Bradley Property through the Gun Lake Act. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Kennedy and Gorsuch, dissented on the Gun Lake Act, arguing that it violates the principle of Klein by directing the outcome of a single pending case and infringing on the judicial branch's power. They contended that the Act targeted Patchak's lawsuit specifically, as it was the only challenge to the DOI's action within the statute of limitations. Chief Justice Roberts disagreed with the plurality's conclusion that the Gun Lake Act is jurisdictional, arguing that Congress manipulates jurisdictional rules to decide specific cases. He noted that recent cases treat statutory limitations as nonjurisdictional unless clearly stated otherwise, which the Gun Lake Act does not. The dissenters would have invalidated the Gun Lake Act on Article III grounds, citing the 1871 case of Klein as a guidepost for Congress in crafting jurisdiction-stripping legislation. Congress cannot dictate how a court should rule in a specific case or interfere with final judgments. Congress can influence how the judiciary resolves lawsuits by regulating court jurisdiction or enacting substantive measures that must be applied to legal disputes, even retroactively. Legislation can target specific cases or parties to ensure a particular outcome, as long as the court can still independently apply the new law. This can be done without violating the separation of powers. Congress has the authority to enact legislation that can influence judicial outcomes, including limiting reviewability for pending cases. This can be done without impeding the judiciary's independence, even if it ensures a particular party's victory. The Supreme Court's decision in Patchak complicates the determination of Congress's power over courts. There is no majority opinion on when a law that ends pending litigation in favor of one party violates separation of powers. Some justices believe a neutral law stripping court jurisdiction does not raise concerns, while others focus on specific language. Justice Sotomayor concurred in the judgment based on the specific language used in the Gun Lake Act, which aimed to restore the government's sovereign immunity. Her opinion aligns with the dissent's view that Congress cannot influence the outcome of a pending case by stripping a court of jurisdiction. The Court's decision in Patchak raises questions about Congress's power over courts, with no clear majority opinion on the issue."
