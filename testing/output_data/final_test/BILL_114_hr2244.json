    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section titled \"STRATEGIC TRANSFORMER RESERVE PROGRAM.\" The \"STRATEGIC TRANSFORMER RESERVE PROGRAM\" aims to store spare large power transformers strategically to reduce the vulnerability of the US electric grid to various risks like physical and cyber attacks, electromagnetic pulse, severe weather, and seismic events. Definitions for terms like \"bulk-power system\" and \"critically damaged large power transformer\" are provided in this section. The term \"large power transformer\" refers to a power transformer with a maximum rating of 100 megavolt-amperes or higher, intended for the bulk-power system. The \"spare large power transformer\" is stored in the Strategic Transformer Reserve to prevent extended instability in the bulk-power system due to repair or damage. The Secretary of Energy oversees this program. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan aims to establish a reserve of spare large power transformers to temporarily replace critically damaged ones. The plan includes determining the necessary number of transformers and total capacity in megawatts. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan aims to establish a reserve of spare large power transformers to mitigate impacts from various attacks and disturbances. This includes determining necessary capacity and locations for strategic storage, considering security and confidentiality. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan aims to establish spare large power transformers in strategic locations for efficient delivery to sites of critically damaged transformers. Considerations include transformer flexibility to conform to different substation configurations. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan includes estimating direct costs, funding options, and transportation considerations for spare large power transformers. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan involves factors like transformer transportation weight, size, substation topology, mounting pads availability, flexibility, and rapid energization. Eligibility criteria for withdrawing spare transformers are also considered. The Strategic Transformer Reserve Plan includes the process for replacing damaged transformers and how owners can apply for withdrawals. It also outlines the return process for spare transformers and any associated cost-share fees. The Secretary must obtain Congressional approval before establishing a Strategic Transformer Reserve, and no funds can be used without prior approval. The plan includes details on replacing damaged transformers, owner withdrawals, return process for spare transformers, and cost-share fees."
