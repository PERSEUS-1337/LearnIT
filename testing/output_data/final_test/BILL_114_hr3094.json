    "content": "The Act titled \"Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority Act\" transfers management of red snapper fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico to the states. It amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act by adding a new title for this purpose. The term 'coastal waters' in the Gulf of Mexico refers to waters from the shoreline to the outer boundary of the exclusive economic zone. The 'Gulf coastal State' includes Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The 'Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council' is established under section 302(a). The Mexico Fishery Management Council oversees the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery, with specific definitions for Gulf of Mexico red snapper, Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority, and red snapper fishery management plan. The Reef Fish Federal fishery management plan pertains to the Gulf of Mexico and is overseen by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. State territorial waters for Gulf coastal States extend three marine leagues seaward from the baseline used to measure the territorial sea of the United States. SEC. 502. MANAGEMENT OF GULF OF MEXICO RED SNAPPER. The Gulf States Red Snapper Management Authority (GSRSMA) must be established within 60 days of the enactment of the title. It will consist of the principal fisheries manager of each Gulf coastal State and will review and approve red snapper fishery management plans. The GSRSMA will also provide standards for each state to develop fishery management measures for sustainable management of Gulf of Mexico red snapper. The GSRSMA requires Gulf coastal States to submit red snapper fishery management plans consistent with federal requirements. Plans must be submitted by a deadline set by the GSRSMA, and scientific data must be available to the public for inspection before meetings. The GSRSMA must review and approve red snapper fishery management plans submitted by Gulf coastal States within a specified timeframe. Public participation is required, including public hearings in each Gulf coastal State and the opportunity to submit written comments on the plan. The GSRSMA must review and approve red snapper fishery management plans from Gulf coastal States, ensuring long-term sustainability based on science, compliance with standards, and setting quotas based on stock assessments. Recommendations to reduce commercial sector quotas by more than 10% require approval. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council must review and approve any recommendations to reduce the commercial sector quota by more than 10%. During a 3-year period, the GSRSMA cannot determine a quota for the commercial sector, and existing individual quota shares will remain unchanged. Red snapper fishery management plans from Gulf coastal States must be reviewed and approved within 60 days by the GSRSMA. During a 3-year period, the Secretary will manage the commercial sector of the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery in coordination with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Gulf coastal States must submit annual reports on the fishery status, and the GSRSMA will use this information to prepare reports every 5 years. The Secretary will manage the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery's commercial sector in coordination with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council. Gulf coastal States must submit annual reports on the fishery status, and the GSRSMA will use this information to prepare reports every 5 years. Additionally, annual reports required by paragraph (1) to prepare and submit to the Secretary a report on the status of the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery. \"SEC. 503. STATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RED SNAPPER FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS.\" The GSRSMA certifies approved red snapper fishery management plans for Gulf States. Upon certification, the Secretary revokes conflicting regulations and transfers management to GSRSMA. Management transfer is implemented accordingly. Upon certification, each Gulf coastal State shall implement and enforce red snapper fishery management plans approved for the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery. If certification is not made, the Secretary will remain responsible for management. \"SEC. 504. OVERSIGHT OF GULF OF MEXICO RED SNAPPER MANAGEMENT.\" The GSRSMA oversees the implementation and enforcement of fishery management plans for Gulf of Mexico red snapper, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards and satisfactory enforcement by coastal states. Additionally, certification is required for overfishing and rebuilding plans. The Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery in coastal waters adjacent to Gulf coastal States must be certified by the GSRSMA to show implementation of measures to end overfishing or rebuild the fishery. Failure to implement these measures may result in a vote to recommend closure of the red snapper fishery by the GSRSMA to the Secretary. The Secretary may declare a closure of the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery within the waters adjacent to a Gulf coastal State if certain conditions are met. Prior to making this declaration, the Secretary must consider the comments of the Gulf coastal State and the GSRSMA. During the closure, it is prohibited to fish for Gulf of Mexico red snapper in the specified waters. The Secretary can close the Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery in waters near a Gulf coastal State. Fishing for red snapper is prohibited during the closure, and it is illegal to land or keep any caught red snapper in the closed area. The closure does not apply to State territorial waters. Federal funding for the Gulf of Mexico red snapper management actions by the GSRSMA or its members is prohibited. This does not affect the management of shrimp fisheries in federal waters. The text chunk discusses exemptions related to bycatch reduction devices for Gulf of Mexico red snapper in shrimp trawl fishing activities and the incidental catch of red snapper in commercial shrimp fisheries. It also includes a conforming amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act regarding data collection for fisheries. The text chunk discusses exemptions for Gulf of Mexico red snapper in shrimp trawl fishing and incidental catch in commercial shrimp fisheries. It also amends the Magnuson-Stevens Act for data collection in Gulf state territorial waters. The seaward boundary of a coastal State in the Gulf of Mexico is defined as a line three marine leagues from the baseline used for measuring the territorial sea of the United States. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the first section of the Act. TITLE V--TRANSFER TO STATES OF MANAGEMENT OF RED SNAPPER FISHERIES IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. This section includes definitions, management of Gulf of Mexico red snapper, state implementation of fishery management plans, oversight, prohibition on Federal funding, and no effect on shrimp fisheries management in Federal waters."
