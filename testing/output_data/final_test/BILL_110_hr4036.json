    "content": "The Act may be known as the \"Cents and Sensibility Act\". The Congress finds that the United States Mint studied alternative metals for circulating coins in 2001 but never publicly released the study. In 2006, the Mint informed Congress that production costs for coins had increased significantly due to global demand for metals, with the cost to produce 1-cent and 5-cent coins exceeding their face value. The cost of producing circulating coins has increased significantly due to global demand for metals, potentially costing taxpayers over $1 billion over a decade. Despite this, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the United States Mint have not recommended changing the metallic content of coins to reduce costs. Other countries have adjusted their coin metal content in response to commodity metal price increases. Canada has been producing a cent coin similar to the US 1-cent coin using steel with a thin copper coating, reducing production costs. In 1943, the US Mint made \"steel pennies\" due to copper demands during WWII. Given this experience, there is no reason not to change the metal content of the US cent coin to lower production costs. Simply reducing the production cost of a 1-cent coin below its face value could save the Treasury nearly $1 billion over the next decade. Changes to the metallic content of the 5-cent, 10-cent, and quarter-dollar coins should be made simultaneously to minimize costs to consumers. Reducing the cost to taxpayers of producing the penny is a key focus. The 1-cent coin will be primarily made of steel and treated to look like copper-zinc alloy coins. This change aims to reduce production costs for taxpayers. The Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005 allows for the issuance of 1-cent coins for numismatic purposes. The amendment applies to all 1-cent coins issued after 90 days from the enactment of the Act. SEC. 4 aims to reduce the cost of producing circulating coins without disrupting their use in everyday commerce by businesses, government, and consumers. The Secretary of the Treasury must submit a report to Congress within 60 days outlining a plan to adjust the metallic content of certain coins to reduce production costs while maintaining their value. The report should include recommendations for the composition of each coin to achieve cost-effective ratios similar to those in the 1980s. The report to Congress must include recommendations for adjusting the metallic content of coins to reduce production costs and maintain value. Recommendations should be enacted into law within 30 days, with production starting within 90 days if Congress chooses. Reports should also suggest changes to production methods to further reduce costs and avoid recommendations requiring multiple equipment changes for all circulating coins simultaneously. The report to Congress must recommend adjusting coin specifications to reduce costs and maintain value. Recommendations should not require changes to coin-handling equipment and should prevent fraud. Additional recommendations for the 1-cent coin are also required. The Secretary may recommend changes to the metallic content of circulating coins to reduce production costs. Annual reports to Congress will review the metallic content of various coins and must comply with reporting requirements. The Secretary of the Treasury can seek input and conduct testing to develop new metallic content for circulating coins, in line with federal procurement laws."
