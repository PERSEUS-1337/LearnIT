    "title": "AB 175",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 25500.5 of the Public Resources Code is amended to certify sites and facilities for electricity supply to meet projected demand. Section 25514 is amended to require a final report within 300 days after hearings, detailing findings on designated sites and facilities. The 12-year forecast of statewide and service area electricity demands, along with relevant local, regional, state, and federal standards and comments from the California Coastal Commission and San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, are considered in certifying sites and facilities for electricity supply. The commission considers the acceptability and relative merit of each alternative siting proposal, making specific findings based on established standards. Findings on safety and reliability of facilities at designated sites are also included, with potential modifications to meet commission guidelines. The commission evaluates proposed sites for additional power-generating capacity, considering the impact on property taxes and public services. Amendments are made to the Public Resources Code regarding the conformity of facilities with electricity forecasts. The Public Resources Code is amended to evaluate proposed power-generating sites based on initial facilities for the next 12 years, excluding future facilities beyond that period. The Public Resources Code is amended to evaluate power-generating sites based on initial facilities for the next 12 years. The approval of the notice by the commission is contingent upon findings from Section 25514, requiring at least two acceptable alternative site proposals. If not met, additional proposals can be considered. If a good faith effort is made to find an acceptable alternative site and only one is found, the commission may approve the notice. Additional electrical generating capacity may be needed to accommodate electricity demand. The commission may designate a feasible site for additional electrical generating capacity if no acceptable site is found after a good faith effort. This is in cooperation with the State Energy Conservation and Development Energy. The commission, in collaboration with various agencies and industries, will evaluate and implement policies to promote the use of electricity and natural gas for low-emission vehicles. This includes considering the sale-for-resale and rate-basing of vehicles and supporting equipment, as well as developing statewide standards for charger and fueling connections. The commission will hold public hearings to evaluate and implement new policies for promoting the use of electricity and natural gas for low-emission vehicles. They will provide progress reports to the Legislature every two years on policies related to rates, equipment, and infrastructure. The commission's policies for promoting the use of electricity and natural gas for low-emission vehicles will not pass costs to ratepayers unless deemed beneficial. Utilities must not unfairly compete with nonutility enterprises in developing necessary equipment or infrastructure."
