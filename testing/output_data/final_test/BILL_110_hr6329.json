The term \"refinery\" refers to a facility designed to process crude oil or coal through various chemical or physical processes to produce gasoline or other fuels. The term \"liquefaction\" refers to the process of converting coal into liquid fuel such as gasoline or diesel. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and the term \"State\" includes States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. SEC. 2. STATE PARTICIPATION AND SECRETARY'S DESIGNATION. The Secretary must designate at least 5 brownfield sites suitable for siting a refinery within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The analysis for site selection includes assessing crude oil supply availability, national refined petroleum product demand, and proximity to pipeline infrastructure. The Secretary must designate brownfield sites for refinery construction, considering factors like crude oil supply, demand for refined products, and pipeline infrastructure. The Secretary will make designated sites available for refinery construction, either by taking appropriate actions for federal sites or facilitating transfer of ownership for non-federal sites. The Secretary designates brownfield sites for refinery construction based on factors like oil supply and demand. The Governor can object to a site within 60 days, which can be overridden by Congress within the same timeframe. SEC. 3. PROCESS COORDINATION AND RULES OF PROCEDURE. The Department of Energy is designated as the lead agency to coordinate Federal refinery authorizations and environmental reviews. All Federal and State agencies must cooperate and comply with deadlines set by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to establish a schedule for all Federal refinery authorizations to ensure timely completion. The Secretary, in coordination with Federal and State agencies, maintains a consolidated record of decisions and actions related to Federal refinery authorizations. If deadlines are not met, applicants can seek remedies under subsection (d). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has original and exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions for the review of orders or actions related to Federal refinery authorizations by Federal or State administrative agencies. If the court finds the record insufficient, it may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for further development. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction over civil actions related to Federal refinery authorizations. If an agency fails to act on a Federal refinery authorization as per the Secretary's schedule, it is considered inconsistent with Federal law. The Court may remand the proceeding if it finds an order or action inconsistent with Federal law, hindering the refinery's siting, construction, expansion, or operation. The Court may remand the order or action to the agency for appropriate action. The Secretary must promptly file the consolidated record with the Court. Civil actions are expedited, and attorney's fees may be awarded in challenges to Federal refinery authorizations. The prevailing party may be awarded attorney's fees and litigation expenses, excluding actions related to Federal refinery authorizations. SEC. 4. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF ELECTION TO EXPENSE CERTAIN REFINERIES. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to extend the election to expense certain refineries for five years. Amendments include changing dates for qualified refinery property definitions and implementation through secretarial guidance. The effective date for these changes is property placed in service after December 31, 2007. The Secretary of the Treasury must issue regulations or guidance within 90 days of the enactment of the Act to implement section 179C of the Internal Revenue Code for property placed in service after December 31, 2007."
