The majority of doctors in the US work in smaller, office-based practices, leading to inefficiencies in the healthcare market. However, there is a trend of physicians merging their practices into larger entities or selling them to hospitals, insurance companies, and physician management. Physicians are increasingly selling their practices to hospitals, insurance companies, or physician management firms, or working for larger providers as salaried employees. The number of doctors on hospital payrolls has risen by 32% from 2000 to 2010, with about 20% of practicing physicians now working for hospitals. Medical groups owned by U.S. hospitals are on the rise, with some regional variations in physician employment trends. The share of physician-owned cardiology practices declined to 60% in 2012 from 73% in 2007, while hospital-owned practices grew from 8% to 24%. Factors include industry consolidation, lifestyle preferences of younger doctors, and difficulty in finding doctors to buy or join small practices. The healthcare industry is experiencing a shift towards more complex management and declining average compensation for doctors. Hospitals and insurers are actively recruiting physicians due to forecasts of a future physician shortage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is expected to increase demand for medical services, leading to financial incentives for consolidation and integration of services, such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACO). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is driving the formation of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) where savings are shared between ACOs and payers if quality measures are met. Physician practices, insurers, and hospitals are integrating financially and clinically as ACOs to improve healthcare delivery. Changes in practice organization could impact the expansion of healthcare access, quality of treatment, and control of healthcare spending. Congress has a dual role in promoting consolidation to reduce fragmentation and control spending through the ACA. The health care system is being monitored for negative effects of mergers and acquisitions on costs, competition, and consumer access. Analysts and lawmakers are aware of past restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s, which led to consumer backlash and dissolution of deals. The ACA promotes \"patient-centered\" care to improve quality outcomes. This report provides background on factors contributing to changes in physician practice organization, including physician supply, lifestyle changes, and government incentives. It also examines different types of integration, legal intricacies of affiliation, and implications for consumer and federal policy. The physician population consists of MDs and osteopaths, with a distribution of one-third primary care physicians and two-thirds specialists. The distribution of physicians in the U.S. is not optimal, with one-third being primary care physicians and two-thirds specialists. There is a variation in the ratio of physicians to the population across different regions, with rural areas struggling to attract enough doctors. Experts initially predicted a surplus of doctors in the 1980s, but recent forecasts suggest a potential shortage, especially in primary care. The federal Health Resources and Services Administration and the Association of American Medical Colleges have both predicted a significant shortfall of physicians by 2020. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) warned in 2008 of a potential shortage of 130,600 patient care physicians by 2025. By 2012, 33 states reported current or anticipated physician shortages. Concerns are heightened as nearly a third of physicians are nearing retirement age, with studies showing doctors working fewer hours, especially younger ones. A 2010 study revealed a 6% decrease in hours worked by nonresident physicians, equivalent to a loss of 36,000 doctors. Analysts predict a strain on the healthcare system due to retirements and changing work patterns, emphasizing the need for more efficient practices. The forecasted physician shortage is impacting hospitals, leading to difficulties in finding physicians for voluntary duty. Hospitals are hiring more full-time staff doctors, including hospitalists and emergency room physicians. Many hospitals are looking to hire or affiliate with primary care physicians to ensure a stable supply and staff outpatient centers. The use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants is helping to mitigate the projected physician shortage. In 2009, nearly half of all office-based physician practices included nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, or physician assistants. State laws vary in the scope of services allowed for nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Nurse practitioners require graduate education beyond a bachelor's degree and can work independently or with physicians in various healthcare tasks. There are approximately 155,000 active U.S. nurse practitioners. Physician assistants complete at least two years of college courses before applying to accredited programs. Most have a bachelor's degree and undergo 27 months of training. Physician assistants typically have a bachelor's degree, 27 months of specialized training, and 2,000 hours of clinical rotations. They can take patient histories, examine patients, treat minor injuries, order tests, and make rounds in medical facilities. There are about 86,000 certified physician assistants in the United States. Historically, physicians have operated in small practices, with laws in some states complicating affiliation with other healthcare providers. During the 1930s, a committee suggested improving healthcare by affiliating doctors with hospitals, sparking controversy over corporate medicine. In the 1980s and 1990s, managed care plans grew, coordinating healthcare through affiliated providers. In the 1980s and 1990s, managed care plans grew by coordinating healthcare through affiliated providers. Physicians sold practices to hospitals or management companies due to pressure from health plans for lower payment rates. However, consumer protests led to loosened controls, causing mergers and acquisitions to dissolve. Consolidation continued, with a decline in doctors owning their practices from 62% in 1996-1997 to 54% in 2004-2005. The percentage of office visits to physicians in solo practices declined from 38.7% in 1997 to 30.5% in 2007, while visits to practices of 6-10 physicians rose from 12.1% in 1997 to 17.7% in 2007. Recent trends show a reconsolidation of physician practices, with a rise in practices owned by hospitals and insurers. Studies indicate a decrease in solo practices and an increase in larger practices, with more doctors working under exclusive contracts with hospitals and insurance companies. The share of physicians working for hospitals has not significantly increased since 2000, but fewer doctors now own their practices and more are working as employees. Accenture predicted that only a third of U.S. doctors would be truly independent by 2013, compared to 57% in 2000 and 43% in 2009. Factors contributing to this trend include the complexity and cost of running a practice, concerns about physician shortages, declining reimbursement rates, and the cost of implementing new systems like electronic health records. The trend of physicians moving away from owning their practices towards working as employees is influenced by factors such as the complexity and cost of running a practice, concerns about physician shortages, declining reimbursement rates, and the cost of implementing new systems like electronic health records. Practice changes include horizontal and vertical consolidation, with examples such as hospitals buying physician practices, physicians affiliating with insurers, and the growth of concierge practices impacting physician supply and patient care. The trend of physicians moving towards larger practices is increasing, offering advantages such as leverage in negotiations with insurance companies and access to advanced technology. Physicians can organize into different configurations, including mergers and independent practice associations. For-profit practice management companies and private equity investment in physician practices are also on the rise. Practice consolidation figures are not definitive. The trend of physicians moving towards larger practices is increasing, with a doubling of mergers, acquisitions, and private equity investments in specialty physician practices between 2008 and 2012. The Affordable Care Act is driving changes in the healthcare system, leading to the creation of larger medical group practices and transactions among specialty physician groups, medical clinics, hospitals, and other organizations. Notable examples include the 2011 merger of Cogent HMG and the Hospitalists Management Group, creating the largest private hospitalist company. Cogent, IPC The Hospitalist Company, and Mednax are examples of companies in the healthcare industry that are experiencing consolidation. The American Hospital Association reported a 32% increase in hospital employment of doctors from 2000 to 2010, indicating a growing trend towards larger medical practices. Merritt Hawkins, a physician search and consulting firm, also highlighted the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry. The healthcare industry is experiencing consolidation, with companies like Cogent, IPC The Hospitalist Company, and Mednax merging. Merritt Hawkins reported a shift towards larger medical practices, with hospitals increasingly hiring doctors. A survey by the American College of Cardiology showed a growing trend of hospital administrators acquiring cardiology practices. The number of hospitalists has also significantly increased in recent years. The number of hospitalists has risen significantly from less than 1,000 in the late 1990s to nearly 30,000 in 2011. Physician-hospital affiliations can take various forms, including contracts for specific services, full-time employment of doctors, and the formation of physician-hospital organizations or joint ventures. Financial incentives have driven changes in these arrangements over time. Physician-hospital affiliations can take various forms, such as joint ventures or contracts for services, to achieve financial and clinical integration. These affiliations can benefit both physicians and hospitals by reducing overhead, providing predictable schedules and compensation for physicians, developing areas of excellence for hospitals, ensuring staff, and increasing revenues. Joint ventures like outpatient centers can also help hospitals compete with independent practices. Medicare reimbursement disparities between hospitals and independent physician offices incentivize physician-hospital affiliations. Hospitals charging facility fees for physician visits result in higher costs for payers and patients. Medpac warns that increased outpatient billing by hospitals could raise Medicare costs by $2 billion annually by 2020. This payment difference drives hospitals to acquire and convert freestanding physician offices into outpatient departments. Hospitals are acquiring freestanding physician offices and converting them into outpatient departments (OPDs) to increase clinic visits. However, hospital employment of physicians may lead to initial financial losses and decreased productivity. Despite hospitals preparing for coordinated systems like ACOs, challenges remain in the transition process. Physicians are transitioning to coordinated systems like ACOs while still being compensated on a fee-for-service basis. Insurance companies are affiliating with physicians to control costs. The success of these arrangements depends on factors like decision-making power and financial concerns. Some recent affiliations in the healthcare industry include UnitedHealth Group acquiring Monarch HealthCare's management arm, Cigna expanding its accountable care network, and Highmark Inc. working on acquiring West Penn Allegheny Health System to develop an integrated care system. Various healthcare providers are forming affiliations to qualify as ACOs under the ACA. ACOs under the ACA involve group practices, independent practitioners, and networks meeting HHS standards. ACOs contract with payers to be accountable for care, sharing savings if costs are lower and quality measures are met. The Medicare Shared Savings Program contracts with ACOs to improve care quality and coordination. Industry analysts predict ACOs will impact the healthcare marketplace by accelerating consolidation. The ACA promotes integration in healthcare by encouraging ACOs, medical homes, bundled payments, and provider affiliations to improve care coordination and reduce costs. Market changes are expected to accelerate consolidation in the healthcare industry. Some analysts predict long-lasting market changes in healthcare due to moves towards integrated care. Private equity firms are targeting companies that can capitalize on consolidation by providing management services or physician staff. Bain & Co. forecasts increased strategic interest in accountable-care investments. Some doctors are creating concierge practices in response to pressures to change healthcare delivery and reimbursement. Some physicians are adapting to changes in healthcare delivery and reimbursement by establishing concierge practices, where patients pay an annual fee for enhanced services. Despite concerns about the impact on physician supply, the number of such practices remains relatively small. A 2010 study found at least 756 retainer-based physicians with average fees ranging from $1,500 to $2,000, serving 100 to 425 patients each. Several states have examined whether concierge medicine is in compliance with insurance laws, including issues regarding additional fees and Medicare patient inclusion. Physicians seeking to affiliate with other practices must comply with state and federal laws to ensure fair competition and prevent over-utilization of services. To ensure fair competition and transparency in the health care sector, laws such as federal antitrust and anti-kickback statutes, state laws against the corporate practice of medicine, and the Stark law limiting physician self-referrals are in place. Antitrust laws aim to maintain competitive markets and govern market behavior. Consolidation or integration of health care entities could raise antitrust concerns, even if done to improve the health care sector. Joint negotiation over fees by physicians or providers is an example of such behavior. Behavior such as joint negotiation over fees by physicians or providers may implicate antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. The FTC and DOJ provide guidance on configurations like ACOs that could pass antitrust review. Hospital physician mergers are under investigation by the DOJ and FTC. The DOJ and FTC are investigating hospital physician mergers due to potential violations of the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback law. This law prohibits offering or receiving anything of value in exchange for patient referrals or purchasing services reimbursable by federal health care programs. Violators may face fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal health care programs. The Stark law, enacted in 1989, prohibits physician self-referrals for designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid to prevent conflicts of interest. The Stark law prohibits physician self-referrals to prevent conflicts of interest and overutilization in healthcare. Direct employment of physicians may be a straightforward way for hospitals to integrate with physicians, despite potential financial downsides. Congress is closely monitoring consolidation in the healthcare industry, including physician practices. Lawmakers in the 112th Congress are actively interested in market developments in healthcare due to physician complaints about federal policies and concerns about declining independent practices exacerbating physician shortages. Congressional action can impact practice consolidation and market trends, with a focus on rising healthcare costs, efforts to control medical spending, and incentives for consolidation to improve efficiency. Physician affiliations with health organizations like hospitals may not necessarily reduce costs, as larger entities could increase prices by leveraging negotiations with insurers. Studies on integration between physician practices and hospitals have shown mixed results on improving efficiencies and reducing healthcare service prices. For example, a study in California during the 1990s did not find evidence of increased prices with affiliations, and some evidence suggested that vertical integration may have actually lowered prices, although the findings were not statistically significant. Some studies show that physician-hospital affiliations may not lower costs and could potentially lead to higher prices due to increased market power. Concerns arise that large organizations like ACOs could gain more negotiating leverage with insurers, resulting in higher charges for patients. Some analysts suggest that patients are facing higher charges for services in hospital outpatient settings due to differences in Medicare payment. Stronger antitrust oversight is recommended to address pricing concerns, with an increase in FTC and DOJ investigations of proposed mergers. Coordinated care delivery systems are still in the early stages, and health care payments are primarily based on volume of services rather than quality improvements. Hospitals are hiring physicians or buying practices based on productivity, potentially leading to more physician services in the future. Efforts at physician coordination could improve access to care. Some experts believe that physician coordination efforts could enhance access to care by increasing competition and creating networks with additional services for underserved consumers. Concerns have been raised about changes in the doctor-patient relationship and potential disparities in the healthcare system as more doctors work in larger practices. There is also a question about whether patient-driven systems could lead to a disincentive to treat sicker, more expensive patients. Some lawmakers are concerned that consolidation in healthcare could make it harder for rural areas to attract physicians. Analysts suggest that fewer physicians in rural areas may have more negotiating power with local hospitals. The issue of access to doctors and specialists in integrated health care systems like ACOs and medical homes is also a concern, as it may impact consumer choice and freedom. Some analysts emphasize the importance of analyzing patients' access to primary and specialty physicians in emerging health organizations. Initiatives to expand the scope of care provided by nurse practitioners and physician assistants are being debated to increase supply and possibly reduce prices. New payment and delivery systems aim to enhance physician reimbursement by promoting coordinated care to improve quality and reduce costs. The Congressional Budget Office analysis of past Medicare demonstration programs showed mixed results in reducing spending through quality care initiatives. Physicians may have incentives to upcode initial diagnoses for larger quality improvements. A 2012 study at the University of Washington found improvements in care quality and health savings. Smaller physician practices may face challenges in implementing new quality-based systems like medical homes due to upfront costs. The segmentation of physicians due to market changes could impact efforts to improve care coordination. Some physicians now exclusively manage patients in ambulatory settings, leading to two separate physician communities. Primary care physicians are often seen as central to managing patient care under quality-based systems, with potential financial penalties for coordinating physicians based on the quality of care provided by other providers. The rise of hospitalists, emergency room physicians, and other hospital-based physicians with segmented roles can make care coordination more challenging. Lower-income consumers often use emergency rooms for care, where specialized doctors may admit patients without involving primary care physicians early on. Doctors have limited control over setting prices for their services, as they are largely determined by federal payment rates or negotiations with insurers. Physician income is influenced by factors like specialty, payment source, and productivity. General practitioners earn less than specialists. Studies show that physician income has decreased in real terms, with fees dropping by 25% from 1995 to 2006. Despite working fewer hours, income did not decline as much, suggesting doctors may be finding other ways to earn money. Physician income has decreased in real terms, with fees dropping by 25% from 1995 to 2006. A second study found that average physician net income declined about 7% after inflation from 1995 to 2003, though there were differences among specialties. The recession from 2007 to 2009 may have impacted physician income, with a 17% decline in visits by privately insured patients under age 65 from 2009 to 2011. Physician practice operating costs have not decreased in line with compensation, posing financial challenges for small practices. Federal Policies Affecting Compensation: Physicians accepting Medicare patients face challenges with determining proper payment levels. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula, leading to annual cuts in physician reimbursement. The Affordable Care Act includes incentives to boost primary care, but does not address the SGR issue. Practices entering new payment systems like ACOs may struggle to raise capital without affiliating with other providers. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced financial incentives to increase primary care, including a 10% bonus for Medicare primary care services from 2011 to 2016. It also implemented new Medicare payment systems like the Medicare Shared Savings Program for doctors in Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). Solo and group physician practices are facing costs for transitioning to electronic health record (EHR) technology, with assistance from Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs. Average EHR implementation costs can be as much as $54,000 per physician. Physicians can receive incentive payments under Medicare of up to $44,000 over five years, with an additional 10% for practicing in medically underserved areas. Beginning in 2015, non-meaningful EHR technology users will see a reduction in Medicare Part B reimbursement."
