    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Oil Spill Research and Prevention Act of 2009\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that the United States is an Arctic nation with a 700-mile border with the Arctic Ocean, over 100,000,000 acres of land above the Arctic Circle, and a broader Arctic area including the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The Arctic region is home to an indigenous population that has relied on marine mammals, fish, and wildlife unique to the region for millennia. The Arctic region, crucial to the national interest of the United States, has produced over 16 billion barrels of oil and may hold additional reserves. Temperatures in the US Arctic have risen by 3-4 degrees Celsius in the past 50 years, twice the global average. The Arctic ice pack is rapidly diminishing, with estimates suggesting the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer within 30 years, impacting indigenous populations. The impact of climate change in the Arctic is significant for indigenous communities and ecosystems, opening up new areas for development such as offshore oil and gas, fishing, shipping, and tourism. The harsh conditions in the Arctic Ocean increase the risk of maritime accidents, and there is a need for continued research and technological improvement in oil spill response and recovery in Arctic waters to enhance environmental preparedness and maritime security in the United States. The Act aims to enhance the US readiness for Arctic maritime accidents, understand oil behavior in cold water, and improve oil spill prevention, treatment, and recovery capabilities in Arctic waters. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will assess and act to reduce risk and enhance US response capabilities to a maritime disaster in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea. This includes prioritizing resources for oil spill response, coordinating contingency plans, expanding search and rescue capabilities, designating ports of refuge, and evaluating navigational infrastructure. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will assess and act to reduce risk and enhance US response capabilities to a maritime disaster in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea by evaluating and enhancing navigational and vessel monitoring infrastructure, as well as integrating local and traditional knowledge into prevention and response strategies. SEC. 5. RESEARCH AND ACTION TO CONDUCT OIL SPILL PREVENTION. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with other agencies, will direct research to improve the US ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from oil spills in Arctic waters. This includes prioritizing resources for ecological baselines, critical habitats, and oil technologies for safe navigation and response strategies. The research will focus on response strategies for oil spills in Arctic waters, including data on currents, winds, weather, waves, spill monitoring, and ice forecasting. It aims to develop monitoring programs, improve technologies for cold water oil recovery, and integrate local knowledge. Additionally, hydrographic surveys and navigational charting of Arctic waters will be conducted.

Additionally, hydrographic surveys and navigational charting of Arctic waters will be conducted. SEC. 6. RISK ASSESSMENT. The Secretary of Commerce will request a risk assessment from the National Research Council to enhance safety and reduce environmental impacts of industrial activities in Arctic waters. The assessment will include recommendations for measures to prevent and respond to oil spills, consulting with various agencies. The National Research Council will provide a risk assessment to Congress for industrial activities in Arctic waters, as requested by the Secretary of Commerce. SEC. 7. FUNDING FOR ARCTIC OIL SPILL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is amended to allocate $8,150,000 annually for Arctic oil spill research and development from 2010 to 2014. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is amended to allocate funds annually to various agencies for Arctic oil spill research and development: $2,150,000 to the Coast Guard, $2,000,000 to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, $2,000,000 to the Environmental Protection Agency, and $2,000,000 to the Minerals Management Service. Additionally, a conforming amendment increases the total allocation to $35,400,000. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015: $15,000,000 to the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates for infrastructure and operational activities, and $15,000,000 to the Secretary of Commerce."
