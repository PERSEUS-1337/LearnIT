    "title": "SB 1285",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 23826.13 of the Business and Professions Code allows the department to issue up to five new neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general licenses in certain census tracts in San Francisco starting from January 1, 2017. The eligible census tracts are specified within the City and County of San Francisco. The Department can issue new neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general licenses in specific census tracts in San Francisco. The licenses will follow a set procedure and will not be issued if the applicant already holds on-sale licenses for the same premises. Applicants with existing on-sale general licenses for a premises cannot apply for a license under this section for that same premises. Applicants for neighborhood-restricted on-sale general licenses must meet all requirements for a bona fide eating place license. Before applying, they must hold a preapplication meeting with neighbors and community members within the census tract. Notification of the meeting must be sent to residents within a 500-foot radius at least 14 days in advance. Applicants for a neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general license must notify residents within a 500-foot radius of the premises, relevant neighborhood associations, and the Chief of Police. They must also submit verification of a preapplication meeting with the local government body. Licenses issued under this section cannot be transferred between counties. A license issued under this section cannot be transferred between counties or to any other premises. It also cannot be transferred to any person, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, except under specific circumstances outlined in other sections. Upon cancellation, the license must be returned to the department for reissuance following specified procedures. A neighborhood-restricted special on-sale general license cannot be exchanged for a public premises license. It has the same privileges and restrictions as an on-sale general license for a bona fide eating place, except for off-sale beer and wine. The fees for this license are the same as those for a bona fide eating place license, and all collected fees go to the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund. The department will establish rules to enforce the provisions of this section. The Legislature deems a special law necessary due to unique liquor license distribution in San Francisco. No reimbursement is required by this act for local agencies or school districts, as any costs incurred would be due to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. Reimbursement may be pursued under existing law."
