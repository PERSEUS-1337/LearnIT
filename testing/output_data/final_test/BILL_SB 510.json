    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 23103 of the Vehicle Code in California is amended to define reckless driving as willful or wanton disregard for safety on the highway or in offstreet parking facilities. Offenders face imprisonment in a county jail for 5 to 90 days or a fine of $145 to $1,000, or both. If a person is convicted of reckless driving in California, their vehicle may be impounded at their expense for 30 days. The impoundment period can be reduced if the vehicle was impounded previously. However, if the vehicle is the only means of transportation for the defendant's family and impounding it would cause undue hardship, the court may choose not to impound it. The vehicle can be released to the legal owner or their agent after 30 days if certain conditions are met. The legal owner, a motor vehicle dealer, bank, or other licensed financial institution, must pay all towing and storage fees for impounded vehicles. No lien sale processing fees are charged if the vehicle is redeemed within 15 days. The legal owner must present foreclosure documents or an affidavit of repossession. Section 23109 of the Vehicle Code is amended. Section 23109 of the Vehicle Code is amended to prohibit motor vehicle speed contests on highways, including races against other vehicles or timing devices. It also prohibits aiding or abetting in such contests and engaging in motor vehicle exhibitions of speed. A person is prohibited from obstructing or placing barricades on highways for the purpose of aiding or participating in motor vehicle speed contests or exhibitions. A person convicted of violating highway obstruction laws may face imprisonment, fines, community service, and potential suspension of their driver's license for 90 days to six months. Driving privileges may be restricted to necessary travel to and from work, or within the scope of employment. Probation may be granted in suitable cases. If convicted of violating subdivision (a) causing bodily injury, punishment includes imprisonment for 30 days to six months or a fine of $500 to $1,000. Repeat offenses within five years result in imprisonment for four days to six months and a fine of $500 to $1,000. If a second violation of causing bodily injury within a five-year period results in imprisonment for 30 days to six months and a fine of $500 to $1,000. If serious bodily injury is caused, the punishment is imprisonment in state prison or county jail for 30 days to one year and a fine of $500 to $1,000. The court may suspend the privilege to operate a motor vehicle for six months for a person convicted of certain offenses, with the option to restrict driving to necessary travel to and from work. This does not affect the court's ability to grant probation. If probation is granted to a person convicted of a violation, they may be required to spend 48 hours to six months in jail. Their driving privilege will be suspended for six months or restricted. If the convicted person's vehicle is registered to them, it will be impounded for 30 days at their expense, with possible reduction for prior impoundment days. If the impounded vehicle violates a mechanical requirement or code, an officer may issue a notice to correct within 30 days of release. Upon correction, the violation will be dismissed. A vehicle seized and impounded must be released to the legal owner or their agent within 30 days if certain conditions are met, including payment of towing and storage fees and presentation of foreclosure documents or repossession affidavit. If convicted of violating certain sections, a person may face up to 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $500, or both. If a person's driving privilege is restricted by a court, the restriction will be marked on their license and notified to the Department of Motor Vehicles. The DMV will record the restriction and include it on any subsequent licenses issued during the restriction period. The Louis Friend Memorial Act allows for imprisonment on non-employment days for those convicted under this section. Section 23109.2 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow for immediate arrest and seizure of the motor vehicle used in offenses such as motor vehicle speed contests and reckless driving on a highway. The Louis Friend Memorial Act allows for imprisonment on non-employment days for those convicted under this section. Reckless driving on a highway, reckless driving in an offstreet parking facility, and exhibition of speed on a highway are offenses that can lead to vehicle seizure. The registered owner can request a storage hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment. An impounding agency must release a vehicle to the owner if it is stolen. The Louis Friend Memorial Act allows for imprisonment on non-employment days for those convicted under this section. Vehicle seizure can occur if the vehicle is stolen, the driver was unauthorized by the owner, the owner was not present or unaware, the owner is a rental car agency, or if charges are dismissed. A vehicle can be released if the owner presents a valid driver's license and registration, or if ordered by a court. If a vehicle is released early, no one is responsible for towing and storage charges. A seized vehicle must be released to the legal owner or their agent within 30 days if certain conditions are met. The legal owner, a motor vehicle dealer, bank, or other licensed financial institution, must pay all towing and storage fees for impounded vehicles. No lien sale processing fees are charged if the vehicle is redeemed within 15 days. The legal owner must present foreclosure documents or an affidavit of repossession. The registered owner is responsible for all towing and storage charges if the vehicle is impounded. If the convicted person was not authorized to operate the vehicle, they must reimburse the owner for towing and storage charges. Rental agencies can also require payment for towing and storage charges related to impoundment. The owner is not liable for towing and storage charges if acquitted or charges are dismissed. The vehicle cannot be sold before the defendant's conviction. The impounding agency is responsible for towing costs if the registered owner is not liable. Storage period is included in the impoundment ordered by the court. If the Commission on State Mandates finds that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts according to the Government Code."
