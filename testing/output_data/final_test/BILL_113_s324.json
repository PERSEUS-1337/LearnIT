    "content": "The Act titled \"Puerto Rico Medicare Part B Equity Act of 2013\" applies the Part B deemed enrollment process to residents of Puerto Rico, providing a special enrollment period and limiting late enrollment penalties. The Act extends the Part B deemed enrollment process to Puerto Rico residents, removes the exclusion, and applies to those enrolling after a specified date. It also provides a special enrollment period and limits late enrollment penalties for certain Medicare beneficiaries. The Act extends Part B enrollment to Puerto Rico residents, providing a special enrollment period of 7 months for eligible individuals not yet enrolled. The Act extends Part B enrollment to Puerto Rico residents with a special 7-month enrollment period for eligible individuals. For those enrolling during this special period, coverage under section 1838 starts on the first day of the second month after enrollment. The term 'effective month' refers to a month specified by the Secretary between October 2014 and January 2015. There is a reduction in late enrollment penalties for current enrollees and individuals enrolling during the transition period. The late enrollment penalty under section 1839(b) is reduced to 15 percent for individuals enrolling during the transition period. During the transition period, a reduction in the late enrollment penalty to 15 percent applies to individuals enrolling before the special enrollment period ends. This reduction does not apply if the individual terminates enrollment after the special enrollment period. A transition individual in Puerto Rico would have been enrolled under this part before a specific date. During the transition period, a reduction in the late enrollment penalty to 15 percent applies to individuals enrolling before the special enrollment period ends, regardless of whether the individual is enrolled under this part as of such first day."
