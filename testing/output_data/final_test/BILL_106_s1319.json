    "content": "The \"Save My Home Act of 1999\" is the short title of this legislation, which aims to provide findings and purposes related to home protection. Congress finds the need for decent, safe, and affordable housing for low-income families, especially the elderly and persons with disabilities. There is a significant number of expiring section 8 contracts and project-based assistance units with lower rents compared to unassisted units in the same market. Many residents in federally assisted housing are elderly or disabled. The Department of Housing and Urban Development lacks the capacity to effectively appraise property values. In 1998, 219 properties with over 25,000 units chose not to renew their section 8 contracts, resulting in the loss of affordable housing. Currently, 3,000 section 8 project-based units are lost each month due to owners choosing to prepay or opt-out of their contracts. Many section 8 project-based housing projects are opting out of renewing their contracts, leading to a scarcity of affordable housing in certain areas. Residents receiving vouchers due to contract non-renewals struggle to find suitable housing. Without changes to the contract terms, more owners are expected to opt-out in the future. Many section 8 project-based housing owners are choosing not to renew their contracts, leading to unaffordable rent increases for current residents. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has the authority to renew contracts at market rent levels but has not implemented a policy, resulting in the unnecessary loss of affordable housing options. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has funds to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at market rates but has not made them available, leading to the loss of affordable housing units. The Act aims to protect vulnerable residents, especially the elderly and persons with disabilities, in affordable housing. The Act aims to protect vulnerable residents in affordable housing, especially the elderly, persons with disabilities, and those with large families, by ensuring the renewal of expiring section 8 project-based contracts. This includes efforts to renew contracts in rural areas and areas with low vacancy rates before providing flexible rental options. Contracts under section 8 are renewed with flexible rental assistance, including enhanced vouchers, to prevent vulnerable populations from being displaced when rent becomes unaffordable due to owners opting out of renewing their project-based contracts. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, definitions include \"assisted dwelling unit\" as a unit in a covered project with rental assistance, and \"covered project\" as housing with more than 4 units covered by project-based assistance contracts. The programs mentioned include property disposition, moderate rehabilitation, loan management assistance, and section 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The curr_chunk discusses housing contracts expiring between fiscal years 2000-2004 under specific programs like the rent supplement program and section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937. Residents of this housing are not eligible for enhanced voucher assistance. The curr_chunk defines terms related to housing assistance programs, such as \"covered resident\" and \"low-vacancy area,\" under the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997. The curr_chunk defines terms related to housing assistance programs, such as \"project-based assistance\" and \"tenant-based assistance,\" with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development being defined as the \"Secretary.\" SEC. 4. RENEWAL OF SECTION 8 PROJECT-BASED CONTRACTS. The Secretary may use funds for renewing assistance under section 8 of the US Housing Act to provide assistance for covered projects at market rent levels. Mandatory renewals must be offered at rent levels not exceeding market rates. The Secretary can use funds to renew assistance for covered projects at market rent levels, based on appraisals from comparable properties. Rent levels should not exceed market rates and are adjusted for units occupied by elderly or disabled families in low-vacancy areas. The Secretary can renew assistance for covered projects at market rent levels based on appraisals from comparable properties, ensuring that assistance provided is not greater than necessary for affordable housing. The Secretary and owner of a covered project may agree to a 10-year renewal of a contract for assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, subject to annual appropriations. SEC. 5. ENHANCED VOUCHERS FOR RESIDENTS OF PROJECTS WITH EXPIRING SECTION 8 CONTRACTS. Upon expiration of a contract for assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, the Secretary will provide enhanced voucher assistance to residents of covered projects in low-vacancy areas. This assistance may also be available to other low-income families in assisted dwelling units. Upon expiration of a Section 8 contract, enhanced voucher assistance is provided to families in covered projects. If the family stays in the same unit with rent exceeding the payment standard, assistance is based on the rent amount. If the family moves, a different payment standard applies. The payment standard for the family's dwelling unit is determined according to section 8(o). Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2000-2004 to carry out this section. SEC. 6. APPRAISALS. The Secretary shall establish an Appraisal Clearinghouse in conjunction with the Appraisal Standards Foundation to collect appraisal data and develop model standards for establishing market value of multifamily housing in the US, including rural areas.

Additionally, regulations must be issued within 6 months of the Act's enactment."
