    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Earned Income Credit Information Act of 2008\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress created the earned income credit (EIC) in 1975 to help working poor families and encourage low-income workers to seek employment. President Reagan praised the EIC as an effective anti-poverty measure. The EIC has grown into the largest Federal anti-poverty program in the US, with 22.8 million tax filers receiving $42.4 billion in tax credits in 2005. In 2007, the EIC provided a maximum Federal benefit of $4,716 for families with 2 or more children. In 2007, the Earned Income Credit (EIC) provided $4,716 for families with 2 or more children, $2,853 for families with a single child, and $428 for taxpayers with no qualifying children. Studies show that 25% of eligible individuals do not claim the EIC, resulting in approximately $8 billion in unclaimed credits in 2004. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Bill 650 into law in response to a study finding 460,000 eligible California families did not file for the EIC. The law enacted in October 13, 2007, requires California employers to notify employees of their potential eligibility for the Earned Income Credit (EIC). The purpose of this Act is to inform Americans about their eligibility for the EIC in a way that is not burdensome for employers or the Government. The Federal Government should enact a similar law to ensure that tax benefits reach the maximum number of people. SEC. 3. EMPLOYER NOTIFICATION OF AVAILABILITY OF EARNED INCOME CREDIT. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require employers to notify employees about the Earned Income Credit. Employers must provide a notice to potential EIC-eligible employees, defined as those with annual wages below the phase-out threshold for the EIC credit. The notice must include IRS Notice 797 or a similar statement. In 2008, the earned income credit benefits are available for taxpayers with earnings up to $38,646 ($41,646 if married filing jointly). Eligibility and benefit amounts vary based on filing status, number of qualifying children, and income levels. For example, childless taxpayers earning less than $15,880, taxpayers with 1 child earning less than $36,995, and taxpayers with 2 or more children earning less than a certain amount are eligible for the earned income credit. Taxpayers with 2 or more children earning less than $41,646 may qualify for the earned income credit. Earned income credit payments will not affect eligibility for various assistance programs. To determine eligibility and receive the credit, individuals must file a tax return. Free tax preparation assistance is available through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. Contact the IRS for more information at 1-800-829-1040 or visit www.irs.gov. For taxable years after 2008, the earned income credit phase-out limits have been adjusted based on the taxpayer's income and number of qualifying children. Taxpayers can contact the IRS for more information on sites in their area to receive assistance with tax preparation. For taxable years after 2008, the earned income credit phase-out limits have been adjusted based on income and number of qualifying children. An employer with 25 or fewer employees is exempt from providing notices under this section if they were in existence throughout the preceding calendar year. The notice required by subsection (a) must be provided to each employee at the same time the employer statement is given under section 6051. Special rules apply for controlled groups and predecessors of employers. The notice required by subsection (a) must be provided to each employee at the same time the employer statement is given under section 6051. It can be provided by hand or by mail to the employee's address used for the statement. Failure to provide this notice may result in a penalty under section 6724(d)(2) of the Code. Additionally, a new subparagraph (DD) related to employer notification of the availability of earned income credit is added. The amendments made by this section require employers to notify employees about the availability of the earned income credit. The effective date for these changes is more than 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
