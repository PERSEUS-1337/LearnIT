    "content": "The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) incentivizes hiring employees with specific characteristics by subsidizing a portion of their wages. Employers may choose to hire WOTC-eligible applicants to lower after-tax costs. The credit benefits workers from target groups but does not create new jobs. The WOTC section of the Internal Revenue Code specifies an expiration date for eligible wages, recently extended by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. Eligible workers must start before December 31, 2019. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) allows employers to claim a credit of 40% of qualified wages for eligible workers who work at least 400 hours in their first year of employment. If the worker works fewer hours, the credit percentage decreases. The maximum credit is based on statutory limits for each eligible population. For example, the maximum eligible wages for a qualified ex-felon is $6,000. The maximum credit for an employer hiring a qualified ex-felon is 40% of $6,000, totaling $2,400. Most eligible workers can receive a maximum credit of $2,400 if they work at least 400 hours. Different populations may have varying levels of qualified wages, with some having higher or lower than $6,000. Eligibility criteria include being a Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) recipient for 9 out of 18 months. A qualified veteran is a worker who served in the US armed forces for at least 180 days, has been discharged for at least 60 days, and meets certain criteria such as being a member of a family receiving SNAP assistance or having a service-connected disability. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program provides incentives for hiring certain individuals, including veterans with periods of unemployment, qualified ex-felons, designated community residents, and vocational rehabilitation referrals. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program offers incentives for hiring specific individuals, such as veterans, ex-felons, designated community residents, and vocational rehabilitation referrals. Other eligible groups include Summer Youth Employees, Qualified SNAP recipients, and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. Title XVI of the Social Security Act allows employers to claim the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) for hiring long-term TANF recipients and qualified long-term unemployment recipients. The WOTC is a nonrefundable credit, and employers must have tax liability to claim it. The maximum wages eligible for the WOTC for long-term family assistance recipients is $10,000 per year, with a 50% credit on eligible worker's wages in the second year of employment. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a nonrefundable credit that can be claimed by employers for hiring eligible workers. Employers must have tax liability to claim the credit, and it can be applied in a subsequent tax year if no tax liability exists in the year of hire. Tax-exempt organizations hiring WOTC-eligible veterans may also be eligible for a credit against payroll tax liability. Eligibility for the WOTC is determined by state workforce agencies, with two paths for the eligibility determination process. The determination process for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) involves obtaining conditional certification from a state agency, completing IRS Form 8850, and mailing both forms to the state's WOTC coordinator within 28 days of the new hire starting work. States verify eligibility and notify employers of certification. The employer is notified when the application for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is certified. States receive grants from the Department of Labor (DOL) to cover administrative costs. Once certified, the employer can claim WOTC as part of the General Business Credit. If there is no tax liability in the year of hire, the credit can be carried back one year or carried forward 20 years. IRS Form 8850 must be submitted within 28 days of the hire starting work. Data on WOTC usage and costs are not definitive, but insights can be gained from DOL and IRS data on certified workers and claims. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is claimed by certified workers, but not all certified workers meet retention requirements, leading to a lower number of claims. The primary cost of WOTC to the government is foregone tax revenue. Estimates of credits claimed are published annually, but may not fully reflect actual hiring. The U.S. Employment Service collects data on certifications issued to employers, which may exceed the number of employees for whom credits are claimed. Statistics on the number of individuals for whom credits are claimed are not collected by the government. In FY2017, there were over 2.0 million WOTC certifications, with SNAP recipients making up more than 68% of certifications and veterans accounting for about 7%. Most of the government costs from tax credits come from revenue forgone rather than appropriated funds. Data on WOTC claims are not precise. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) in FY2017 amounted to about $1.3 billion, with corporations claiming $1.0 billion and individuals claiming $320 million. Detailed data on claimants and qualifying workers is not available. The WOTC is a temporary provision with a limitation that wages paid to eligible workers hired after December 31, 2019, are not eligible for the credit. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) has been retroactively reauthorized multiple times, with changes to eligible populations and credit levels. The Welfare to Work Tax Credit, which existed from 1997 to 2006, was repealed in 2007, incorporating its eligible population into the WOTC. The WOTC was created by the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. The Business Job Protection Act of 1996 allowed for-profit employers to claim a tax credit for hiring specific groups from October 1996 to September 1997. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 revised the program, shortening the employment requirement and creating a two-tier subsidy. It also extended the credit until June 1998 and introduced the Welfare to Work tax credit. The WOTC was reauthorized multiple times by Congress, extending the credit for various groups until December 31, 2003. The program was amended to include renewal communities and New York Liberty Zone employees. The WOTC was extended until December 31, 2003, and included renewal communities and New York Liberty Zone employees. Qualified businesses in the vicinity of the World Trade Center or those relocated due to the 9/11 attacks could claim the credit for existing and new employees. The WOTC was extended until December 31, 2003, and included renewal communities and New York Liberty Zone employees. The first WOTC-related law enacted by the 108th Congress was P.L. 108-203, which modified the definition of the WOTC's vocational rehabilitation referral-eligible group to include disabled individuals with individualized work plans referred by employment networks. President George W. Bush signed P.L. 108-311, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004, extending the WOTC and WtW credits through December 31, 2005. The 109th Congress made temporary and permanent changes to tax provisions, including expanding WOTC eligibility to include Hurricane Katrina employees. P.L. 109-73 added individuals affected by the disaster to the eligible groups for WOTC, allowing them to be hired in the core disaster area. The WOTC and WtW credits were extended through December 31, 2005 by P.L. 108-311. In December 2006, P.L. 109-432 reauthorized the WOTC for two years, extending its expiration date to December 31, 2007, and incorporated the WtW credit into the WOTC. Changes to the WOTC credit became effective for persons hired after December 31, 2006, including expanded eligibility for ex-felons and food stamp recipients. The WOTC was extended through August 31, 2011, with changes including raising the age limit for \"designated community residents\" to less than 40 years old and clarifying definitions. The law also added \"rural renewal county\" as a place of residence for designated community residents. The WOTC was extended to cover designated community residents and disabled veterans. Congress also extended the credit for firms hiring \"Hurricane Katrina employees\" and temporarily expanded it to include unemployed veterans and disconnected youth under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The WOTC was extended to cover designated community residents, disabled veterans, and unemployed veterans and disconnected youth under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The eligibility of disconnected youth expired after December 31, 2010. The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act provided payroll tax forgiveness to employers who hired certain unemployed individuals in 2010, but they could not claim the WOTC for those wages associated with payroll tax forgiveness. Individuals hired after December 31, 2010, were not eligible for payroll tax forgiveness under the HIRE Act. The WOTC was extended through December 31, 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act expanded the qualified veterans group covered by WOTC and adjusted the maximum wages for the credit based on specific criteria. The WOTC was extended through December 31, 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The VOW to Hire Heroes Act expanded the qualified veterans group covered by WOTC and adjusted the maximum wages for the credit based on specific criteria. P.L. 112-56 made the WOTC refundable for certain tax-exempt employers, extending it to U.S. possessions with a tax system mirroring the U.S. system. The maximum wages for the credit varied based on veterans' eligibility and unemployment status. The WOTC was extended through various legislative acts, including P.L. 112-56 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, with extensions up to December 31, 2013. Subsequent acts like the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 and the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 further expanded and retroactively extended the WOTC for eligible employees. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 expanded the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to include long-term unemployment recipients starting work after December 31, 2015, and extended the WOTC for all eligible populations through December 31, 2019."
