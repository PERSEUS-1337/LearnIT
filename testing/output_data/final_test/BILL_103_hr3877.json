The Attorney General may provide grants and technical assistance to States and multi-State compact associations for developing, expanding, and improving prison programs, facilities, and treatment for violent offenders with substance abuse problems. Grant funds can be used to contract with the private sector for services and utilize components of the Department of Justice. State and Multi-State Compact Applications require submission of an application to the Attorney General as prescribed. The chief executive of a State or multi-State compact association can designate private sector participants for facilities construction or services associated with grant-funded projects. The application must include construction details, prisoner selection criteria for programs, and certification of a law requiring life imprisonment for violent offenders with prior convictions. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must have a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole for individuals previously convicted of a crime of violence at the State or Federal level. The Attorney General can withdraw a State's qualifying status if they no longer meet these requirements or show progress towards them. The Attorney General has the authority to waive requirements for a State for up to one year if there are compelling law enforcement reasons. If a grant recipient is not in compliance with the terms, funding may be revoked or suspended by the Attorney General. The Attorney General and the Comptroller General have access to audit grant recipients' documents. The Attorney General can issue regulations and guidelines. $600,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1994-1998."
