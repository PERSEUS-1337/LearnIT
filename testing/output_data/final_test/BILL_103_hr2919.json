Guidelines are established for identifying, reducing, and preventing significant indoor air health risks. The \"Indoor Air Act of 1994\" mandates the Administrator to publish a list of common significant indoor air health risks using scientific data. Guidelines for identifying, reducing, and preventing these risks must also be published concurrently. The Administrator is required to periodically review and revise the list of common significant indoor air health risks and guidelines to reduce them. This review must be done at least every 4 years after the initial publication, with public input. The Administrator must ensure that indoor air quality guidelines are consistent with federal workplace regulations and energy conservation laws. Additionally, priority is given to conducting indoor air health studies with available funding. Authorities prioritize conducting and providing financial assistance for studies on indoor air quality, including human exposure to pollutants, sources of pollutants, health effects, and methods for reducing risks. Studies must undergo peer review. SEC. 4. INDOOR AIR CONTRACTORS. The Administrator must submit a report to Congress within 2 years of fiscal year 1996 on contractors involved in indoor air health risks, including the need for a certification program.

The Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will implement a Building Assessment Program to assist employers and employees in reducing indoor air health risks. Assessments can be requested by employers or employees for individual buildings, including Federal, State, and municipal buildings, based on the seriousness of health risks. The Building Assessment Program implemented by the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health aims to reduce indoor air health risks. Assessments will identify significant indoor air health risks, their sources and effects, and provide measures to eliminate or control them. Reports will be promptly provided to employers, employees, and building owners. SEC. 9.
