    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Private Activity Renewable Energy Bonds Act\" and it addresses the treatment of bonds issued for financing renewable energy resources, conservation and efficiency facilities, and specified greenhouse gas emission technologies. The \"Private Activity Renewable Energy Bonds Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to include renewable energy resource facilities, conservation and efficiency facilities, and high efficiency vehicles and related facilities or projects. It defines renewable energy resource facilities as those used to produce electric or thermal energy. The curr_chunk discusses the production of thermal energy from various renewable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal energy, marine and hydrokinetic energy, biogas, solids from wastewater treatment, and biomass. It also mentions special requirements for facilities producing biogas. The production of biogas must meet specific requirements to be considered for transportation or distribution, including being of pipeline quality or used for onsite electricity or hydrogen fuel with a minimum British thermal unit content. The term 'pipeline quality' for biogas means a British thermal unit content of at least 930 per cubic foot. Geothermal energy is derived from geothermal deposits or geothermal heat pumps. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy is defined in section 45(c)(10). Incremental hydropower refers to additional energy generated from efficiency improvements or capacity additions to existing hydropower facilities. The term 'biogas' refers to a gaseous fuel derived from various sources such as landfill, municipal solid waste, food waste, wastewater, biosolids, or biomass. The term 'facility' in a recovery energy resource facility includes prepayments for purchasing electricity from renewable energy property and prepayments of a lease or license of such property, as long as the prepayment agreement cannot be canceled before the tax assessment loan expires. The term 'facility' in a recovery energy resource facility includes prepayments for purchasing electricity from renewable energy property and prepayments of a lease or license of such property, as long as the prepayment agreement cannot be canceled before the tax assessment loan expires. Conservation and Efficiency Facilities and Projects refer to facilities used for energy conservation, energy efficiency, smart grid technologies, and energy storage, transmission, or distribution. Implement smart grid technologies and facilities for water conservation and efficiency, including reducing water demand, improving water use efficiency, and enhancing land management practices for water conservation.

Additionally, it mentions a national limitation on the amount of renewable energy bonds. The text introduces tax assessment financing for high efficiency vehicles and related facilities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes a national limitation on the amount of renewable energy bonds issued by states. The Secretary allocates authority to issue bonds to each State based on population, not exceeding $2.5 billion in total. States can allocate their share among specified facilities or projects as they see fit. Any unused bond allocation can be carried over to qualified states.
