    "content": "Medicaid is a federal-state program providing financial assistance for medical care to poor, elderly, and disabled individuals. States must comply with federal regulations to receive funding and have flexibility in administering the program. States facing budget challenges have looked to reduce Medicaid costs, including cutting provider reimbursement rates. Providers have challenged Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions in court, arguing they violate the equal access provision of the Social Security Act. This provision requires states to ensure payments are sufficient to enlist enough providers for care and services. Medicaid beneficiaries and others have claimed that inadequate reimbursement rates lead to insufficient care and services compared to the general population in the area. Plaintiffs argue that low provider reimbursement rates do not meet the equal access provision, as they do not ensure enough care for beneficiaries. Plaintiffs have sought legal avenues to challenge Medicaid payment rate cuts under the equal access provision, as the Medicaid Act does not explicitly allow private parties to do so. They have historically used 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 to sue state officials for violating their rights by not complying with reimbursement rate requirements. Multiple courts have allowed Medicaid providers and beneficiaries to enforce the equal access provision through this legal action. In 2002, the Supreme Court's decision in Gonzaga University v. Doe limited plaintiffs' ability to enforce the equal access provision under Section 1983. Most appellate courts ruled that the provision is not privately enforceable. Medicaid providers and beneficiaries have looked for other legal options to challenge reimbursement rates, such as the 10% cut in Medi-Cal provider rates enacted by California in 2008. Plaintiffs, including pharmacies, health care providers, and senior citizens' groups, alleged that California's rate cut violated the Supremacy Clause by not properly evaluating compliance with the federal equal access provision. The Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's decision, allowing the plaintiffs to challenge the state law's preemption by federal statute. On April 1, 2009, the director filed a petition for Supreme Court review, which was denied. The district court found that the defendant did not meet the equal access provision requirements and granted the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the state law rate cut. The plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rate reduction was affirmed by the court of appeals. The director's attempt to vacate the decision on moot grounds was denied. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if Medicaid recipients and providers can enforce the equal access provision under the Supremacy Clause. The Supreme Court will address whether private parties can use the Supremacy Clause to challenge a California law reducing Medicaid reimbursement rates. Respondents argue that a statutory cause of action is not needed to bring a preemption claim, citing Court precedent. California's Department of Health Care Services disagrees, claiming the Ninth Circuit misused the Supremacy Clause in allowing the challenge. The director's petition urges the Supreme Court to find that allowing Medi-Cal beneficiaries and providers to use the Supremacy Clause to enforce a federal statute without a private right of action goes against congressional intent. The Court will hear oral arguments in the Douglas cases during its October 2011 term. The Court will hear oral arguments in the Douglas cases during its October 2011 term, which could determine if the Supremacy Clause allows court review of issues related to a state's Medicaid program. A ruling for Medicaid providers and beneficiaries could enable litigation previously obstructed by Gonzaga, potentially allowing individuals to challenge preemption under other federal statutes. Advocates for Medicaid beneficiaries believe a decision in their favor is crucial to enforce states' obligations under Medicaid, especially with the expansion of the program. Allowing private litigants to sue for equal access provision could lead to increased state spending, as argued by some states in an amicus brief. The Court will evaluate if a cause of action can be brought under the Supremacy Clause for a potential violation of the equal access provision. The Court will not address whether the rate cuts violated the Medicaid Act, as CMS regulations will address the equal access provision. CMS issued proposed regulations on April 29, 2011, outlining a state-level process for reviewing reimbursement rates to ensure access to Medicaid services.
