This program is added as a new section under Part B of title XXIII of the Public Health Service Act. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" establishes a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. The Secretary may conduct research directly or provide grants to entities. Research includes studying HIV transmission to women, the relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases, and clinical trials on prevention methods. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" focuses on preventing HIV transmission in women by addressing sexually transmitted diseases. Research includes developing rapid diagnostic tests, affordable treatments, prevention methods, and substance abuse reduction programs for women. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" aims to reduce substance abuse among women and conduct research on the development, progression, and treatment of HIV symptoms in women. This includes behavioral research on prevention, understanding social, economic, and legal factors contributing to infection risk. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" addresses low participation of women in clinical trials and inadequate access to healthcare services. It focuses on gynecological evaluations in HIV trials for women, ensuring proper evaluation and follow-up services. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" focuses on conducting studies related to the effects of virus infections on the reproductive tract and determining the effectiveness of standard treatments for gynecological conditions arising from HIV infection. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" focuses on conducting clinical trials for HIV in women, considering factors like employment schedules and providing support services such as transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, and treatment for drug abuse. Services are tailored to meet the specific needs of women participating in clinical trials. The Act \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1996\" focuses on conducting clinical trials for HIV in women, considering factors like employment schedules and providing support services such as transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, and treatment for drug abuse. Services are tailored to meet the specific needs of women participating in clinical trials. The Act also emphasizes the importance of prevention programs for sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, including research on topical microbicide and physical barrier methods that women can use without their partner's knowledge. Priority is given to carrying out the topical microbicide research agenda. The National Institutes of Health focus on topical microbicide research, including basic research, product development, and clinical evaluation. Special consideration is given to non-spermicidal microbicides that do not affect women's ability to conceive healthy children. Epidemiological research is conducted to determine HIV risk factors specific to women. The curr_chunk discusses research on various aspects related to HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptives, vaginal products, the relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and noncoital sexual activity. Additionally, it mentions an interagency study known as the Women's Interagency HIV Study conducted by the Secretary through various agencies of the Public Health Service. The Secretary will ensure a study monitoring HIV progression in women with a minimum of 2,500 participants over 5 years. The study will focus on markers of disease progression and viral activity to understand their impact on serious illnesses in women. The study will address gynecological and other conditions specific to women not currently included in the CDC's list of conditions from HIV infection. The term 'human immunodeficiency virus' refers to the agent causing AIDS. Authorization of appropriations is provided for clinical research purposes. For fiscal years 1997 through 1999, appropriations are authorized for subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) totaling $20,000,000, $10,000,000, $10,000,000, and unspecified amounts respectively. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 include $15,000,000 for (c)(4) and $10,000,000 each for prevention programs under subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2). Additional sums may be necessary for each fiscal year. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 include $6,000,000 for an interagency study in addition to other authorizations. Additional funds may be needed for each fiscal year."
