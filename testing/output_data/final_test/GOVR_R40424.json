    "content": "The Senate biennial committee funding process applies to all Senate committees except Appropriations and Ethics, which have permanent authorizations for their staff and operating expenses. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration oversees committee funding resolutions and regulations. Funding for Senate committees is governed by Senate rules and statutes, with resolutions for expenses typically reported at the start of a new Congress. The Senate adopts a two-year funding resolution for committee expenses, divided into three fiscal periods. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration oversees this process, with resolutions reported at the start of each Congress. On February 28, 2017, S.Res. 62 was adopted authorizing expenditures for specific periods. Table 1 shows funding levels for committees in the 115th Congress, while Tables 2-10 display funding requests and authorizations for Senate committees in the 106th-114th Congresses. Tables 11-19 present the same data adjusted for inflation to January 2017 dollars."
