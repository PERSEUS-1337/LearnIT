    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Thorium Energy Security Act of 2010\". Congress acknowledges the increasing global demand for energy and recognizes nuclear power as a low greenhouse gas emission option. However, concerns about weapons-useable material and spent fuel disposal have hindered the growth of nuclear power. Advanced thorium fuel cycle in nuclear power plants could address these issues by not producing weapons-useable material in spent fuel and generating less long-term waste. The United States has significant thorium deposits and continues to research thorium fuel cycle technology. It is in the national interest to provide foreign countries access to advanced thorium fuel cycle technology to reduce nuclear proliferation risks. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation risks by providing foreign countries access to advanced thorium fuel cycle technology and a secure domestic supply of thorium. SEC. 251 introduces thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, aiming to enhance nuclear technology and ensure a stable thorium supply. The Secretary, in consultation with the Chairman, will establish an office for regulating thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation within the Commission and an office for thorium-based fuel cycle research within the Department of Energy. Regulations regarding fuel must be finalized by December 31, 2011. The Chairman, in consultation with industry and nonindustry experts, will establish standards for thorium-based nuclear fuel manufacture, testing, use, and management. By December 31, 2012, regulations for facilities and materials used in thorium-based power generation will be promulgated. The Secretary, in collaboration with industry and nonindustry experts, will conduct demonstration projects for thorium-based nuclear power generation, consulting with various stakeholders in the process. The curr_chunk discusses the collaboration between reactor designers, utilities, engineering, and manufacturing firms to determine the optimum use of thorium in different reactor types, prioritize thorium-based fuel cycle options, license the manufacture of thorium-based fuels, qualify and license thorium-based fuel for use in commercial reactors, and develop databases necessary for safe licensing and use of advanced fuels. International partnerships and incentives are also mentioned. The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on strengthening international partnerships for nuclear nonproliferation using thorium fuel cycle nuclear power generation and providing incentives for using proliferation-resistant thorium fuels. Additionally, the Secretary must submit an annual report on the progress and activities related to implementing this section. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to authorize $250,000,000 for the Secretary to carry out nuclear nonproliferation efforts. The amendment also changes the reference from the Atomic Energy Commission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."
