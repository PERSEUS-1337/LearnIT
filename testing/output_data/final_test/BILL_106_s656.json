    "content": "The Act may be referred to as the \"Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1999\". It involves the adjustment of status. The Attorney General can adjust the status of eligible aliens to that of a lawful permanent resident if they apply before April 1, 2001, and meet other criteria, excluding certain grounds for inadmissibility. The Nationality Act does not apply to certain aliens seeking adjustment of status. An alien is ineligible if convicted of an aggravated felony or two crimes involving moral turpitude. Despite certain orders, aliens in the US can still apply for adjustment of status. Aliens in the US can apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions, regardless of previous orders. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. This provision applies to aliens who are nationals of Liberia and have been continuously present in the US. Aliens in the US can apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions, regardless of previous orders. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains effective. This provision applies to aliens who are nationals of Liberia and have been continuously present in the US from January 1, 1999, through the date of application. An alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence by reasons of an absence totaling not more than 180 days. The Attorney General shall provide regulations for aliens subject to a final removal order. Regulation allows aliens with a final deportation order to seek a stay by applying for adjustment of status. The Attorney General cannot order removal if an alien is in proceedings and has applied for adjustment, unless the application is denied. Aliens applying for adjustment may be authorized to work in the US. Upon approval of an alien's application for adjustment of status under subsection (a), the Attorney General shall establish a record of the alien's admission for permanent record as of the date of the alien's arrival in the United States. The Attorney General shall provide applicants with the same right to administrative review as provided to others. The Attorney General provides aliens with the same administrative review rights as applicants for adjustment of status or aliens in removal proceedings. The Attorney General's determination on status adjustment is final and not subject to court review. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this section, without affecting the Attorney General's powers. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent an alien from seeking it under other laws."
