    "content": "Pakistan is a key ally in the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition, with ongoing cooperation praised by top U.S. officials. However, strain in the bilateral relationship has emerged due to U.S. frustration with Islamic militants along the Afghan-Pakistani border, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to anti-terrorism policies, anti-American sentiment, nuclear proliferation concerns, and perceived anti-democratic practices in Islamabad. The text discusses U.S. frustration with Islamabad, growing anti-American sentiment in Pakistani society, difficulties in pursuing U.S. policies in conservative Muslim regions, and conspiracy theories regarding the September 11 attacks. After the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. improved its relationship with Pakistan by lifting sanctions and passing laws to exempt Pakistan from certain sanctions related to democracy and debt-arrearage. There were concerns about increased Islamization in Pakistan and potential backlash from U.S. military action in Iraq fueling Islamic radicalism. Anti-U.S./anti-war marches organized by Islamist political parties in Pakistan in March 2003 involved up to 250,000 demonstrators. The U.S. lifted sanctions on Pakistan related to democracy and debt-arrearage for FY2002 and granted the President authority to waive sanctions through FY2003. Presidential Determination 2003-16 waived sanctions for FY2003. Bills introduced in the 107th Congress regarding Pakistan included reducing duties on Pakistani textiles, repealing the President's authority to waive sanctions, and requiring certification of Pakistan's efforts to halt cross-border terrorism and conduct fair elections. During the final months of 2002, concerns were raised about Pakistani assistance to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, leading to calls for reinstating aid restrictions. In February 2003, there were requests to ban military sales to Pakistan and impose sanctions under the Foreign Assistance Act. However, in March 2003, the Bush Administration decided not to impose sanctions. Members of the 108th Congress may face more issues related to proliferation and democracy aid with Pakistan. Members of the 108th Congress may face proliferation- and democracy-related aid issues with Pakistan, including concerns about nuclear technology transfers and democratic governance. U.S. assistance to Pakistan increased significantly after September 2001, with authorization for economic support funds to cancel concessional debt. The Bush Administration is requesting bilateral assistance for FY2003 and FY2004. Pakistan's interest in purchasing U.S.-made weapons and trade-related legislation, especially in textile duties, are areas of congressional interest. After the September 2001 terror attacks, Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf ended support for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and joined the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. This policy reversal was made without full support from Pakistan's Islamic citizens or military and intelligence organizations. Islamabad subsequently requested assistance from the United States. Pakistan requested military equipment and aid from the United States to assist in the anti-terror campaign and maintain balance with India. However, negative political reactions in Pakistan are fueling anti-government and anti-American sentiment, which could jeopardize U.S. interests in the region. The U.S. conducted military operations in Pakistan's border regions, complicating counterterror efforts due to Al Qaeda fighters fleeing into Pakistan. In April 2002, U.S. counterterror operations in Pakistan face challenges due to alleged support from elements of Pakistan's ISI to Taliban, Al Qaeda, and local terrorist groups. Concerns arise over Pakistani Islamist parties influencing foreign policy and the government's manipulation of elections to stay in power. Despite being labeled a \"crucial ally\" by President Bush and Secretary of State Powell, there are doubts about the transparency of Pakistan's 2002 national elections. Some Members of Congress seek aid restrictions in Pakistan until a civilian-led government is in place. Islamist political groups gaining power may not align with U.S. interests, leading to potential anti-American sentiment and reduced cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Islamist members warn U.S. forces to stay out of border areas with Afghanistan. The provincial government in a border region with Afghanistan dropped criminal charges against Pakistani citizens involved in anti-U.S. demonstrations. U.S. officials urged Pakistan to exclude Islamists from the ruling coalition, prevent Islamist interference in anti-terror operations, and maintain cooperation in the anti-terror campaign. The report reviews Pakistan-U.S. anti-terrorism cooperation in law enforcement, intelligence, and military operations, as well as arms transfers and security cooperation. It discusses domestic repercussions, perceptions by Pakistan Islamists, and potential effects on future cooperation. Pakistan has shown inconsistency in controlling Islamic militants, with outlawed groups in Kashmir and Pakistani cities. Pakistan has been criticized for tolerating and supporting terrorist groups within its territory, including providing material support to designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The country's ties to hardline Islamists are rooted in ethnic Pashtun connections that extend across the Afghan-Pakistani border. Islamic religious schools in Pakistan have been accused of promoting extremism and anti-American sentiments among their students. President Musharraf's shift away from Islamic extremism began with cutting ties to the Taliban in 2001. He vowed to end Pakistan's support for terrorism, criticized religious extremism, and banned militant groups. Sweeping reforms were implemented, including arrests of 3,300 extremists, although many were later released. In late-2002, intelligence analysts believed Al Qaeda had established a new base in Karachi, Pakistan. President Musharraf suggested Osama bin Laden may be in Pakistan in early-2003. U.S. law enforcement agencies began actively assisting Pakistan in hunting terrorists and their allies from early 2002 onwards. The U.S. has provided assistance to Pakistan in hunting terrorists, with a reported number of U.S. counterterrorism agents in Pakistan. While U.S. officials claim limited involvement in field operations, Pakistani officials have indicated F.B.I. agents participated in raids. However, Pakistan denies the existence of independent F.B.I. offices in the country and claims F.B.I. operatives are not involved in hunting Al Qaeda supporters. Director of Central Intelligence Tenet visited Pakistan post-September 2001, and the Islamabad government is cooperating with the C.I.A. in the hunt for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar. The U.S. is cooperating with Pakistan in the hunt for top-level Islamic militant fugitives, raising concerns about human rights abuses. The use of \"stress and duress\" techniques by the C.I.A. for interrogations has sparked allegations of torture. The murder of Daniel Pearl has led to an increased focus on law enforcement in Pakistan. Human Rights Watch has called for an investigation into possible torture by U.S. officials. The intensified U.S. focus on law enforcement in Pakistan and efforts to assist local security forces in tracking and capturing Islamic militants, believed to have links to Al Qaeda. U.S. officials suspect Al Qaeda involvement in deadly car bombings in 2002, leading to the formation of the U.S.-Pakistan Joint Working Group on Counterterrorism and Law Enforcement. The two governments discussed bilateral law enforcement issues including counternarcotics, counterterrorism, extradition, money laundering, and trafficking in persons. They agreed to strengthen cooperation in these areas, with upcoming meetings planned in both Pakistan and Washington. In April 2003, a meeting is scheduled in Washington to discuss Pakistan's efforts in halting terrorist financing. Pakistan has taken action against U.S.-designated entities but lacks sufficient legal and regulatory structures for effective anti-terrorism financing. The U.S. encourages stricter oversight and regulation, offering technical assistance. The United States has provided technical assistance and training to Pakistani customs and finance officials to improve oversight and regulation. Additionally, the US has supplied various instruments to bolster Pakistani security forces, including transport helicopters, radios, and vehicles. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia Rocca announced the provision of sophisticated communication and surveillance equipment worth over $4 million during a visit to Islamabad in December 2002. The United States has provided technical assistance and training to Pakistani customs and finance officials. They have also supplied security forces with equipment worth over $4 million, including transport helicopters, radios, and vehicles. Additionally, the US is helping establish a national fingerprint database and providing road-building projects in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas to improve access for law enforcement and security personnel. The US is also supplying Pakistan with the Personnel Identification Secure Comparison Evaluation System (PISCES) for real-time comparisons with the F.B.I. database. The F.B.I. database is being used for real-time comparisons to track movements of Islamic militants entering or leaving Pakistan at major transit points. American agents provide intelligence for operations, including intercepting satellite phone transmissions and monitoring internet traffic for terrorist communications. Former Pakistani army officers have been trained by the F.B.I. in these operations. The \"Spider Group,\" an intelligence-gathering unit led by former Pakistani army officers, monitors Pakistani Islamist groups. U.S. law enforcement has played key roles in capturing Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad, aiding in Daniel Pearl's case, and conducting raids in Faisalabad and Lahore to apprehend suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban members. In Faisalabad and Lahore, raids captured suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban fugitives, banned extremist members, \"Arab mujahideen,\" and Harakat-ul-Mujahideen militants with explosives. Key figures like Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Sharib Ahmad were apprehended, along with Algerian nationals linked to Al Qaeda. In October, raids in Pakistan led to the capture of suspected Al Qaeda operatives and militants connected to terror attacks on Pakistani Christians. A physician who treated Osama bin Laden was interrogated by FBI agents. In December, two tribesmen were handed over to U.S. agents for their alleged involvement in an attack on a U.S. military camp. Later that month, a joint raid by Pakistani police and FBI agents captured 9 suspected Al Qaeda operatives, including two American citizens. In January 2003, Pakistani police and F.B.I. agents arrested three suspected Al Qaeda operatives in Karachi, recovering computers, grenades, and $30,000 in U.S. currency. Among the nine suspects arrested in December was a Pakistani doctor named Ahmed Khawaja, charged with providing material assistance to Al Qaeda figures. On March 1, Khalid Mohammed, alleged mastermind of the September 2001 terrorist attacks, was arrested in Rawalpindi along with two cohorts. U.S. communications specialists played a key role in locating the suspects and valuable data on Al Qaeda's operations was seized. Additionally, 10 Al Qaeda suspects were arrested in Peshawar a week later. In March, Al Qaeda suspects were arrested in Peshawar and Lahore, including a financier and communications operative. Khalid Mohammed's arrest fueled speculation of Osama bin Laden's imminent capture. The White House praised Pakistani and U.S. authorities for their efforts in combating terrorism. Rumors circulated about ISI's prior knowledge of Mohammed's whereabouts. Pakistan's intelligence agency claimed to have captured foreign nationals suspected of terrorist activities and remanded many to U.S. custody since September 2001. Pakistan has been a vital basing and transit point for Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, providing permission for U.S. and coalition forces. U.S. military operations in the region have heavily relied on Pakistani territory for over 57,000 military sorties. Pakistan has been a crucial operational base for U.S. military operations, with extensive radar facilities installed at Pakistani airfields. Over 115,000 troops were deployed along the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan and Iran to support efforts against Taliban and Al Qaeda. Around 45,000 Pakistani troops actively supported Operation Enduring Freedom in October 2002, with U.S. special operations soldiers and C.I.A. agents participating in operations on Pakistani territory. The presence of U.S. military personnel in Pakistan is a sensitive subject, with reports of joint operations with Pakistani units. There are concerns about over 3,500 Al Qaeda operatives crossing into Pakistan and the potential establishment of a permanent presence in Pakistani cities. An assessment estimated up to 1,000 Al Qaeda fighters in the country. In August, a U.S. military assessment estimated up to 1,000 Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, prompting discussions about expanding U.S. military operations into neighboring countries. Pakistani officials rejected any U.S. troop presence on their territory, citing ongoing security operations. Despite ongoing U.S. military operations in Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, there have been no confirmed reports of large-scale American troop movements or aerial sorties in Pakistani territory. In Pakistan, government officials have given conflicting statements about the presence of Al Qaeda in the country. While some claim to have weakened the group, others admit that members are still hiding, with up to 5,000 fighters in the North West Frontier Province. Reports suggest that Al Qaeda and Taliban forces have regrouped near the Afghan border for potential attacks against coalition units. The Pakistani government sought compensation for joining the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition, including economic aid, debt forgiveness, and access to U.S. weaponry. The transfer of U.S. military equipment to Pakistan was halted in 1990 due to concerns about their nuclear weapons program. Economic sanctions were imposed on Pakistan after their nuclear tests in 1998 and military coup in 1999. President George W. Bush waived sanctions on Pakistan in October 2001, following their nuclear tests and military coup. Pakistan requested various weapons from the U.S., aiming for a relationship similar to Egypt's in terms of arms sales. Pakistani Foreign Minister Kasuri urged the U.S. to reduce the conventional weapons gap with India to prevent a nuclear arms race in South Asia. Islamabad reportedly secured deals for purchasing military equipment. Pakistan has secured deals for major U.S. weapons platforms, including F-16s, P-3 aircraft, and Harpoon missiles. The Bush Administration has notified Congress of pending transfers for C-130E transport aircraft and Aerostats. These arms sales aim to support Pakistan's military capabilities for counterterror operations and air force enhancement. Pakistan has received spare parts and weaponry for its F-16A fighters, many of which are grounded due to maintenance issues. The country's arsenal includes Chinese and U.S.-made weapons systems like P-3 Orion, C-130 Hercules aircraft, Harpoon missiles, and 155mm howitzers. The Pakistan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Group (DCG) met in 2002 for the first time since 1997 to discuss military cooperation, security assistance, and anti-terrorism efforts. In October 2002, the first joint U.S.-Pakistan military exercises in nearly five years took place with around 120 soldiers from each country participating. The exercises aimed to increase interoperability in weapon systems and tactics. U.S. assistance to Pakistan under security-related programs included significant funding in FY2002, FY2003, and a request for FY2004. Pakistan, as a rotating member of the UN Security Council, faced a dilemma in its security environment. In early-2003, Pakistan, as a member of the UN Security Council, grappled with the dilemma of supporting the U.S.-led war on Iraq despite domestic opposition. Despite expectations of abstention on UNSC Res. 1442, Pakistan never voted, and instead criticized the war as \"unjustified.\" A fragile ruling coalition led by President Musharraf was formed in November 2002, with day-to-day governance handed over to civilian politicians. The new civilian government in Islamabad has taken over day-to-day governance from President Musharraf. The National Assembly and Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali's influence will impact Pakistan-U.S. security relations and counterterrorism efforts. The government pledges to continue anti-terrorism policies, despite significant economic losses. President Musharraf's cooperation with U.S.-led efforts places him in a delicate position. The February 2003 report highlights Musharraf's survival of multiple assassination attempts in 2002 and the risk of a coup by senior-ranking military officials. This could potentially lead to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of Islamic extremists. Street demonstrations and opposition calls for Musharraf to resign as Army Chief have made the Pakistani government uneasy. The escalation of U.S. military involvement in anti-terrorism operations in western Pakistan is causing political unrest in the country. The presence of American law enforcement agents in Pakistani cities is also fueling anti-government and anti-American sentiments. The Islamabad government is trying to address this negative political response. The Islamabad government is facing backlash over American presence in Pakistan, with concerns about sovereignty raised by leaders of Islamist parties. There are complaints about F.B.I. operations being seen as violations of the Pakistani constitution. Pakistanis view ballistic missile tests as a message of hawkishness towards India and a display of foreign policy independence from the United States. The F.B.I. operations in Pakistan are seen as violations of the constitution, leading to calls for jihad against America. Islamist leaders demand fingerprinting and AIDS testing for Americans in Pakistan. Police forces are instructed to only follow provincial government orders, not those from U.S. agencies. The Pakistani government criticizes U.S. policy of fingerprinting Pakistani men entering the United States as discriminatory. Pakistani men in the United States are protesting against immigration restrictions, with the Pakistani government requesting removal from the list. The issue reflects a perception of double standards in U.S.-Pakistan relations, causing concerns about destabilization and radicalization in Pakistan. Secretary of State Powell reassured that the registration program is not targeting Pakistan or Muslims. The 2002 national elections in Pakistan saw a strong showing for the United Action Forum, an anti-American Islamic coalition winning 68 seats. This raised concerns about a potential shift in Pakistan's foreign policy towards Talibanization in border regions. The 2002 national elections in Pakistan saw the United Action Forum, an anti-American Islamic coalition, winning parliamentary seats in major cities. Leading Islamist politicians made provocative comments, threatening government action against perceived U.S. support for President Musharraf's practices. The MMA leaders expressed solidarity with Taliban and Al Qaeda members, criticizing U.S. actions and labeling America as a terrorist state. In January 2003, leaders of the MMA coalition in Pakistan expressed strong anti-American sentiments, with calls to break America into pieces like Russia and erase it from the world. The Urdu-language press in Pakistan also highlighted alleged Christian-Jewish attacks on Islam and criticized Pakistan's Western-allied leadership. Additionally, there were efforts to \"re-Talibanize\" Pashtun-majority areas near the Afghan-Pakistani border. In 2003, MMA lawmakers in the NWFPhave pledged to accelerate Islamization in the region, requesting authority to impose harsh Sharia penalties like amputations and stoning. They have also restricted women's freedoms, seized and burned \"pornographic\" materials, and shut down carnivals and theaters. Pakistani government officials have stated that foreign policy will remain unchanged despite the MMA's strong showing in the 2002 elections. The middle-class in Pakistan is politically active, with moderate figures aiming for a middle ground between secular military rule and Islamic governance. Despite efforts for moderation rooted in Jinnah's ideas, militarist influences and corruption among politicians have led to political polarization. U.S.-Pakistan relations were described as \"significantly broadened\" and \"solid\" in 2003, with strong anti-terrorism cooperation and the apprehension of suspected Al Qaeda operatives. In early 2003, there were growing concerns in the U.S. about Pakistani cooperation in anti-terrorism efforts, with doubts raised by top military and congressional leaders. Specific issues included Islamist militant infiltration into Indian Kashmir, the presence of wanted terrorists in Pakistan, and the commitment of Pakistan's government to anti-terrorism policies. U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell criticized Pakistan for being a \"platform for terrorism,\" calling for a halt to such activities. The amount of infiltration of Islamic militants into Indian Kashmir from Pakistan is increasing, with concerns raised by U.S. military commanders about the slow progress in capturing wanted fugitives, including Taliban leaders. U.S. Special Envoy Khalilzad stated that key Taliban figures and Al Qaeda members are finding refuge in Pakistan, urging Pakistan to do more to secure its western border. In late-2002 and early-2003, concerns were raised about Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency possibly aiding Taliban and Al Qaeda members along the border with Afghanistan. Reports suggested Pakistan provided nuclear weapons-related technologies to North Korea and possibly Iran, which Islamabad denies. Musharraf assured Secretary of State Powell that no transfers to North Korea occurred. In March 2003, the Bush Administration reviewed possible nuclear technology transfers from Pakistan to North Korea, deciding against sanctions. Congressional oversight expressed concerns about links between Al Qaeda and Pakistan, support for Kashmiri terrorists, and assistance to Al Qaeda and Taliban fugitives by lower-level ISI operatives. The ISI may be assisting Al Qaeda and Taliban fugitives, involved in regional heroin trafficking, and possibly engaged in nuclear weapons proliferation activities. Concerns also exist about the role of madrassas in promoting Islamic radicalism in Pakistan and issues with Pakistani democratization. Despite broad anti-terrorism cooperation between Pakistan and the U.S. since October 2001, various U.S. concerns could undermine this partnership. Indications of suboptimal Pakistani commitment and tensions with India could lead to restrictions on U.S. aid. The Islamabad government may face pressure to align with opposition parties, potentially eroding anti-terrorism cooperation. Domestic unrest in Pakistan may further disrupt cooperation in the long term."
