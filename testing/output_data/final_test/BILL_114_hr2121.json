    "content": "The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to include a new section on the employment transition of loan originators. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to allow loan originators moving from depository to non-depository institutions temporary authority to originate loans in an application State under certain conditions. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 allows loan originators to temporarily originate loans in an application State if they meet certain conditions, including not having a felony conviction that would prevent licensure, submitting an application to be a State-licensed loan originator, and being registered in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry as a loan originator in the preceding 12 months. State-licensed loan originators can temporarily act as loan originators in an application State under certain conditions, including submitting an application and being listed on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. State-licensed loan originators can act in an application State if they meet specific requirements, including being employed by a State-licensed mortgage company in that State and being licensed in a different State within the 30-day period before submitting the required information. State-licensed loan originators must end their connection with the application in the application State under specific conditions, such as withdrawal of the application, denial by the application State, granting of a State license, or after 120 days if the application is incomplete on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. Any person employing an individual with temporary authority to act as a loan originator in an application State must comply with federal and state laws as if the individual was a State-licensed loan originator. Individuals with temporary authority engaging in mortgage loan origination activities are also subject to the same requirements. In this section, definitions for \"State-licensed mortgage company\" and \"Application state\" are provided. The table of contents in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 is also amended to include these definitions. The S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 is amended to specify the use of the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry for licensing or registration. The Act and its amendments will take effect 18 months after enactment."
