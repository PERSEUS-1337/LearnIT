    "content": "Congressional interest in small business access to capital has increased due to concerns about their ability to access sufficient funding for operations and job creation. Small businesses have been crucial for job growth in past economic recoveries, especially in sectors like construction, housing, and retail. After the 1990-1991 recession, small businesses increased employment while larger businesses continued to decline. During the 2007-2009 recession, small businesses accounted for nearly 60% of job losses but later contributed to about 63% of new jobs through FY2012. Since FY2012, small businesses have added around 65% of net new jobs, prompting calls for federal assistance. Advocates suggest business tax cuts, financial credit market reform, and fiscal restraint to support small businesses and job creation. Laws enacted during the 111th Congress aimed to improve small business access to capital, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 providing the Small Business Administration with additional funding. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized funding for small business lending programs, including a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund and a $1.5 billion State Small Business Credit Initiative. It also made changes to the SBA's loan guaranty and contracting programs, extended fee subsidies, and increased the maximum loan guaranty percentage to 90% for all regular 7(a) loans. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 authorized funding for small business lending programs, including the Small Business Lending Fund and State Small Business Credit Initiative. The SBA continued fee subsidies and a 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage for the 7(a) program until funding was exhausted. The SBLF aimed to enhance small business loan supply, with advocates highlighting its importance in this effort. The report examines arguments for and against the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) program. Advocates believed it would boost lending to small businesses and create jobs, while opponents raised concerns about potential financial losses, lack of oversight, and possible misuse by TARP recipients. The implementation of the SBLF by the Department of the Treasury and proposed amendments to the program in recent Congresses are also discussed. The Small Business Lending Fund program was subject to various proposed amendments during the 113th Congress. These included limitations on the program's authority, restrictions on TARP recipients' participation, and extensions of the Department of the Treasury's investment authority. Additionally, there were proposals to transfer unobligated funds to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to support small businesses. H.R. 2474, the Community Lending and Small Business Jobs Act of 2013, aimed to transfer unobligated and repaid funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The Federal Reserve Board surveys senior loan officers quarterly on small business lending practices, including questions on credit standards for small business loans. The Federal Reserve Board surveys senior loan officers quarterly on small business lending practices, including questions on credit standards for small business loans. Senior loan officers reported tightening small business loan credit standards from 2007 through late 2009, with some improvement since then. Demand for small business loans is also monitored, with questions on changes in demand over the past three months for small firms. The Federal Reserve Board surveys senior loan officers quarterly on small business lending practices, including credit standards and demand for small business loans. Demand for small business loans declined in 2007 and 2008, significantly in 2009, leveled off in 2010, increased in the first half of 2011, declined in the latter half of 2011, generally increased from 2012 through 2015, and has varied since then. FDIC maintains comparable small business lending data. The FDIC has tracked small business lending data since 2002, showing an increase in outstanding loans from 2006 to 2008, a decline in the following years, and a steady increase since 2013. Changes in small business debt can indicate challenges in accessing capital for job growth. The decline in small business lending from 2007 to 2010 was influenced by factors such as the 30% decline in home prices, making collateral less valuable for borrowers who relied on home equity loans. Renewing existing lines of credit became difficult as lenders grew cautious due to slow economic growth and increased risk of loan defaults, particularly among small business start-ups. The authors argued that in the newly regulated market, smaller lenders are likely to be less profitable due to higher auditing and FDIC costs, resulting in less money to lend to small businesses. The difficulty in assessing creditworthiness in small business lending, driven by factor rather than relationship lending, may lead to a slower recovery in the small business loan market compared to other financial markets. FDIC data showed a decline in small business lending both in absolute terms and market share over the eight years from 2003. Small business loans declined in market share from 81.7% in 2003 to 68.9% in 2010. The ratio of small business loans to total assets also decreased from 16.8% in 2005 to 15.3% in 2010. This trend indicates a diminishing significance of small business lending for lenders. During the recession, small business loans fell as owners saved capital due to declining sales and uncertainty about future demand. NFIB surveys showed poor sales as the main concern for small business owners from 2008 to 2011. Small businesses identified poor sales as their top problem, a shift from taxes being the main concern before 2008. Employment data indicated that small businesses were severely impacted by the recession, with construction and real estate sectors hit the hardest. Testimony highlighted that small businesses suffered due to their concentration in these hard-hit sectors. During the recession, small businesses, especially in the real estate sector, were severely impacted, with job losses almost twice as high as in larger firms. Legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to boost small business loans, providing over $1.1 billion to subsidize fees and increase loan guarantees to stimulate borrowing. The 90% loan guarantee aimed to increase small business loans by reducing borrowing costs. Congress allocated additional resources to the SBA, including a $255 million temporary small business stabilization program and funding for the surety bond and Microloan programs. During the 111th Congress, funds were increased for the SBA's Microloan program and technical assistance program. The leverage available to SBA-licensed SBICs was also raised. Additionally, the ARRA authorized the SBA to establish a temporary secondary market guarantee authority and make below-market interest rate direct loans to SISM Broker-Dealers for purchasing SBA-guaranteed loans. P.L. 111-240 extended the SBA's secondary market guarantee authority and increased loan guarantee limits for the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC programs. It also raised the Microloan program's loan limit and temporarily increased leverage for SBA-licensed SBICs. The SBLF was established to provide capital investments in eligible institutions to increase credit availability for small businesses. P.L. 111-240 also increased loan limits for the SBA's 7(a) Express Program and authorized funding for the State Small Business Credit Initiative. The SBLF was established to provide capital investments in eligible institutions with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion as of the end of 2009. Eligible institutions could apply for a capital investment not exceeding 5% of risk-weighted assets. During the fourth quarter of 2009, eligible lending institutions with assets of $1 billion to $10 billion could apply for a capital investment not exceeding 3% of risk-weighted assets, as per FDIC regulations. Cash, government bonds, and residential mortgage loans have specific risk-weightings, while institutions on the FDIC problem bank list are ineligible to participate. A lending institution can refinance securities issued through the Treasury Capital Purchase Program (CPP) and the Community Development Capital Incentive (CDCI) program under TARP, but only if that institution had not missed more than one dividend payment due under those programs. Participating banks are charged a dividend rate of no more than 5% per annum initially, with reduced rates available if the bank increases its small business lending. Dividend rates are lowered if small business lending increases compared to previous quarters. Table 1 and Table 2 display dividend rates for small business lending increases by C corporation banks, savings associations, S corporation banks, and mutual lending institutions. S corporation rates are slightly higher to account for after-tax effective rates. S corporations pass business income or loss to shareholders for personal income tax reporting. Community Development Financial Institutions receive funding for eight years with a possible two-year extension. The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) offers funding for eight years with a possible two-year extension. Dividend rates start at 2% per annum for the first eight years and increase to 9% thereafter. Applicants must submit a small business lending plan outlining their strategy and goals to support small businesses. The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) requires consultation with federal banking agencies before participation. All funds received by the Treasury from SBLF purchases go towards reducing public debt. Advocates believe SBLF will boost lending to small businesses and create jobs. The House report accompanying H.R. 5297 argued that the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was necessary to enhance small businesses' access to capital amid a decrease in bank lending. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) reported a significant decline in commercial and industrial loans, making it harder for small businesses to secure new loans. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner supported the SBLF to help small businesses create jobs and aid in economic recovery. The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) aims to help small businesses access capital as banks tighten lending terms. Some banks are scaling back lending, even to creditworthy borrowers, due to capital level requirements. The House Committee on Financial Services' minority members argue that the SBLF does not effectively address the lack of financing for small businesses by injecting capital into banks without guarantees of increased lending. The bill allows qualifying banks to receive government capital infusion without requiring increased lending for two years. If banks do not increase lending to small businesses during this period, there are no penalties. Some representatives proposed extending small business tax credits before implementing the Small Business Lending Fund, arguing that the program may not be fully operational for months and banks may avoid it due to its association with TARP. The bill did not provide sufficient oversight for effectively monitoring the program, as argued during House floor debate. Representative Melissa Bean advocated for the bill's passage, stating that the Small Business Lending Fund builds on previous financial stabilization measures by establishing a new $30 billion fund to provide capital to community banks for increased lending to small businesses. The $30 billion investment by the Federal Government aims to provide capital to community banks for increased lending to small businesses. Banks can leverage this investment into over $300 billion in new small business loans. The terms of the capital provided are performance-based, with lower dividend rates for banks that increase small business lending and higher rates for those that decrease it. Strong safeguards are in place to ensure funds are used for small business lending and oversight will be consistent throughout the program. The $30 billion investment by the Federal Government aims to provide capital to community banks for increased lending to small businesses. Oversight will be consistent throughout the program, with funds going directly to small businesses and their communities. Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez ensured safeguards were in place to target funds at small businesses. Repayment to Treasury is required over the next 10 years. Banks must apply to the Treasury for funds to increase small business lending, with a repayment plan starting at 5% dividend rate. The rate can decrease to 1% if lending increases by 10% or more, but will increase to 7% if lending does not increase within 2 years. All banks must repay funds within 5 years at a 9% dividend rate. The Small Business Lending Fund bill proposes a 9% dividend rate for banks after 4 1/2 years, aiming to save taxpayers $1 billion over 10 years. Representative Neugebauer opposes the bill, comparing it to TARP without strong oversight, injecting $30 billion into banks to boost small business lending. The Small Business Lending Fund bill, an extension of TARP's Capital Purchase Program, raises concerns about its effectiveness in improving credit access. The bill allows for an additional $33 billion in spending, with the bank lending portion estimated to cost taxpayers $3.4 billion. The House passed H.R. 5297 by a vote of 241-182 on June 17, 2010, with arguments for and against the bill centered around its potential impact on small business lending. Advocates supported the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) bill, arguing it would boost small business lending and jobs. Senator Mary Landrieu emphasized it as a public-private partnership strategy, not a government program, with endorsements from banks and small business associations. The program, costing $1 billion according to the CBO, aims to create jobs and stimulate the economy without creating new bureaucracy or imposing restrictions. The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) aims to boost small business lending and create jobs. It is a public-private partnership strategy, not a government program, working with banks to lend money to small businesses in need. Opponents raised concerns about potential financial losses, oversight, and impact on TARP recipients. Senator Olympia Snowe opposed further consideration of the bill due to concerns about the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) potentially costing $6.2 billion according to an alternative methodology. She also highlighted similarities between SBLF and TARP, questioning the effectiveness of bank-focused capital infusion programs in increasing lending. Snowe expressed frustration over the lack of agreement on allowing minority amendments. Senator Snowe opposed the bill due to concerns about the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) potentially costing $6.2 billion and questioned the effectiveness of bank-focused capital infusion programs in increasing lending. She expressed frustration over the lack of agreement on allowing minority amendments. Opponents also criticized the SBLF's incentives and use of quarterly call report data to determine small business loans. The Senate's version of H.R. 5297 was agreed to on September 16, 2010, by a vote of 68-38. The Senate's version of H.R. 5297, renamed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, was signed into law by President Obama on September 27, 2010. The implementation of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) faced delays and criticism for not proceeding as expected, with the first financing occurring nine months after enactment. The implementation of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) faced delays, with the first financing occurring nine months after enactment on June 21, 2011. The delay was due to finalizing investment decisions and creating separate regulations for different types of financial institutions. C corporations are legal entities with shareholders, directors, and officers, while Subchapter S corporations can pass income to shareholders. S corporations allow income and losses to flow through to shareholders for tax purposes, avoiding double taxation. Mutual lending institutions are owned by depositors or policyholders, while CDFIs provide financial services to underserved communities. Separate regulations were established for different financial institutions regarding the SBLF's financings counting as Tier 1 capital. The SBLF's financings can be classified as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital for banks to maintain a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8%. S corporations are limited to having only a single class of stock under IRS rules. Treasury had to consider purchasing subordinated debt from S corporations and mutual lending institutions as they cannot issue preferred stock. For C corporations, SBLF funds are treated as Tier I capital, and Treasury purchases senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock. The SBLF program allows Treasury to purchase senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock from C corporation banks, while S corporations and mutual lending institutions receive unsecured subordinated debentures. Tier 1 capital is a key measure of financial strength for banks, with different deadlines for different types of institutions to apply for funding. A total of 926 institutions applied for $11.8 billion in SBLF funding. Treasury approved over $4.0 billion in SBLF financing to 332 lending institutions, with $3.9 billion going to 281 community banks and $104 million to 51 CDFIs. The average financing amount was $12.1 million, ranging from $42,000 to $141.0 million. 137 of the institutions that received financing had previously participated in TARP programs, receiving nearly $2.7 billion in SBLF funding. Treasury is required to publish monthly reports on SBLF transactions and a semiannual report detailing projected costs, liabilities, and expenses. The SBLF program requires participating institutions to submit quarterly reports on their use of funds received. An initial supplemental report must be submitted to Treasury before closing, providing information from FDIC call reports to establish a baseline for measuring progress in small business lending. The baseline is derived from the average outstanding amount of qualified small business lending for the four quarters ending on June 30, 2010. The SBLF program requires institutions to report on their lending activities, including commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, agricultural loans, and loans secured by farmland. Large loans and loans to big businesses are excluded, and charge-offs are adjusted. The baseline for small business lending is established using data from FDIC call reports. The SBLF program adjusts for gains in small business lending from mergers, acquisitions, and loan purchases to ensure dividend rate reductions correspond to new lending. The cumulative baseline decreases as participants repay loans. Initial baseline was $35.52 billion for 332 participants in 2011, reduced to $1.5 billion for 50 participants in 2018. The number of SBLF participating institutions is declining as institutions repay their loans and exit the program. This decline has accelerated since 2016 due to increased dividend rates for banks and savings associations. SBLF institutions are required to submit quarterly reports to determine their dividend rate. Treasury announced in its April 2019 quarterly report that current SBLF participants increased small business lending by $1.347 billion over a $1.523 billion baseline as of December 31, 2018. Total small business lending reported by current and former participants has surpassed $19.1 billion over the baseline. Most current participants have significantly increased their small business lending, with 86.0% reporting a 10% or more increase. Treasury officials praised the SBLF's performance, with 86.0% of current participants increasing small business lending by 10% or more. Some financial commentators have a less optimistic view of the program's effectiveness. The report of increased small business lending was seen as positive news, but it is difficult to determine how much of the new lending would have happened anyway due to economic improvements. Some commentators suggested that the data may have been skewed by new participants in the small business lending market, making the increases seem more significant than they actually are. Despite reported growth in small business lending over six quarters, some argue that the results are not as impressive as they may appear. It was noted that even if the SBLF ends up being successful, it will be on a smaller scale than expected, and the demand for loans from small businesses has also decreased. The Treasury's Office of Inspector General found that reported small business lending gains linked to SBLF funding were overstated, with a significant portion occurring before participants received funding. This raises concerns about the accuracy of reported gains in relation to the program's impact on small business lending. The Office of Inspector General found that reported small business lending gains linked to SBLF funding were overstated, with concerns about accuracy and impact. The OIG argued that program performance was inflated by measuring against a baseline seven quarters prior to funding, and lending gains couldn't be directly linked to SBLF capital. During the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to change the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF), but none were enacted. Senator Snowe introduced a bill to increase accountability in the fund, aiming to ensure that only healthy banks have access to taxpayer money and that small businesses receive affordable credit. The bill would have required recipients to repay SBLF distributions within 10 years and terminate the program within 15 years. The bill introduced during the 112th Congress aimed to increase accountability in the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). It required recipients to repay SBLF distributions within 10 years and terminate the program within 15 years. Provisions included prohibiting the Secretary of the Treasury from making capital investments if the FDIC is appointed receiver of 5% or more of the institutions receiving an investment, and prohibiting participation by institutions that received an investment under TARP. Additionally, the bill revised the benchmark for measuring changes in small business lending. The Small Business Lending Fund Accountability Act of 2011 aimed to increase oversight over the SBLF. It prevented TARP recipients from using funds from other federal assistance programs and transferred unobligated funds to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The Small Business Lending Extension Act aimed to increase credit availability for small businesses by extending the Treasury's investment authority. The Community Lending and Small Business Jobs Act of 2013 would transfer unobligated funds from the SBLF to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The Small Business Lending Extension Act aimed to increase credit availability for small businesses by extending the Treasury's investment authority. The SBLF was enacted to enhance capital supply to small businesses, with advocates believing it would boost small business lending and job creation. However, concerns were raised about its cost and similarities to TARP. Participating institutions have reported increased small business lending, but questions have been raised about the validity of these reports, with Treasury's OIG noting that a significant portion of reported gains occurred before receiving SBLF funds. The Small Business Lending Extension Act aimed to increase credit availability for small businesses by extending the Treasury's investment authority. Concerns have been raised about the validity of reported small business lending gains, with previous audits showing misreporting by participants. Analyzing the program's impact on small business lending is challenging due to methodological issues and the relatively small amount of financing involved. The Small Business Lending Extension Act aimed to increase credit availability for small businesses by extending the Treasury's investment authority. The SBLF's $4.0 billion in financing represents less than 0.7% of outstanding small business loans. Concerns were raised about the program's potential cost, with initial estimates suggesting up to $1.26 billion in taxpayer costs. Treasury later estimated a savings of $80 million, primarily due to lower-than-expected financing levels. The Small Business Lending Extension Act aimed to increase credit availability for small businesses by extending the Treasury's investment authority. Treasury estimated that the SBLF will generate a lifetime positive return of $31 million for the Treasury General Fund, primarily due to lower-than-expected financing levels and improvements in default rates. One issue raised was the noncumulative treatment of dividends under the program, unlike the TARP programs. The change in dividend treatment under the Small Business Lending Extension Act was driven by the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which aimed to equalize capital requirements for bank holding companies. This required regulators to apply the same capital and risk standards for FDIC-insured banks to bank holding companies. Treasury made dividends under SBLF comply with the Dodd-Frank Act by ensuring securities purchased from holding companies receive the same capital treatment as those purchased from depository institutions. Treasury made dividends under SBLF non-cumulative and addressed issues with missed payments by imposing additional requirements and restrictions on participants. CEO and CFO must provide written notice for not declaring a dividend, no repurchases or dividends for several quarters after missed payments, and issuer's BOD must certify efforts to pay dividends after four missed payments. The Treasury's equity investment policy under the SBLF incentivizes dividend payments, with additional requirements for missed payments. Congressional oversight is focused on the program's long-term costs and effects on small business lending. Recommendations include potential amendments to legislation for repayment of dividends as a requirement for exiting the program. Some advocate for additional federal resources to help small businesses access capital, while others prefer business tax reduction and financial credit market reform to assist small businesses and create jobs. The SBLF's Legislative Origin dates back to President Obama's 2009 proposal to use TARP funds for SBA-guaranteed loans, aiming to boost liquidity in community banks. President Obama proposed the creation of a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) in his January 2010 State of the Union address to enhance access to credit for small businesses. The plan aimed to address the difficulty small business owners faced in obtaining financing, despite banks on Wall Street lending primarily to larger companies. The SBLF was intended to increase the liquidity of community banks and provide support to small businesses across the country. In response to concerns from community lenders about TARP restrictions, the Obama Administration proposed transferring $30 billion to the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to help small businesses. Legislation was introduced in Congress in 2010, with the House Committee on Financial Services passing the bill. The House passed the bill on June 17, 2010, which included a State Small Business Credit Initiative and Small Business Early-Stage Investment Program. The bill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund to provide capital investments in eligible institutions to increase credit availability for small businesses. The Small Business Lending Fund aimed to provide capital investments to eligible financial institutions with total assets of $1 billion or less, allowing them to receive up to 5% of risk-weighted assets. Institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less could receive up to 3% of risk-weighted assets. During the fourth quarter of 2009, 565 FDIC-insured lending institutions with assets of $1 billion to $10 billion reported their risk-weighted assets. FDIC regulations establish different risk-weightings for assets like cash, loans, and investments. Lending institutions on the FDIC problem bank list or recently removed were ineligible for certain programs. Institutions could refinance securities under TARP programs if they met specific criteria. Participating banks under the program would be charged a dividend rate of no more than 5% per annum initially, with reduced rates available based on increased small business lending. Increases in small business lending would result in lower rates: 2.5% to less than 5% increase would lower the rate to 4%, 5% to less than 7.5% increase to 3%, 7.5% to less than 10% increase to 2%, and 10% or greater increase to 1%. Table A-1 shows the dividend rates associated with small business lending. The bill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to adjust dividend rates for S corporations and Community Development Financial Institutions. SBLF applicants were required to submit a small business lending plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. The bill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the Small Business Lending Fund Program (SBLF) to address the needs of small businesses. The program required consultation with federal banking agencies before participation and specified that it was separate from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The bill authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) to make capital investments in eligible community banks with total assets equal to or less than $1 billion or $10 billion. Funds received by the Secretary in connection with SBLF purchases were directed to be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for debt reduction. The Senate-passed version of the bill had differences in SBLF provisions compared to the House-passed version. Eligible institutions included insured depository institutions not controlled by a bank. The bill authorized a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) for eligible community banks with total assets of $1 billion or less. Eligible institutions included insured depository institutions not controlled by a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company with total assets of $10 billion or less. Small business lending companies were not initially eligible in the Senate-passed version of the bill. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 defined small business lending types and excluded certain real estate loans. It also included provisions limiting loan amounts and recipient revenues. The House-passed version did not contain these provisions. The House-passed version of H.R. 5297 included incentives for increased small business lending, with reduced dividend rates tied to loan growth. The Senate-passed version did not have this provision. The House-passed version of H.R. 5297 included an alternative computation provision for small business lending amounts, while the Senate-passed version did not have this provision. Additionally, the House version allowed community development loan funds to apply for a capital investment from the SBLF. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297 specifies eligibility criteria for Community Development Loan Funds to participate in the program and repay the investment. It includes a mandatory list of criteria, unlike the House-passed version which had a temporary amortization authority provision. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 5297, renamed the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240), was agreed to in September 2010 after amendments to assist small businesses, including small business tax reductions."
