    "content": "On May 31, 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced FY2006 allocations of federal homeland security assistance to states and urban areas through three programs: State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP), Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP), and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI). These programs aim to enhance first responder capabilities, prevent terrorist attacks, and respond to catastrophic events. The programs provided funds for planning, operations, equipment, training, and exercise needs to help states and urban areas build and sustain first responder and emergency management capabilities. The USA PATRIOT Act guarantees each state a set amount of funding, with the remaining allocation at the discretion of the Department of Homeland Security. This report explains the administrative guidance from FY2003 to FY2006 for homeland security assistance programs. The DHS grant allocation methods for SHSGP and LETPP have evolved since 2003. Some states and urban areas raised concerns about reductions in grants compared to FY2005. Congress questioned the suitability of the allocation methods and conducted oversight hearings. UASI grants were allocated based on indicators of risk. The DHS allocated discretionary amounts for homeland security assistance programs based on risk assessments and effectiveness of proposed solutions. Administrative guidance is provided through various directives and documents. The DHS provides guidance through various documents such as Planning Tools, National Preparedness Guidance, and Homeland Security Grant Program Guidance. These detail responsibilities to prevent, protect, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks and catastrophic events. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 requires the development of a National Preparedness Goal to improve the nation's capabilities in responding to catastrophes. The National Preparedness Goal aims to establish measurable readiness priorities and targets to respond to terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. It includes readiness metrics, standards for preparedness assessments, and strategies to assess the nation's overall preparedness. DHS has issued multiple versions of draft preparedness goals in accordance with statutory mandates. The National Preparedness Goal aims to enhance capabilities for preventing, responding to, and recovering from attacks, disasters, and emergencies. It uses the National Response Plan, National Incident Management System (NIMS), and National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It emphasizes a risk-based approach, clarifies roles and responsibilities, and declares preparedness as a shared responsibility. Seven national preparedness priorities are outlined, including implementing NIMS and the National Response Plan. Additional guidelines were set to be published in 2005. The National Preparedness Goal aims to enhance capabilities for preventing, responding to, and recovering from attacks, disasters, and emergencies by implementing the National Incident Management System, National Response Plan, and National Infrastructure Protection Plan. It emphasizes a risk-based approach and declares preparedness as a shared responsibility. The NPG guides the nation in achieving its vision for preparedness by integrating federal, state, and local efforts. States and urban areas were required to submit Homeland Security Strategies, Program and Capability Enhancement Plans, and Investment Justifications to be eligible for federal homeland security assistance in FY2006. Some critics argue that states and urban areas lack federal guidance in preparing for homeland security. A study by the Government Accountability Office found that the lack of preparedness standards hinders state and local jurisdictions in prioritizing expenditures for first responder preparedness. The role of state and local officials in the National Preparedness Goal (NPG) development process, feedback opportunities, and reconciliation of federal, state, and local priorities are key issues. The National Preparedness Guidance, a companion document to the National Preparedness Goal, outlines instructions and guidance for implementing the goal. It includes the National Planning Scenarios, Universal Task List, and Target Capabilities List, as well as assessment standards for preparedness efforts. The Guidance aims to ensure effective use of preparedness resources and enhance understanding of emergency preparedness. The National Preparedness Guidance outlines instructions for implementing the National Preparedness Goal, including assessment standards for preparedness efforts. It includes compliance, capability, needs, and performance assessments to ensure effective use of resources and enhance emergency preparedness understanding. Possible oversight issues include the involvement of state and local officials in the guidance development process. The National Preparedness Guidance involves state and local officials in developing scenarios to assess emergency response capabilities. Scenarios include nuclear, biological, chemical, natural disasters, and cyber attacks, with descriptions of impacts and consequences. The National Preparedness Guidance outlines scenarios involving nuclear, biological, chemical, natural disasters, and cyber attacks with potential impacts and consequences. Some oversight issues include concerns about the emphasis on terrorist attacks, leading to questions about the balance between terrorism and other types of disasters in DHS preparedness guidance. The grant programs are shifting from an \"all-hazards\" approach. There are concerns about the balance between terrorism and other disasters in DHS preparedness guidance. State and local governments must meet certain criteria to receive federal homeland security assistance in FY2006. The Universal Task List (UTL) outlines expected operations and tasks for various scenarios. The Universal Task List (UTL) outlines tasks for various scenarios, including National Strategic Tasks, Planning, Coordination and Support, Incident Management, and Incident Prevention and Response. Not all jurisdictions are expected to accomplish every UTL task, but coordinated responses are crucial for terrorist attacks and catastrophic events. Training and exercise programs are funded through various grants and are based on the UTL and related mission requirements. Concerns arise about how jurisdictions will be judged \"capable\" if they do not meet every UTL standard. The Target Capabilities List (TCL) identifies critical capabilities needed during Incidents of National Significance to reduce losses and respond successfully to disasters. It includes 36 target capabilities associated with tasks from the Universal Task List (UTL). DHS and states must prioritize funding for training efforts based on identified needs. The Target Capabilities List (TCL) outlines various capabilities such as all hazards planning, criminal investigation, critical infrastructure protection, and emergency response communications. Possible oversight issues include the expected qualifications for state and local governments, potential shifts in TCL proficiency levels, and the need for jurisdictions to demonstrate competence in specific capabilities for grant applications. When DHS was established, only a State Homeland Security Strategy and a Categorical Assistance Progress Report were required for grant applications. In FY2003, states and urban areas had to submit an equipment budget worksheet, but this requirement was dropped in FY2004. In FY2004, DHS stopped requiring the equipment budget worksheet for grant applications. In FY2006, Congress granted the DHS Secretary discretion to request additional reports from assistance recipients. Currently, states and urban areas must submit a State Homeland Security Strategy, Program and Capability Enhancement Plan, Investment Justification, and Categorical Assistance Progress Report for grant applications. These documents outline homeland security goals and objectives based on self-assessments of risks and threats. The Homeland Security Strategy is based on self-assessments of risks and needs. States and urban areas must outline how they will use federal assistance to achieve their goals. Specific equipment and training plans are not required in the strategy. States and urban areas must update their strategies for funding. The Enhancement plan focuses on improving first responder and emergency management capabilities. The Homeland Security Strategy outlines activities and abilities needed by first responders and emergency management entities in the event of a terrorist attack or disaster. It includes TCL capabilities such as community preparedness, risk management, law enforcement operations, information sharing, critical infrastructure protection, and emergency operations center management. The plan must be submitted to DHS before federal assistance allocation is determined. It focuses on enhancing capabilities with federal homeland security assistance and does not specify equipment, training, plans, or exercises. Another required document is the Investment Justification, listing homeland security needs identified during program development. The Investment Justification outlines urban area homeland security needs identified during the development of the Program and Capability Enhancement Plan. It includes implementation plans to enhance and develop homeland security capabilities with federal assistance. These documents are part of the assistance application considered by DHS for funding allocations. States and urban areas are required to report twice a year on how they used their federal assistance to meet homeland security goals. The reports are to present information on the state's or urban area's progress in achieving its homeland security goals and objectives, but are not required to list specific expenditures. Critics argue that this lack of expenditure information may hinder DHS's ability to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of meeting the nation's homeland security needs. The federal government has awarded $11 billion in grants for emergency preparedness and homeland security, but there is a lack of information on how states and localities finance their efforts and assess the effectiveness of their spending. This lack of expenditure information may hinder DHS's ability to assess the nation's homeland security needs effectively. In FY2006, DHS allocated grants based on risk and effectiveness factors, including threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Asset-based risk is calculated using threat values from the U.S. intelligence community. The U.S. intelligence community's assessment of threats to critical infrastructure and geographic-based risk factors are used by DHS to determine asset-based risk. This approach considers an adversary's intent and capability to attack different types of assets using various methods, analyzing vulnerability and estimating consequences of successful attacks. The Department of Homeland Security uses a geographic-based risk approach to assess the relative risk estimate for different asset types in a given area. This includes evaluating threats, law enforcement activity, vulnerability factors, and potential consequences of an attack. The Department of Homeland Security uses a geographic-based risk approach to assess the relative risk estimate for different asset types in a given area, including human health, economy, strategic mission, and psychological impacts. Tables 2 and 3 present state and urban area assets and geographic attributes used in the risk analysis. President Bush issued HSPD-7 in 2003, establishing a national policy for identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure and key resources. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses a risk management framework to protect U.S. critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. DHS's Office for Infrastructure Protection (IP) assesses the risk to critical infrastructure and key resources. States submitted data for 48,701 assets to the National Asset Database (NADB) between July 2004 and July 2005. The NADB was used for FY2006 grant allocation methods, but not the only list of assets used by DHS. State and urban area investment justifications were evaluated based on risk assessments. State and urban area investment justifications for HSGP grants are evaluated based on five effectiveness criteria: Relevance to National Preparedness Goal, Regionalization for collaboration across disciplines and jurisdictions, and Sustainability to sustain preparedness efforts. Investments are evaluated for sustainability, implementation approach, and impact on risk and consequences. DHS uses a peer review process to assess Investment Justification effectiveness. The reviewers evaluated submissions based on specific criteria, including relevance, regionalization, sustainability, implementation approach, and impact. Each submission was reviewed and scored in two different ways, resulting in an average score for the Individual Investments and an overall score for the submission. DHS combined the average score of the individual Investments with the overall submission score, as determined by the peer review panel, to determine the final effectiveness score. DHS grouped applicants into four categories based on relative risk and anticipated effectiveness scores. DHS allocated federal assistance based on risk and effectiveness scores, with more weight given to risk. Congress has granted DHS discretion in determining factors for allocating UASI funds. Oversight of DHS' risk-based methodology may address potential issues with the weights used in distribution formulas. DHS uses risk-based methodology and distribution formulas to allocate federal assistance, with a focus on risk and effectiveness factors. Factors considered include threats, critical infrastructure, population, and transportation assets. DHS has adopted allocation methodologies based on asset types and geographic attributes. Identifying risk and effectiveness factors is crucial for accurately assessing threats and consequences. The DHS Inspector General's report on the NADB highlights inconsistencies in state asset totals and unusual assets like a psychiatry behavioral clinic and an ice cream parlor. This information is crucial for devising risk-based funding approaches for homeland security assistance allocation. The DHS Inspector General's report on the NADB raises concerns about inconsistencies in state asset totals and unusual assets, impacting the effectiveness of resource allocation for homeland security. Questions arise about the criteria used for risk assessment and the weighting of asset types in determining grant decisions. Factors such as threats, entities threatened, and consequences need to be considered in assessing risk-based formula variables. The agreement of potential risk and need factors is evaluated based on validity and relevance. Validity assesses if factors measure threats, vulnerability, or potential consequences, while relevance examines the relationship between factors and identified characteristics. For example, population density may indicate vulnerability to attacks, but the number of vehicles in a tunnel may not be relevant to assessing the risk of a hazardous material accident. The quality of information used in risk assessment, such as reliability, timeliness, and availability, is crucial. For instance, population data from the U.S. Census Bureau is considered reliable for allocating aid grants. Timely intelligence reports on terrorist threats are more valuable than monthly or quarterly reports. Data used as variables in risk formulas should be readily available to be widely accepted. The Department of Homeland Security requires states and urban areas to identify first responder and emergency management needs in their HSGP applications. Investment justifications detailing how federal assistance would address homeland security needs are evaluated through a peer review process. The effectiveness factors are determined by states and urban areas themselves. The Department of Homeland Security requires states and urban areas to identify their individual needs and justify how federal assistance would meet those needs. DHS relies on information from other agencies like the FBI for risk assessments, but may not always be able to validate the information. DHS uses a two-part approach for allocating funding based on risk assessment and justification of need, rather than a 100% risk-based formula. Critics may argue against this approach. The Department of Homeland Security allocates funding based on risk assessment and justification of need, rather than a purely risk-based formula. Critics argue that this approach does not address criticisms advocating for a purely risk-based allocation of homeland security funding. The issue of risk- and effectiveness-based funding is being raised in oversight of FY2006 state allocations. In FY2006, Congress mandated GAO to analyze DHS's allocation methodologies for SHSGP, LETPP, and UASI grant funds. GAO reviewed how DHS measured risk, included risk factors, and determined which factors had the most weight in allocating funds. DHS focused on terrorism in its risk analysis, briefing congressional committees on the results. No public report was issued due to security concerns. The GAO analyzed DHS's allocation methodologies for grant funds, focusing on terrorism risk factors. GAO did not issue a public report due to security classification. OMB emphasized the importance of peer review for enhancing scientific information quality. The bulletin emphasizes the importance of peer review for enhancing scientific information quality. Peer review involves specialists in the field reviewing draft products for quality. OMB requires federal agencies to subject scientific information to peer review before dissemination, allowing discretion in selecting appropriate reviewers and procedures. If DHS's FY2006 HSGP allocation methodologies were considered \"scientific assessments\" of terrorism risks, GAO's review could be seen as an independent peer review. The issue at hand is whether DHS should conduct an independent peer review of its allocation methodologies before distributing grant application guidance and determining state and urban area allocations."
