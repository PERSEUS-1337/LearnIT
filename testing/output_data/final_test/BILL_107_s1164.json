    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Location Privacy Protection Act of 2001\". Congress finds that location-based services allow customers to receive services based on their geographic location, with a focus on safeguarding the privacy rights of customers in controlling their location information. The improper disclosure or access to location information can lead to fraud, harassment, discrimination, and physical danger. Congress recognizes the right to privacy of location information by classifying it as customer proprietary network information. Unnecessary collection or retention of location information increases the risk of misuse. The Federal Communications Commission aims to establish privacy rules for wireless location information to promote fair competition and consumer confidence. This includes protecting customer privacy in location-based services and applications. The Federal Communications Commission aims to establish privacy rules for wireless location information to protect customer privacy in location-based services and applications, enabling customers to realize the benefits of location services more fully. The Federal Communications Commission is working on privacy rules to protect customer privacy in location-based services. The Federal Communications Commission must complete a rulemaking proceeding within 180 days to enhance the privacy of location information. The rules will require providers of location-based services to inform customers about their policies and obtain express authorization before using customer location information. Providers of location-based services must obtain express authorization from customers before collecting, using, or disclosing their location information to any non-essential parties. Additionally, these providers are required to restrict the use of customer location information to the specific purpose authorized by the customer. Providers of location-based services must ensure the security and integrity of location data, give customers access to verify or delete their data, be technology neutral for fair competition, and prohibit the disaggregation of aggregated location information for commercial purposes. The rules for location-based services may allow the collection, use, and disclosure of customer's location information without prior consent for specific purposes such as providing services, billing, and protecting rights or property. The rules for location-based services may allow the collection, use, and disclosure of customer's location information without prior consent for specific purposes such as providing services, billing, and protecting rights or property. Third parties receiving customer's location information must not disclose it without the customer's express authorization. The Commission specifies methods for customer authorization under the Communications Act of 1934. Customers can modify or revoke authorization at any time. These rules apply to all providers of location-based services or applications. The Commission's rules for location-based services must align with the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, allowing public safety agencies access to location information. State and local requirements also apply. State and local governments cannot have laws conflicting with Commission rules on wireless location privacy. Existing laws on this issue will be overridden by Commission rules. \"Aggregate location information\" refers to location data without individual customer identities. The term \"customer\" refers to the person entering into a contract for a location-based service with the provider, with individual identities removed."
