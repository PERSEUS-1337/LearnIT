    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 17140.4 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in California implements Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code for taxable years starting January 1, 2016. Modifications include changes to certain phrases and percentages within the code. Chapter 15 of the Welfare and Institutions Code establishes the Qualified ABLE Program in California. It defines terms like \"ABLE account\" and \"Administrative fund\" for the purpose of meeting qualified disability expenses. The California ABLE Act Board and ABLE program trust are also introduced under this chapter. The \"Designated beneficiary\" of an ABLE account is the eligible individual who established it. An \"Eligible individual\" must meet criteria related to blindness or disability before age 26. The \"Federal ABLE Act\" refers to the Stephen Beck, Jr., Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014. \"Investment management\" involves functions performed by a contracted manager on behalf of the board. The \"Investment manager\" is contracted to perform functions delegated by the board. The \"Program fund\" is established within the California ABLE Program Trust. The \"Qualified ABLE Program\" implements the federal ABLE Act under Section 529A of the Internal Revenue Code. (l) \u201cQualified disability expenses\u201d refer to expenses related to the eligible individual\u2019s blindness or disability for their benefit, including education, housing, transportation, employment training, assistive technology, health, financial management, legal fees, funeral expenses, and other approved expenses under the federal ABLE Act. The California ABLE Act Board is created with key members, and the Treasurer serves as chair. The program allows contributions to an ABLE account for eligible individuals in the state for qualified disability expenses. Contributions to an ABLE account in California are subject to restrictions. Contributions must be in cash and cannot exceed the annual gift exclusion amount set by the Internal Revenue Code, except in specific circumstances. The designated beneficiary of an ABLE account retains ownership of all contributions and interest until used for qualified disability expenses. Contributions and interest cannot be used as collateral for loans. The board must prevent contributions exceeding maximum limits, including contributions from other ABLE programs. The board must provide annual distribution listings to the Franchise Tax Board for ABLE accounts, using taxpayers' identification numbers for tax purposes. They must also report distributions to individuals and provide annual reports to designated beneficiaries on account value, interest earned, and investment returns. The board must provide means for beneficiaries to set savings goals and express concerns. The act shall be broadly interpreted to align with the federal ABLE Act."
