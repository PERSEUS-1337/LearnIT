    "content": "Members of Congress and Pentagon officials are focusing on developing hypersonic weapons to enable the US to launch attacks globally in under an hour. These weapons can travel faster than Mach 5. The interest is driven by the need for prompt strike systems and concerns about lagging behind Russia and China. The US is pursuing boost-glide systems and hypersonic cruise missiles. The Pentagon's program for ballistic missile-based prompt strike systems has been ongoing for about 15 years. The US has been developing conventional prompt strike systems for about 15 years, with interest shown by both the Bush and Obama administrations. These systems aim to integrate precision conventional weapons with strategic nuclear forces for long-range, rapid attacks globally. The Trump Administration supports the development of advanced conventional weapons to enhance regional security and reduce reliance on nuclear weapons. Efforts include the development of long-range precision conventional weapons and hypersonic capabilities by the early 2020s. Undersecretary of Defense Michael Griffin emphasizes the need for the US to accelerate its efforts in response to Russian and Chinese hypersonic weapons programs. The United States aims to develop its own systems for defense and to hold adversaries at risk. The Department of Defense identified prompt global strike (PGS) as a new mission in 2003, allowing the US to strike targets worldwide within an hour using conventional weapons. This capability is crucial for deterring and defeating adversaries by targeting high-value or fleeting targets promptly. Various long-range strike systems are being considered to enhance US capabilities. The United States is exploring various long-range strike systems, including bombers, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and boost-glide technologies. The focus has shifted towards hypersonic weapons for precision strikes worldwide. The Pentagon changed the program focus from \"prompt global strike\" to \"prompt strike\" to consider deploying a hypersonic glider. The Pentagon is researching hypersonic cruise missiles for shorter ranges, raising concerns about potential misinterpretation by adversaries. Some question the need for these programs and whether existing military capabilities can meet the need for prompt conventional attacks without increasing the risk of miscalculation. There are debates on whether the U.S. should accelerate its hypersonic and prompt strike programs in response to Russian and Chinese advancements in hypersonic weapons. Some argue for the U.S. to counter Russian and Chinese hypersonic weapons with similar U.S. weapons, while others warn against an arms race due to destabilizing effects. Congress supports the prompt strike mission, urging the Pentagon to prioritize and accelerate development. Review of related technologies and programs is ongoing through annual authorization and appropriations processes. This report discusses the rationale for the PGS/prompt strike mission and the deployment of conventional warheads on long-range ballistic missiles or boost-glide systems. It reviews the efforts of the Air Force and Navy in developing these systems and summarizes congressional reactions. The report also addresses the issues raised by these concepts and programs in the post-Cold War era. The United States has restructured and reduced its military forces overseas, focusing on improving its ability to quickly deploy forces to unexpected conflict areas. Analysts argue for maintaining long-range strike capability to strike anywhere in the world from bases in or near the United States. The United States aims to maintain long-range strike capability to target adversaries globally, even in areas beyond the reach of forward bases. This strategy would enable the US to counter anti-access and area denial efforts by adversaries, utilizing ballistic missile technologies for early, effective strikes. The United States must maintain the ability to strike targets globally within hours to counter adversaries' anti-access and area denial efforts. Adversaries may use concealment or deploy assets in hardened facilities, requiring improvements in defeating such targets promptly. Defense policy studies have highlighted the need for long-range strike capabilities, as seen in the 2001, 2006, and 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Reports. The 2001, 2006, and 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Reports emphasized the importance of long-range strike capabilities for the United States to counter growing threats and maintain power projection capabilities. The 2006 QDR specifically called for the deployment of prompt global strike capabilities using Trident submarine-based ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads. The 2010 QDR highlighted the need for enhanced long-range strike capabilities to address threats to forward-deployed forces and bases. The Department of Defense (DOD) is pursuing programs to meet the need for prompt global strike capabilities. In May 2003, the Air Force issued a Mission Need Statement for Prompt Global Strike, emphasizing the ability to strike globally and rapidly with joint conventional forces against high-payoff targets within minutes or hours, even without a permanent military presence in the region. The George W. Bush Administration sought to extend U.S. capability for global contingencies through prompt global strike missions, as explained by Admiral James O. Ellis and General James Cartwright. This capability allowed for rapid planning and delivery of effects globally, tailored to specific targets, without the need for a permanent military presence in the region. General Cartwright emphasized the importance of global strike capability, which involves rapid planning, precise intelligence application, and understanding the desired effect on the target. The CIA director highlighted the need for convincing intelligence before any attacks, emphasizing the importance of powerful and timely information release to the public. The Obama Administration's focus on regional challenges for the prompt global strike mission was reflected in Pentagon guidance in 2012, renaming the program to Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS). This shift in emphasis highlighted the importance of addressing time-urgent regional threats with powerful and timely intelligence release to the public. The program was renamed Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) under the Obama Administration's focus on regional challenges. The Trump Administration has not addressed prompt global strike missions but continues to support funding for hypersonic technologies. The Pentagon intends to prioritize U.S. prompt strike programs, with STRATCOM merging with U.S. Space Command in 2002 to enhance global power projection through space and information warfare. In late 2002 and early 2003, the Pentagon restructured STRATCOM to take on new missions, including the prompt global strike mission. This change highlighted the emphasis on long-range, strategic missions in conventional warfighting doctrine. STRATCOM established JFCC-GS in July 2006 to optimize planning and execution for deterring attacks and providing global strike capabilities. Analysts have identified potential targets for prompt strikes by the United States during a conflict with a regional adversary, including air defense systems, ballistic missiles, and weapons of mass destruction. These strikes aim to disrupt the adversary's command and control capabilities and prevent the use of WMDs. During a conflict, states may need to destroy quickly appearing and vulnerable targets like leadership cells or hidden mobile military systems. Prompt Global Strike (PGS) could provide the means to attack such targets if necessary weapons are not nearby. The Defense Science Board outlined scenarios in a 2009 report that might require a very rapid strike response to developing situations. The Defense Science Board outlined scenarios in a 2009 report that might require a very rapid strike response to developing situations, such as a near-peer competitor destroying a U.S. satellite, a terrorist organization shipping special nuclear materials to a neutral country, weapons of mass destruction temporarily located in a rural area, a terrorist organization's leadership gathering in a known location, or a rogue state threatening a U.S. ally with a nuclear weapon. The Pentagon is interested in developing hypersonic capabilities for medium- and intermediate-range delivery systems to have prompt regional attack capabilities. This is in response to scenarios that may require a very rapid strike response, where a weapon that could loiter in or near the conflict area and strike within minutes may be more effective than one that takes over an hour to arrive. The United States is considering using long-range ballistic missiles for prompt global strike capabilities, as conventional aircraft and cruise missiles may take too long to reach critical targets. Analysts suggest using ICBMs and SLBMs for this mission. The United States is considering using long-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs and SLBMs) for the prompt global strike mission, deploying them with conventional warheads instead of nuclear warheads. The Bush Administration introduced the concept of the \"new triad\" in 2001, combining long-range nuclear-armed missiles with precision-strike conventional weapons for offensive strike capabilities. The Pentagon's Defense Science Board (DSB) stated in a 2004 study that land-based long-range ballistic missiles with precision conventional weapons could provide the President with more crisis options, reducing the need for nuclear weapons. These missiles have unique time-critical characteristics, allowing them to attack targets worldwide within an hour of launch without relying on forward bases or supporting military capabilities. They are not at risk from air defenses and pose no risk to flight crews. Additionally, maneuverable warheads could potentially target hardened and deeply buried facilities. The DSB study highlighted the effectiveness of long-range ballistic missiles with precision conventional weapons in providing a reliable, low-cost force with high readiness and command control. General Cartwright connected this to the \"new Triad\" concept, enabling tailored global strike operations with the option to use conventional weapons instead of nuclear ones. The United States is considering using conventional weapons instead of nuclear ones for certain targets in its strategic war plan. This shift would require improved accuracy in long-range ballistic missiles, which could eliminate the need for nuclear warheads for some targets. The Navy and Air Force are exploring advanced guidance technologies like GPS to enhance missile accuracy. The United States is considering using conventional weapons instead of nuclear ones for certain targets in its strategic war plan. General Cartwright sought a study to determine the proportion of targets that could be attacked with conventional weapons, estimated to be between 10% and 30%. However, some analysts and military officials questioned the substitution of conventional warheads for nuclear ones, citing the lack of deterrent capabilities and psychological effects. General Chilton emphasized that conventional weapons may not engender fear compared to a nuclear strike. General Chilton and analysts see long-range ballistic missiles with conventional warheads as a \"niche\" weapon for critical targets, expanding U.S. conventional options without replacing nuclear weapons. This new capability could address emerging threats where nuclear weapons might not be suitable, potentially reducing reliance on nuclear weapons. Long-range ballistic missiles with conventional warheads could reduce U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons by providing more conventional options for critical targets. This capability, discussed during the Obama Administration, aims to enhance deterrence and strengthen non-nuclear forces. Both the Air Force and Navy have explored deploying conventional warheads on their long-range missiles. The Air Force and Navy conducted studies in the 1990s to develop non-nuclear penetrating warheads for their long-range ballistic missiles. Tests showed that a warhead could penetrate a hardened target without a nuclear explosion, requiring high accuracy in speed and angle of reentry. The reentry vehicle for a ballistic missile needs to be highly accurate to target and destroy buried targets. In 2003, the Air Force and DARPA started the FALCON program to develop technologies for the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program, which was created in FY2008 to fund research and development for guidance systems, boosters, mission planning, reentry systems, and payload delivery vehicles. The FALCON program, initiated by DARPA, aimed to develop a launch vehicle and hypersonic reentry vehicle (CAV) for the prompt global strike mission. The CAV was designed to travel at Mach 5 speed to deliver payloads from the US to any location on Earth in under two hours. The study outlined objectives for the CAV system to achieve prompt global strike capabilities, including achieving alert status in under 24 hours, launching within 2 hours of receiving an execution order, reaching the target within one hour of launch, and having a cross-range capability of 3,000 nautical miles for maneuverability. The Air Force proposed a plan to segregate the missiles armed with conventional warheads and deploy them far from bases with nuclear warheads, potentially on mobile launchers or in semi-buried silos on each coast for quick launch. The CAV system would require accurate intelligence for maneuverability and precision in delivering weapons within 3 meters of the target. The study identified Vandenberg Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral as potential bases for launching weapons on short notice. The United States would need ISR, command and control, and reconnaissance capabilities to deliver weapons to targets worldwide within hours of a decision to launch, for both land-based and sea-based missiles. The Falcon study and proposed CAV hypersonic vehicle laid the groundwork for the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle (HTV). Despite two failed tests in 2010 and 2011, the Air Force continued development with the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) system, to be launched on a modified version of the Army's Tactical Missile System (ATacMS). The Pentagon's Defense Science Board supported the use of long-range ballistic missiles for prompt global strike missions due to their capabilities for quick and precise attacks worldwide. The DSB study suggested that existing U.S. land-based ballistic missiles could be converted to carry conventional warheads, with modified missiles potentially carrying between 500 and 8,000 pounds of payload. These missiles could potentially destroy targets using the sheer force of impact or improved accuracy through maneuverability. Additionally, the United States could utilize a hypersonic glide vehicle for prompt global strike missions. The United States could use a hypersonic glide vehicle as the reentry body on a long-range ballistic missile. The CAV would be an unpowered, maneuverable hypersonic glide vehicle capable of carrying approximately 1,000 pounds in munitions. It would fly at hypersonic speeds and maneuver to its target. The DOD funded this program through the defense-wide Conventional Prompt Global Strike program. Initially, the Air Force considered warheads containing kinetic energy projectiles for the CPGS mission. The United States could deploy munitions from a payload delivery vehicle, potentially using a hypersonic glide vehicle for delivery. These munitions could include an explosive warhead for penetrating hardened targets. In the near term, existing reentry vehicles on U.S. missiles could be modified to carry conventional warheads. The Air Force considered modifying Minuteman II and Peacekeeper missiles for this purpose. The Air Force deployed 450 missiles in the early 1990s, each carrying a single nuclear warhead with a range of over 7,000 miles. Some missiles were modified for missile defense tests and space launches. The Peacekeeper missile, deployed in 1986 with 50 missiles carrying 10 warheads each, was deactivated between 2002 and 2005. The Air Force plans to modify these missiles for the PGS mission and satellite launches, renaming them Minotaur missiles. The Minotaur IV missile would use stages from the Peacekeeper missile and a new fourth stage for land-based CPGS. The Air Force considered using Minotaur IV missiles for a land-based CPGS mission, stating that modifications could be done at low cost and technical risk. The avionics and guidance systems would rely on existing technologies with some modifications for improved accuracy. An Analysis of Alternatives study was initiated in 2006 to review technologies for the prompt global strike mission, with collaboration between the Navy and Air Force on service-specific platforms. The Air Force collaborated with the Navy on studying various platforms for the long-term Prompt Global Strike (PGS) option, including land-based, sea-based, and air-breathing options. In 2008, the Air Force began developing the conventional strike missile (CSM) as the primary option for PGS after Congress rejected funding for the conventional Trident modification program. General Kevin Chilton assigned the Air Force the lead role in developing the long-range missile capability for PGS in mid-2008. The Air Force developed the conventional strike missile (CSM) in 2008 as a land-based system using boost-glide technologies to deliver conventional payloads globally with high accuracy and the ability to maneuver to avoid third-party countries. The CSM aimed to address concerns about nuclear ambiguity and provide prompt effects on target within minutes to hours of launch. The Air Force developed the conventional strike missile (CSM) in 2008 to deliver conventional payloads globally with high accuracy and maneuverability. The CSM aimed to address concerns about nuclear ambiguity and provide prompt effects on target within minutes to hours of launch. The CSM program faced delays in deployment due to unresolved issues with reentry bodies technology. The DARPA-developed Hypersonic Test Vehicle (HTV-2) was designed to travel at speeds of over 13,000 miles per hour across the Pacific Ocean. Lockheed Martin Corporation developed the HTV-2 as part of the Falcon program, aiming to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base to a target near Kwajalein Atoll in 30 minutes. The Air Force planned to acquire and test two vehicles for this program. DARPA and the Air Force planned to acquire and test hypersonic vehicles. The Air Force contracted Lockheed Martin to produce a third vehicle for testing the CSM's weapon delivery capability. DOD allocated funds for hypersonic glide experiments, with additional budget increases in subsequent years. The Obama Administration requested more funding for HTV-2 flight experiments and CSM payload delivery vehicle design. The DOD conducted its first test of the HTV-2 vehicle on a Minotaur IV rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The test achieved controlled flight in the atmosphere before telemetry was lost nine minutes after liftoff, deemed a partial success by media reports. The HTV-2 vehicle launched successfully but failed to fly the full duration and distance as planned. DARPA gathered valuable data during the test. DOD reviewed the results and conducted wind tunnel tests and simulations for optimization before a second test in August 2011. The second test saw the HTV-2 vehicle successfully separate from the booster and transition to aerodynamic flight at Mach 20, but then experienced a flight anomaly. The HTV-2 experienced a flight anomaly post perigee, leading to a controlled descent and splash down in the ocean. DARPA lost contact with the vehicle during its independent flight, causing it to crash. Despite successful launching and initial trajectory, DARPA had not yet determined how to control the aerodynamic portion of the flight after separation from the booster. The HTV-2 program faced challenges due to a poor test record and budget constraints. Funding for the program decreased significantly over the years, with only minimal amounts allocated for system studies and technology maturation. No additional flight tests are planned for the HTV-2 vehicle. The ArcLight program was a proposed alternative delivery vehicle for the Prompt Global Strike mission, using a high-tech missile with a hypersonic glider capable of reaching over 2,300 miles. It would have had a range of around 2,000 nautical miles and could carry a 100-200 pound payload. The program was intended to be launched from the Navy's Mark 41 vertical launch system on submarines and surface ships, requiring forward positioning of Navy assets. Despite initial funding requests in FY2010 and FY2011, the program was terminated and no additional funding has been requested. The Army developed the advanced hypersonic weapon (AHW) as an alternative to the HTV-2 for delivering a conventional payload. It would use a hypersonic glider on a booster with a shorter range, requiring forward deployment on land or at sea. The AHW had a conical design and precision guidance system for target maneuvering. Funding for the AHW program increased from $1.5 million in FY2006 to $91 million in FY2012. The Army developed the advanced hypersonic weapon (AHW) as an alternative to the HTV-2 for delivering a conventional payload. Funding for the AHW program increased significantly over the years, with Congress appropriating $91 million in FY2012 and additional funding in subsequent years. The AHW, now known as the Alternate Re-Entry System, conducted a successful flight test in 2011 using the strategic targets system booster stack. Funding for the AHW continued to increase steadily, with DOD requesting $263.4 million for FY2019. The AHW program, derived from the Navy's Polaris ballistic missile, conducted a successful 2,400-mile test from Hawaii to Kwajalein Atoll. It collected data on hypersonic boost-glide technologies, tested thermal protection, and demonstrated an alternative payload delivery vehicle. The AHW program is seen as a leading contender for a boost-glide conventional prompt strike system. The Pentagon plans to develop and deploy the AHW as a common hypersonic glide vehicle by the early 2020s. The Navy will use it in its submarine-launched Conventional Prompt Strike program, while the Air Force will deploy it in the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon program. A test of the system in 2014 failed due to issues with the STARS booster, providing no useful information for the program. The Army determined that the test failure was caused by an external thermal protective cover interfering with the launch vehicle steering assembly. A successful scaled test of the Advanced Hypersonic Weapon was conducted in late October 2017. The Navy requested funding for the enhanced effectiveness initiative to improve Trident II missile accuracy. Lockheed Martin Corporation pursued a three-year study for the E2 reentry vehicle, integrating IMU guidance with GPS technology. The modified MK4 reentry vehicle would have a flap-based steering system for improved accuracy and penetration angle. Congress rejected initial funding requests, but research continued at a low level. Lockheed Martin developed the E2 warhead, known as a \"backpack extension,\" to increase the accuracy of Trident missiles. Test flights in 2002 and 2005 showed improved accuracy and control capabilities for striking targets. Lockheed Martin developed the E2 warhead, known as a \"backpack extension,\" to increase the accuracy of Trident missiles. The reentry vehicle for conventional warheads on Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles was included in the Navy's budget request for FY2007 and FY2008. Funding for the program was not sought in FY2004, FY2005, or FY2006, but most of the design and development work could have been completed by FY2008 with additional funding planned for FY2009. The Navy planned to finalize the guidance system for the reentry body extension of the Trident missile, design an interface with the missile system flight controls, develop a conventional payload for the reentry body, and modify facilities for testing. Congress rejected funding requests due to concerns about the program's rationale and potential misuse in conflicts. If funded in FY2008, the Navy aimed to conduct system development and demonstration in FY2008 and FY2009, with production and deployment starting in FY2010 for full operational capability by the end of 2012. The Navy's funding request for the PGS program was rejected by Congress in FY2008, leading to a restructuring of the program. In FY2009, DOD allocated funding for a flight experiment using a Life Extension Test Bed (LETB-2) reentry body on a Trident D-5 missile test. The Navy argued that the technology developed from this test would be applicable to any conventional ballistic missile. The test was funded separately from the combined conventional prompt global strike (CPGS) program. The Navy requested funding for a Medium Lift Reentry Body for conventional ballistic missiles in its FY2009 budget. This reentry body would carry a tungsten-rod warhead designed to destroy area targets. The Navy planned to modify its Trident submarines to deploy missiles equipped with this warhead. The Navy planned to modify Trident submarines to deploy missiles equipped with a Medium Lift Reentry Body for conventional ballistic missiles. The submarines would carry two missiles with conventional warheads, while the remaining missiles would have nuclear warheads. Only eight conventional missiles would be available for use at any time, with only one or two submarines likely within range of the specified targets. The Navy planned to modify Trident submarines to deploy missiles with conventional warheads for precision strikes on area and hardened targets. The reentry vehicle would carry tungsten rods to destroy area targets and technologies to penetrate hardened, buried targets. This capability aimed to contribute to the prompt global strike mission as outlined in the 2006 QDR. Deployment of precision-guided conventional warheads using long-range Trident missiles was planned within two years. The Navy planned to modify Trident submarines to deploy precision-guided conventional warheads using long-range Trident missiles within two years. The budget included $503 million over five years, but Congress denied the funding request in FY2007 and did not approve specific funding for FY2008. Instead, research and development funding was provided for a more general category of \"prompt global strike\" initiatives. The Navy studied the development of a submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missile (SLIRBM) for prompt global strike capabilities. The missile could deliver a 2,000-pound payload over a 1,500-mile range with high accuracy, reaching its target in less than 15 minutes. It could carry nuclear or conventional warheads and be deployed on Trident submarines. The Navy studied developing a submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missile (SLIRBM) for prompt global strike capabilities. The concept involved deploying 2 or 3 missiles in up to 22 launch tubes on Trident submarines. Funding for the program was allocated in FY2005 and FY2006, with additional funding considered in FY2007 and FY2008. In 2008, the Navy considered allocating funds for a Submarine-launched Global Strike Missile with a range of 2,000-3,000 nautical miles. However, Congress eliminated Navy funding for this program in FY2008. The Pentagon reasserted its interest in deploying a prompt strike capability on submarines in 2012. The Pentagon reasserted its interest in deploying a prompt strike capability on submarines in 2012 to maintain military freedom of action against new technologies. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta linked this effort to providing Virginia-class attack submarines with more conventional cruise missiles. The option of deploying the systems at sea was left open to reduce cost and risk as booster and hypersonic glider technologies were developed. The Pentagon developed booster and hypersonic glider technologies for a prompt strike capability on submarines. The system would not use conventional warheads on missiles with nuclear warheads, reducing the risk of misinterpretation by adversaries. General Martin Dempsey highlighted the differences in technology to prevent confusion during launches. DOD has chosen the sea-based option for the conventional prompt strike mission. DOD began reviewing new demonstrations in the Alternate Re-Entry System program by the Navy's strategic systems program in FY2013. A Navy flight test for a conventional prompt strike system was delayed until October 2017, costing $160 million. The successful test flew over 2,000 nautical miles from Hawaii to the Marshall Islands. The Pentagon estimated that a Navy flight test for a conventional prompt strike system cost $160 million and was declared a success by Vice Admiral Terry Benedict. The Navy could potentially deploy the system on Ohio class ballistic missile submarines or Virginia class attack submarines. A second flight test is planned by the end of FY2020, with funding transferring to the Navy starting in FY2020. Funding for the Navy's program for conventional warheads on long-range ballistic missiles is expected to increase significantly, from $278 million in FY2019 to $478 million in FY2022, totaling $1.9 billion between FY2019 and FY2022. Congress has shown both support and skepticism for the program since it was first considered in FY2003. The Navy's requests for funding in FY2003 and FY2004 were denied by Congress, and the Bush Administration requested $12.2 million for the common aero vehicle program in FY2004. Development funding for the Common Aero Vehicle (CAV) program in FY2004 was authorized at $17.025 million, with concerns raised by the House about potential misinterpretation of U.S. missile launches by other nations. The House required the Air Force to submit a report addressing these concerns, which remained in the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (P.L. 108-136) includes a requirement for an annual report on developing a prompt global strike capability. Congress mandated the plan to cover target types, desired capabilities, command and control needs, integration with tactical missions, and cost/schedule. This interest stems from the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review's focus on integrating nuclear and conventional strike capabilities. The Air Force's report on the CAV concept of operations suggested measures to reduce misinterpretation when deploying ballistic missiles with conventional warheads. This was in response to the NPR's focus on integrating nuclear and conventional strike capabilities. Congress blended both concepts into a request for a new report, emphasizing the need for a coherent force structure. The Bush Administration requested $16.4 million for research and development on the CAV in FY2005, with Congress appropriating $21.6 million. Congress expressed concerns about potential misinterpretation of ballistic missiles armed with CAV and specified that funds could only be used for non-weapons-related research on hypersonic technologies. Congress specified that funds for the CAV program could not be used for developing weapons capabilities or for launch on ICBMs or SLBMs. The program was restructured as the hypersonic technology vehicle to comply with these restrictions. Additional funding was approved for the program in FY2006 and FY2007. The Air Force received additional funding for the CAV program in FY2007, with projections showing a significant increase in costs by FY2010 and FY2011 as the program transitioned from research to production and deployment. Congressional concerns about potential misunderstandings with the launch of ballistic missiles were to be addressed. The budget projection for the CAV indicated it would not provide a near-term solution to the PGS mission needs, leading to growing interest in the Navy's CTM program. The Navy's FY2007 budget included $127 million for the conventional Trident modification, with funds allocated for CTM development and advanced strike capability demonstration. The House and Senate Armed Services committees did not authorize the Administration's request for advanced strike capability using the conventional Trident missile in their versions of the FY2007 Defense authorization bills. Concerns were raised about potential misunderstandings by other nations, such as Russia, regarding the launch of a conventional Trident missile. Both committees requested reports from the Administration to address these issues and withheld $95 million of the requested funds pending completion of the report. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $20 million for report preparation and $32 million for research and development on technologies supporting the Trident modification. The Senate Armed Services Committee authorized $20 million for report preparation and $32 million for research and development on technologies supporting the Trident modification. The House Armed Services Committee eliminated $38 million for the CTM program in the Trident II modification budget and reduced Navy's funding for the CTM program by $47 million, leaving $30 million for research and development into an advanced strike capability. The conference committee accepted the House's reduction in CTM funding, resulting in only $30 million allocated for this effort. The House and Senate appropriations bills rejected funding for the CTM program, with the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee reducing research and development funding to $30 million. The Senate eliminated all funding for CTM and allocated $5 million for the National Academy of Sciences to analyze mission requirements. The Defense Appropriations Act conference report retained the $5 million for the National Academy of Sciences report and included $20 million for research and development focusing on advanced strike capabilities. The President's budget request for FY2008 included funding for the CAV, but Congress transferred the funding to a new account for Prompt Global Strike Research. Congress also rolled funding for other elements of the FALCON program into the new account, totaling $100 million for FY2008. The Pentagon objected to this transfer, warning it could lead to the termination of the FALCON program. The Pentagon proposed a combined program for PGS research with a budget of $208 million, but Congress limited the funding to $100 million for FY2008. The President's budget also included $175.4 million for the CTM program, including funds for modifying Trident II missiles. Congress had denied all funding for the FALCON program. The FY2008 budget included funding for modifying Trident II missiles to carry conventional warheads, as well as developing advanced strike capabilities. Congress had denied funding for these purposes in FY2007. The budget allocated $126.4 million for research and development into reentry vehicle technologies for the conventional Trident modification, an increase from the previous year's appropriation of $20 million. The House Armed Services Committee supported continued research on the conventional Trident concept in the FY2008 Defense authorization bill. The FY2008 budget allocated funds for research and development of the conventional Trident concept, but withheld funds for operational deployment. The Strategic Forces Subcommittee supported technologies for prompt global strike but sought to slow the program for further evaluation. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended no funding specifically for the CTM program in the FY2008 Defense authorization bill. The committee recommended transferring all $208 million in PGS funding to support common prompt global strike concepts, emphasizing the need for a non-nuclear capability. The funding was limited to $100 million in a single account. The Appropriations Committee limited funding for the Prompt Global Strike concept to $100 million and required a plan from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. Congress did not fully reject the concept but did not share the Administration's urgency. The House Appropriations Committee redirected $100 million to a new account for the Department's prompt global strike initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $100 million for the Department's prompt global strike initiative, with funds to be used for research and development on the CTM concept. The final FY2008 appropriations bill limited the funding to $100 million, with a report required on technology thrusts and investment objectives. The Pentagon requested $117.6 million for the prompt global strike program element in FY2008 and FY2009. The report to Congress outlined plans for funding allocation, including tests of hypersonic glide vehicles and alternative reentry systems development. The House Armed Services Committee was involved in the process. The Senate Armed Services Committee added $30 million to the requested $117.6 million for the PGS program in the FY2009 Defense authorization bill. Congress ultimately provided the requested amount of $117.6 million, with the Senate Appropriations Committee deleting $43 million from the PGS account. The Defense appropriations bill reduced funding for reentry technologies, allocating $40 million for medium lift reentry body work and $3 million for the LETB-2 test bed program. The legislation specified that $19 million must be available for the Army's advanced hypersonic weapon. The Department of Defense requested $166.9 million for the conventional prompt global strike program, including $91.5 million for the DARPA/Air Force hypersonic test vehicle. The budget request includes funding for hypersonic technology development, integration of HTV-2 vehicles with Minotaur IV lite launch vehicles, and progress assessment of thermal and aerodynamic protection. $46.9 million is allocated for the Army's AHW program, with plans for a first flight in FY2011. The Department of Defense also requested $239.9 million for the Conventional Prompt Global Strike program in FY2011, with the Air Force Conventional Strike Missile as the leading design. $136.6 million is allocated for hypersonic glide experiments to support the development of a payload delivery vehicle for the conventional strike missile. The budget request includes funding for the development of a payload delivery vehicle (PDV) for the conventional strike missile and the Minotaur IV rocket booster. It also supports the integration of the HTV-2 delivery vehicle and Minotaur IV missile, with two test flights of this CSM design expected in FY2011. Additionally, $69 million is allocated to the Alternate Re-Entry System for the development of the hypersonic glide body (HGB) or the Army advanced hypersonic weapon, with one test flight planned for FY2011. The PGS fund also allocated $24 million to Test Range Development and $10.3 million to administrative and study costs. Both the House and the Senate approved this request in their versions of the FY2011 Defense authorization bill. The Subcommittee recommended full funding for the FY2011 Defense appropriations bill but limited DOD to obligate only $189 million until restructuring plans for the HTV-2 vehicle were provided. Congress did not complete work on the FY2011 budget, passing a continuing resolution instead. The FY2012 budget request for conventional prompt global strike programs includes $204.8 million, with $132 million allocated to hypersonic glide experiments. The amended budget request allocates $132 million for hypersonic glide experiments and concept demonstration, $51 million for alternate payload delivery vehicle options, $12 million for range support, and $10 million for long-range studies. The funding in FY2012 will be used to procure the PDV, warhead, and booster for the planned \"weaponized\" test of the Air Force conventional strike missile. The House Armed Services Committee approved $179.8 million for the CPGS program, expressing concerns about the HTV-2 vehicle's 2010 test flight failure and DOD's pursuit of a weaponized missile system. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved $179.8 million for the CPGS program in FY2012, questioning DOD's focus on the Air Force CSM with the HTV-2 payload. They encouraged a broader examination of CPGS capabilities to meet warfighter requirements. The committee also noted other potential long-range strike capabilities that may be more cost-effective and lower risk. In FY2012, the CPGS program budget was altered, with $61.8 million for hypersonic glide experiment and $91 million for the Alternate Re-Entry System. The House Appropriations Committee approved $104.8 million for CPGS, while the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $204.8 million. Congress ultimately appropriated $179.8 million for CPGS in the consolidated appropriations Act, citing delays in the program due to failed HTV-2 flight tests. The Pentagon budget request for FY2013 included $110.383 million for the CPGS program, with allocations for hypersonic glide experiment, Alternate Re-Entry System, test range development, and studies. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved this amount in their versions of the FY2013 Defense Authorization Bills, and it was included in the final version of the FY2013 Defense Authorization Act. The House Armed Services Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a report on competition, verification, and transparency measures for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee increased funding for the CPGS program in the FY2013 Defense Appropriations Bill to $200.383 million, with $147.8 million allocated to the Alternate Re-Entry System. The DOD budget request for FY2014 included $65.4 million for \"prompt global strike capability.\" The DOD budget request for FY2014 included $65.4 million for prompt global strike capability development, with allocations for hypersonic glide experiment, warhead engineering, test range development, and studies. Reductions in overall budget and a shift in defense priorities impacted the funding. The DOD's shift in defense priorities for FY2014 includes a focus on research and development of intermediate range concepts, specifically looking into a conventional prompt strike option from submarines. Funding within the CPGS program is shifting towards the Alternate Re-Entry System to explore alternative booster and delivery vehicle options. Congress appropriated funds in the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act for an affordable alternative solution to fill the CPGS capability gap. A report was requested by Congress to address policy considerations and compare costs of submarine-launched conventional missiles with those launched by other platforms. This provision was included due to DOD's renewed interest in sea-based CPGS capability and concerns about ambiguity issues. The DOD budget request for FY2015 includes $70.8 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with allocations for the HTV-2 program and AHW line. Congress added $25 million to the program's appropriation, totaling $95.6 million. The budget reflects reductions in resources, limiting the Department's ability to meet CPGS requirements. The FY2016 DOD budget request includes $78.8 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with $2 million allocated to the HTV-2 program and $72.95 million to the AHW program. The focus may now be on developing an intermediate range capability for the prompt strike mission. The FY2016 DOD budget request includes funding for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with a focus on developing an intermediate range capability for the prompt strike mission. The House version of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act provided additional funding for Concept Development by the Army and Navy for a CPGS option to support the program following testing complications in prior years. The United States is urged to develop a conventional prompt global strike capability to target high-value, time-sensitive, and defended targets from long distances. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report by September 30, 2020, on the military requirements process and Milestone A decision for at least one weapon system. The Senate authorized $88.8 million for this program area to explore sea-based and ground-based concepts and support a flight experiment in March 2017. The Secretary of Defense must make a Milestone A decision for the Conventional Prompt Global Strike Weapons System by September 30, 2020, or eight months after a successful intermediate range flight test. The conference report on H.R. 1735 authorizes $88.8 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with an additional $5 million allocated to Concept Development by the Navy and Army. The DOD budget request for FY2017 included $181.3 million for this program, with $174 million allocated to the AHW line. The DOD budget request for FY2017 included $181.3 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with $174 million allocated to the AHW line. Congress approved the request and mandated a Milestone A decision by September 30, 2020. The budget also includes funding for Hypersonic Glide Experiment, CPGS studies, and test range development, indicating progress towards developing a system using the AHW glider and an intermediate-range booster, possibly deployed at sea. The legislation mandates a Milestone A decision for the CPGS program by September 30, 2020, or within eight months after the second intermediate-range flight test. Congress limits program funds to 75% until a report on warfighter requirements is submitted. The DOD budget request for FY2018 allocated $201.75 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with $197.4 million for the AHW line and $1 million for Hypersonic Glide Experiment. The DOD budget for FY2018 allocated $201.75 million for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, including support for ground and flight tests, CPGS studies, and plans for the AHW testing program. Congress approved the funding and directed the Secretary of Defense to achieve early operational capability for the conventional prompt strike weapon system by September 30, 2022. The Pentagon submitted a report to Congress outlining the delivery timeline and resources needed for a medium-range conventional prompt global strike weapon. A reprogramming request added $159.5 million to the FY2018 budget for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with $40.0 million allocated for increasing production of hypersonic glide vehicles to support the Navy's CPS program. The reprogramming request added $159.5 million to the FY2018 budget for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development, with $40.0 million allocated for increasing production of hypersonic glide vehicles and prototypes for the Navy's CPS program. Additionally, $34.5 million would address the lack of autoclaves needed for thermal protection systems, $20.0 million would improve test and evaluation infrastructure, and $65 million would support an accelerated demonstration of a new land-launched hypersonics capability. The DOD budget request for FY2019 includes $278 million for the CPS program. The DOD has allocated $263 million to the Alternate Re-Entry System/Warhead Engineering line. The defense-wide research and development account has no funding for the program after FY2019 as it transitions to the Navy's research and development accounts in FY2020. In FY2019, the program will focus on manufacturing and testing the booster and hypersonic glide body for upcoming tests. Congress increased funding for Prompt Global Strike in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2019. In FY2019, funding for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development was increased to $413.4 million in the Defense Authorization Act, with an additional $150 million to accelerate the program. This represents a 57% increase over the Administration's request and a 40% increase over the previous year. Congress also increased funding in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act to $466.9 million, with the Senate Appropriations Committee recommending a total of $615.9 million for hypersonic programs to counter near-peer threats. The recommended increase in funding for Prompt Global Strike Capability Development was to support hypersonics research and prototyping efforts. The original mission requirements assumed future conflicts would be far from existing U.S. bases and sea-based forces, with hidden or relocatable targets appearing quickly. Launch and arrival on target quickly were crucial factors. The U.S. forces needed to launch quickly and arrive on target swiftly to counter the \"anti-access\" threat in Afghanistan in 2001 after the September 11 attacks. Speed was essential to trap and destroy leaders at al Qaeda training camps, requiring the acquisition of basing rights and naval forces deployment due to the lack of military bases in the region. The mountainous terrain provided hiding spots for the enemy leadership. The mountainous terrain in Afghanistan provided hiding spots for enemy leadership, but future conflicts may not have similar characteristics. The focus on great power conflict in recent national security strategies means the US may have more time to build up forces and strike targets. The rationale for deploying prompt long-range strike and hypersonic weapons has also evolved. The United States considered substituting conventional weapons for nuclear warheads in attacking certain targets to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons. Critics argued that conventional weapons could not fully replace nuclear weapons in deterrence strategy due to their lack of scale and psychological impact. Supporters viewed prompt strike missions as a niche capability to enhance conventional options and decrease the need for nuclear weapons. The United States may only need a small number of conventional weapons for use against critical targets, reducing the reliance on nuclear weapons. This capability would provide the President with an alternative to using nuclear warheads in certain circumstances, as highlighted in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. States had a wider range of credible conventional weapons for regional deterrence, reducing the need for nuclear weapons. The U.S. expanded research into hypersonic capabilities, aiming to deploy them on various delivery systems, aligning with the focus on long-range conventional strike weapons. This shift is in response to improved defensive capabilities of potential adversaries like Russia and China. The United States has focused on developing prompt, accurate systems like hypersonic weapons to counter the improved defensive capabilities of adversaries like China and Russia. These weapons are seen as tactical assets with capabilities such as quick response, high speed, and maneuverability for theater or regional conflicts. Analysts question the rationale behind the U.S.'s focus on long-range strike and hypersonic weapons, particularly concerning the need for conventional options to avoid nuclear escalation. Deployment of Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS) could disrupt strategic stability and increase the risk of nuclear conflict. It is uncertain if adversaries would recognize incoming weapons as carrying conventional warheads. The deployment of conventional warheads on long-range ballistic missiles could potentially increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons being used in a conflict. Concerns are raised about the destabilizing effect of hypersonic weapons with shortened attack timelines. Adversaries may not easily distinguish between conventional and nuclear warheads, leading to escalated conflicts. Russian officials have expressed concerns about U.S. conventional prompt global strike capabilities, fearing that these weapons armed with conventional warheads could threaten critical targets in Russia and its strategic nuclear forces. They worry that the deployment of highly accurate missiles could undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent and increase the likelihood of a U.S. attack without the use of nuclear weapons. The deployment of U.S. conventional prompt global strike capabilities has raised concerns in Russia about the potential for these weapons to target critical Russian assets. There are fears that the use of highly accurate missiles could undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent and increase the risk of a U.S. attack without nuclear weapons. Additionally, there are worries about the uncertainty surrounding the type of warhead carried by these missiles and the possibility of exceeding treaty limits by replacing conventional warheads with nuclear ones. Critics also highlight the risk of other nations misinterpreting the launch of these missiles as a nuclear attack by the United States. Critics raise concerns that countries with minimal satellite capabilities or degraded launch notification systems, like China and Russia, could misinterpret conventionally armed long-range ballistic missiles flying over their territories as nuclear attacks. This could lead to a situation where these nations feel compelled to respond with their own nuclear weapons due to the short time of flight and limited opportunity to assess the threat. Congress raised concerns about potential misunderstandings in debates over funding for the CPGS mission. In response, $5 million was allocated for the National Academy of Sciences to analyze the mission requirement. The report, published in August 2008, acknowledged concerns but recommended continuing the program. The National Academies study highlighted the risk of misunderstanding in tracking ballistic missile launches, especially with the use of boost-glide technologies for the CPGS mission. Concerns about misinterpretation were limited to Russia at the time. The United States could mitigate the risk of misunderstanding with Russia by altering deployment patterns of systems armed with conventional warheads and cooperating to demonstrate they are not nuclear. For example, deploying long-range missiles with conventional warheads at bases without nuclear capabilities could help. The United States and Russia could implement cooperative measures such as military-to-military contacts and high-level political consultations to address concerns about the deployment of missiles with conventional warheads. Providing prior notification of launches and establishing a \"hot line\" for communication after launches could help assure Russia that the missiles are not nuclear-armed. These measures would enhance transparency and reduce the risk of misunderstandings. The Air Force planned to launch the Conventional Strike Missile (CSM) on a \"depressed trajectory\" to achieve an altitude of 500,000 feet, different from nuclear-armed ballistic missiles targeting Russia or China. This increased cooperation could reduce suspicion and misinterpretation if the United States were to launch ballistic missiles with conventional warheads. The DOD has suggested that a submarine-launched, intermediate-range boost-glide system would have a different trajectory from nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, potentially reducing misunderstandings. However, during a conflict, communication and information accumulation may not be sufficient to prevent confusion. The United States may have little warning before a conflict, needing to launch missiles promptly without consulting other nations. Other nations, fearing a nuclear attack, might respond quickly before being convinced the missiles are conventional. Routine data exchanges and inspections cannot guarantee warheads haven't been changed recently. Changing missile basing or launch patterns could help distinguish between conventional and nuclear warheads. Changing missile basing or launch patterns could help distinguish between conventional and nuclear warheads, but this may not eliminate misunderstandings or address concerns about potential U.S. use of these weapons. The United States is considering various weapons systems for the PGS mission, with a submarine-launched missile armed with the AHW emerging as the leading contender. Other options include cruise missiles and ballistic missiles with conventional warheads. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are collaborating on precision strike weapons. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are working together to develop hypersonic capabilities by the early 2020s. Long-range land-based ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads could have high readiness rates, prompt response times, and high accuracy with a hypersonic payload delivery vehicle. This would allow the U.S. military to react promptly and decisively without relying on forward basing. The development of hypersonic capabilities by the Army, Navy, and Air Force aims to provide high readiness rates and prompt response times without relying on forward basing. Concerns have been raised about potential misunderstandings and strategic stability issues if these missiles follow the same trajectories as nuclear-armed missiles. Other nations may question whether these missiles carry conventional warheads during conflicts. The United States may have medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missiles that could carry conventional or nuclear warheads. These missiles, possibly deployed outside the country, could address concerns about misunderstandings and misperceptions. The US plans to withdraw from the INF Treaty due to Russia's violation, allowing for the development of such missiles. The US plans to develop a new land-based intermediate-range missile in response to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty. Congress has mandated the development of a conventional road-mobile ground-launched cruise missile system with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. Additionally, there is funding allocated for an accelerated demonstration of a new land-launched hypersonics capability. The United States is also considering deploying conventional warheads on long-range Trident ballistic missiles carried by Ohio-class submarines. The US is considering deploying conventional warheads on long-range Trident ballistic missiles carried by Ohio-class submarines. These submarine-launched ballistic missiles could have similar benefits as land-based missiles, with the ability for prompt decision-making and launch during a crisis. They have the range and accuracy to reach targets worldwide and attack a wide range of targets on short notice. However, deploying conventional warheads on these submarines may raise concerns about misunderstandings, especially if they are on the same submarines as nuclear warheads. The Navy may face challenges in convincing potential adversaries about the nature of the missiles carried. The Air Force identified techniques to convince adversaries that Trident submarines carrying conventional warheads are not nuclear. Russia's monitoring of SLBM launches may be less effective than ICBM launches, potentially leading to misunderstandings. The US could adjust patrol areas to avoid flying over other nations if launching conventional missiles. The United States could use submarines to launch conventional missiles without flying over Russia or China, but moving them to new launch points may not be feasible in a prompt conflict. U.S. bombers like B-52s, B-2s, and B-1s have the range for global targets but were initially not considered for the Prompt Global Strike mission due to long flight times and the need for tanker support. The long flight time of bombers like B-52s could lead to crew fatigue and provide adversaries with warning of an attack. Conventional cruise missiles could allow the aircraft to stay out of range of some air-defense systems but might take too long to reach targets for the Prompt Global Strike mission. The United States could use the time during bombers' flights to acquire and update information on the target, potentially avoiding the need for military attacks. The Air Force plans to deploy the Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) by 2022, a system that would launch off a B-52 bomber. Lockheed Martin was awarded a $928 million contract to design, develop, and test this system. Additionally, the Air Force is pursuing the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) system, which employs a glider similar to the CAV/HTV-2 and launches on a modified version of the Army's Tactical Missile System (ATacMS). The Navy has the capability to attack targets at ranges of around 1,500 nautical miles with sea-based cruise missiles, specifically the Tomahawk missiles. These missiles have been used frequently in conflicts over the past 20 years, allowing the United States to reach targets without risking aircraft or crews. Trident ballistic missile submarines have been modified to carry up to 154 cruise missiles each, enhancing the Navy's long-range strike capabilities. The Navy has explored alternatives to sea-based cruise missiles for quicker and more effective strikes. They are developing hypersonic missiles that can reach targets within 15 minutes from ships or submarines within 500 to 600 nautical miles. The Air Force, in collaboration with DARPA, NASA, and the Navy, is developing scramjet technologies for long-range strike missions. Scramjets use atmospheric oxygen for combustion, eliminating the need for heavy oxygen tanks and allowing for faster speeds. NASA states that a scramjet could travel at 15 times the speed of sound and destroy targets by crashing into them at hypersonic speeds. The Air Force is developing scramjet technology for long-range strike missions. The X-51 WaveRider, an experimental scramjet, was released from a B-52 bomber at 50,000 feet. It reached a speed of Mach 4.8 but did not meet the intended speed of 4,500 miles per hour. The X-51A WaveRider experienced control problems during tests, with issues in 2011 and 2012. However, in a successful 2013 test, it reached Mach 5.1 and 80,000 feet. DARPA and the Air Force are investing in hypersonic technology, with research funding increasing significantly. Research is focusing on developing hypersonic cruise missiles that could be launched from fighters and bombers, including programs like the hypersonic air-breathing weapon concept and tactical boost glide program. This technology is in its early stages and may address nuclear ambiguity issues raised by long-range ballistic missiles. In April 2010, the US and Russia signed the New START treaty, with Russia expressing concerns about US plans to deploy conventional warheads on ballistic missiles. The Obama Administration responded to Russia's concerns about strategic stability and nuclear war risks by assuring that the US did not intend to target its PGS systems against Russia. The New START treaty preamble acknowledges the impact of conventionally armed ICBMs and SLBMs on strategic stability, but it does not limit research and development of prompt global strike capabilities. Russia initially wanted to ban conventional warheads on strategic ballistic missiles during negotiations, but the US rejected this proposal. The United States rejected Russia's proposal to ban conventional warheads on strategic ballistic missiles due to interference with U.S. plans for the CPGS mission. Under New START, U.S. land-based ballistic missiles armed with conventional warheads would count towards treaty limits. The New START treaty allows missiles with a ballistic trajectory over most of their flight path and a range greater than 5,500 kilometers to count towards the limits. Submarine-launched ballistic missiles meeting this criteria must travel on a ballistic trajectory for most of their flight path and have a range greater than 600 kilometers. The Obama Administration accepted this provision to avoid difficulties in verifying compliance with the treaty limits. The New START Treaty allows for conventional warheads on ballistic missiles to be counted towards the treaty limits, as long as they meet certain criteria. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that the number of these delivery vehicles and warheads would be very small compared to overall strategic systems. The treaty would include warheads deployed on CPGS systems, like the Navy's conventional Trident modification. The New START Treaty allows for conventional warheads on ballistic missiles to be counted towards the treaty limits, including those deployed on CPGS systems like the Navy's conventional Trident modification. However, warheads deployed on boost-glide systems, such as the Air Force's conventional strike missile, would not be accountable under the treaty due to their non-ballistic trajectory. Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy James Miller confirmed that these non-nuclear systems would not be considered new kinds of strategic offensive arms under the treaty. The New START Treaty allows for conventional warheads on ballistic missiles to be counted towards the treaty limits, but warheads on boost-glide systems like the Air Force's conventional strike missile would not be accountable under the treaty. Russia can question the classification of these systems, but the U.S. can continue development and deployment without delay. The deploying Party is obligated to resolve the issue within the Bilateral Consultative Commission framework. The New START Treaty does not require delaying deployment of new systems, such as the Navy's hypersonic glider and the Air Force's plans for missile-launched hypersonic gliders on heavy bombers. Under the treaty, bombers count as both a delivery vehicle and a warhead. Concern is growing about potential U.S. adversaries like Russia and China in the defense community. The defense community is concerned about potential U.S. adversaries, such as Russia and China, developing hypersonic boost-glide systems and cruise missiles. A study highlighted the challenges these programs pose for U.S. defense efforts, emphasizing the new offensive capabilities of high-speed maneuvering weapons. Michael Griffin, Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, noted the growing gap between U.S. and Chinese hypersonic weapons. The growing gap between U.S. and Chinese hypersonic weapons is a concern for the defense community. Without its own hypersonic weapons, the United States would be at a disadvantage if China were to attack with hypersonic missiles. Michael Griffin, Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, emphasized the need to develop systems to hold them at risk and provide defense. Members of Congress and Pentagon officials have also highlighted the lack of capability to defend against these missiles. The Defense Authorization Bill designates the Director of the Missile Defense Agency to develop a U.S. capability to counter hypersonic boost-glide vehicle capabilities. The Pentagon's FY2019 budget includes funding for space-based sensors to track hypersonic missiles. Concerns about Russian hypersonic weapons have escalated due to their testing of the Avangard hypersonic glider. In late December 2018, Russia tested its new Avangard hypersonic glider, launched from southwestern Russia to the Kamchatka Peninsula. The glider, impossible to intercept with existing anti-missile defenses, can maneuver past defenses but does not pose a new threat to the United States. Russia developed the Avangard hypersonic glider in response to the U.S. missile defense system. The Avangard can evade existing anti-missile defenses and poses a challenge to intercepting Russian long-range ballistic missiles. The United States lacks the capability to intercept sophisticated Russian ballistic missiles and may need to escalate to nuclear weapons in response to Chinese hypersonic attacks. However, the U.S. has various long-range strike options, providing a range of choices for a President in a conflict. The Pentagon justifies the development of U.S. hypersonic weapons for prompt attack against adversarial air defense capabilities, independent of an adversary's possession of such weapons. Michael Griffin highlighted concerns about the U.S. and Chinese hypersonic programs but stated the U.S. will remain the world leader in this research area by increasing investments. The United States plans to increase investments in research and prototyping for hypersonic weapons to maintain an edge over other countries. This competition in developing new technologies is not just about pending arms race but about enhancing capabilities for prompt global strike missions. Both the Bush and Obama Administrations supported deploying systems with long-range booster rockets for quick attacks anywhere in the world to support national security goals. The Trump Administration supports the development of hypersonic weapons for long-range attacks with conventional weapons to reduce reliance on nuclear weapons. Critics argue these weapons may provide excessive capability and raise the risk of misinterpretation. The ability to strike globally on short notice depends on precise information acquisition. The U.S. ability to acquire precise information about potential targets globally is crucial for launching long-range ballistic missiles. If this information is not available quickly, bombers may be used instead, allowing more time for intelligence gathering. The Government Accountability Office highlighted the need for critical enabling capabilities in global strike efforts. During the Cold War, analysts recognized the destabilizing effect of prompt global attack capabilities in a crisis. Nations may respond quickly without complete information, leading to potential escalation. Adversaries targeted by U.S. conventional prompt strike weapons could choose to use their capabilities swiftly to prevent them from being degraded or destroyed at the start of a conflict. During a crisis, nations may respond quickly without complete information, leading to potential escalation. Adversaries targeted by U.S. conventional prompt strike weapons could use their capabilities swiftly to prevent degradation or destruction at the start of a conflict. The question of whether the United States should accept the risks associated with potential misunderstandings and crisis instabilities can be viewed with a broader perspective. During a crisis, nations may respond quickly without complete information, leading to potential escalation. Adversaries targeted by U.S. conventional prompt strike weapons could use their capabilities swiftly to prevent degradation or destruction at the start of a conflict. The United States must consider the risks of waiting for other forces to arrive in theater versus the potential misunderstandings and crisis instabilities associated with launching long-range ballistic missiles. This has led to interest in deploying hypersonic weapons on bombers and intermediate-range land-based missiles for a prompt, precision response. Deploying hypersonic weapons on bombers and intermediate-range land-based missiles can provide a prompt, precision response while reducing the risk of ambiguity or misperception associated with long-range missiles. However, concerns about crisis stability arise with shorter-range prompt strike weapons that can maneuver to avoid defenses and change direction to conceal their targets, potentially leading to a quick escalation of conflict during a crisis."
