    "content": "The \"Lines Interfere with National Elections Act of 2012\" or the \"LINE Act of 2012\" establishes minimum requirements for voting systems and poll workers under Title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002. The \"LINE Act of 2012\" mandates that each State must provide the necessary voting systems, poll workers, and resources for each voting site during Federal elections. The term \"voting site\" refers to a polling location or precinct serving multiple precincts. States must comply with these requirements starting September 15, 2014. The \"LINE Act of 2012\" requires States to provide voting systems, poll workers, and resources for each voting site during Federal elections. States must comply with these requirements starting September 15, 2014. Amendments are made to the table of contents of the Act. Subtitle C of the \"LINE Act of 2012\" mandates minimum voting systems and poll worker standards under Subtitle E, with guidance and standards for establishing these requirements. The Attorney General, in coordination with the Commission, must issue standards by January 1, 2014, for the minimum voting systems, poll workers, and resources required on Federal election days and during early voting. These standards must ensure a fair distribution based on factors like voting age population, past voter turnout, and registered voters at each voting site. The standards for voting systems must consider factors such as the number of registered voters, new registrations since the last Federal election, census data for the population served, educational levels, socio-economic factors, disabled voters, voters with limited English proficiency, and the type of voting systems used. No single factor should be decisive, and the purpose is to consider all relevant factors in distributing voting systems. The standards for voting systems aim to ensure equal waiting times for all voters and prevent waits over 1 hour at polling places. States can deviate from allocation requirements in unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The text chunk adds a new paragraph to carry out duties described in subtitle E of the Act. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of contents of the Act. Subtitle E of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 introduces standards for voting systems and poll workers. Additionally, Title X addresses remedial plans for states with excessive voter wait times. Subtitle E of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 sets standards for voting systems and poll workers. States with excessive voter wait times must comply with a State remedial plan established by the Attorney General to minimize waiting times for voters. The term 'jurisdiction' is defined as 'registrar's jurisdiction' in the National Voter Registration Act. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 requires the Attorney General to publish a list of States and jurisdictions that must comply with a State remedial plan by March 1 following a Federal election. Governors of listed States must certify compliance by September 1. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is amended to include title X, and a clerical amendment is made to the table of contents of the Act. Title X of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 includes remedial plans for states with excessive voter wait times, with amendments taking effect upon enactment of the Act."
