    "content": "The \"Military Voting Protection Act of 2009\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section follows the short title. Congress finds that members of the United States Armed Forces are frequently deployed overseas and on ocean-going vessels, especially in the ongoing Global War on Terror. The right to vote is a fundamental right defended by the Armed Forces both at home and abroad, as decisions made by elected officials directly impact them. The ability of Armed Forces members to vote while serving overseas is hindered by various factors such as slow delivery of absentee ballots and confusing voting procedures. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act was enacted to protect their voting rights. The absentee voting system for overseas members of the Armed Forces needs improvement to reduce delays. Utilizing express mail services for ballot delivery could help address major sources of delay. SEC. 3. PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTION AND DELIVERY OF MARKED ABSENTEE BALLOTS OF ABSENT OVERSEAS UNIFORMED SERVICES VOTERS. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is amended to include new procedures for collecting and delivering marked absentee ballots of overseas uniformed services voters. The Presidential designee establishes procedures for collecting and delivering marked absentee ballots of absent overseas uniformed services voters in federal elections. The designee ensures timely delivery of ballots to election officials before the polls close. The Presidential designee utilizes express mail delivery services of the United States Postal Service to collect and deliver marked absentee ballots of absent overseas uniformed services voters in federal elections. The deadline for ballot collection is noon on the fourth day before the election, with the authority to establish alternative deadlines if necessary for timely delivery. The Presidential designee may establish alternative deadlines for ballot delivery in remote locations to ensure timely delivery. A tracking mechanism will be implemented to allow individuals to determine if their absentee ballot has been delivered. The Presidential designee can use various methods to confirm ballot delivery, including the Internet or automated telephone systems. They must also inform overseas uniformed services voters of absentee ballot procedures and submit reports on procedure utilization after each general election. The Presidential designee must submit a report to Congress after each general election on the utilization of procedures for collecting and delivering marked absentee ballots. The report should include details on the number of ballots collected and delivered, as well as the reasons for any ballots not delivered by the closing of polls. The term 'relevant committees of Congress' includes specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. An 'absent overseas uniformed services voter' is defined as an overseas voter. Appropriations are authorized for the Presidential designee to carry out this section. This section applies to the effective date. The section applies to the regularly scheduled general election for Federal office in November 2010 and subsequent elections. It includes amendments for Federal and State responsibilities related to the collection and delivery of marked absentee ballots for overseas uniformed services voters in Federal office elections. The amendment to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act includes State responsibilities for processing marked absentee ballots of overseas uniformed services voters. A report on the implementation status is required within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report on the implementation of the program for collecting and delivering marked absentee ballots, as required by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, must include details of steps taken for implementation in November 2010. Relevant committees of Congress are defined in the Act. SEC. 4. PROTECTING VOTER PRIVACY AND SECRECY OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS. Section 101(b) of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is amended to ensure that absent uniformed services voters can cast absentee ballots privately and independently, and to protect the privacy of the contents of absentee ballots."
