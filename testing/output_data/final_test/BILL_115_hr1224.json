    "content": "The Act titled \"NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Assessment, and Auditing Act of 2017\" emphasizes addressing cybersecurity threats by engineering security from the beginning of an information system's life cycle. It also focuses on building trustworthy and secure components and systems, as well as applying security design principles throughout. The Act includes the implementation of a framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. The Institute will promote the implementation of the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity by Federal agencies. Guidance will be provided to incorporate the Framework into information security risk management efforts, aligning with existing agency practices. The curr_chunk discusses the need to identify areas of conflict or overlap between the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity and existing cybersecurity requirements. It also includes a template for Federal agencies on how to use the Framework and recommends procedures for streamlining and harmonizing cybersecurity-related requirements. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Assessment, and Auditing Act of 2017 requires the Institute to recommend procedures for compliance with cybersecurity reporting, oversight, and policy review requirements. It also mandates the establishment of a Federal working group to address cybersecurity issues. The Federal working group, established by the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Assessment, and Auditing Act of 2017, is tasked with developing outcome-based metrics for assessing the effectiveness of the Framework in protecting federal information systems. They will update these metrics as needed, compile information on agency use of the Framework, and assist in oversight and policy review. The Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will assist in publishing the annual report on agency adoption rates and the effectiveness of the Framework. They will use information compiled by the Federal working group for this report. \"SEC. 20B. CYBERSECURITY AUDITS.\" The NIST Cybersecurity Framework requires an initial assessment of agencies' cybersecurity preparedness based on information security standards. This assessment includes agencies listed in section 901(b) of title 31, US Code, and any agency reporting a major incident. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework mandates audits of agencies' cybersecurity preparedness, excluding national security systems. Within 6 months of enactment, the Institute must create an audit plan detailing staffing, methods, coordination with agencies, and audit completion timeframes. The plan will be shared with congressional entities. Audits must be conducted within 6 months of the requirement. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework requires audits of agencies' cybersecurity compliance. Within 6 months of enactment, audits will be initiated to assess agencies' adherence to information security standards. Audits will be informed by agency adoption rates and the effectiveness of the Framework. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework mandates audits of agencies' cybersecurity compliance based on guidance and metrics. Audits must be completed within specific timeframes, with high-risk agencies audited annually and others every two years. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework requires audits of agencies' cybersecurity compliance, to be conducted biennially after the enactment of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Assessment, and Auditing Act of 2017. Reports of these audits are to be transmitted to various entities including the Office of Management and Budget, Congress, and relevant agency officials."
