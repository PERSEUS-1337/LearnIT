The Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 1999 holds air carriers liable for departure or arrival delays exceeding 3 hours. The liability includes the amount determined under subparagraph (A) plus an additional 100 percent of the price paid by the passenger multiplied by the number of hours exceeding 3. Excessive departure or arrival delay is defined as a period exceeding 2 hours from the closing of the aircraft door to takeoff.

If a flight is canceled for non-safety reasons, the carrier must provide timely transportation to the destination and refund the passenger. Airlines must notify the Secretary of Transportation in writing if they cancel a flight. The Secretary of Transportation must be informed in writing within 30 days of a flight cancellation, including details like flight number, date, time of departure, and percentage of seats filled. The Secretary will review this information to identify any patterns of specific flight cancellations or undersold flights by air carriers. The Secretary of Transportation will investigate if an air carrier cancels specific flights or undersold flights to determine if it's for reasons other than safety. If found guilty, the carrier must refund passengers for the canceled flight. The Secretary of Transportation will investigate if an air carrier cancels specific flights or undersold flights to determine if it's for reasons other than safety. If found guilty, the carrier must refund passengers for the canceled flight, even if the carrier provided the air transportation. Undersold flights are defined as flights where 70 percent or more of the seats are not purchased before a certain date. Flights shall not be considered canceled for reasons other than safety if there is an insufficient number of crew, weather issues, or mechanical problems preventing safe operation. In accordance with FAA regulations, air carriers must make efforts to return lost baggage with the owner's name. Security screenings at airports must not separate children under 2 from their parents without consent. Code sharing for flights in the US requires informing customers of the operating carrier. An air carrier must disclose if another carrier will provide the flight, and cannot restrict the use of purchased air transportation. Additionally, they cannot charge extra fees for using only a portion of the purchased air transportation. An air carrier must disclose the availability of seats for award redemption under a frequent flyer program. The Secretary may issue regulations to implement this requirement. SEC. 3. CIVIL PENALTIES for air carrier passenger protection include regulations for disclosing seat availability under frequent flyer programs. Section 46301(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include maximum penalties for violations related to air service termination notices, single flight number requirements, and explanations of delays, cancellations, and diversions. The maximum civil penalty for an air carrier violating section 41716(b) with respect to a flight shall be determined by multiplying the maximum amount of a civil penalty by the number of passengers who paid for transportation on the flight. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study to determine if air carriers are providing sufficient supervision for unaccompanied children under 12 during plane changes. A report on the study results must be submitted to Congress within 1 year of the Act's enactment."
