    "content": "The September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States led insurers to start excluding or charging separately for terrorism coverage due to the significant losses incurred. Insured losses from the 9/11 attacks exceeded $40 billion, with the highest losses in business interruption insurance, property insurance, and liability insurance. Reinsurers, who insure insurance companies, bore the heaviest losses as they struggled to accurately price terrorism risks without sufficient data or modeling. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reinsurers struggled to accurately price terrorism risks and withdrew from the market for terrorism risk insurance. This led primary insurers to also withdraw or attempt to withdraw from the market due to a lack of public data and models. State regulators approved insurer requests to exclude terrorism risks from commercial policies, making terrorism risk insurance unavailable or extremely expensive. Many businesses were left unable to purchase insurance to protect them from future terrorist attacks, posing a threat to industries such as real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utilities. Following the 9/11 attacks, the lack of terrorism risk insurance availability posed a threat to various sectors like real estate, transportation, construction, energy, and utilities. In response, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) in 2002 to provide a government reinsurance backstop. The TRIA program was extended in 2005 and 2007, but is set to expire in 2014. The executive branch has shown skepticism towards the program in the past. The TRIA program, established after 9/11, faces potential changes under President Obama's budgets. While the insurance industry and some commercial consumers support TRIA, others like the Consumer Federation of America question its necessity. The FY2015 budget proposes extending TRIA with reforms to limit taxpayer exposure, but specifics are not provided. The program's future is uncertain despite past acts of terror like the Boston bombing in April 2013. The President termed the Boston bombing an \"act of terror,\" but whether it falls under TRIA depends on certification by the Secretary of the Treasury, Attorney General, and Secretary of State. The Massachusetts Department of Insurance found insured losses from the bombing to be below the $5 million threshold for TRIA coverage. H.R. 508, introduced by Representative Michael Grimm, seeks to reauthorize TRIA for five more years and extend the deadline for mandatory recoupment. H.R. 1945, introduced by Representative Bennie Thompson, aims to extend the TRIA program until 2024, with the Secretary of Homeland Security as the lead authority for certifying acts of terrorism. H.R. 2146, introduced by Representative Michael Capuano, is also related to TRIA reauthorization. Michael Capuano introduced H.R. 2146 on May 23, 2013, to reauthorize the existing TRIA program for 10 years, until the end of 2024. The bill also extends the deadline for mandatory recoupment until September 30, 2027. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets will continue filing reports on market conditions in 2017, 2020, and 2023. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. Senator Charles Schumer introduced S. 2244 on April 10, 2014, to extend the current TRIA program for seven years, until December 31, 2021, with changes to federal loss sharing and industry retention/recoupment amounts. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs marked up S. 2244 on June 3, 2014. The Senate Committee marked up S. 2244 on June 3, 2014, amending it and passing it on July 17, 2014. The bill would decrease federal loss sharing gradually, increase insurance marketplace retention amount, extend mandatory recoupment dates, and create an advisory committee on risk-sharing mechanisms. Additionally, it includes provisions for a study on improving certification processes and upfront premiums. The bill H.R. 4871, introduced by Representative Randy Neugebauer, aims to extend the TRIA program for five years with changes to reduce government exposure to future losses. It includes provisions such as gradually reducing federal share of losses, increasing program trigger amount, and raising the maximum mandatory recoupment amount. The House Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 4871 on June 19, 2014, with changes including an increase in mandatory recoupment to 150% of federal share of losses and separate treatment for NCBR terrorist attacks. A second title was added containing the text of H.R. 1155. The House Committee on Financial Services marked up H.R. 4871 with changes including an increase in mandatory recoupment to 150% of federal share of losses and separate treatment for NCBR terrorist attacks. Representative Maxine Waters' substitute amendment for a 10-year reauthorization of the current program was voted down 27-31. Hearings on terrorism insurance have been held by the House and Senate Committees on Financial Services and Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) was enacted on September 19, 2013, with the goal of creating a federal program to compensate for insured terrorism losses and stabilize the private market. The program has undergone amendments, including expanding coverage to domestic terrorism. The federal government shares insured commercial property/casualty losses with the private insurance market to achieve this goal. The federal government's role in sharing insured property/casualty losses with the private insurance market under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) depends on the size of the loss. For small losses, there is no federal sharing, for medium losses, the federal government spreads the loss over time and recoups payments through a levy on insurance policies, and for large losses, the federal government pays most of the losses. Criteria for federal sharing include certification of an act of terrorism by specific government officials and losses exceeding $5 million. The federal government shares in an insurer's losses due to a certified act of terrorism only if the aggregate industry insured losses exceed $100 million. The federal program covers commercial property and casualty insurance, with each insurer responsible for a deductible equal to 20% of their annual direct earned premiums. Once the $100 million threshold and deductible are met, the government covers 85% of losses above the deductible until $100 billion, after which there is no federal coverage. The federal government shares insurer losses for certified acts of terrorism if industry losses exceed $100 million. Insurers have a 20% deductible on direct earned premiums. The government covers 85% of losses above the deductible until $100 billion, with no coverage beyond that. The Secretary of the Treasury may establish surcharges to recoup losses, but it is not mandatory. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) covers losses up to $36 billion, with recoupment provisions in place for attacks resulting in under $27.5 billion in insured losses. The Treasury Secretary may recoup 133% of government outlays through surcharges on insurance policies for smaller attacks, and has discretionary authority for larger events. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires mandatory recoupment of government outlays for attacks based on insured losses. The administration of the program was initially under the Treasury Secretary but was later shared with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) aims to assist the Secretary in administering the Terrorism Insurance Program. It requires insurers to offer terrorism insurance to commercial policyholders, with details on premiums and federal compensation. Policyholders are not obligated to purchase coverage, and insurers can exclude terrorism losses if coverage is declined. State regulators can adjust insurance rates. TRIA also aims to preserve state regulation of insurance. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) aims to preserve state regulation of insurance by allowing state insurance commissioners to maintain regulatory authority. The law preempts state definitions of \"act of terrorism\" and insurance policy exclusions for terrorism, while also preempting state rate and form approval laws for terrorism insurance until the end of 2003. The current TRIA statute does not specifically include or exclude events involving NCBR weapons, leaving coverage for such events under the TRIA program uncertain. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) covers insured losses from terrorist actions, including NCBR events. However, most insurance policies have exclusions that may limit coverage for NCBR events. Specific language to extend TRIA coverage to NCBR events has not been included in legislation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was directed to study the issue in 2007. H.R. 4871 proposes higher federal cost sharing and a lower program trigger for NCBR attacks, but does not address NCBR exclusions. Insurance involves assuming future risks for current premiums, pooling risks to prevent losses exceeding premiums, and accurately estimating loss probabilities to avoid bankruptcy. To avoid bankruptcy, insurers rely on past loss data to estimate loss probabilities accurately. While everyday occurrences can be predicted with precision, extraordinary events like large hurricanes are more challenging but can be forecasted using weather data and computer models. Terrorism risk is considered fundamentally different and often deemed uninsurable by private insurers due to a lack of public data on the probability and severity of terrorist acts. Insurers use models to assess terrorism risk due to lack of historical data. Insurable risks require predictability, measurability, fortuitousness, and non-catastrophic nature. Terrorism risk in the United States is unlikely to meet criteria for insurability due to malevolent human actors and constantly changing motives. Insurers limit exposure in high-risk areas, making terrorism insurance harder to find. Other countries have more experience with terrorism and have developed their own responses. Countries like Spain and the United Kingdom have developed specific responses to terrorism risk. Spain uses a government-owned reinsurer for coverage since 1954, while the UK created Pool Re after IRA attacks. Other countries, like Germany, also have their own approaches, such as creating a private insurer with government support. The United States created a temporary terrorism insurance measure that has been extended and is set to expire in 2015. Canada considered but rejected a government program after 9/11. Congress has historically addressed uninsurable risks through government action, such as during World War II and with current programs for aviation war risk and flood losses. The federal riot reinsurance program in the late 1960s is a previous analog to the terrorism risk situation. In the late 1960s, insurers pulled back from insuring cities due to riots, leading Congress to create a riot reinsurance program. This program offered coverage above a deductible in exchange for a premium. Private reinsurers later returned to the market, and the federal program ended in 1985. The September 2001 terrorist attacks caused upheaval in the insurance market, with significant insured losses. The insurance market experienced a \"hardening\" trend post-September 11 due to large losses from terrorist acts. Insurers and reinsurers started adding surcharges for terrorism risk or excluding coverage altogether. Reinsurers could act quickly, while states regulated primary insurance contracts more closely, requiring approval for terrorism coverage exclusions. By early 2002, 45 states had approved insurance policy language changes. The lack of terrorism insurance coverage post-September 11 led to economic concerns, especially in the real estate market. Lenders require insurance on properties, and without terrorism coverage, defaults on loans and a decrease in future lending could occur. The period between September 2001 and November 2002 highlighted the impact, with $15.5 billion in real estate projects stalled or canceled. The aftermath of September 11 led to economic worries, particularly in the real estate sector. $15.5 billion worth of real estate projects in 17 states were halted due to a lack of terrorism insurance. Despite concerns, trophy properties remained in demand. The Congressional Budget Office found that TRIA had minimal impact on office construction and commercial loans, but noted potential positive effects masked by economic factors at the time. TRIA's \"make available\" provisions aimed to address the insurance availability issue. The terrorism insurance market faced uncertainty as insurers were required to offer coverage, but businesses were not mandated to purchase it initially. Marsh, Inc. reported a gradual increase in the uptake rate of terrorism insurance from 27% in 2003 to 62% in 2012. Pricing for terrorism insurance has shown a decline over the past decade. The 2013 report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets highlighted a decreasing trend in terrorism premiums, with median values dropping from above 7% in 2003 to around 3%. Aon, a major insurance broker, provided these figures. While there has been variability across industries, insurers have shown increased willingness and financial capability to cover terrorism risks over the past decade. Recent estimates from the insurance broker Guy Carpenter show that $6-8 billion in terrorism reinsurance capacity is available in the U.S. market. The policyholder surplus among U.S. property/casualty insurers was $674.0 billion in 2013, up from $293.5 billion in 2002. Extreme weather losses could compete with terrorism insurance market capital, as they share similar risk characteristics. Tables compare the original TRIA law with reauthorizing laws, and provide examples of government recoupment for terrorism losses. The government recoupment for terrorism losses under TRIA is calculated in the aggregate for various sizes of losses. The deductible is assumed to be 30% of insured losses for illustrative purposes. The law defines the \"insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount\" as the lesser of $27.5 billion or total insured losses. The \"mandatory recoupment amount\" is the difference between $27.5 billion and aggregate insurer losses not compensated by the program. The law requires recoupment of government outlays for insured losses under TRIA, with mandatory amounts decreasing for losses over $27.5 billion. The Secretary retains discretionary authority to apply recoupment surcharges regardless of uncompensated industry losses reaching $27.5 billion."
