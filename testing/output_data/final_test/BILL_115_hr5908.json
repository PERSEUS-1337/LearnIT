Aliens facing removal proceedings can receive a stay of removal or abeyance if they have filed a workplace claim, are a witness in a workplace claim proceeding, or have applied for relief under section 101(a)(15)(U), along with employment authorization until the resolution of the claim. The Department can establish, by evidence before the immigration judge, that a stay of removal or abeyance can be revoked if the alien has been convicted of a felony or if the workplace claim was filed in bad faith to delay or avoid removal. The authorization issued under clause (i) remains valid until the resolution of the workplace claim or denial of relief under section 101(a)(15)(U). The Secretary of Homeland Security can extend it for up to 3 additional years if it enables the alien to pursue the claim, serves the deterrent goals of the statute, or if relief is warranted. In this paragraph, the term 'material witness' is defined as an individual who presents a declaration from an attorney investigating, prosecuting, or defending the workplace claim, attesting to the best of the declarant's knowledge. To the best of the declarant's knowledge and belief, reasonable cause exists to believe that the testimony of the individual will be relevant to the outcome of the workplace claim, which includes any written or oral claim related to the violation of labor laws. Labor laws cover various aspects such as wages, hours, labor relations, family and medical leave, occupational health and safety, civil rights, and nondiscrimination. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out this Act and its amendments."
