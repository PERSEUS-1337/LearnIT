    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Compliance Act of 2011\" and includes definitions for clarity. The \"Fair Compliance Act of 2011\" defines key terms such as Administrator and Affected owner or operator related to emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, as defined in the \"Fair Compliance Act of 2011.\" SEC. 3. COMPLIANCE PERIOD FOR UTILITY MACT STANDARDS. Extension of Compliance Date for emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from electric utility steam generating units based on the proposed rule \"National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units\" (76 Fed. Reg. 24976 (May 3, 2011)). The extension period for compliance with emissions standards is at least an additional 2 years after the 3-year compliance period under the Clean Air Act. This section does not affect the authority to extend compliance schedules for emissions standards. SEC. 4. Compliance period for cross-state air pollution rule. Extension of Compliance Date for Emissions Reductions of Sulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxides from Electric Utility Steam Generating Units under the Clean Air Act. The Administrator shall provide adequate time for States to adopt and submit plan revisions for implementation, extending the deadline for emissions reductions until January 1, 2015. The compliance date for emissions reductions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from electric utility steam generating units is extended until January 1, 2017 for the second phase. This extension does not modify the emissions reduction requirements established by the rule. SEC. 5. EXPEDITIOUS IMPLEMENTATION OF EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. Each affected owner or operator must develop and submit an implementation plan for emissions reduction requirements by December 1, 2012. The plan should include all electric utility steam generating units and designate units for retirement or continued operation until December 31, 2018. The implementation plan must include a schedule for units designated for retirement or continued operation, with proposed dates for ceasing operations or implementing control measures to achieve emissions reductions requirements. The plan should not impair compliance with the specified requirements. The implementation plan must include a schedule for units designated for retirement or continued operation, with proposed dates for ceasing operations or implementing control measures to achieve emissions reductions requirements. The schedule should ensure the reliability of the local or regional electricity system. The affected owner or operator must provide a description of control measures, intermediate milestones, and proposed completion dates to comply with emissions reduction requirements. Each affected owner or operator must submit a draft implementation plan to the Electric Reliability Organization by July 1, 2012. The ERO will review the plans for feasibility and assess the combined implementation efforts. The Electric Reliability Organization will review draft implementation plans from affected owners/operators by July 1, 2012. The review will assess the combined implementation efforts' impacts on the bulk power system's reliability and adequacy, recommending revisions if necessary to ensure system reliability. ERO will consult with stakeholders for any modifications to the draft plan. The Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) will consult with affected owners/operators to develop revisions to draft implementation plans to address recommendations for system reliability. Consultations will be completed promptly to facilitate timely finalization of the plans. The Secretary must publish the final implementation plan within 60 days of receiving the draft plan. An annual report on progress in implementing emissions control measures must be submitted by March 31, 2015, and annually through 2018 to ensure electricity system reliability. Annual Reports are required to be submitted by affected owners or operators who have submitted an implementation plan, detailing progress made in implementing the plan, including milestones achieved and any deviations from the schedule. Adjustments to the implementation plan can be made if necessary. If a modification to the retirement date or control measure completion date is needed, the owner or operator can request a schedule change in the implementation plan. The modified schedule must be developed, reviewed, and approved in the same way as the initial plan."
