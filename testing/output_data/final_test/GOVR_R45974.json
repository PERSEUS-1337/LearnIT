    "content": "Congress passed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-94) on December 20, 2019, which included Agriculture appropriations in Division B. The House and Senate passed minibus appropriations bills earlier in the year, with Agriculture in Division B. The Administration released its budget request in March 2019. The FY2020 Agriculture appropriations act, with a total of $23.5 billion in discretionary spending, was set after the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised caps on discretionary spending. This amount is $183 million more than FY2019. The appropriation also includes about $129 billion of mandatory spending determined by authorizing laws. The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act funds the USDA and FDA, with jurisdiction under the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Discretionary spending is the primary focus, with some programs outside the authorizing jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committees. The budget process treats discretionary and mandatory spending differently. Discretionary spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and receives most attention during the appropriations process. Mandatory spending is carried in the appropriation and usually advanced unchanged. In the FY2020 appropriation, the discretionary amount is 15% of the total, while mandatory spending comprises about 85% of the total. Within the discretionary total, agency operations and grant programs are included. The largest spending items within the discretionary total of the 2018 farm bill include WIC, agricultural research, rural development, FDA, foreign food aid and trade, farm assistance loans and salaries, food safety inspection, animal and plant health programs, and technical assistance for conservation programs. Mandatory spending items consist of SNAP, child nutrition programs, crop insurance, and farm commodity and conservation programs funded through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. SNAP requires an annual appropriation, while CCC appropriations reimburse spending from a line of credit. Discretionary Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010 and declined thereafter. Discretionary Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010, declined through FY2013, and have gradually increased since then. Changes within titles have generally been proportionate to changes in the overall bill, with some areas sustaining relative increases, such as FDA and rural development. In FY2018, USDA reorganization affected the placement of some programs between Titles I and II of the bill. The cumulative appropriation for agencies is usually higher than the official discretionary total due to negative offsets from rescissions in Title VII and other adjustments. The Trump Administration released its FY2020 budget request, including reductions in Agriculture appropriations by $4.1 billion (-18%). USDA, FDA, CFTC, and Farm Credit Administration also provided detailed budget justifications. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request includes a $4.1 billion reduction in Agriculture appropriations (-18%). Budget enforcement involves procedural and statutory elements, with discretionary spending limits enforced through budget caps and sequestration. Appropriations Committees receive top-line limits on discretionary budget authority for allocation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set discretionary budget caps through FY2021 to reduce federal spending. Bipartisan Budget Acts have raised the caps four times in 2013, 2015, 2018, and 2019 to avoid sequestration. The BBA of 2019 raised the cap on nondefense discretionary spending for FY2020 by $78 billion. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the cap on nondefense discretionary spending for FY2020 by $78 billion, totaling $627 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees set their subcommittee allocations accordingly, with the Senate allocation slightly higher at $23.1 billion. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY2020 bill on May 23, 2019, and the full Appropriations Committee passed an amended bill on June 4, 2019. The House later passed a five-bill minibus appropriation on June 25, 2019. On June 25, 2019, the House passed a five-bill minibus appropriation (H.R. 3055) with the Agriculture bill as Division B. The Rules Committee allowed 35 amendments for floor debate, of which 31 were adopted. The House-passed FY2020 Agriculture appropriation totaled $24.3 billion, $1 billion more than FY2019. The House-passed FY2020 Agriculture appropriation totaled $24.3 billion, $1 billion more than FY2019. Key changes included a $412 million increase for Rural Development accounts, a $393 million increase for the ReConnect Broadband Pilot Program, and a $377 million increase for foreign agricultural assistance. In FY2020, the House passed a $24.3 billion Agriculture appropriation, with key increases in various programs. This included a $25 million increase for Food for Education, $232 million for related agencies, $151 million for other agricultural programs, and a net decrease of $134 million for agricultural research. Additionally, there were increases for FDA, CFTC, departmental administration accounts, USDA regulatory programs, and USDA headquarters renovation.

The discretionary total would have been $57 million more than the amount enacted for FY2019. The Senate-passed FY2020 Agriculture appropriation bill was $57 million more than FY2019. It did not include most of the proposed reductions by the Administration. Key changes included increases in agricultural research and ARS buildings and facilities, while NIFA saw a decrease in funding. The Senate bill for FY2020 Agriculture appropriations would have increased administration accounts by $97 million compared to the House bill. Rural Development funding in the Senate-passed bill would have been $407 million less than in the House-passed bill, with significant reductions for the Rural Utilities Service, Rural Housing Service, and Rural Business-Cooperative Service. The ReConnect Broadband Pilot Program would not have received any funding in the Senate bill. The Senate-passed bill for FY2020 Agriculture appropriations would have significantly reduced foreign agricultural assistance, FDA appropriations, and mandatory spending compared to the House bill. The bill also included lower amounts for child nutrition programs and SNAP. In FY2020, Congress passed a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) to fund Agriculture operations until a full-year appropriation was signed in December 2019. The CRs maintained funding rates and conditions from the previous year's appropriation, with the Office of Management and Budget prorating funding to agencies. In FY2020, CRs continued FY2019 Agriculture appropriations with provisions for rural development and sufficient funding for mandatory program levels, including nutrition programs. Five anomalies applied specifically to the Agriculture appropriation during the first CR, such as covering the cost of direct loans and amending eligible losses for Disaster Assistance for Sugar Beet Processors. Amended the list of eligible losses for Sugar Beet Processors under the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act of FY2019 to include payments for reduced sugar beet quantity and quality. Allowed USDA to waive the nonfederal matching funds requirement for grants under the Specialty Crop Research Initiative. Allocated funding for summer food for children demonstration projects to fully operate by May 2020. The FY2020 CR included provisions to ensure timely payments to farmers, such as allowing the Commodity Credit Corporation to receive its appropriation early to avoid exhausting its line of credit before completing an audit. Additionally, USDA was required to submit a report to Congress with details on Market Facilitation Program payments and trade damages by October 31, 2019. The FY2020 CR included provisions for timely payments to farmers, including details on Market Facilitation Program payments and trade damages. It also provided funding for the Hemp Production Program and the Commodity Assistance Program. The second CR extended terms until December 20, 2019, with additional funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. Congress later passed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2020. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-94) included Agriculture appropriations totaling $23.5 billion for FY2020, with an additional $129 billion in mandatory spending. Emergency spending of $535 million for FDA and $1.5 billion for Ebola prevention was also included. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-94) allocated $23.5 billion for FY2020 Agriculture appropriations, with $535 million for FDA for Ebola prevention and $1.5 billion for USDA's Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program. The increase in foreign agricultural assistance by $235 million includes a boost in Food for Peace humanitarian aid by $225 million. The FY2020 Agriculture appropriations include increases in Rural Development accounts by $229 million, with significant boosts for the Rural Utilities Service and Rural Housing Service. Additionally, there is a $175 million increase for a rural broadband pilot program. Other agricultural program appropriations see a $199 million increase, with funding for USDA headquarters renovation and regulatory programs. FDA appropriations are raised by $91 million, and the CFTC by $47 million. Increase USDA regulatory programs by $59 million, with boosts for Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Agricultural Marketing Service. Decrease agricultural research by $18 million. ARS construction reduced by $189 million, while salaries and expenses are increased. Increase Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses by $47 million. Increase Natural Resources Conservation Service appropriations by $35 million. Decrease Food and Nutrition Service discretionary appropriations by $54 million. The budget changes include a decrease in WIC by $75 million (-1%) and an increase in Commodity Assistance Programs by $22 million (+7%). The General Provisions title shows a net change of -$570 million, mainly due to greater rescissions in WIC and the absence of continuing FY2019 appropriations for Food for Peace and rural water and waste disposal grants. Additionally, there are increases in funding for rural broadband and miscellaneous programs. Emergency funding for Ebola and the Wildfires and Hurricanes Indemnity Program is also included. The House-passed bill includes $1.5 billion for the WHIP program, with mandatory spending totaling $129 billion. Reimbursement to the Treasury for the CCC increased by $10.9 billion, child nutrition programs increased by $0.5 billion, while crop insurance and SNAP spending decreased. Appropriations acts also include policy-related provisions directing executive branch actions. Appropriations acts include policy-related provisions that direct executive branch actions, with limitations having the force of law for the current fiscal year. Report language may provide policy instructions, explaining congressional intent for agencies to follow. Joint explanatory statements and committee reports are essential for capturing all congressional intent for a fiscal year. The joint explanatory statement for the FY2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations act clarifies that the House and Senate reports should be read together with the conference agreement to understand congressional directives. It emphasizes that unchanged report language indicates congressional intentions and provides appendices on appropriations and budget sequestration. Budget sequestration is a process to reduce federal spending through automatic, across-the-board reductions triggered when spending exceeds budget goals. Sequestration rates are calculated annually by OMB, with specific details provided in tables for Agriculture appropriations. Sequestration is authorized through FY2021 for discretionary defense and nondefense spending. Sequestration is authorized through FY2021 for discretionary defense and nondefense spending if spending exceeds specified caps. In FY2013, sequestration was triggered on discretionary spending. BBAs in FY2014-FY2019 raised budget caps, avoiding sequestration. The BBA of 2019 for FY2020-FY2021 may also prevent sequestration on discretionary spending. Mandatory spending sequestration continues through FY2029, extended multiple times to offset raising discretionary spending caps. Congress has extended sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts multiple times, with the latest extension until FY2029 as an offset in BBA 2019. Some USDA mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration, including nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program. Sequestration affects agriculture programs, with crop insurance mostly exempt but farm commodity programs subject to it. In FY2020, nonexempt mandatory spending faces a 5.9% reduction, resulting in about $1.4 billion cut from agriculture accounts, including over $900 million from the CCC. Farm income support programs like Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage are impacted, reducing final payments to farmers. Sequestration affects agriculture programs, with crop insurance mostly exempt but farm commodity programs subject to it. The sequestration rate is applied to the available budget authority for programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Market Assistance Program."
