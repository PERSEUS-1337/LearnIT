The \"Small Business Investment and Growth Act\" includes a provision for the S Corporation tax rate, limiting the tax imposed on taxable S corporation income to a maximum of 34 percent. The \"Small Business Investment and Growth Act\" sets a tax rate of 34 percent on qualified taxable S corporation income exceeding $5,000,000. The term 'taxable S corporation income' is defined as the taxable income of the taxpayer for any taxable year, with certain limitations on capital expenditures. The term 'eligible S corporation' refers to an S corporation that is not a personal service corporation or a personal holding company. A 'qualified personal service corporation' is defined as per section 448(d)(2). Each S corporation must establish a qualified retained earnings account that is adjusted annually based on taxable income or loss from active business activities. The S corporation must establish a qualified retained earnings account that is adjusted annually based on taxable income or loss from active business activities. Qualified distributions from this account are made to owners of the S corporation to help them pay income taxes on the corporation's income. Regulations may be issued by the Secretary to provide further guidance on these distributions. The S corporation must establish a qualified retained earnings account to make distributions to owners for income tax payments. Regulations may establish a presumption for distributions not exceeding 34% of qualified taxable income. Distributions within 75 days after the end of the taxable year may be treated as made on the last day of the year. Additional tax may apply to nonqualified distributions. The S corporation must establish a qualified retained earnings account for distributions. Additional tax may apply to nonqualified distributions from the account. The S corporation must establish a qualified retained earnings account for distributions. Additional tax may apply to nonqualified distributions based on the taxpayer's pro rata share and the difference between the highest tax rate and 34 percent. Distributions are treated on a last-in, first-out basis from the qualified retained earnings account. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 1997. The Secretary will create regulations to prevent mischaracterization of distributions from qualified retained earnings."
