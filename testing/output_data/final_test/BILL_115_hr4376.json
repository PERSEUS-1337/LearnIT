    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act of 2018\" and includes an upgrade for the Advanced Light Source. The Secretary of Energy will upgrade the Advanced Light Source to include a multi-bend achromat lattice for high flux of coherent soft x-rays. Operations should start before December 31, 2026, with funding authorized for completion. The Secretary for the Office of Science will receive funding for the upgrade of the Advanced Light Source as follows: $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019, $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2020, $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2021, $52,000,000 for fiscal year 2022, $22,000,000 for fiscal year 2023, and $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2024. SEC. 3. LINAC COHERENT LIGHT SOURCE II HIGH ENERGY UPGRADE. The Secretary of Energy will upgrade the Linac Coherent Light Source II facility to develop experimental capabilities for high energy x-rays, enabling the production of high energy, ultra-short pulse x-rays at a high repetition rate. Definitions include high energy x-rays exceeding 12 kiloelectron volts, high repetition rate up to one million pulses per second, and ultra-short pulse x-rays. The Secretary of Energy will upgrade the Linac Coherent Light Source II facility to develop experimental capabilities for high energy x-rays, enabling the production of ultra-short pulse x-rays with durations of less than 100 femtoseconds. The start of full operations of the upgrade is targeted before December 31, 2025, with authorized funding amounts allocated for fiscal years 2018 to 2023. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams will be upgraded to develop experimental capabilities for high energy x-rays, enabling the production of ultra-short pulse x-rays with durations of less than 100 femtoseconds. The Secretary of Energy will establish a Facility for Rare Isotope Beams to study rare nuclear isotopes and the cosmos. The facility will have capabilities including a rare isotope beam facility with 400 kW of beam power and scientific instruments like a gamma-ray energy tracking array. Operations should start before June 30, 2022, with funding authorized for completion. The Secretary for the Office of Science will receive funding for the completion of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams as follows: \n- $101,200,000 for fiscal year 2018\n- $86,000,000 for fiscal year 2019\n- $64,000,000 for fiscal year 2020\n- $36,300,000 for fiscal year 2021\n- $24,000,000 for fiscal year 2022\n- $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2023\n- $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2024. SEC. 5. SPENDING LIMITATION. No additional funds authorized for this Act and amendments. Use available amounts."
