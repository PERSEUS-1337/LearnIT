    "title": "AB 1571",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 11837 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to restrict driving privileges for individuals convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, requiring participation in a licensed program for at least 18 months. In determining whether to refer a person to a licensed alcohol and other drug education program, the court may consider relevant information from a presentence investigation or other screening procedure. Information cannot be provided by someone with a direct interest in a privately operated program. The court must also obtain the person's driving record from the Department of Motor Vehicles to determine eligibility. The probation department may consider placing the defendant in a treatment program that includes nonscheduled nonaddicting medications for alcohol or substance abuse. The defendant must obtain a prescription and medical suitability finding from their physician before the court can consider this option. The court must refer first-time offenders with a blood alcohol concentration below 0.20% to a licensed program for at least three months, consisting of 30 hours of activities including education, group counseling, and individual interviews. In cases where a first-time offender's blood alcohol concentration is 0.20% or more, or if they refuse a chemical test, the court must order participation in a licensed program for at least nine months with 60 hours of program activities. The State Department of Health Care Services may specify required treatment activities for participants in the program. Any program licensed under this chapter can offer treatment services to participants who have received at least six months of program services under specific sections of the Vehicle Code. For second or subsequent violations, the court must refer the individual to a licensed program as a condition of probation, even if their driving privileges are restricted, suspended, or revoked. An 18-month or 30-month program under the Vehicle Code may include treatment for family members and significant others with their consent, without increasing costs to the convicted person. The court must indicate the program duration in the record for individuals ordered to participate. If probation is granted under Section 23536 of the Vehicle Code, a fine of $390 to $1,000 must be paid, along with possible jail time of 48 hours to six months. The court may suspend a person's driver's license if they are deemed a traffic or public safety risk during the suspension period. The court can also disallow the issuance of a restricted driver's license in certain circumstances. The court may impose a probation condition for a driver to enroll in a DUI program within 30 days of conviction and complete it after the violation date. No credit is given for activities before the violation. Extensions up to 30 days may be granted for enrollment. The court may grant an extension of up to 30 days for enrollment in a DUI program upon request from the program provider, which can be done by telephone or electronic means. The court mandates first-time offenders with different blood-alcohol concentrations to participate in licensed programs for a specified duration, including education, counseling, and interviews. Offenders with higher concentrations or those who refuse testing must attend a longer program. For first-time offenders, a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08% or more, along with certain controlled substances, can lead to enhanced probation terms regarding program participation. The court advises the person at sentencing that their driving privilege will not be restored until proof of completion of a DUI program is received. Failure to enroll in or complete the program may result in probation revocation. The court consults with the county alcohol program administrator to establish reporting requirements for individuals ordered to attend and complete a program. The reporting ensures identification of those who fail to enroll or complete the program, as well as those who successfully complete it. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made accordingly."
