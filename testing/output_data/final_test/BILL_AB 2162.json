    "title": "AB 2162",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act (Chapter 6.3) is added to the Fish and Game Code to conserve oak woodlands, enhance scenic beauty, increase property values, promote ecological balance, provide habitat for wildlife and plant species, reduce soil erosion, sustain healthy watersheds, moderate climate change, and improve the health and welfare of California residents. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodlands in California to maintain ecosystem health and wildlife species viability. Land use changes, habitat loss from pathogens and parasites, and human impacts are fragmenting oak ecosystems, necessitating immediate conservation efforts. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodland ecological attributes in California, provide habitat for wildlife species, ensure land use decisions are based on scientific information, and restore the state's diverse natural resource for future generations. Canopy cover is defined as the area directly under the live branches of an oak tree. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines terms related to oak tree removal, permits, and woodlands. It specifies criteria for oak removal permits, oak removal plans, oak trees, and oak woodlands. Oak woodlands are defined as land with over ten percent oak canopy cover or historically supported such cover. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines terms related to oak tree removal, permits, and woodlands, including definitions for nontimberland areas with valley oak trees, parcels, riparian hardwood, timberland, and watercourses. In accordance with the Oak Woodlands Protection Act, an oak removal plan and permit application must be approved by the director before removing valley oak trees or 10 or more oak trees of a certain size from an oak woodland during a calendar year. The application must be prepared and signed by a registered professional forester and submitted on a prescribed form. The commission will establish regulations by June 30, 2016, for oak removal permits, including an application fee to cover processing costs. The fee will be set to cover all department expenses related to administering and enforcing the Oak Woodlands Protection Act. Canopy cover and mapping information from oak removal plans will be integrated into a vegetation classification program maintained by the department. The fee for oak removal permits will be deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund. An oak removal plan must be submitted with the application, detailing parcel use, canopy cover percentages, oak species to be removed, location of removal, acres affected, habitat mitigation, and other required information. The director's decision to approve an oak removal permit is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act. The director may not approve a permit if it does not comply with regulations, findings cannot be made, or if it would remove more than 10% of the oak canopy cover. The oak removal permit approval is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act. Removal of oak or riparian hardwood trees near water sources may be restricted if the information provided is inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading. The applicant must have a legal interest in the property, and the proposed plan should not violate any laws. Dead trees or those removed for fire breaks are exceptions. An applicant can appeal the director's denial of an oak removal permit to the commission within 15 days. The commission will hear the appeal within 60 days unless a later date is agreed upon. A person can seek declaratory and equitable relief to restrain violations of the oak removal regulations. Preliminary relief will be granted upon showing a violation. Oak removal permits approved under this chapter are considered construction projects. In civil actions, it is not necessary to prove irreparable damage or inadequate legal remedy when seeking a restraining order or injunction. The permittee must record the approved permit in each county before starting operations. Violations of this chapter may result in a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per violation. The civil penalty for violations is separate and additional to any other penalties imposed by law. The court considers various factors when determining the amount of the penalty, including the nature of the violation, ability to pay, prior violations, and economic benefit gained. (d) Civil actions under this section brought by the Attorney General, department, district attorney, or city attorney in California's name may be joined. Civil penalties collected are not fines or forfeitures and are distributed with fifty percent going to the county treasurer for the fish and wildlife propagation fund. Fifty percent of funds will be distributed to the Wildlife Conservation Board for the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund. These funds can be used for legal actions or law enforcement purposes. Section 21083.4 of the Public Resources Code is repealed. Oak trees are defined as native species in the Quercus genus, not designated as commercial species, and are 5 inches or more in diameter at breast height. A county must determine if a project may impact oak woodlands significantly. If so, mitigation alternatives include conserving oak woodlands with easements, planting trees, and maintaining them for seven years. Mitigation through tree planting can only fulfill half of the requirement for the project. The county can mitigate the impact on oak woodlands by contributing funds to the Oak Woodlands Conservation Fund for purchasing conservation easements, following guidelines from the Wildlife Conservation Board, or by implementing other mitigation measures. A county can use a grant from the Oak Woodlands Conservation Act to develop oak conservation elements for general plans, protection ordinances, or management plans. Exemptions include projects under approved conservation plans that conserve oak habitat. The Oak Woodlands Conservation Act allows for affordable housing projects in urban areas, conversion of oak woodlands on agricultural land, and projects to mitigate effects on oaks and oak woodlands. Compliance with the Act is achieved by adopting measures to mitigate significant effects on oaks and oak woodlands. This section clarifies that Section 21081 can still apply to a project and that public agencies are not limited by the regulations in complying with the law. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts under this act, as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
