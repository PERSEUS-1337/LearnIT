Metrics for measuring security at ports of entry must be implemented within 90 days. The effectiveness of security at ports of entry is measured by the number of illegal border crossers turned back and narcotics seized, as well as infractions related to personnel and cargo by major violators apprehended or not apprehended. Estimates are made using alternate methodologies for total attempted illegal border crossings. The Secretary of Homeland Security will implement metrics to measure the effectiveness of security in the maritime environment, including an effectiveness rate that considers migrants apprehended, migrants turned back, and narcotics seized in relation to the total estimated numbers of migrants and narcotics not apprehended or seized.
