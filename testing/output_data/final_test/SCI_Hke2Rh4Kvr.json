    "content": "A novel approach of cascaded boosting for boosting generative models is proposed in this paper. Meta-models are cascaded together to create a stronger model, allowing each meta-model to be trained separately and greedily. This approach aims to improve the learning power of generative models by combining cascaded boosting with the multiplicative boosting framework. Deep generative models (DGMs) have seen success in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms by combining deep learning scalability with probabilistic reasoning. However, a single parametric model may struggle to learn complex distributions due to fixed structure limitations. Integrating multiple weak models is an alternative to increase model strength without facing challenges like vanishing or exploding gradient problems. Recent success has been made on boosting generative models by combining multiple weak models to construct a stronger model. Grover & Ermon (2018) propose a method of multiplicative boosting, which improves performance on density estimation and sample generation compared to a single meta-model. However, the boosted model requires importance sampling for estimation. The method of additive boosting proposed by Rosset & Segal (2003) takes the weighted arithmetic mean of meta-models' distributions for faster sampling. However, it does not improve density estimation as effectively as multiplicative boosting. Balancing between learning power and sampling efficiency remains a challenge for both boosting methods. The proposed cascaded boosting framework connects meta-models in cascade, inspired by DBNs. A decomposable variational lower bound is introduced to train meta-models separately and greedily, resulting in a deep boosted model. This framework can be integrated with the multiplicative boosting framework for improved learning power. The proposed boosting framework connects meta-models in cascade to create a stronger model. A decomposable variational lower bound is used for training meta-models separately and greedily, leading to a deep boosted model. This framework can be combined with multiplicative boosting models for enhanced learning power. The cascaded boosting framework connects meta-models to create a stronger model. Multiplicative boosting combines meta-models' distributions with exponentiated weights to improve learning power. It shows better performance in density estimation and sample generation compared to individual meta-models. Our cascaded boosting framework connects meta-models in a top-down style to improve density estimation and sample generation. It overcomes the limitations of importance sampling and MCMC by replacing x i with h i\u22121 in n meta-models with hidden variables. This approach allows for faster evaluation of the partition function Z n and better quality samples. The boosted model is constructed by connecting meta-models in a top-down style, replacing x i with h i\u22121. This approach avoids the partition function and allows for sampling using ancestral sampling. The boosted model facilitates sample generation and approximation of the posterior distribution for inference. Connecting meta-models in a bottom-up style constructs the posterior distribution approximation, assuming conditional independence. Incorporating new meta-models only requires inferring the specific model, not the entire boosted model. The boosted model is constructed in a top-down style by connecting meta-models, allowing for sampling using ancestral sampling. The lower bound tightens when there is only one meta-model (k=1) and can be further optimized layer-wise. To ensure the lower bound grows with additional meta-models, l_k must be positive. Each meta-model can be trained separately by maximizing specific terms. The boosted model is constructed in a top-down style by connecting meta-models, allowing for sampling using ancestral sampling. Each meta-model can be trained separately and greedily, with the lower bound tightening as more meta-models are added. The non-decreasing property of the decomposable lower bound is derived when meta-models are arbitrarily powerful learners. Negative values of l_k indicate the need to tune hyperparameters or stop training, while convergence of the lower bound suggests halting further training. The boosted model is constructed by connecting meta-models in a top-down style, allowing for sampling using ancestral sampling. The lower bound tightens as more meta-models are added, with a non-decreasing property derived for powerful learners. Convergence of the lower bound indicates when to halt training, as discussed in subsection 2.5. The boosted model convergence is described in Theorem 3, with a necessary condition given in Theorem 4 to judge convergence after training. For models like VAEs, simple estimation is possible due to analytically solvable distributions. The boosted model is constructed by connecting meta-models in a top-down style, allowing for sampling using ancestral sampling. For hybrid boosting, integrating cascaded boosting with multiplicative boosting is considered. Strategies for determining meta-models to use and how they are connected are discussed, with suggestions such as using GMM or VAEs as top-most meta-models.

For hybrid boosting, integrating cascaded boosting with multiplicative boosting is considered. Strategies for determining meta-models to use and how they are connected are discussed, with suggestions such as using GMM or VAEs as top-most meta-models. There are three reasons for this strategy: (1) the posterior of VAE is much simpler than the dataset distribution, making a GMM enough to learn the posterior; (2) the posterior of a VAE is likely to consist of several components, with each corresponding to one category, making a GMM which also consists of several components suitable; (3) Since m k\u22121 (h k\u22121 ) is a standard Gaussian distribution when m k\u22121 is a VAE, when m k (h k\u22121 ) is a GMM, which covers the standard Gaussian distribution as a special case, we can make sure that Equation 7 will not be negative after training m k. Experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of a method that boosts advanced models by connecting them in a top-down style. The experiments validated the non-decreasing property of the decomposable lower bound and showed improved performance compared to naively increasing model capacity. The method was compared with different generative boosting methods using datasets like static binarized mnist and celebA. Various meta-models including RBMs, GMMs, VAEs, and ConvVAEs were used in the experiments. The experiments involved using RBMs, GMMs, VAEs, ConvVAEs, IWAEs, and LVAEs with their architectures specified. Marginal likelihood estimation methods were applied, and experiments were conducted on specific hardware. The non-decreasing property of the decomposable lower bound was validated theoretically and practically using RBMs and VAEs as meta-models on static binarized mnist dataset.

The non-decreasing property of the decomposable lower bound was validated theoretically and practically using RBMs and VAEs as meta-models on static binarized mnist dataset. RBMs were placed at the bottom and VAEs at the top, with evaluation of the lower bound at different k values. Incorporating VAEs led to a slight drop in the lower bound growth, with the first four meta-models being RBMs and the rest VAEs. The lower bound improved with the addition of two VAEs. The lower bound becomes stable by adding two VAEs to RBMs. The quality of generated samples from boosted models increases with the number of VAEs. Evidence of convergence is seen when incorporating 3 VAEs, with the last one being redundant. The quality of generated samples shows a non-decreasing trend for both mnist and celebA datasets. The boosted model's quality of generated samples has a non-decreasing property, with evidence of convergence after incorporating 3 VAEs. Cascaded boosting can enhance the performance of state-of-the-art models, such as ConvVAE, LVAE, and IWAE. Incorporating a GMM further promotes the lower bound of each advanced model, with a slight increase in computational cost. The study compares cascaded boosting with conventional methods of increasing model capacity in VAEs. The boosted model ensures non-negativity of the lower bound after training and requires minimal time due to the smaller dimension of hidden variables. It is compared with a deeper VAE with ten 500-dimensional hidden layers and a wider VAE with two 2500-dimensional hidden layers. The study compares different VAE models: Wider VAE with two 2500-dimensional hidden layers, Deeper VAE with ten 500-dimensional hidden layers, and Boosted VAEs composed of 5 base VAEs with two 500-dimensional hidden layers each. Boosted VAEs generate distinguishable and sharp digits, avoiding challenges like vanishing or exploding gradient problems. The study compares different VAE models and boosting methods on mnist dataset. The hybrid boosting produces the strongest models but with high time cost, while cascaded boosting allows quick density estimation and sampling. The multiplicative connection of one VAE and one GMM produces a bad model due to weak learning power of GMM. The curr_chunk discusses the estimation of density log p(x) using cascaded connection and importance sampling. It is inspired by Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Deep Latent Gaussian Models (DLGMs) with a focus on the training algorithm of DBNs. The decomposable variational lower bound reveals the principle behind the training algorithm of DBNs. Deep Latent Gaussian Models (DLGMs) are deep directed graphical models with multiple layers of hidden variables. An approximate posterior distribution is introduced which factorizes across layers. The variational lower bound of DLGMs can be further decomposed and optimized greedily and layer-wise. Boosting generative models have been explored with methods like sum-of-experts and product-of-experts. In boosting generative models, a framework is proposed for cascading meta-models to improve performance. The cascaded boosting integrates with multiplicative boosting and shows better learning power compared to increasing model capacity. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach in enhancing the performance of advanced models. The hybrid boosting method is shown to further improve the learning power of generative models. The text discusses the hybrid boosting method to enhance the learning power of generative models. It presents a variational lower bound and the architectures of various VAEs. The text discusses the architectures of various VAEs, including ConvVAE, IWAE, and LVAE. These models have different configurations of deterministic hidden layers and stochastic hidden variables, with specific dimensions and additional convolutional layers. Batch normalization layers are added after deterministic hidden layers in some models."
