The Public Safety Ex-Offender Self-Sufficiency Act of 2003, also known as the Temporary Ex-Offender Low-Income Housing Credit, provides a housing credit for ex-offenders under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The credit amount is determined based on the applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each qualified ex-offender residential building. The applicable percentage is defined in section 42(b)(2) and yields credit amounts equal to 70 percent of the qualified basis of the building. The term 'qualified basis' refers to the adjusted basis of a qualified ex-offender residential building at the end of the 1st taxable year of the credit period. The qualified basis can be increased by the portion of the building used for ex-offender support services, up to 20 percent of the total qualified basis. Rules similar to section 42 apply to determine the adjusted basis, treatment of rehabilitation expenditures, and credit period for qualified ex-offender residential buildings. These buildings must meet specific requirements during the compliance period. Each residential unit in a qualified ex-offender residential building must be made available for occupancy to only one ex-offender who meets certain residency requirements. The building will not fail to satisfy the requirements solely because of certain circumstances. The qualified ex-offender residential building must have residential units available for single ex-offender occupancy or for ex-offenders with their family members. It should also include a self-sufficiency center for ex-offenders to provide support services. The qualified ex-offender residential building must offer services to residents and ex-offenders, provide rental space for service providers, and ensure rent does not exceed 30% of the occupant's income. Ex-offenders must meet residency requirements to qualify for occupancy. Ex-offenders with low income participating in support services can reside in a qualified ex-offender residential building if they meet residency requirements and move in within 12 months of release from a correctional facility. Ex-offenders with low income can reside in a qualified residential unit within 12 months of release from a correctional facility. Income must not exceed 60 percent of the area median gross income. Participation in an ex-offender support services program is required. An ex-offender support services program must be created and managed by an individual with experience in ex-offender needs, tailored to the specific ex-offender, with defined duration and goals, and includes continual oversight for monitoring progress and needs. An ex-offender support services program requires the ex-offender to participate by agreeing to receive appropriate services and comply with program requirements. Ex-offender support services program mandates participation in scheduled meetings, events, and obtaining services as a condition for residency. Support services assist ex-offenders in developing life skills post-incarceration. The ex-offender support services program in a correctional institution includes job training, employment counseling, entrepreneurial training, financial management training, drug and alcohol abuse counseling, health care services, probation services, family and crisis management counseling, and more. The ex-offender support services program in correctional institutions offers job training, employment counseling, entrepreneurial training, financial management training, drug and alcohol abuse counseling, health care services, probation services, family and crisis management counseling, and general educational assistance. Ex-offenders are defined as individuals convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonment for 6 months or longer, with a limitation of 2 years residency in ex-offender residential facilities. Rules similar to section 42(h) apply for credit allocation and determination. The State housing credit ceiling is determined by a competitive process where the Secretary considers various factors for each State's allocation. When determining State housing credit allocations, the Secretary considers factors such as the need for prisoner reentry programs and the commitment of funds for ex-offender support services. The applicant's plan for collecting information on program success, organizational capacity for ex-offender housing, and the goal of the program. The Secretary may allocate a housing credit dollar amount to any building using a competitive application process and considering specific factors. The aggregate amount of State allocations for any year is $85,000,000. The State housing credit ceiling is calculated using State carryover allocations, which are determined by the Secretary similar to State allocations. The aggregate amount of State carryover allocations equals the aggregate unused housing credit carryovers. The section discusses the aggregate unused housing credit carryovers of all States for the preceding calendar year, required involvement of qualified non-profit organizations, recapture of credit rules, application of at-risk rules, certification and other reports to the Secretary, and responsibilities of the Secretary and Housing Credit. The Secretary and Housing Credit Agencies have responsibilities similar to those in section 42. The ex-offender low-income housing credit is included as a current year business credit. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code. The ex-offender low-income housing credit applies to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
