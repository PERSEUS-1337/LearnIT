    "content": "The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) extends the Adoption Incentives program, authorizes states to claim additional federal funds for child welfare purposes, and adds new requirements for federal child welfare dollars. These changes aim to ensure the well-being of children in foster care, support permanent living arrangements outside of foster care, assist older foster youth in transitioning to independent living, and allow tribes to access federal support for foster care, kinship care, and adoption assistance for Indian children under their authority. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 made changes to the Social Security Act, allowing states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance and maintenance payments for foster care youth beyond age 18. Tribes also gained access to federal funds for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship programs. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 expanded federal support for adoption assistance, phased in authorization for states to claim federal reimbursement for training costs, and provided funding for Family Connection Grants to support kinship navigator programs and family group decision making meetings. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 expanded federal support for adoption assistance and provided funding for kinship navigator programs, family group decision making meetings, and residential treatment centers for families under Title IV-B. It appropriates $3 million annually for grants related to improving outcomes for Indian children under Title IV-E. Additionally, it establishes new requirements for federal child welfare funding by public agencies, including ensuring school enrollment and coordinating health care for children in foster care. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 expanded federal support for adoption assistance and provided funding for kinship navigator programs, family group decision making meetings, and residential treatment centers for families under Title IV-B. It also established new requirements for federal child welfare funding by public agencies, including ensuring school enrollment and coordinating health care for children in foster care. Additionally, it mandates efforts to place siblings together, develop transition plans for youth exiting foster care, negotiate agreements with tribes for Title IV-E funds, and inform prospective adoptive parents of foster children's eligibility. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 expanded federal support for adoption assistance and provided funding for kinship navigator programs, family group decision making meetings, and residential treatment centers for families under Title IV-B. P.L. 110-351 makes additional child welfare financing, policy, or related program changes, including amendments to the federal tax code's definition of child and investment rules for the Treasury Department. These changes are estimated to fully offset the increased spending authorized by the bill over the next 5 and 10 years. All child welfare policy changes in P.L. 110-351 are administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) makes financing and policy changes to support children's placement in permanent families, including strengthening connections with biological kin or through federal programs. The provisions of the law are administered by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal support for kinship guardianship assistance, promotes relative placement, authorizes Family Connection Grants, and requires states to place siblings together. It also permits states to claim reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for children leaving foster care for legal guardianship with a relative. States can claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance payments under Title IV-E and Title IV-B of the Social Security Act. This assistance includes transferring parental rights to the caretaker for the child's protection, education, care, and custody. Reimbursement rates vary based on the state's per capita income, ranging from 50% to 83%. Additionally, states can claim reimbursement for general administrative costs at a 50% rate and for program-related training costs at a 75% rate. Since the mid-1990s, around 40 states have implemented subsidized guardianship programs for children leaving foster care, with some using federal Title IV-E funds. Early experiments showed that providing guardianship subsidies increased permanence for children in foster care. The Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care recommended federal support for subsidized guardianship in May 2004. The Government Accountability Office recommended federal subsidies for legal guardianship to increase permanent homes for children in foster care, citing evidence that it could benefit African American and other children. The Senate Finance Committee approved guardianship assistance provisions, stating that kinship placements and relative guardianships improve well-being and are good permanency options for children in foster care. The provision of a state option to receive federal support for guardianship assistance under Title IV-E is expected to reduce federal costs by strengthening children's connections to their families and creating more opportunities for kinship placements. This includes a new requirement for states to identify and notify grandparents and other adult relatives of a child within 30 days of removal from parental custody. The curr_chunk discusses the options for relatives to participate in the care and placement of a child, including waivers for non-safety licensing requirements in foster family homes. It also mentions a mandated study on licensed and unlicensed relative foster homes and authorizes HHS to compare names submitted by child welfare agencies. The bill establishes a new competitive grant program named Family Connection Grants under Title IV-B, Subpart 1 of the Social Security Act. Public child welfare agencies and non-profit organizations can seek federal funding to help children connect with relatives through kinship navigator programs and intensive family-finding efforts using search technology. The bill establishes a new competitive grant program called Family Connection Grants under Title IV-B, Subpart 1 of the Social Security Act. It allows public child welfare agencies and non-profit organizations to receive federal funding for intensive family-finding efforts using search technology to locate biological kin of children and explore permanent family placements. Additionally, it includes family group decision-making meetings and residential family treatment centers to provide a safe environment for parents and children, offering a range of services such as substance abuse treatment, family counseling, and medical care. HHS can award up to 30 new Family Connection Grants each year. The bill establishes Family Connection Grants under Title IV-B, allowing funding for family-finding efforts and services. HHS can award up to 30 grants annually with specific funding requirements. States must make efforts to place siblings together unless contrary to safety. The enacted bill expands federal adoption assistance to children with special needs, revises the Adoption Incentives program, and requires states to provide information on the adoption tax credit to prospective adoptive parents. It phases out income tests for eligibility for federal adoption assistance from FY2010-FY2018, providing more support to special needs children leaving foster care for adoption. States must use any saved state funds for child welfare purposes. Federal adoption assistance was established in 1980 for children with special needs, primarily those adopted out of foster care. Eligibility is linked to the former AFDC program rules, even though AFDC was repealed in 1996. Starting in FY2010, income tests for assistance eligibility were phased out, providing more support to special needs children leaving foster care for adoption. Beginning in FY2010, P.L. 110-351 phased out the link between federal adoption assistance and the former AFDC program rules. The revised eligibility rules eliminated income or resource requirements for special needs children qualifying for Supplemental Security Income. These changes will be effective for children aged 16 or older in FY2010, gradually lowering the age requirement until all special needs children are eligible for federal adoption assistance by FY2018. Beginning in FY2010, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded federal adoption assistance eligibility criteria. Children in foster care for 60 continuous months may qualify, regardless of age, and siblings of eligible children may also qualify. The link to AFDC eligibility will continue for children who do not meet the revised rules. Additionally, the Act provides incentives to states for increased adoptions from foster care. The Adoption Incentives program, created by ASFA, rewards states for increased adoptions from foster care. States earn bonuses for exceeding baseline adoption numbers, with additional awards for adopting older children and those with special needs. In FY2007, 21 states earned $11.1 million in bonus funds. This money can be used for services authorized by federal child welfare programs. P.L. 110-351 extends the Adoption Incentive program funding authorization to FY2013 at $43 million annually. It increases incentive amounts for older children and children with special needs adopted from foster care. The program's structure was modified to ensure states have a financial incentive to increase adoptions, even if their overall foster care caseloads decline. The Adoption Incentive program funding authorization is extended to FY2013 at $43 million annually, with increased incentive amounts for older children and children with special needs adopted from foster care. States can earn awards for increasing the rate of children adopted from foster care, with awards expected to be announced in September 2009. The Fostering Connections to Success and Improving Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) extends the Adoption Incentive program funding to FY2013 at $43 million annually. States have 24 months to spend any adoption incentive funding awarded. The Act also requires states to notify individuals adopting a child from foster care about potential eligibility for the federal adoption tax credit. Additionally, it aims to support children transitioning to independent living from foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-169) expanded support for youth aging out of foster care, while the Fostering Connections to Success and Improving Adoptions Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-351) extended adoption incentive program funding and aimed to support children transitioning to independent living. The enacted bill allows states to continue federal foster care payments for eligible children after they turn 18, until they reach 21, if they are in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. The bill allows states to support youth in foster care over 18 in supervised settings, with defined qualifications. States must create transition plans for children leaving foster care, addressing housing, health insurance, education, and mentorship opportunities. The bill allows states to support youth in foster care over 18 in supervised settings, with defined qualifications. States may continue federally supported subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after their 16th birthday for adoption or kinship guardianship until they reach their 21st birthday, as long as they are enrolled in school, employed, or participating in activities to promote employment. The bill expands support for youth in foster care over 18, allowing states to provide assistance until the age of 21 for those with medical conditions. It also extends federal adoption and kinship guardianship assistance for children with disabilities. Additionally, the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program now includes services for youth aging out of foster care without a permanent family. The bill extends support for youth in foster care over 18, providing assistance until age 21 for those with medical conditions. It also expands federal adoption and kinship guardianship assistance for children with disabilities. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 focuses on stable school enrollment and access to healthcare for children in foster care. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 emphasizes stable school enrollment and access to healthcare for children in foster care, requiring state child welfare agencies to collaborate with education authorities to ensure continuity in schooling for foster children. The enacted bill allows states to claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin\" at the same rate as foster care maintenance payments. States must ensure that children in foster care are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and develop a plan for access to healthcare services. The plan aims to provide health care, including mental health and dental services, for all children in foster care through a collaborative effort between the state child welfare agency and Medicaid. It includes scheduling health screens, monitoring and treating health needs, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of care, and overseeing prescription medicines. These requirements go beyond safety and permanence, focusing on health and education in federal child welfare policy. The federal child welfare policy has long focused on achieving safety and permanence for children in foster care. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and ASFA emphasized the importance of permanence and safety, providing incentives for case planning and adoption assistance. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 aims to improve child welfare services for Indian children by granting tribes federal reimbursement authority for foster care, adoption, and kinship guardianship costs. Tribes can access Title IV-E assistance through state supervision agreements. The Senate Finance Committee approved direct tribal access to federal Title IV-E support, allowing tribes to provide culturally appropriate care for Indian children. Tribes must meet all requirements for funding like states and can also apply for direct federal allotment of Chafee Foster Care Independence and Education and Training Voucher funds. The agreement between a tribe and state for federal Title IV-E funds must remain unchanged unless revoked. P.L. 110-351 allows tribes to receive a tribe-specific federal matching rate for foster care and adoption assistance. States must negotiate in good faith with eligible tribal entities. P.L. 110-351 requires states to negotiate in good faith with eligible tribal entities for agreements to administer Title IV-E funds for children under tribal authority. States must also negotiate with tribal entities not receiving federal funds for programs on behalf of Indian children. $3 million is appropriated for technical assistance and implementation grants to tribes and states to improve outcomes for Indian children. The P.L. 110-351 provides technical assistance and implementation grants to tribes and states for Title IV-E plans. Tribes may receive grants up to $300,000 and must submit their plan within 24 months. Failure to do so may result in repayment, unless circumstances beyond their control occur. Additionally, the bill phases in increased federal reimbursement rates for states offering training related to foster care and adoption programs. The enacted bill allows states to claim Title IV-E training reimbursement for short-term training of relative guardians and court personnel handling child abuse cases. The federal matching rate for training costs will increase annually to reach 75% by FY2013. P.L. 110-351 also includes changes unrelated to child welfare policy, such as clarifying the definition of a child for federal tax purposes. The bill includes provisions related to federal tax code and investing excess cash, estimated to offset costs over the next five and 10 years. It also prohibits altering current prohibitions on federal payments to individuals unlawfully present in the US. Effective since October 7, 2008, states may have additional time to comply with new requirements. The bill includes provisions related to federal tax code and investing excess cash, estimated to offset costs over the next five and 10 years. It also prohibits altering current prohibitions on federal payments to individuals unlawfully present in the US. A state may have limited additional time to comply with new requirements if HHS determines that legislation is needed. The bill authorizes significant expansions in federal support for state and tribal child welfare programs, with a projected budget neutral impact over ten years. The bill is projected to reduce the federal budget deficit by $15 million over ten years, with larger savings in the first five years. Four major provisions are expected to produce significant savings over five and ten years, including support for kinship guardianship assistance. The bill includes provisions such as making school enrollment a condition for federal eligibility for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance, new authority for the Treasury Department related to investment of operating cash, and changes to the tax code's definition of qualifying child. These provisions are projected to save a total of $791 million over 10 years. The bill includes provisions for delayed implementation of certain measures to reduce costs over time. These provisions include annual appropriation for Family Connection Grants, extending federal assistance for foster care youth up to age 21, and increased federal reimbursement rates for child welfare training. These measures are projected to increase federal spending by a total of $1 billion over several years. The bill includes provisions for increased oversight of access to health care for children in foster care, authority for tribes to receive direct federal funding, annual appropriation for technical assistance grants related to improving outcomes for Indian children, and phase-out of income eligibility criteria for federal adoption assistance. These measures are projected to increase federal spending by a total of $412 million over 10 years. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (H.R. 6893) phased out income eligibility criteria for federal adoption assistance, leading to an increase in federal spending. The bill was introduced by Representative Jim McDermott and passed both the House and Senate before being enacted as P.L. 110-351 on October 7, 2008. The Guardianship Support Act of 2008 (S. 3038) and the Fostering Connections to Success Act (H.R. 6307) were introduced in 2008. S. 3038 was approved by the Senate Finance Committee, while H.R. 6307 passed the House. Representatives McDermott and Weller highlighted bipartisan efforts in passing the final bill, H.R. 6893. Hearings were held to address challenges in the child welfare system, especially for older youth leaving foster care without a permanent family. In February 2008, Representative McDermott introduced the Invest in KIDS Act (H.R. 5466) to address challenges faced by older youth leaving foster care without a permanent family. Provisions from H.R. 5466, S. 3038, H.R. 6307, and H.R. 6893 were inspired by other bills introduced in earlier Congresses. These bills include the Kinship Caregiver Support Act, Adoption Equality Act, and Tribal Foster Care and Adoption Access Act. The Foster Care and Adoption Access Act (S. 1956, H.R. 4688) and the Foster Care Continuing Opportunities Act (S. 1512) were introduced by various senators and representatives. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services supported revising the Adoption Incentive program but disagreed with certain aspects of the final enrolled bill (H.R. 6893). HHS did not provide specific comments on expanding federal eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance, continuing federal Title IV-E foster care assistance after age 18, or increased federal reimbursement for child welfare training costs. HHS opposed creating a new entitlement for subsidized relative guardians under Title IV-E. HHS supports the Child Welfare Program Option for states to have flexibility in supporting guardianship agreements. They prefer direct federal support for tribes under this program option. HHS has concerns that bills may weaken child protection requirements for tribes compared to states. They also note that activities funded under Family Connection Grants could already be covered by existing Title IV-B programs. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 was urged by various groups, including child welfare advocates and organizations representing children and youth in foster care. The act addresses long-standing issues in the child welfare system and has garnered support from national, state, and local entities. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children leaving foster care for placement with relatives. Eligibility requires the child to have lived with the relative guardian for at least six months and met state foster care standards. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children leaving foster care for placement with relatives. Additional conditions for federal eligibility include the child being removed from their home through a voluntary placement agreement or by a judge, with neither reunification nor adoption as suitable options. The child must have a strong attachment to the relative guardian, who must undergo specific background checks before receiving kinship assistance. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children leaving foster care for placement with relatives. States must conduct registry checks before a relative guardian can receive assistance payments on behalf of a child. Siblings can be placed in the same kinship guardianship arrangement, with payments made on their behalf. Payments must not exceed what the child would receive in foster care. Medicaid eligibility is maintained for children receiving assistance. States must have a written agreement with the guardian for federal reimbursement. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children placed with relatives. The agreement must specify payment details and additional services available to the child and relative guardian. States can receive federal reimbursement for assistance payments at a rate similar to adoption assistance. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children placed with relatives. The agreement must specify payment details and additional services available to the child and relative guardian. States can receive federal reimbursement for assistance payments at a rate similar to adoption assistance, ranging from 50%-83% based on each state's FMAP. The agreement also covers nonrecurring expenses associated with obtaining legal guardianship of the child, up to $2,000. States must outline in the child's case plan the reasons for placement in a kinship guardianship arrangement and any separation from siblings. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children placed with relatives. The agreement must specify payment details, additional services, reasons for placement, separation from siblings, efforts made for adoption, and eligibility criteria. At the termination of any state child welfare demonstration project related to guardianship, the state's costs for providing assistance to children continue to be eligible for federal reimbursement. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 allows states to claim federal reimbursement for kinship guardianship assistance for eligible children placed with relatives. States can use federal funds for independent living services for youth leaving foster care for adoption or kinship guardianship after turning 16. Mandatory funding of $15 million is appropriated for Family Connection Grants from FY2009-FY2013. Family Connection Grants from FY2009-FY2013 support kinship navigator programs, family-finding efforts, family group decision-making meetings, and residential family treatment centers providing various services for parents and children. HHS must annually award no less than $5 million for these grants. The Family Connections Grants support kinship navigator programs to assist caregivers in finding services for themselves and the children they care for. HHS must allocate funds for evaluation and technical assistance, limit the number of new grants per year, and provide 75% of the funding for approved program costs in the first year. The \"Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program\" requires states to notify adult relatives when a child is removed from parental custody and provide information on foster care and kinship guardianship assistance. States must also provide funding for approved program costs in the first and second year of the grant. The legislation requires states to notify adult relatives when a child is removed from parental custody and provide information on foster care and kinship guardianship assistance. It allows for waivers of \"non-safety\" licensing standards for relative foster family caregivers on a case-by-case basis. HHS must report on the licensing of relative foster family homes, including the number of children in licensed and unlicensed homes, frequency of waivers granted, and the impact on safety and permanence. The legislation allows waivers of \"non-safety\" licensing standards for relative foster family caregivers. It permits state child welfare agencies to have more direct access to the Federal Parent Locator Service and extend federal assistance to eligible children after their 18th birthday if they are in foster care or left foster care for adoption or guardianship assistance after their 16th birthday. Recommendations are provided to increase the licensing of relative foster family homes while ensuring the safety and well-being of foster children. The legislation allows children in foster care to retain eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments after turning 18, as long as they are in a supervised setting. States can also continue federal kinship guardianship assistance up to age 21 for children with mental health conditions. The legislation allows federal kinship guardianship assistance to continue up to age 21 for children with mental or physical handicaps deemed necessary by the state. Payments are prohibited if the relative guardian is no longer legally responsible for the child or if the child is not receiving support. Effective October 1, 2010, states must have procedures in place to ensure support for foster care children before their 18th birthday. When a child in foster care turns 18 (or 90 days before the later birthday chosen by the state for Title IV-E assistance), a transition plan must be developed with options for housing, health insurance, education, mentors, support services, and employment. States can claim federal reimbursement for training related to the foster care program for relative guardians, child welfare agency staff, and court personnel. A 75% federal reimbursement rate is phased in for these individuals. The federal reimbursement rate for relative guardians, private child welfare agency workers, and court personnel training claims will increase to 75% by FY2013. States must consider the child's current educational setting and proximity to their school when placing them in foster care. States must also coordinate with local educational agencies to ensure the child remains in their current school or is enrolled in a new school promptly. The child will be enrolled in a new school with all education records provided. States can claim federal reimbursement for transporting a child to their original school. Each school-age child receiving federal assistance must be enrolled full-time or have completed high school. States must create a plan for oversight and coordination of health services. The plan for oversight and coordination of health care for children in foster care includes strategies for identifying and addressing their health needs, ensuring continuity of care, and involving medical professionals in assessing their well-being. The requirement for professionals to assess the health of children in foster care and determine appropriate medical treatment is stipulated. States must make efforts to place siblings together in foster care, kinship guardianship, or adoptive placement, unless it is contrary to their safety or well-being. If siblings are not placed together, states must ensure frequent visitation or interaction between them, unless it is not in their best interest. Permits Indian tribes with an approved Title IV-E plan to claim federal reimbursement for foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship payments for eligible children under tribal responsibility. Defines \"Indian tribe,\" \"tribal organization,\" and \"tribal consortium\" for direct federal funding eligibility. Title IV-E plan requires tribes to meet all requirements as states for federal support. Tribes with approved plans receive reimbursement directly from the federal government. Existing cooperative agreements with states for IV-E payments must remain in effect. The bill allows states and tribes to continue agreements for Title IV-E funds, with the option to modify or revoke them. Tribal entities can apply for funds under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program and Education and Training Voucher funds. Successful tribal applicants will receive funds based on the number of children in foster care under their authority. Tribes with an approved Title IV-E plan can claim federal reimbursement for in-kind expenditures from third-party sources. HHS must issue regulations by September 30, 2011, related to this claiming. States must negotiate in good faith with tribal entities to administer parts of the Title IV-E program for Indian children. Similarly, states must negotiate with tribal entities for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program if they do not receive direct federal funds. The text chunk discusses the requirement for HHS to issue regulations by October 7, 2009, to implement tribal access provisions for Indian children under tribal authority. It ensures that transferring a child from a state to a tribal child welfare agency does not affect their eligibility for Title IV-E or Medicaid services. The effective date for most provisions in this section is October 1, 2009. To improve services for Indian children and families, HHS must provide technical assistance to tribes and states on child welfare programs. Implementation grants up to $300,000 are available for tribes preparing a Title IV-E plan, to develop necessary procedures and meet requirements for approval. The bill stipulates that an implementation grant for tribal entities must be repaid if a Title IV-E plan is not submitted to HHS within 24 months. $3 million annually is appropriated for technical assistance and grants, with funding authority for Adoption Incentives extended for five years. The bill increases Adoption Incentive awards for older child adoptions and special needs adoptions, with states having 24 months to spend the funds. Any unneeded funds will be awarded to states with increased adoption rates from foster care. States must exceed their previous foster child adoption rate to earn awards for adoptions finalized from FY2008 to FY2012. In FY2008 through FY2012, states must exceed their previous highest foster child adoption rate to earn Adoption Incentive awards. The award amount is based on the increased number of adoptions achieved. Eligibility criteria for federal Title IV-E adoption assistance are being phased in, starting in FY2010 for children aged 16 or older. By FY2018, the new eligibility rules will apply to all children. Starting in FY2010, revised adoption assistance eligibility criteria will apply to children of any age, including those who have been in care for 60 or more consecutive months. Siblings of children who meet the new eligibility rules will also be eligible if they will be placed in the same adoptive home. States are required to inform individuals adopting from foster care about their potential eligibility for the federal adoption tax credit. The federal adoption tax credit eligibility criteria have been clarified to ensure that a qualifying child must be unmarried, younger than the taxpayer claiming them, and the dependent of the taxpayer claiming the credit. This is to offset costs of increased federal child welfare spending authorized in previous titles of the enacted bill. The bill clarifies that to claim a qualifying child for the adoption tax credit, the individual must have a higher income than either of the child's parents. It also allows the Treasury Department to invest excess cash for 90 days. The bill prohibits altering current prohibitions on federal payments to individuals unlawfully present in the US. The effective date of the bill's amendments is October 7, 2008, with exceptions for states needing to comply with new requirements."
