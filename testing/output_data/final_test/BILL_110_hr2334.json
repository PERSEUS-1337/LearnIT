    "content": "The \"Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness and Indian Peaks Wilderness Expansion Act\" aims to protect the scenic, historic, and wildlife values of certain land within Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. It also seeks to preserve the scientific, educational, and recreational resources of the area while adjusting the boundaries of the Indian Peaks Wilderness and Arapaho National Recreation Area. The Act defines key terms such as \"Map\" as the map of Rocky Mountain National Park, \"Park\" as the park itself, \"Potential wilderness land\" as identified land on the map or acquired land contiguous to designated wilderness areas, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior. The Act defines key terms such as \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" as the State of Colorado, \"Trail\" as the East Shore Trail, and \"Wilderness\" as the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness. SEC. 4. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK WILDERNESS. Designated as wilderness under the Wilderness Act, approximately 249,339 acres of land in Rocky Mountain National Park are designated as the \"Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness.\" The Secretary will submit a map and boundary description to Congress for public inspection. The Secretary may correct errors in the map and boundary description submitted for public inspection. The submitted map and description will have the same legal effect as if included in the Act. Potential wilderness land can be included in the Wilderness after ceasing inconsistent uses, and will be managed accordingly. The Secretary will modify the map and boundary description to include a parcel in the Wilderness, excluding specific land like the Grand River Ditch and land owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water Conservancy District. The Wilderness area comprises approximately 35.38 acres, including lands owned by the Wincentsen-Harms Trust totaling 2.75 acres. The land within the \"East Shore Trail Area\" depicted on the map will also be designated as Wilderness and administered by the Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. The Wilderness Act deems the effective date to be the date of enactment of the Act or the date of adding the land to the Wilderness. Congress finds that the United States has existing water rights within the Park, which are sufficient for Wilderness purposes. The Wilderness Act does not require the United States to reserve additional water rights for Wilderness purposes. The Act also does not imply any reservation of water rights by the United States. Additionally, the liability of the Grand River Ditch is addressed, regardless of any other laws or agreements in place. The Water Supply and Storage Company operates and maintains the Grand River Ditch within the Park under an agreement with the National Park Service. Owners, controllers, or operators of the ditch are not liable for any damages to the Park caused by events like water overflow or breaches. The Grand River Ditch, including the portion outside the Park, is not liable for damages unless caused by negligence or intentional acts. The Act does not limit liability for damages occurring before its enactment and does not restrict existing activities in the Wilderness area. The Act allows authorized activities on the Grand River Ditch to continue without adverse effects on water rights or right-of-way. Activities on the Grand River Ditch will not affect its right-of-way, and the Colorado-Big Thompson Project facilities within the Park are allowed to operate as of the date of enactment. The Act allows existing activities in the Park to continue, unaffected by the Wilderness designation. Water conveyance through the Alva B. Adams Tunnel is not restricted. No new reclamation projects in the Wilderness are permitted. The Act does not create a buffer zone around the Wilderness and allows nonwilderness activities to be conducted outside its boundaries. The Secretary can take measures to control fire, insects, and diseases in the Wilderness, including using mechanized tools. The Act does not limit the Secretary's authority to manage the lands and resources within the Park. SEC. 5. EAST SHORE TRAIL AREA IN ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK. The Secretary will establish the East Shore Trail in Rocky Mountain National Park to ensure sustained use without harm to resources or conflicts among users. Boundaries of the trail will not extend more than 25 feet east of the alignment line or be within the wilderness area. The Secretary may adjust the boundaries of the Trail to protect National Park System resources, ensuring no portion of the Trail is within the Wilderness. Upon completion of the Trail construction, any untraversed portion of the East Shore Trail Area not within 50 feet of the Trail shall be included in the Wilderness and managed accordingly. The Secretary will modify the map and boundary as needed. The Secretary will modify the map and boundary of the wilderness to include the East Shore Trail Area land. This section does not require the construction of the Trail along a specific alignment line or limit applicable laws. It also clarifies that the Act does not affect the management or use of land outside the Wilderness. The East Shore Trail Area prohibits the use of unauthorized motorized vehicles, except for construction and maintenance of the Trail. The land must be managed to protect wilderness characteristics until the Trail is authorized for non-motorized bicycles. SEC. 6. Indian Peaks Wilderness and Arapaho National Recreation Area boundary adjustment. The Indian Peaks Wilderness boundary is adjusted to 74,195 acres and the Arapaho National Recreation Area boundary is adjusted to 35,235 acres, both dated May 2007. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO LEASE LEIFFER TRACT. Section 3(k) of Public Law 91-383 applies to the Leiffer tract near Rocky Mountain National Park in Larimer County, Colorado, administered by the National Park Service."
