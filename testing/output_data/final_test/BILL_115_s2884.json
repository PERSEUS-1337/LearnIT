    "content": "The \"Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2018\" requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide notice regarding debt collection activities. The \"Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2018\" mandates the collaboration between the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and veterans service organizations to create a standard, easy-to-understand format for debt notification letters. These letters will explain why an individual owes a debt to the United States due to participation in a benefits program and outline available options. Additionally, the Secretary will establish a method for individuals to receive debt notices electronically. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must deliver debt notification letters in a standard format to recipients who have elected to receive them both by mail and electronically, while recipients who have not made such an election will only receive them by standard mail. The Secretary is required to notify Congress upon completion of the standard letter format and the method for electronic delivery. If these notices are not submitted within 90 days of the Act's enactment, progress reports must be provided to Congress. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, must conduct a study on the process for individuals indebted to the United States. Progress reports must be submitted to Congress every 30 days until all required notices are completed. The study required by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, will analyze the issue of individuals in debt to the United States through a benefits program not receiving debt collection notices. Administrative actions to reduce incorrect addresses will be identified. The study will analyze incorrect addresses in VA and Treasury databases, estimate costs of sending debt collection notices, assess effectiveness of certified mail, evaluate resources needed for a consolidated debt snapshot, and analyze the impact on individuals. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will submit a report to Congress on the extent of individuals' indebtedness due to errors, misrepresentations, or fraud in benefits programs. This report will be submitted in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury within one year of the enactment of the Act."
