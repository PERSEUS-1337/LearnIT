    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Popcorn Workers Lung Disease Prevention Act\" and includes findings related to the prevention of this disease. Congress finds that an emergency exists concerning worker exposure to diacetyl, a substance used in flavorings, including artificial butter flavorings, which poses a grave danger of life-threatening illness. Cases of bronchiolitis obliterans have been linked to diacetyl exposure in workers, particularly in microwave popcorn plants. NIOSH has recommended measures to minimize worker exposure to diacetyl. The Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association issued a report in 2004 warning about respiratory illness in workers exposed to flavorings, specifically diacetyl. Cases of bronchiolitis obliterans were identified in the flavoring manufacturing industry, leading to calls for reducing exposure to diacetyl. In April 2007, NIOSH reported bronchiolitis obliterans cases among workers exposed to diacetyl in flavor manufacturing and popcorn industries. Despite recommendations for exposure control, OSHA has not implemented a safety standard to protect workers. An urgent need for an OSHA standard to prevent bronchiolitis obliterans from diacetyl exposure is emphasized. Workers exposed to diacetyl are at risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans and other debilitating conditions. SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF STANDARD ON DIACETYL. The Secretary of Labor must issue an interim final standard regulating worker exposure to diacetyl within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The standard applies to flavoring manufacturing facilities and microwave popcorn production establishments using diacetyl-containing flavors, providing protection in line with NIOSH recommendations. The interim final standard for regulating worker exposure to diacetyl includes requirements for engineering controls, work practice controls, respiratory protection, a written exposure control plan, and evaluation of control measures. The interim final standard for regulating worker exposure to diacetyl includes requirements for airborne exposure assessments, medical surveillance, protective equipment, safety training, and effective date of issuance. The interim final standard for regulating worker exposure to diacetyl will have the legal effect of an occupational safety and health standard until a final standard is issued within 2 years. The final standard will include worker protection provisions, a short term exposure limit, and a permissible exposure limit that is at the lowest feasible level. The final standard for regulating worker exposure to diacetyl will include worker protection provisions, a short term exposure limit, and a permissible exposure limit that does not exceed the lowest feasible level, applying to all facilities where diacetyl is processed or used. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will conduct a study on food flavorings as substitutes for diacetyl and report findings to OSHA. This does not affect the timing of rulemaking outlined in section 2."
