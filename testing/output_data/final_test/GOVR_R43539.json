    "content": "Congress has used commemoratives to express gratitude, dramatize virtues, and remember events. Initially, commemoratives were medals, but later expanded to include national observance days, monuments, federal holidays, commemorative coins, and naming public works. In the 20th century, Congress used commemorative legislation for buildings, scholarships, and historic sites. This report discusses commemorative options requiring legislation. Types of commemoratives requiring legislative action include naming federal buildings, creating postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding Congressional Gold Medals, authorizing monuments and memorials, establishing commemorative commissions, authorizing observances and federal holidays, and requesting presidential proclamations. Nonlegislative options include sending certificates of recognition, making floor speeches, and sending flags flown over the Capitol Building to constituents. Efforts to reduce the number of commemoratives proposed through legislation began in the 1960s due to concerns about excessive legislative time spent on these measures. Efforts to curb excessive legislative time spent on commemoratives began in the 1960s. Proposals included creating an advisory commission to recommend appropriate commemorations and amending congressional rules on commemorative legislation. One proposal introduced in 1966 suggested a Commission on National Observances and Holidays to review national observance proposals of national significance. Measures were passed by the House in the 89th and 90th Congress, but no further action was taken by the Senate. In the 104th Congress, the House adopted a rule to reduce commemorative bills and resolutions. House Rule XII, clause 5, prohibits date-specific commemorative legislation. Republican Conference Rule 28 also limits honorific legislation scheduling. House Rule XII was amended to prevent the introduction of any bill establishing a commemoration. The House Rules Committee's section-by-section analysis of the House Rules resolution (H.Res. 6, 104th Congress) explains the ban on date-specific commemorative measures, including measures incidental to the overall purpose, which will be returned to the sponsor if dropped in the legislative hopper. The prohibition also extends to date-specific commemorative measures received from the Senate, which will not be referred to the appropriate committee. The House Rules Committee prohibits date-specific commemorative measures from being considered by the House or referred to the appropriate committee. If included in a conference report or Senate amendment, the entire report or amendment would be subject to a point of order. Alternative forms of national recognition should not become a new outlet for such measures, and committees are not expected to establish special rules for their release to the House floor. The House Rules Committee prohibits date-specific commemorative measures from being considered or referred to committees. Exceptions for special national recognition should be limited and determined by Leadership. House Republican Conference Rule 28 (6) prohibits scheduling bills under suspension of the Rules for commemorative purposes. House majority leadership has issued protocols for scheduling and consideration. The House majority leadership has issued protocols for scheduling legislation on the House floor, including guidance on exemptions to Conference Rule 28. Party conference rules are not enforceable on the House floor, but there is a general reluctance to schedule legislation with commemorative intent. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform adopted Rule 13(c) regarding holidays and celebrations. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform adopted Rule 13(c) stating that resolutions expressing appreciation, commendation, or celebration of entities or events will not be considered. House Rule XII, clause 5, has been waived by unanimous consent in the past to allow certain commemorative resolutions. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform adopted Rule 13(c) stating that resolutions expressing appreciation, commendation, or celebration of entities or events will not be considered. Legislative options for commemorations include naming federal buildings, designing postage stamps, minting commemorative coins, awarding congressional gold medals, creating monuments and memorials, and more. Nonlegislative options include creating individual office awards, giving floor speeches, sending official letters, and ordering. Since House Rule XII, clause 5, was adopted in the 104th Congress, it has been waived by unanimous consent on at least one occasion to allow for the consideration of legislation establishing Patriot Day as a day of remembrance for September 11, 2001. Several legislative options exist to honor individuals, groups, and historic events, requiring passage of a bill or resolution by the House, the Senate, or both chambers. House and Senate committees may have specific rules or guidance associated with commemoratives. Legislation allows for the naming of post offices and federal buildings after individuals, with specific rules and restrictions in place. Between the 110th and 114th Congresses, nearly 18% of all statutes enacted were for post office naming acts. This practice is common and honors locally esteemed individuals, deceased officials, military personnel, and celebrities. Legislation allows for naming post offices after various individuals, including local figures, deceased officials, military personnel, and celebrities. Renaming a post office through legislation does not change the building's facade or signs, but a plaque is installed inside to commemorate the designation. The House and Senate have established policies for considering post office naming acts. Currently, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has policies for post office naming bills, including restrictions on naming buildings for living persons and requirements for co-sponsorship from the state delegation. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has policies for post office naming bills, including restrictions on naming buildings for living persons and requirements for co-sponsorship from the state delegation. The Senate HSGAC also has practices for considering post office naming legislation, such as not naming facilities for living individuals except for specific cases. Once post office naming legislation is approved by the Committees, it can proceed for further consideration. Legislation for naming post offices, federal buildings, and facilities is typically reported by House and Senate Committees. Post office naming bills often pass the House under suspension of the rules and the Senate via unanimous consent. Other federal buildings may also be named through legislation, with bills usually originating in committees related to the agencies involved. For example, naming a veterans medical facility would typically start in the Veterans' Affairs committees. Courthouses, managed by the General Services Administration, are named through committees with jurisdiction over GSA, such as the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In the legislative process, naming post offices, federal buildings, and facilities is typically handled by House and Senate Committees. Different committees, such as Veterans' Affairs, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Environment and Public Works, are responsible for naming facilities under their jurisdiction. Committees like Science, Space and Technology and Commerce, Science, and Transportation also handle naming legislation for agencies like NASA. Some committees have specific rules for introducing naming legislation. House Veterans' Affairs committees have adopted rules for naming legislation, only allowing VA facilities to be named after deceased veterans who were instrumental in the facility's construction, Medal of Honor recipients, high-ranking military or federal officials, or individuals who provided outstanding service for veterans. The House Veterans' Affairs committees have specific rules for naming legislation, requiring support from congressional delegation members and veteran organizations with large memberships. In contrast, the committees with jurisdiction over courthouse naming do not have identical written rules. Contacting the committee is necessary to determine any informal requirements still in place. EPW has specific rules for naming buildings, while T&I and SST in the House and CST in the Senate do not have written rules for naming legislation. The USPS issues commemorative stamps annually for various individuals and events. The USPS issues commemorative stamps annually for various individuals and events, including special series stamps directed by Congress. For example, in 1947, Congress directed the Postmaster General to issue a special series of stamps in honor of Gold Star Mothers. Additionally, Congress has enacted legislation for semipostal stamps, such as the Save the Vanishing Species Semipostal Stamp created in 2010. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has a rule against considering legislation for commemorative stamps. The Postmaster General has discretionary authority to create semipostal stamps, like the one for Alzheimer's disease. Commemorative coins are produced by the U.S. Mint to honor American people, events, and institutions, with over 140 authorized by Congress since 1892. In 1982, Congress restarted the commemorative coin program by authorizing a half dollar to honor George Washington's 250th Birthday. The Commemorative Coin Reform Act of 1996 imposed restrictions on the number of coin programs and coins minted per year. The law also clarified the process for Mint expenses and surcharge disbursement. The House Committee on Financial Services has a rule requiring bipartisan cosponsorship for commemorative coin legislation hearings. The House Committee on Financial Services has a rule requiring bipartisan cosponsorship for commemorative coin legislation hearings, while the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee rules require at least 67 Senators as cosponsors for consideration. Congress has approved legislation for various awards and decorations, but there are no permanent statutory provisions specifically for creating commemorative coins. In the 115th Congress, rules prohibit the creation of Congressional Gold Medals unless certain criteria are met, such as the recipient being a natural person, having made a significant impact on American history and culture, not having received a similar medal before, and being alive or deceased for a certain period. The rules for awarding Congressional Gold Medals in the House Republican Conference include criteria such as the recipient being alive or deceased for a specific period, having achievements in their field of endeavor, and being recognized by others in the same field. Additionally, there is a restriction on the number of gold medals that can be awarded annually. The rules for awarding Congressional Gold Medals in the House Republican Conference include criteria such as the recipient being alive or deceased for a specific period, having achievements in their field of endeavor, and being recognized by others in the same field. A waiver on the restriction can be granted by the majority of the elected leadership of the conference. In the Senate, at least 67 Senators must cosponsor any Congressional Gold Medal bill before being considered by the committee. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) was enacted in 1986 to provide standards for monuments and memorials in the District of Columbia. Authorization from Congress is required for any new commemorative work in the District, with legislation typically including a short title, definitions, and authorization for the memorial. The authorizing legislation for a commemorative work typically includes a short title, definitions section, and authorization for the memorial. The authorization consists of four parts: establishment of the commemorative work, compliance with the Commemorative Works Act, prohibition of federal funds, and deposit of excess funds. The provision for depositing excess funds raised for a monument or memorial is an important consideration in CWA-related legislation. The House and Senate committees hold hearings on proposals, considering historical significance, estimated costs, and fundraising methods. The National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission also provides advice on proposed memorials. After a commemorative work is authorized by Congress, committees receive advice on the process. Congressional involvement in monuments and memorials outside of the District of Columbia is not governed by the Commemorative Works Act. Recently, Congress has handled the creation of monuments and memorials outside the District of Columbia in two ways: by directly authorizing a new commemorative or by making an existing commemorative a \"national\" monument or memorial. Legislation is required to authorize a group to design, construct, and maintain the memorial, as seen with the memorial at the crash site in Shanksville, PA for the passengers and crew of Flight 93. During debate on bill H.R. 3917, Representative William Shuster emphasized the importance of creating a national memorial for the brave individuals who thwarted a planned attack on the Nation's Capital. The legislation proposes a fair and balanced approach for constructing the memorial to honor these heroes. The legislation proposes the creation of the Flight 93 Advisory Commission, composed of representatives from victims' families, the local community, Pennsylvania, and the US Government. This Commission would submit recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior for the Flight 93 Memorial. Congress also established an advisory committee for design, construction, and management recommendations. Additionally, Congress has considered recognizing existing works as national monuments or memorials instead of creating new memorials. Enacting legislation to provide national recognition of a monument or memorial, while maintaining local operation and maintenance, typically requires no federal oversight or funds. For example, P.L. 113-132 designated a memorial in Riverside, CA, as the \"Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial\" to honor military aviators who have received the \"Distinguished Flying Cross.\" Commemorative commissions oversee celebrations and events, often coinciding with milestone anniversaries. A commemorative commission was created to plan and conduct observances for the quincentennial of Christopher Columbus' voyages. Bills for such commissions are regularly introduced in Congress, with details on membership, duties, and termination date included in the statute. Legislators have flexibility in organizing commissions based on Congress's goals. Commemorative commissions, created by Congress, have unique structures and powers to fulfill their duties. They work closely with private groups, state and local governments, and other federal entities for event coordination. Federal funds allocated to these commissions are only a portion of the total funding for commemorative activities, which can be sourced through appropriations or nonfederal money. Commemorative commissions may be authorized for appropriations and fundraising. Some commissions lack the authority to solicit funds or accept donations and are prohibited from doing so. House rules restrict commemorative legislation that designates a specific period for remembrance, celebration, or recognition. The House rules restrict the scheduling of commemorative observances and days, but the Senate can still honor individuals, groups, and events through Senate measures. The Senate Judiciary Committee has had guidelines on commemorative legislation in the past, which may not be currently applicable. These guidelines required bipartisan cosponsors and prohibited commemoration of specific categories. The United States has 11 permanent federal holidays, including New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, and Independence Day. States decide their own legal holidays, and legislation is required to create a new federal holiday. Legislation has been introduced in recent Congresses for holidays like \"Cesar E. Chavez Day\" or to establish Election Day as a federal holiday. Recent legislation has proposed adding Election Day as a federal holiday, with Congress often requesting the President to issue proclamations for events or individuals, such as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. Presidents can also issue commemorative proclamations without congressional action. Since 1789, Presidents have issued proclamations without congressional action, commemorating various events and individuals. Nonlegislative options like certificates of recognition and purchasing American flags are also available for commemoration. Members of Congress can create and distribute certificates of recognition to constituents to acknowledge accomplishments. Official funds in the House can be used for this purpose. The House Ethics Manual and Senate Standing Orders place restrictions on the use of official funds for certificates of recognition and reimbursable expenses. This includes prohibiting political references, partisan endorsements, and unequal treatment of constituents based on support or contributions. The House Ethics Manual and Senate Standing Orders restrict the use of official funds for expenses like holiday greeting cards, flowers, trophies, awards, and certificates. Members can honor constituents with floor speeches and Congressional Record copies. Members can request floor time for commemorative speeches through party leadership. In 1937, a Member requested to fly a U.S. flag over. The Architect of the Capitol manages the flag program for the House and Senate, where constituents can purchase U.S. flags flown over the Capitol through their Representative's or Senator's offices. The Member office collects flag requests and coordinates with the Architect of the Capitol for flag flying. Flags can be obtained from the Office Supply Service, with costs initially charged to the Member Representational Allowance. Members can use official funds from the Member Representational Allowance (MRA) to purchase U.S. flags flown over the Capitol for official gifts. Senators can obtain flags from the Senate Stationary Room by collecting costs from constituents and arranging for flag flying through the Printing, Graphics, and Direct Mail (PG&DM) office. More information on the House of Representatives flag program can be found at https://housenet.house.gov/campus/service-providers/aoc-flag-office. Members can use official funds to purchase U.S. flags flown over the Capitol for official gifts. The Senate flag program allows flags to be gifted to public organizations only.
