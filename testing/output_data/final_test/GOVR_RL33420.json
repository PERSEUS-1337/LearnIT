    "content": "Congress completed work on the Foreign Operations and Science, State, Justice, and Commerce Appropriations bills as part of the FY2007 Continuing Resolution. The bill provided $32.6 billion in international affairs spending, with $9.6 billion for State Department Operations and $23.0 billion for foreign assistance programs. The Continuing Resolution finished the appropriations process for FY2007, except for a pending supplemental request for global war on terror costs. The FY2007 Continuing Resolution allocated funding for the Department of State and foreign operations based on FY2006 levels or the House-passed/Senate-passed FY2007 levels. Two additional CRs extended funding until February 15, 2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $31.5 billion for foreign assistance programs and State Department Operations, a decrease of $2.4 billion from the President's request. The House passed various bills in June 2006, including one consolidating health-related programs and another providing funding for the State Department and related programs. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2007 allocated $21.3 billion, which was $597 million above the previous year but $2.387 billion below the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee largely accepted recommendations for overall funding levels in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act for FY2007. H.R. 5522 provided $3.61 billion for bilateral and multilateral HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs, slightly less than requested but significantly more than FY2006. The legislation also included near full funding for HIV/AIDS and reduced spending for the Presidents Malaria Initiative. H.R. 5522 proposed funding for trade capacity building efforts and fragile states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, and Sudan. It allocated $522 million for Iraq, $2 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and rescinded $200 million in cash assistance to Egypt. The FY2006 emergency supplemental measure (H.R. 4939 / P.L. 109-234) included $2.4 billion for Foreign Operations and $1.4 billion for State Department operations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized their subcommittee structures at the beginning of the 109th Congress. The House reduced the number of subcommittees to ten, while the Senate maintained twelve sub-panels. The House Foreign Operations Committee's jurisdiction remains the same, while the State Department, Broadcasting, and related activities are now funded within the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies (SSJC) in the House. The Senate combined Foreign Operations with the State Department in its restructuring. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized their subcommittee structures at the beginning of the 109th Congress. The Senate maintained twelve sub-panels, combining Foreign Operations with the State Department and related agencies. State Department funds were incorporated into the SSJC measure for FY2006 funding. The House and Senate maintained the same jurisdiction structure as last year, with House Foreign Operations and Senate State/Foreign Operations. This report covers funding and policy issues related to Foreign Operations and State Department programs as debated in the Senate. The discussion in the Senate tracks the House Foreign Operations Appropriation measure and the broader Senate State, Foreign Operations spending bill. Foreign Operations, with a request of $23.69 billion for FY2007, is the primary legislative vehicle for U.S. foreign assistance budget and influences executive branch foreign policy-making. It funds U.S. bilateral development assistance programs managed by USAID. Foreign Operations, managed by USAID and other agencies, includes aid programs, humanitarian assistance, and security aid for strategic countries. It also covers initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Global AIDS Initiative. The Foreign Operations spending measure includes aid programs, reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq, contributions to international organizations, and funding for export promotion agencies and embassy-related expenses. The State Department and related programs funding includes the Science, State, Justice, and Commerce appropriations in the House and the State, Foreign Operations measure in the Senate. It also covers the Broadcasting Board of Governors, U.S. contributions to international organizations, and funding for various educational and exchange organizations. Additionally, resources are allocated for international commissions and foreign policy-related commissions under the Senate bill structure. Foreign policy authorization bills are crucial for funding State Department and USAID activities. When Congress fails to pass these bills, authorization requirements are waived, and foreign affairs provisions are attached to appropriation measures. This has made the Foreign Operations appropriations bill a key tool for congressional oversight and involvement in foreign policy for the past two decades. Since 1985, Congress has not passed a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill, leading to Foreign Operations appropriations bills expanding their scope to shape foreign aid and policy initiatives. These measures have been crucial in modifying aid policy priorities post-Cold War and using foreign aid in the war on terrorism since 9/11, including Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction efforts. The Foreign Operations appropriations bills have been instrumental in shaping foreign aid policy post-Cold War and in the war on terrorism since 9/11. The FY2007 budget request raised key issues for Congress to consider, including the overall size of the request and competing budget proposals for domestic programs and deficit reduction. The FY2007 budget proposal includes funding for domestic programs, deficit reduction, foreign aid for the global war on terror, reconstruction aid in Iraq, the Millennium Challenge Account, global health funding for HIV/AIDS, Presidential Malaria Initiative, avian flu, and bilateral development aid programs. Congress will need to address these key issues in the appropriations bills. The FY2007 budget proposal includes funding for various programs such as the Millennium Challenge Account and HIV/AIDS. The creation of the new Director of Foreign Assistance within the State Department aims to improve coordination of U.S. foreign aid programs. Key policy and funding issues for State Department operations include Transformational Diplomacy and Public Diplomacy, with increased funding for educational and cultural exchange programs. The FY2007 budget proposal includes an 11% increase in funds for foreign aid and a 4% increase for broadcasting operations. Historically, U.S. aid programs aimed to promote economic development, policy reforms, and strengthen alliances to combat communism and Soviet threats. Aid programs also facilitated access to military bases for American armed forces. Foreign aid and diplomatic programs in the developing world supported secondary U.S. policy goals such as reducing population growth, improving healthcare and education, advancing trade interests, and protecting the environment. After the Cold War, American foreign policy focused on stopping weapons proliferation, combating drug trafficking, promoting peace in the Middle East, resolving conflicts globally, protecting human rights and religious freedom, and countering human trafficking. Foreign assistance underwent significant changes in the 1990s. During the 1990s, the United States implemented expansive aid programs in Russia and eastern-bloc states without a clear consensus on the rationale for foreign aid. The Clinton Administration emphasized \"sustainable development\" as the main strategy for USAID's foreign aid programs, focusing on economic growth, democratic systems, and stabilization. The goals of American foreign aid include economic growth, global health, democracy, conflict prevention, and humanitarian assistance. USAID has identified core operational goals such as promoting transformational development, strengthening fragile states, providing humanitarian assistance, supporting geostrategic interests, and mitigating global challenges. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy has focused on strategic importance in the war on terrorism. President Bush's National Security Strategy in 2002 established global development as a key pillar of national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign assistance budget priorities began emphasizing support for countries cooperating in the war on terrorism. The U.S. foreign policy post-9/11 focused on combating terrorism and promoting global development. Efforts included reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq, building coalitions, and public diplomacy. Additional goals were to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and combat HIV/AIDS. The Millennium Challenge Corporation was introduced as a new aid delivery concept by President Bush. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to concentrate U.S. resources in low-income countries committed to reforms. If fully funded, $5 billion annually will support economic growth and poverty reduction. Global health initiatives, including HIV/AIDS programs, are also a key focus of U.S. aid efforts. President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address introduced a $15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, with a focus on malaria through the President's Malaria Initiative. Other foreign policy goals include supporting peace in the Middle East, democratization in crisis countries, and suppressing narcotics production. The Administration introduced a \"transformational\" development agenda in 2006, creating the position of Director of Foreign Assistance at the State Department. This realignment of responsibilities at the Department and USAID could impact programs funded within the Foreign Operations spending measure. The Director of Foreign Assistance oversees foreign assistance programs managed by USAID and the State Department, providing guidance for assistance delivered through other government agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Randall Tobias, the new USAID Administrator and Director of Foreign Assistance, is tasked with developing a coordinated U.S. foreign assistance strategy and achieving the President's Transformational Development Goals. While USAID remains independent, Tobias reports to the Secretary of State for foreign policy guidance. The extent of his authority over entities outside of the State Department and USAID is still unclear. The new Director of Foreign Assistance faces challenges in coordinating entities outside the State Department and USAID. Previous attempts at coordination, like the Development Coordinating Council, have had limited impact. The creation of the DFA raises questions about implementation. The restructuring initiative aims to reform the U.S. foreign assistance program, with some supporters feeling it falls short of necessary reforms. Critics fear increased politicization of aid and marginalization of USAID. Congress may oversee the plan's progress, as Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated over the past 30 years. Foreign Operations appropriations fluctuated over the past 30 years, peaking at $35 billion in FY1985 and declining to $15.3 billion in FY1997. Funding for regular foreign aid programs rose modestly after FY1997, but supplemental spending for special activities like hurricane relief and counternarcotics initiatives in Colombia drove growth in foreign aid appropriations in the past decade. Appropriations reached unprecedented levels for FY2003-FY2005. Foreign Operations spending for FY2004 reached $41 billion, the highest level in real terms since the early 1960s. The enacted level for FY2006 was $20.8 billion, the largest in over a decade. An emergency supplemental containing $2.4 billion raised the total to $23.2 billion, making supplemental resources a significant channel of funding for U.S. international programs. Foreign Operations funding, a significant channel for U.S. international activities, has supported reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Emergency supplemental spending outside regular appropriations has been crucial for responding to unforeseen events in the national interest. Supplementals have funded major foreign policy events like the Camp David accords, Central America conflicts, Africa famine, Gulf War, and Bosnia relief. Congress approved only one significant foreign aid supplemental in eight years starting in FY1999. In FY1999, Congress approved over $1 billion in Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations for relief efforts such as Hurricane Mitch, Kosovo refugees, and embassy bombings. Subsequent years saw additional supplements for counternarcotics initiatives in Colombia, terrorism response, Afghan reconstruction, and Iraq war funding. These supplements accounted for 7-11% of total Foreign Operations spending until FY2003. The Iraq war and reconstruction supplemental for FY2003 exceeded standards, representing nearly one-third of the Foreign Operations budget. FY2004 saw even higher supplemental appropriations, doubling the budget. In FY2005, a $2.53 billion supplemental was approved for Afghan reconstruction, tsunami relief, and aid for Sudan, accounting for 11% of total Foreign Operations appropriations. In June 2006, a $2.387 billion supplemental was approved for Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Darfur, and other emergencies, representing 10% of the total. Funding for the State Department and international broadcasting has varied over the past three decades. The funding level for the State Department and international broadcasting has generally increased over the years, with spikes in funding related to overseas security issues such as terrorist attacks and embassy security concerns. In the 1980s, there was a greater recognition of the need to tighten security measures after incidents like the bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut. The Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, led by Admiral Bobby Inman, proposed new security standards for U.S. facilities worldwide. Congress provided funding in 1986 and after the 1998 embassy attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. Following 9/11, emergency appropriations raised State Department funding to record levels by FY2004. Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized the need for increased resources to address neglected technology and staffing challenges. The Administration of Foreign Affairs budget has increased significantly from $4 billion in FY2000 to $6.4 billion in FY2006, with an additional $1.4 billion provided in the FY2006 emergency supplemental. The State Department requested $6.8 billion for FY2007. House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide how to allocate funds after Congress adopts a budget resolution. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees decide how to allocate funds among subcommittees within the functional guidelines set in the budget resolution. This process, known as Section 302(b) allocation, includes determining the distribution of funds for Foreign Operations, State Department, and international food assistance programs. The overall ceilings set in the budget resolution can impact the budget limitations for the subcommittees. The Senate and House subcommittees will operate within budget limitations when marking up their annual appropriations bills. The Senate approved a budget resolution for FY2007 reducing discretionary budget authority for International Affairs to $33.5 billion, $1.6 billion less than the President's request. The House measure cut Function 150 even deeper, with $33 billion, $2.1 billion below the Administration's proposal. The Appropriations Committees can allocate the final amount among subcommittees differently than proposed by the President. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $21.3 billion allocation for Foreign Operations, which was 11% below the FY2007 request. The Committee reallocated funds from Foreign Operations and Defense/Military Quality of Life subcommittees to address budget challenges. The President submitted his FY2007 budget request, including $23.69 billion for Foreign Operations and $10.09 billion for State Department and Related Agencies appropriations, which were higher than FY2006 amounts. The FY2006 emergency supplemental provided an additional $4.3 billion for State Department and Foreign Operations, bringing the FY2006 total to over $34 billion. The FY2006 total for State Department and Foreign Operations exceeded $34 billion, nearly matching the FY2007 request. The proposed 14.3% increase for Foreign Operations in FY2007 was one of the largest in discretionary spending. Priority areas included foreign aid for the war on terrorism and Iraq reconstruction, with significant funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. The FY2007 foreign aid budget saw significant increases for key initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Additional funds were proposed for a Conflict Response Fund and debt reduction programs, with a focus on canceling debt for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Peacekeeping funds for non-U.N. sponsored operations also saw a 16% increase. The FY2007 foreign aid budget saw significant increases for key initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Account and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Peacekeeping funds for non-U.N. sponsored operations would grow by 16%, mainly due to additional resources for African Union peacekeeping activities in the Darfur region of Sudan. Funding for these major elements of the Foreign Operations request totaled $9.2 billion, or 55% higher than for FY2006. The FY2007 foreign aid budget, passed as law on February 15, provided $32.6 billion in international affairs spending. $9.56 billion was allocated for State Department Operations, diplomacy, and broadcasting, while $23.0 billion was designated for foreign assistance programs. The Continuing Resolution finalized the appropriations process for FY2007, with spending levels slightly higher than FY2006. Notable increases were seen in accounts like the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, Child Survival and Health Account, and Peacekeeping Operations. The FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act provided $21.3 billion, $597 million above FY2006 but $2.387 billion below the President's request. The House largely accepted the recommendations of the House. The House Appropriations Committee largely accepted the recommendations for the $23.69 billion request in the markup of the bill. H.R. 5522 included near full funding for HIV/AIDS and increased funding for the Global Fund, but reduced spending for the President's Malaria Initiative. Overall, H.R. 5522 provided $3.61 billion for Foreign Operations programs, slightly less than requested but more than FY2006. It also proposed funding for fragile states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, and Sudan, and allocated $522 million for Iraq. H.R. 5522 provided funding for fragile states like Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, and Sudan, as well as $522 million for Iraq. It also included $2 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, $1 billion less than requested. Additionally, the bill rescinded $200 million in cash assistance to Egypt due to concerns about financial sector reforms. Amendments were adopted to increase funding for programs addressing improvised explosive devices and human trafficking. The House bill included various amendments such as reducing administrative expenses, designating funds for counternarcotics assistance to Mexico, limiting State Department's authority on extradition waivers, prohibiting funds to organizations violating U.S. trademark laws, reducing counternarcotics funds to Mexico, prohibiting funds to Saudi Arabia, and increasing funding for certain programs. The House bill included amendments like reducing administrative expenses, counternarcotics assistance to Mexico, limiting State Department's authority on extradition waivers, and prohibiting funds to organizations violating U.S. trademark laws. Additionally, amendments included increasing Child Survival and Health funds for TB by $10 million offset by reductions in USAID's operating expenses and the Asian Development Fund. The House also defeated various amendments, such as transferring funds from Foreign Military Financing to Development Assistance, cutting ESF to Egypt, transferring funds to Global HIV/AIDS initiative and International Disaster and Famine Assistance, and prohibiting funding for programs at the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. The House-passed bill included various amendments, such as reducing funding by 1%, creating a new Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund with $522 million, and establishing a new administrative position within USAID. The Administration expressed concerns about the cuts impacting national security strategy progress. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version of the State/Foreign Operations bill on June 29 (S.Rept. 109-277), providing $21.5 billion for foreign aid programs and $9.7 billion for State Department programs. The bill consolidated programs and allocated $600 million for the Global AIDS Fund, a significant increase over the request. The Senate bill allocated $1.064 billion for a Democracy Fund, $283 million for trade capacity building, and $100 million for a Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund. It also included a reduction of $348.75 million to reduce unobligated balances in foreign aid programs. Since September 2001, American foreign aid has focused on supporting key coalition countries and global counterterrorism efforts. Congress has allocated $52.3 billion in Foreign Operations funding from FY2002-FY2006 to assist front-line states in the war on terrorism, provide anti-terrorism training, and address post-conflict needs in Iraq and surrounding countries. Approximately 43% of Foreign Operations appropriations in the past five years have supported war on terror and Iraq war-related purposes. While there is debate on the direct impact of foreign aid on reducing terrorism, many believe that economic and security assistance can indirectly address factors that terrorists exploit to recruit individuals. The FY2007 request allocated about $7 billion for fighting terrorism, with key recipients including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Jordan. Funding for the war on terror would have been higher if not for a decision to transfer security forces training and equipping responsibilities from the State Department to the Department of Defense. Military assistance programs have been ongoing. In FY2006, Congress approved shifting Afghan military aid funding from Foreign Operations to Defense Department funds, with the requirement that the Secretary of State concur with DOD decisions. H.R. 5522 provided mixed funding levels for countries fighting the war on terror, with reduced aid for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In FY2006, Congress approved shifting Afghan military aid funding from Foreign Operations to Defense Department funds. Indonesia security assistance was $12 million less than requested, while Jordan received $16 million more than proposed. The House bill provided $143.6 million for counterterrorism programs, $14 million below the request. The Administration opposed cuts in assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan, citing delays in fulfilling commitments. The Senate bill fully funded requests for Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided more aid for Indonesia and Jordan, and allocated $157.5 million for counterterrorism programs. The Senate bill provided $157.5 million as requested by the Administration, with country-specific funding levels to be determined later. The NADR account for terrorism programs was funded at $406 million, $43 million less than requested. Critics argued that unspent funds from previous years could cover Iraq's reconstruction needs. The pace of reconstruction spending in Iraq increased, with $14.77 billion obligated from the $18.44 billion total. Despite Congress providing only $61 million of the $414 million Iraq request for FY2006, the Administration requested additional funds for FY2007. Over 90% of the $18.44 billion appropriation has been obligated, with plans to disburse the entire amount by the end of FY2006. The FY2007 request included $478.8 million in Economic Support Funds for infrastructure and democracy programs, $254.6 million for rule of law programs, $16.6 million for anti-terrorism activities, $20 million for refugee assistance, and $1.2 million for International Military Education and Training. The House-passed bill provided $305.8 million in ESF support, $173 million less than proposed, with reduced funding for INCLE and MRA programs. The FY2007 funding levels for INCLE and MRA were reduced from requested amounts. Iraq may receive less counterterrorism support from the INCLE account. The Senate bill recommended transferring funding to the Democracy Fund for activities in Iraq. Egypt has been a significant recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, with the Administration requesting $455 million in economic support and $1.3 billion in military assistance for FY2007. Some lawmakers believe U.S. assistance to Egypt has not effectively promoted political and economic reform. They argue for renegotiating foreign assistance agreements with benchmarks for Egypt to meet to qualify for aid. Concerns include Egypt's support for Palestinian terrorism, suppression of its population, and dissemination of conspiracy theories. Congress has historically tied economic reforms and liberalization conditions to aid, but more recently, conditions supporting political reform have been added. The U.S. has attached conditions to Egyptian assistance to support political reform, including allocating funds for education and democracy programs. The FY2006 appropriations designated $100 million for this purpose, with a requirement that at least 50% of funds for democracy and governance be channeled through NGOs to strengthen civil society. H.R. 5522 fully funded the Administration's $1.76 billion aid package for Egypt in FY2007, with $455 million in economic aid and $1.3 billion in military assistance, but included a $200 million rescission of previous year funds. During House debate, an amendment by Representative Obey to redirect $100 million in military aid to Egypt was defeated. Obey argued for reallocating the funds to International Disaster and Famine Assistance for Darfur and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative due to concerns about Egypt's human rights record. Another failed amendment by Obey sought to delay $200 million of Egypt's military aid until future legislation was enacted. Additionally, an amendment by Subcommittee Chairman Kolbe adding report language was approved during full Committee markup. The Subcommittee Chairman Kolbe added report language clarifying the terms of Section 578(b) of the bill, specifying the rescission of $200 million of previously appropriated Economic Support Funds for Egypt. The cash aid was conditioned on Egypt meeting financial reform benchmarks, with some not implemented. H.R. 5522 stipulated $50 million for democracy and human rights programs, with half through non-governmental organizations, and $50 million for education activities. The Senate bill approved $1.758 billion for Egypt, reallocating some funding to different accounts like the Democracy Fund and Child Survival and Health. $1.3 billion remained in the FMF account, with restrictions on economic and political reforms. The bill also rescinded $300 million in prior year ESF funds. The continuing resolution provided $1.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing to Egypt and $455 million in Economic Support Funds, including $50 million for assistance for the West Bank and Gaza. The disagreement between the executive branch and Congress is over the allocation of the $3 billion budget for USAID development assistance and global health programs. The Administration's proposed cuts would reduce funding for USAID's core accounts, while increasing funding for the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President's Global AIDS Initiative. Development Assistance and Child Survival/Health funds support various long-term development activities in low-income countries, while MCC and PEPFAR programs focus on specific countries with increased funding. Critics argue that proposed cuts to Development Assistance and Child Survival/Health funds will impact poverty reduction in many countries, while MCC and PEPFAR programs focus on specific countries with severe HIV/AIDS problems. Critics support MCC and PEPFAR but believe new initiatives should not replace traditional USAID accounts. Administration officials defend budget saying MCC funds do not take away from core accounts. The MCC is not diverting funds from core accounts but prioritizing in a constrained fiscal environment. Latin America will receive similar assistance in FY2007 compared to FY2006. The House bill increased funding for Child Survival and Health by $143 million but decreased by $77 million from FY2006. Development Assistance received $1.294 billion, slightly more than the President's request. H.R. 5522 created a new account and transferred $214 million from DA to the Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund. The House bill did not fully fund the Administration's request for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, providing $2 billion instead of $3 billion. It met the Administration's request for HIV/AIDS programs but increased the contribution to $445.5 million. The Senate bill provided $1.677 billion for Child Survival and Health and $1.400 billion for Development Assistance. It recommended $283 million for trade capacity building and economic growth activities, and $1.877 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. The Senate bill allocated $1.877 billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation, $123 million less than the House bill and $1.123 billion less than the request. For HIV/AIDS programs, it met the Administration's $3.3 billion request, providing funds for various initiatives including the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, Child Survival and Health, ESF, SEED, and FSA. The U.S. contribution to the Global AIDS Fund was set at $600 million. Health programs received increased funding under the continuing resolution, with Child Survival and Health funded at $1.72 billion and the Global HIV/AIDS Initiative at $3.25 billion. Development Assistance remained at the FY2006 level of $1.51 billion. In FY2007, Development Assistance was maintained at $1.51 billion, while MCC funding remained at $1.752 billion. Beyond these accounts, funds from other Foreign Operations channels also support similar development priorities. The Global HIV/AIDS Initiative targets 15 countries with severe HIV/AIDS problems. Resources from ESF, FSA, SEED, and ACI are spent similarly to funds from DA and CSH accounts. The ACI funds are allocated similarly to DA and CSH accounts, but the rationale for aid differs as it has a more strategic or political dimension in relationships with the United States. In the past, ACI funds were co-managed by the State Department and USAID, while DA and CSH funds were controlled directly by USAID. However, under Secretary Rice's new foreign aid realignment, the Director of Foreign Assistance now oversees all State and USAID aid appropriations. The FY2007 budget request compares with FY2006 enacted amounts for bilateral economic aid Foreign Operations accounts. Agriculture programs saw a $192 million increase, with a focus on Iraq and Afghanistan due to underfunding in developing countries. Congressional directives for other sectors have limited resources for agriculture. The FY2007 budget request includes increases for agriculture in Iraq and Afghanistan, while other nations remain at or below FY2006 levels. Conflict management funding targets Sudan with a significant rise in resources. HIV/AIDS funds are redistributed, with a disagreement over the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The Administration has consistently proposed funding for the Global Fund since FY2003, with Congress appropriating varying amounts. For FY2007, the Administration requested $300 million for the Global Fund, while the House-passed foreign operations bill provided $444.5 million and the Senate State/Foreign Operations bill directed $600 million. Funding for other infectious diseases, including malaria and tuberculosis, has also increased due to initiatives like the malaria initiative and avian flu combat efforts. The FY2007 budget includes increased funding for malaria, tuberculosis, and avian influenza. President Bush announced a plan to provide $1.2 billion for malaria through FY2010. The House-passed bill cut funding for the President's Malaria Initiative and did not fully fund the Administration's request for Avian Influenza. The Senate bill provided the requested funding for malaria and avian flu. The FY2006 allocation exceeded the congressional directive, while FY2007 shifted funds to strategic countries for basic education programs. Congress typically increases levels proposed by the Administration, as seen in FY2006 where lawmakers increased the request from $341 million to $465 million. The Administration allocated $520 million for FY2006 and proposed $456 million for FY2007, focusing on more strategic countries like Afghanistan and Jordan. The House bill supported basic education programs with $550 million, while the Senate bill recommended $455.7 million. The House bill supported basic education programs with $550 million, while the Senate bill recommended $455.7 million. Family planning funds reduced, with the executive branch seeking less than $425 million for international family planning and reproductive health programs. Congress has historically supported family planning programs with larger appropriations, ranging between $432 million and $480 million in recent years. USAID Administrator Tobias defended the request for $357 million, citing the need for funding trade-offs among various health activities. The House provided $432 million for international family planning, with an additional $34 million for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) if eligible. The Senate allocated $465.3 million for family planning, with $25 million potentially available for UNFPA. Observers and Members of Congress criticized reductions in economic assistance for Latin America in the FY2007 request. Funding for Latin America from the DA and CSH accounts decreased by nearly 22%, but overall levels were not reduced as much as for core USAID development accounts. The FY2007 proposal for Latin America would have cut amounts by $51 million, or about 6% below FY2006, along with reductions in economic assistance. Critics are concerned about the withdrawal of foreign aid from Latin America, despite recent U.S. initiatives benefiting some regional countries. The FY2007 proposal for Latin America would have reduced funding by $51 million, with cuts in economic assistance. In contrast, Africa would see a significant increase of $860 million under the proposal, mainly focused on countries targeted for HIV/AIDS and malaria initiatives. Non-participating Latin American nations face flat or reduced assistance, raising concerns about decreased funding in the region. The House report on H.R. 5522 expressed concern about decreased funding for Latin America in FY2007. It directed that funding levels for various programs should not fall below FY2006 levels. The Senate bill did not include similar language. The largest funding increase in the FY2007 Foreign Operations budget was for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a program aimed at providing economic assistance to developing nations. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) focuses on promoting good governance, investing in people, and fostering enterprise. It differs from traditional U.S. aid practices with its $5 billion annual commitment and competitive process based on performance indicators. The MCA aims to link economic development to free market principles and democracy, without being tied to U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) focuses on promoting good governance, investing in people, and fostering enterprise. The request for FY2007 was $3 billion, the same as for FY2006, but substantially higher than the $1.75 billion appropriated by Congress. The MCC's Board of Directors selected 23 countries to participate in the program in FY2004-FY2006, and the Corporation has signed eight agreements, or Compacts, with Madagascar, Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Georgia, Benin, Vanuatu, and Armenia between April 2005 and May 2006. Some Members of Congress believe the initiative has started more slowly than anticipated. Some Members of Congress believe the Millennium Challenge Account initiative has started slowly, spending only small amounts of the appropriated $3.7 billion for FY2004-FY2006. They question increasing the budget for the untested program while other development assistance programs face reductions in FY2007. The MCC argues that changes have been made to accelerate the signing of more Compacts, with three signed in 2006. Existing resources are expected to be fully committed by the end of 2006, requiring an additional $3 billion for new Compacts in FY2007. President Bush pledged in 2002 that MCC spending would be additional, not a substitute for existing aid. The FY2007 budget proposal shows declines in USAID resources in countries where MCC Compacts have been signed, but reductions may not be directly linked to MCC funding. The FY2007 budget proposal shows declines in USAID resources in countries with MCC Compacts, but reductions may not be directly linked to MCC funding. The House Appropriations Committee provided $2 billion for the MCC, $1 billion under the request, while the Senate bill provided $1.877 billion, a reduction of $1.123 billion from the request. The continuing resolution maintained funding for MCC at the FY2006 level of $1.752 billion.
