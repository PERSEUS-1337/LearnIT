    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4119.8 of the Business and Professions Code allows pharmacies to provide naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist to schools with a written order from a physician and surgeon. Records of naloxone acquisition and disposal must be kept by schools for three years. Schools must monitor naloxone supply and dispose of expired medication. Section 49414.3 of the Education Code allows school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide emergency naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist to trained personnel for use in cases of opioid overdose. The term \"authorizing physician and surgeon\" includes medical professionals affiliated with educational agencies or local health departments. (2) An \"auto-injector\" is a device for injecting a premeasured dose of an opioid antagonist into the body, approved for layperson use by the FDA. (3) An \"opioid antagonist\" negates the effects of opioids in the body and is approved for treating opioid overdose. (4) A \"qualified supervisor of health\" can include a school nurse. (5) A \"volunteer\" or \"trained personnel\" is an employee designated by a school to administer naloxone or another opioid antagonist to someone experiencing or believed to be experiencing an opioid overdose after receiving training. Each school in the state can decide whether to have emergency naloxone or another opioid antagonist and trained personnel available. They must consider the emergency medical response time and if initiating emergency medical services is a suitable alternative. Private schools choosing to do so will not receive state funds for this purpose. Each school in the state may designate volunteers for training on the storage and use of naloxone or another opioid antagonist. Training must be provided at no cost during regular working hours, with no benefit or retaliation based on volunteering. An employee volunteering to administer emergency naloxone or another opioid antagonist can withdraw their offer at any time, even after receiving training. The Superintendent establishes minimum training standards for administering naloxone or other opioid antagonists, consulting with relevant organizations every five years. Training established under this subdivision includes recognizing opioid overdose symptoms, naloxone storage and use procedures, emergency follow-up protocols, CPR instruction recommendations, and adherence to medication administration guidelines. The school must keep written materials for reference. The department will have a clearinghouse on its website for training nonmedical personnel to administer naloxone or another opioid antagonist to students. Schools using naloxone must inform staff annually about volunteer training to administer the medication in case of an opioid overdose. The volunteer will receive training as described in subdivision (d) and has the right to rescind their offer. No benefits will be given or withheld based on volunteering, and there will be no retaliation for rescinding the offer, even after training. A qualified supervisor of health at a school district, county office of education, or charter school must obtain a prescription for naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist for emergency use. If no qualified supervisor is available, an administrator can fulfill this duty. The prescription can be filled by local or mail order pharmacies or manufacturers. An authorizing physician and surgeon is not liable for issuing a prescription unless it is gross negligence or willful conduct. School nurses or volunteers can administer naloxone in emergencies at school. Naloxone must be restocked promptly after use. Volunteers can administer naloxone or another opioid antagonist in nasal spray or auto-injector form. Schools must provide defense and indemnification to volunteers for any civil liability. A person trained to administer naloxone or another opioid antagonist in good faith to someone experiencing an overdose is protected from liability, professional review, or criminal prosecution. However, this protection does not apply in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Public employees volunteering to administer naloxone are not considered to be providing emergency medical care for compensation. A state agency, department, or public school can accept gifts, grants, and donations for supporting public schools, including naloxone or other opioid antagonists from manufacturers or wholesalers."
