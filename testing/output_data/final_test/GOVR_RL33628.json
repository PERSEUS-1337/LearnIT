    "content": "Trade capacity building (TCB) is development assistance to help countries participate in global trade by building physical, human, and institutional capacity. It includes support for trade agreements like those in the WTO, regional, and bilateral free trade agreements. TCB is crucial for developing countries to benefit from trade liberalization and engage in the global economy, promoting economic growth and poverty reduction. The report discusses key TCB issues, U.S. and international TCB programs, and Congressional involvement. Bilateral donors like the U.S., European Commission, European countries, Japan, Korea, and Canada provide TCB assistance. Trade capacity building (TCB) assistance is provided by various entities including the U.S. government, European Commission, individual European countries, Japan, Korea, and Canada, as well as multilateral institutions like the World Bank, WTO, and United Nations. Recipients of TCB include government ministries, customs officials, business owners, NGOs, and farmers. TCB programs involve workshops, training, data collection, feasibility studies, and infrastructure upgrades. Developing countries ideally incorporate TCB needs in their national development plans, with programs planned in partnership between recipient and donor countries. The U.S. government provides TCB assistance bilaterally and through contributions to multilateral organizations and global TCB trust funds. The U.S. government, along with other entities, provides Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance through various agencies like USAID, USDA, Department of Commerce, and MCC. TCB funding is not a separate budget item but is allocated through different initiatives. In FY2007, U.S. government agencies allocated nearly $1.4 billion to TCB, with MCC and USAID accounting for over $1 billion of that amount. The United States allocated about 25% of its total official development assistance to TCB between 2002 and 2005. Interest in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) has increased among donors, including the United States, as developing countries prioritize trade negotiations. Developing countries are actively participating in free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with the US and EU, as well as in WTO negotiations. Additional resources for TCB may be needed to address developing country needs in trade negotiations. Congress has policy interests in TCB, including potential inclusion in FTAs and consideration of implementing legislation for these agreements. Congress may need to consider legislation for potential FTAs and provide funding for TCB programs. TCB is seen as complementary to trade preference programs like AGOA and is important in WTO negotiations. The definition of TCB varies but generally includes assistance related to trade agreements. The broader definition of Trade Capacity Building (TCB) includes assistance in regulatory environment, supply-side constraints, and infrastructure. TCB aims to address adjustment costs, implementation costs of trade agreements, preference erosion, lost tariff revenue, negotiating capacity, and supply-side constraints. The risk of defining Trade Capacity Building (TCB) too broadly is that any assistance activity can be loosely categorized as TCB. Different projects in different countries may have varying objectives, with some strongly trade-related and others not qualifying as TCB. This variability poses challenges when analyzing aggregate TCB data. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) is also known as aid for trade or trade-related technical assistance (TRTA). Developing countries often lack the physical, institutional, or human capacity to effectively participate in world trade. Physical capacity includes infrastructure like ports and roads, while institutional capacity refers to the business and trade policy environment. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) focuses on enhancing institutional and human capacity for effective participation in international trade. It is based on the idea that trade liberalization can lead to economic growth, but developing countries often lack the necessary capacity. TCB complements market access and aims to assist developing countries in achieving trade-led economic growth. Increased market access through preferential treatment and trade agreements may not be enough for developing countries to boost their participation in international trade. Despite trade preference programs like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), most developing countries have not significantly increased their trade. Despite trade preference programs like AGOA, many developing countries have not diversified their exports or substantially increased their global trade. Low income countries have struggled the most, with only a slight increase in market share for non-oil trade. Middle income countries, on the other hand, have seen a significant increase in market share. Critics argue that stringent rules of origin and exclusion of competitive products are hindering trade growth. Many developing countries have not benefited from trade preference programs due to various factors such as inadequate knowledge of market opportunities, non-competitive production capacity, lack of exporting infrastructure, inability to meet standards in high value export markets, and being crowded out by domestic support and export subsidies of developed countries. This has been a long-standing issue, as highlighted in a 1980 Congressional Budget Office report. Trade preference erosion is a concern in countries like Lesotho and Bangladesh, where booming apparel industries have benefited from preference programs. However, as trade liberalization reduces the margin of preference, these industries may decline due to competition from lower-cost producers like China. Trade preference erosion is a concern for developing countries like Lesotho and Bangladesh, as trade liberalization may make them less competitive against lower-cost producers like China. To address this issue, Trade Capacity Building (TCB) can help these countries increase competitiveness and diversify into other industries. TCB is seen as a more politically feasible solution compared to monetary compensation. The United States and other donors may provide TCB to help developing countries overcome adjustment costs and transition to liberalized trade. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) aims to assist developing countries in coping with the dislocation caused by trade liberalization. This transition period may lead to unemployment, loss of value in investments, and slow economic growth, especially in rural areas. TCB helps countries increase competitiveness, diversify industries, and overcome adjustment costs during the transition to liberalized trade. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) aims to help developing countries cope with the dislocation caused by trade liberalization. In the past, the development community was skeptical about using trade for economic growth, favoring import substitution industrialization (ISI). However, after the failure of ISI policies in the 1980s, there was a shift towards removing trade barriers to foster growth. When expected gains did not materialize, the focus shifted to strengthening institutions supporting market and trade-led growth in the late 1990s. Development experts recognized the importance of liberalized trade for growth and poverty reduction, leading to the concept of Trade Capacity Building (TCB) in the 1990s. TCB assistance has been a part of U.S. development programs since the 1950s, evolving based on changes in foreign policy and development theories over the last 60 years. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) emerged in U.S. development assistance around 1999, evolving from previous technical assistance programs. TCB focuses on partnership with beneficiaries, including government, private sector, and NGOs, and is coordinated with trade policy. Trade Capacity Building (TCB) has become a significant aspect of U.S. development assistance since around 1999. U.S. government agencies provided $1.4 billion in TCB assistance worldwide in FY2007, funding various programs from agricultural development to WTO accession. The reported TCB assistance increased steadily from $370 million in 1999 to $1.4 billion in 2006 and 2007, possibly due to improved reporting and expanded activities under the TCB definition. Since around 1999, Trade Capacity Building (TCB) has been a significant aspect of U.S. development assistance. In FY2007, U.S. government agencies provided $1.4 billion in TCB assistance worldwide, funding various programs. USAID funded the majority of TCB assistance from FY1999 to FY2005, but in FY2006, the MCC became the largest funder. The MCC funded $610.3 million in FY2006 and $775.4 million in FY2007, providing TCB to developing countries, including potential FTA partners. The USTR coordinates TCB assistance through working groups with partner country governments. The CAFTA-DR TCB working group, comprised of U.S. and partner country government representatives, focuses on coordinating TCB programs for implementing the agreement. TCB funding trends varied by region, with the Middle East and North Africa receiving less assistance in 2006 and 2007 due to declines in Iraq, Egypt, and the West Bank/Gaza. In 2006 and 2007, there was a surge in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance in Sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet Republics due to MCC-funded activities. The former Soviet Republics received more typical levels of TCB assistance in FY2007 as there were no new MCC compacts. TCB assistance is often provided regionally to improve efficiency and encourage economic integration. Some projects focus on regional economic integration, while others are global in nature but may target individual countries within regions. Various U.S. agencies are involved in providing Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance, coordinated by a TCB Interagency Group led by USTR and USAID. This group meets monthly to address TCB issues such as free trade negotiations, WTO matters, and performance measures. Different agencies share TCB funding, with some also implementing TCB programs funded by other agencies. The Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture fund their own programs and implement TCB activities funded by other agencies like USAID and the State Department. Interagency cooperation is seen through the Interagency Group. The \"other\" category has a significant share in TCB program implementation. USTR plays a coordinating role in TCB, but does not implement or fund any TCB programs. USTR coordinates TCB programs but does not implement or fund them. Various U.S. government agencies provide TCB, offering expertise and funding options. For example, the Department of Agriculture's APHIS helps protect U.S. agriculture from foreign pests and diseases. Obtaining clearance from APHIS has been difficult for agricultural producers from developing countries. Bringing APHIS into TCB has raised awareness of the issue, but concerns exist about conflicting missions between regulatory agencies and TCB. Coordination among U.S. government agencies in TCB can be challenging. TCB is a core strategy of USAID, outlined in its 2003 document \"Building Trade Capacity in the Developing World.\" USAID's Trade Capacity Building (TCB) strategy aims to increase developing countries' participation in global economic forces for growth and income. Programs focus on improving economic responsiveness through strengthening commercial laws, trade-related services, and addressing supply-side constraints. USAID supports trade negotiations, implementation of agreements, and trade liberalization to achieve its goal. USAID responds to increasing demand for assistance in trade negotiations and implementation of trade agreements with developing countries. TCB activities are planned, funded, and implemented at both agency and country levels, targeting countries committed to reform and openness, especially LDCs. Field missions have flexibility to address individual country TCB needs, considering local trade factors and opportunities like FTA negotiations. The MCC provides TCB assistance to select developing countries based on governance and economic reform criteria. MCC-eligible countries define their own priorities and submit proposals for trade-related projects, forming the basis for five-year compacts negotiated with the MCC. The MCC provides TCB assistance to eligible countries through five-year compacts. In FY2005, commitments totaled $369 million to Honduras, Nicaragua, and Madagascar. FY2006 saw commitments of $610 million to countries like Armenia and Georgia. In FY2007, $775 million was obligated to countries like El Salvador and Ukraine, with 70% for infrastructure development. The MCC may continue high levels of TCB assistance as more countries sign compacts. The Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) of the U.S. Department of Labor funds programs to help developing countries adhere to international labor standards, especially with regard to child labor. ILAB partners with the International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (ILO/IPEC) to implement projects worldwide. In FY2007, ILAB funded about $51 million in projects. Additionally, ILAB implemented $12 million in projects funded by USAID and the State Department for labor technical assistance. In FY2007, the State Department funded $101 million and implemented $72 million in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) projects globally, with a focus on meeting international labor standards for trade preferences. Some question the direct benefits of including labor activities in TCB. The State Department allocated $47 million for educational exchange programs, including the Academic Exchange Program and International Visitors Leadership Program, both emphasizing trade-related topics. In FY2007, the State Department funded $101 million for Trade Capacity Building (TCB) projects globally, focusing on trade-related topics. $19 million went to multilateral TCB programs, and $6 million to global, regional, and bilateral programs. The Export-Import Bank assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and services to international markets. The Ex-Im Bank provides pre-export financing, credit insurance, loan guarantees, and direct loans. In 2007, they funded $4 million for TCB programs, mainly in infrastructure and tourism. They committed $50 million in FY2005, with $42 million for physical infrastructure development. For example, they financed Ethiopian Airlines for aircraft equipment. In FY2006, the DOT implemented $26 million in TCB assistance, mostly for Afghanistan funded by USAID. In 2007, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded about $23 million in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) programs, with half of the funding supporting physical infrastructure projects in developing and middle-income countries. This assistance included projects to improve the Kabul International Airport and rebuild the Afghanistan Civil Aviation System, funded by USAID. In 2007, USTDA provided $23 million in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance, with half supporting physical infrastructure projects. The largest recipients were Burkina Faso, Uganda, and Vietnam. USDA funded $5.1 million and implemented $15.8 million in TCB assistance, with $8 million in trade-related agriculture activities. USAID and the Department of State also provided funding for TCB projects. In FY2007, various U.S. government agencies provided Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance to developing countries. The USDA focused on technical assistance for producers and compliance with WTO agreements, while the U.S. Treasury Department offered advisors in financial management. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) supported U.S. businesses investing in developing countries through financial instruments. OPIC implemented $27 million in TCB programs in FY2007. In FY2007, various U.S. government agencies provided Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance to developing countries. OPIC implemented $27 million in TCB programs, focusing on physical infrastructure and financial sector development. The Department of Commerce implemented $17 million in TCB programs, including commercial legal development. The Department of Homeland Security implemented $3 million in TCB for border security training. Peace Corps and Department of Energy also provided TCB assistance in areas like e-commerce and business development. In FY2007, various U.S. government agencies provided Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance to developing countries. The State Department funded $2 million in TCB assistance in former Soviet Union republics. Other agencies implemented programs totaling $4.7 million, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Trade Commission, Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Justice. TCB is provided by multilateral development banks and through multilateral funds managed by the WTO. Trade Capacity Building is commonly referred to as 'Aid for Trade' and 'Trade-Related Technical Assistance' within the WTO. The WTO provides Technical Assistance (TRTA) to developing country members to help them understand and implement WTO agreements. Developed countries support this assistance to ensure developing countries can comply with agreements and participate in trade negotiations. The WTO funds TCB through the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund and the Integrated Framework. The United States has contributed nearly $6 million to the trust fund since the launch of the Doha round. Total contributions to the fund were about $47 million from January 2005 to September 2007. The United States has contributed $6 million to the Doha round fund for Technical Capacity Building (TCB), with a recent $1 million donation in April 2006. At the Hong Kong ministerial in December 2005, the U.S. pledged to increase TCB spending to $2.7 billion by 2010. The WTO collaborates with the OECD to monitor TCB globally, encouraging donors and developing countries to enhance its effectiveness. Reports of bilateral TCB assistance are submitted to the WTO for compilation in a joint database. Technical assistance is also discussed in WTO negotiations. The WTO provides technical assistance in various negotiating areas to enhance developing countries' capacity to address trade policy issues, incorporate trade into national development plans, participate in the multilateral trade system, and comply with WTO rules. Discussions on technical assistance take place in the Committee on Trade and Development and the Aid for Trade Task Force. The WTO delivers technical assistance in various areas to help developing countries enhance their capacity to address trade policy issues, comply with WTO rules, and participate in the multilateral trade system. Critics have raised concerns about the superficial nature of the training provided by the WTO, leading to a reduction in the number of training activities. The WTO Aid for Trade Task Force was established to make recommendations on how to effectively operationalize aid for trade and contribute to the DDA. The WTO Aid for Trade Task Force released recommendations at a WTO General Council meeting in July 2006, endorsing aid for trade despite the suspension of Doha negotiations. The Task Force emphasized that aid for trade should complement, not substitute, the development benefits of a successful DDA conclusion. WTO members agreed to implement the Task Force's recommendations, which include guidance on financing and overcoming challenges associated with aid for trade. The WTO Aid for Trade Task Force recommends that aid for trade should follow the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, focusing on country ownership, donor coordination, aligning aid to national development strategies, and monitoring and evaluation. The Task Force also suggests improving the Integrated Framework and extending its needs-assessment process to non-LDC developing countries. The Integrated Framework assists Least Developed Countries in integrating trade issues into their national development strategies, aiming to better coordinate aid for trade globally and within countries, and integrate it with general development assistance objectives. Six international institutions collaborate on the Integrated Framework. The Integrated Framework (IF) is funded by a trust fund with contributions from various organizations, including the United States. The first stage of the IF process involves developing a Diagnostic for a Trade Integration Study (DTIS) to identify trade constraints and create an action plan for integrating countries into the global trading system. The DTIS is a collaborative effort between beneficiary country officials, economists from international institutions, and experts from donor countries. The Integrated Framework (IF) includes an action plan integrated into the country's national development strategy, usually the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). Bilateral donors provide Trade Capacity Building (TCB) to implement the action plan, with initial funding from the IF trust fund. Critics suggest more IF funding for action plan implementation rather than relying on bilateral donors. The IF steering committee is working on the \"Enhanced Integrated Framework\" to raise additional funds for IF-implemented activities. The \"Enhanced Integrated Framework\" aims to raise extra funds for IF-implemented activities. Concerns include the level of involvement of developing country officials and citizens in preparing studies. Some suggest extending the IF to all developing country WTO members, not just LDCs. As of November 2007, 45 LDCs were at various stages of the IF process. The World Bank works on trade at both global and country levels to support development. The World Bank aims to build capacity in member countries for trade policy formulation, adjustment costs management, participation in international trade negotiations, and regional trade policy development. In 2005, global TCB commitments totaled $121 million, focusing on export development, trade facilitation, and standards. Critics have pointed out the lack of clear TCB goals and policies in the Bank's operations. The Bank is involved in the Integrated Framework for trade capacity building. Countries provide TCB through foreign assistance programs, reported to the OECD/WTO database. Congress passes legislation for TCB funding, with restrictions on countries and activities. Funds are appropriated within the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The 110th Congress directed the administration to use at least $550 million of foreign aid appropriations for trade capacity building (TCB) in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008. This funding must come from specific foreign aid accounts and has seen a slow increase over the years. In 2006, Congress recommended $522 million for TCB assistance, with a portion designated for labor and capacity building activities related to DR-CAFTA. In previous years, Congress allocated funds for Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance, with amounts ranging from $452 million to $507 million. In FY2005, there was an earmark of $20 million from ESF for TCB activities in CAFTA-DR countries. The House version of the FY2007 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill proposed a Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund of $522 million and the creation of an Office of the Director of Trade Capacity Enhancement within USAID. The House proposed a Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund of $522 million and the creation of an Office of the Director of Trade Capacity Enhancement within USAID. This initiative aimed to prioritize TCB programs and coordinate government-wide efforts. Concerns were raised about potential restrictions on foreign aid allocation and resource diversion from other priorities. The Senate and 2007 Continuing Resolution bills did not include the new fund or office. In the mid-1980s, Congress passed legislation limiting the use of foreign development assistance programs in response to U.S. farm economy issues. USAID's policies were criticized for being overly restrictive due to congressional sensitivity. The Bumpers Amendment, introduced in 1986, restricts USAID's trade-related activities in agriculture to avoid competition with US commodities. Exceptions include activities for food security in developing countries and research benefiting American producers. This has limited TCB assistance in agriculture, such as aid to West African cotton. Restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance affect Trade Capacity Building (TCB) assistance in agriculture, including aid to West African cotton farmers. Statutory restrictions, such as the Bumpers Amendment and the Nethercutt Amendment, limit TCB assistance in certain countries and projects. USAID catalogs and summarizes these restrictions. Trade capacity building (TCB) is often seen as a way for the United States and other donors to help developing countries benefit from trade and reduce poverty. One potential motivation for TCB is to create markets for U.S. exports. This can be achieved indirectly by increasing developing countries' incomes, allowing them to import more goods from the U.S. TCB can also directly create markets for U.S. exports by influencing developing countries' policies and promoting development in sectors that would require imports from the U.S. The U.S. Export-Import Bank plays a role in facilitating this process. The U.S. Export-Import Bank facilitates the process of importing American capital goods to developing countries. Trade capacity building (TCB) aims to help developing countries benefit from trade and reduce poverty. Providing TCB can also help gain cooperation in trade negotiations by assisting developing countries in understanding technical aspects and implementing agreements. This assistance can make developing countries more agreeable in negotiations, as seen in the WTO Doha Round. Technical assistance in trade facilitation and negotiations has helped countries progress more smoothly in trade talks. Some countries have made trade reforms without WTO obligations. Critics argue that U.S. trade policy may use TCB to divert attention from high tariffs and subsidies. There are concerns that U.S. TCB is driven more by political goals than development objectives. Iraq received significant TCB funds in 2005, raising questions about the allocation of assistance. Trade capacity building (TCB) assistance from the Millennium Challenge Corporation has raised questions about its use as a tool to influence developing country trade policies outside of formal negotiations. While TCB can help developing countries negotiate better, it may also lead to more aggressive stances against U.S. interests. Additionally, TCB can enhance competitiveness in global markets, potentially impacting U.S. businesses. However, increased competition through TCB can boost productivity, benefitting consumers and workers with lower prices and higher wages. Trade capacity building (TCB) assistance aims to coordinate assistance with trade policy agendas and integrate it into developing countries' national development strategies. This assistance helps reduce trade barriers through free trade agreements (FTAs) and provides new types of aid to help developing countries benefit from trade. TCB recipients, mostly poor countries, may not pose significant competition to U.S. businesses, except for a few major agricultural and textile producers receiving TCB assistance. Uneven distribution of benefits and losses from increased competition can impact job and income losses in certain regions and industries. Trade capacity building (TCB) assistance aims to integrate trade into developing countries' national development strategies. Policymakers should consider trade implications in all aspects of development planning to enhance a country's competitiveness. Challenges include aligning changing trade needs with long-term development plans and coordinating international donor efforts. One major challenge for Trade Capacity Building (TCB) is international donor coordination, which can lead to overlap and duplication of efforts. Demand-driven TCB assistance, based on recipient governments' strategies and needs, can help facilitate donor coordination. Recipients must communicate their needs, and donors should align their assistance accordingly. Close communication between donors and recipient governments, as seen in TCB provided during CAFTA-DR negotiations, can enhance effectiveness. International donor coordination in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) is hindered by recipient countries lacking the capacity to assess and prioritize their needs. Coordination challenges arise from multiple short-term projects rather than a long-term strategy aligned with national development plans. Efforts towards donor coordination have been made through the OECD and the WTO, but issues persist due to donors preferring to take credit for their efforts and having different strategies for foreign assistance implementation. This results in supply-driven assistance based on what donors can provide. International donor coordination in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) faces challenges as assistance is supply-driven by donor countries. Assistance should align with partner countries' needs, goals, and strategies for effectiveness. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness emphasizes this principle. Evaluating TCB effectiveness is a challenge, with the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommending better monitoring and evaluation strategies. USTR and USAID are working on developing these mechanisms. The effectiveness of Trade Capacity Building (TCB) is challenging to measure as high-level indicators like trade volumes are influenced by various factors. Lower-level indicators, such as the number of people trained in WTO negotiations, may be directly linked to TCB but do not fully capture its impact. The OECD highlights that the most measurable outcomes of TCB include increased awareness of WTO issues, participation in negotiations, and the development of national trade policy dialogues among stakeholders. Effective TCB is seen where robust dialogue exists according to the OECD. The OECD finds that robust dialogue is crucial for effective Trade Capacity Building (TCB). However, U.S. TCB faces challenges as it competes with other development priorities for limited resources, such as responding to emergencies. While TCB may not directly save lives, it can reduce countries' vulnerability in the long term by increasing incomes and reducing poverty."
