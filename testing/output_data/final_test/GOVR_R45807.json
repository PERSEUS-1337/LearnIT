The BJP expanded its parliamentary majority to 56%, becoming the first party to win consecutive majorities since 1971. The Congress Party failed to win the minimum seats required to lead the Lok Sabha opposition. The BJP won a decisive victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, securing a majority of seats. The US is looking to strengthen its strategic partnership with India, particularly in defense and security cooperation. Recent tensions have emerged over trade, religious freedom, and India's relations with Russia and Iran. The State Department congratulated Prime Minister Modi and his ruling coalition for their victory. The United States congratulated the Indian government for their decisive victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and expressed commitment to strengthening the strategic partnership between the two countries. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met with Prime Minister Modi and other top Indian officials in June to discuss important issues. Members of Congress also highlighted the strategic importance of the U.S.-India relationship in an open letter to President Trump. State Michael Pompeo met with Modi and other top Indian officials in New Delhi in June to express enthusiasm about America's \"natural strategic partner.\" The partnership, inaugurated in September 2018, is showing signs of strain, with concerns about its limitations. Modi's reelection brings continuity in Indian policies, with relief among many due to the stability it offers. Modi's internationalist approach is evident in his active diplomacy with major powers. Modi's energetic pursuit of diplomacy with major powers and regional governments, including the U.S.-India strategic partnership, is rooted in shared values and visions for the global order. Despite mixed reviews on economic reforms, Modi's political support remains strong, despite challenges such as joblessness and demonetization. Market analysts are hopeful but cautious about the future. India's political system is described as competitive but plagued by corruption. In 2017, the country fell 10 places on the Democracy Index due to rising violence against minority communities. Despite these challenges, India maintained its status as a \"flawed democracy\" in 2018. The scale of India's national election poses logistical challenges. India's 2019 national election was the largest democratic exercise in history, with 880 million eligible voters across 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Over 600 million Indians participated, with a turnout rate of 67.4%. The election saw more than 8,400 candidates and 669 parties competing for 543 seats in the Lok Sabha. The campaign was also the most expensive in history, with an estimated $8.7 billion spent by parties and candidates, raising concerns about the influence of money in politics. The 2019 Indian national election saw the BJP winning by securing 303 seats with over 37% of the vote, marking a shift towards single-party domination. Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency in campaign finance, as the Modi government lifted caps on corporate donations. The BJP won the 2019 Indian national election with 303 seats and over 37% of the vote, increasing their seat total from the previous election. The Congress Party took 52 seats with 19.5% of the vote, a net gain of 8 seats. The BJP won a majority of votes in 10 states and Delhi, as well as 49.6% of the votes in Uttar Pradesh. They expanded their appeal in the east but were shut out in seven states. The Congress Party failed to win a single seat in 14 states. The BJP won the 2019 Indian national election with 303 seats and over 37% of the vote, increasing their seat total from the previous election. The Congress Party took 52 seats with 19.5% of the vote, a net gain of 8 seats. Nationally, the party failed to win a single seat in 14 states. The Lok Sabha is younger, wealthier, and better educated than before, with increased female representation. Muslim minority representation in Parliament has declined, with only a slight increase in 2019. India's parliamentarians also face criminal allegations. The \"Modi 2.0\" cabinet sees significant changes with key ministries under new leadership. Career diplomat Subramanyam Jaishankar is now External Affairs Minister, replacing Sushma Swaraj. Amit Shah is the new Home Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman is the first female Finance Minister, and Ajit Doval, known for his stance on Pakistan, has been elevated to cabinet rank. In office since 2014, a hardliner on Pakistan, elevated to cabinet rank in 2019. Congress Party hoped to reverse decline after 2014, led UPA coalition government from 2004 to 2014. Rahul Gandhi, son of Rajiv Gandhi, entered politics reluctantly, won \"family seat\" in Amethi in 2004. Oversaw Congress's worst electoral performance in 2014, but gained new shine after strong showings in 2017 Gujarat state elections and 2018 victories in three north-central states. During the 2019 campaign, Rahul Gandhi impressed with creative policy proposals and improved public speaking. Congress struggled to maintain alliances and establish new ones, facing leadership crises after their defeat. BJP and Congress are India's main national parties, winning a combined 57% of votes in 2019. In 2019, regional and caste-based parties held one-third of Lok Sabha seats, with many facing reversals. Narendra Modi was the main target of electoral opponents, but no single challenger emerged. Opposition parties formed unusual alliances, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where the effort failed. Powerful regional parties like Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and others experienced setbacks. The BJP won 18 seats in the 2019 elections, up from 2 in 2014. Only in Odisha did a major regional party, the Biju Janata Dal, withstand the BJP's campaign. Modi's mandate is unclear as his campaign focused on personal popularity rather than policy. Modi's foreign policy successes include partnerships with the US, Japan, Israel, and Gulf states, as well as a vision for the Indo-Pacific region. Critics argue he missed the opportunity to elevate India to great power status. Critics argue that Modi has squandered the opportunity to elevate India to great power status due to a lack of strategic vision. Despite domestic challenges and limited power projection capacity, some American observers doubt India's near-term potential to fulfill the role expected by the US. Modi's victory has strengthened his position domestically, potentially opening new global opportunities. With a reputation for a strong foreign policy, Modi may resist Chinese assertiveness and align closer with the US. However, Indian strategic thinkers emphasize the importance of engaging with not only the US but also Russia and Iran to serve national interests. India's relationship with the United States, Russia, and Iran may impact its willingness to align with America's Indo-Pacific strategy. While trade and economic ties are important, recent challenges have arisen. Prime Minister Modi's strong electoral mandate may embolden the BJP to push ahead with reforms. The Trump Administration is concerned about the trade deficit with India and trade practices restricting U.S. exports. The United States is concerned about the trade deficit with India and unfair trade practices that restrict U.S. exports and investment in India. There have been disappointments over India's lack of market-opening reforms during Modi's first term, leading to increased tariffs and trade restrictions. Recent tariff hikes by India on various products have raised U.S. concerns, along with issues such as inadequate intellectual property protection, restrictive e-commerce rules, and opposing stances on multilateral trade issues in the World Trade Organization. The outlook for bilateral trade relations is uncertain. President Trump terminated India's eligibility for the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on June 5, 2019, citing India's lack of assurance in providing equitable market access. In response, India announced higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, including almonds and apples, due to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs. In response to U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, India delayed applying retaliatory tariffs in 2018. President Trump criticized India's imposition of retaliatory tariffs in 2019 but hinted at a potential trade deal at the G-20 Summit. Lack of progress may lead to a Section 301 investigation of India's trade practices. The Section 301 investigation could address U.S. concerns about India's trade practices, potentially leading to trade tensions and tariff escalations. India's designation as a \"major defense partner\" by President Obama and Congress in 2016 allows for license-free access to American technologies. This designation was intended to continue under the new U.S. administration. India's designation as a \"major defense partner\" by the U.S. in 2016 allows for license-free access to American technologies. In mid-2018, India received Strategic Trade Authorization Tier-1 status, putting it on par with NATO allies. The two countries also concluded a military-to-military agreement called COMCASA. India participates in quadrilateral consultations with the U.S., Japan, and Australia, focusing on defense trade and technology sharing. Defense trade is a key aspect of the bilateral partnership, with India being a major purchaser in the global arms market.

India participates in quadrilateral consultations with the U.S., Japan, and Australia, focusing on defense trade and technology sharing. The bilateral partnership has seen defense contracts worth about $15 billion since 2008, with growing intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation. India's homeland security cooperation with the U.S. includes engagement in mutual legal assistance, extradition, cyberterrorism, and cybersecurity. India endorses the FOIP strategy and Modi promotes a vision of a free and inclusive Indo-Pacific. India remains cautious about joining security architectures that may provoke Beijing. Modi's win in India likely means a continuation of New Delhi's multilateralist approach in Asia and efforts to resist Chinese assertiveness in South Asia. India-China relations have been tense due to border disputes, China's support for Pakistan, and China's presence in the Indian Ocean region. India is wary of Beijing's attempts to contain its influence. The United States aims to reduce India-Pakistan conflict. The United States aims to assist in reducing India-Pakistan conflict and its impact on developments in Afghanistan. Indian nationalism surged after a 2019 crisis with Pakistan, boosting Modi's electoral prospects. Modi's reelection may lead to a new peace initiative with Islamabad or continued punitive policies. Some analysts believe Modi has the standing to change tack, while others see his belligerent policy toward Pakistan as vindicated. India's close ties with Russia for defense imports could lead to U.S. sanctions under CAATSA. Despite U.S. pressure to cancel a deal for the Russian S-400 air defense system, India insists on pursuing its national interest. India also maintains friendly relations with Iran, which supplies about 30% of its needs. India has historically friendly relations with Iran, a key energy supplier, but opposes Iran's nuclear weapons acquisition. New Delhi faced U.S. sanctions for Iranian oil purchases, impacting its economy. The Trump Administration seeks greater Indian involvement in Afghanistan. India's involvement in Afghanistan, including financial support for reconstruction, has caused tension with Pakistan. Analysts predict stronger ties between India and Afghanistan under Modi's leadership. India's strategic partnership with Japan is a key aspect of its \"Act East\" policy and aligns with broader FOIP strategies. Modi's friendly relationship with Japan's leader enhances bilateral ties. The 2019 election cycle in India focused on nationalism and emotive issues, with concerns raised about Hindu majoritarianism threatening religious minorities and syncretic traditions. Human rights violations in India, some perpetrated by state actors, have raised concerns about growing religious bigotry and Hindu nationalism. Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are openly aligned with Hindu nationalism, with Modi previously denied a U.S. visa over concerns about his role in anti-Muslim violence. Modi, previously denied a U.S. visa over concerns about his role in anti-Muslim violence, has made conciliatory gestures towards minority groups after the 2019 election. However, there are concerns about the Modi/BJP mandate leading to renewed efforts towards Hindu nationalist goals, which could strain U.S.-India relations. Future moves on \"Hindutva\" policies may deepen national divisions and attract international criticism."
