The Secretary has the authority to adjust these percentages with congressional notification. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended to include not-for-profit electric cooperatives, public utilities, states, territories, and Indian tribal governments as eligible entities.

Extension and expansion of credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources. Extension and expansion of credit for electricity produced from certain renewable resources. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to extend the qualified facilities deadline to 2011. Adds incremental geothermal energy and incremental hydropower production as qualified energy resources. The term 'incremental geothermal production' refers to the excess electricity produced from a geothermal facility over a specified period, compared to its average production in previous years. The subsection (d)(9) addresses incremental hydropower production, reducing the calculated amount each year by the average percentage decrease in annual kilowatt hour production over a 7-year period, capped at 30 percent. The text chunk discusses determining incremental hydropower production based on efficiency improvements or capacity additions at a hydropower facility. It involves establishing a percentage of average annual hydropower production attributable to these improvements using water flow information. The text chunk discusses determining incremental geothermal facility eligibility for tax credits based on electricity production using geothermal energy. The definition of a qualified facility is limited to those originally placed in service before a certain date. The text chunk defines a qualified facility as a non-Federal hydroelectric facility owned by the taxpayer using incremental hydropower to produce electricity. The facility must have been originally placed in service before a specific date to be eligible for tax credits. The amendments made by this section apply to facilities placed in service after December 31, 2005. SEC. 4. CREDIT FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENT PROPERTY. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for residential solar and geothermal property. Applies to facilities placed in service after December 31, 2005. The text chunk discusses a tax credit for qualified energy property expenditures made by individuals. The credit is equal to 10 percent of the expenditures and has limitations such as the property's original use commencing with the taxpayer and remaining in use for at least 5 years. The property must be installed in a dwelling unit in the United States used as a residence by the taxpayer. Expenditure for energy property is subject to special rules, such as solar panels being considered property even if they are a structural component of a roof. Expenditures for energy storage mediums with other functions are not eligible for tax credit. In cases of joint occupancy of a dwelling unit, the tax credit allowable for energy expenditures is determined by treating all occupants as one taxpayer for the calendar year. Each individual can claim a credit for their share of the expenditures in the taxable year when the calendar year ends. For joint occupancy of a dwelling unit, the tax credit for energy expenditures is determined by treating all occupants as one taxpayer for the calendar year. Each individual can claim a credit for their share of the expenditures when the calendar year ends. Individual tenant-stockholders in cooperative housing corporations and condominium owners are also eligible for tax credits based on their proportionate share of expenditures. Individuals who are members of a condominium management association are treated as having made their proportionate share of the association's expenditures. The term 'condominium management association' refers to an organization meeting specific requirements for a residential condominium project. If less than 80 percent of the units are used as residences, allocation rules apply. Allocation rules apply when less than 80 percent of an item is used for nonbusiness purposes. Expenditures for items are considered made upon completion of installation, except for building construction where it is when the structure is first used. The taxpayer's use of the structure begins when the expenditure is made. Expenditures from subsidized energy financing are not considered. Basis adjustments are made if a credit is allowed for any expenditure on the property. Conforming amendments are also included. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow a credit under section 25C for certain amounts. Basis adjustments are made for property expenditures eligible for the credit. Conforming amendments are included in the legislation. The amendments made by SEC. 5 and SEC. 6 delay the phaseout of deductions for clean-fuel vehicles and credits for qualified electric vehicles, respectively. The effective date for both amendments is after December 31, 2005."
