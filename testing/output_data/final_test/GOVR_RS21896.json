    "content": "Congress is taking steps to increase oversight of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in response to accounting scandals and housing issues. The Treasury Department may have more authority to regulate their debt issuances based on language in their charters. The Treasury Secretary has authority over Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's debt issuances to coordinate with the Department of the Treasury's own debt issuances. Reports suggest the Treasury Department may regulate the amount of debt Fannie and Freddie can issue. The Supreme Court's Chevron deference principle applies to agency interpretations of statutes, but only when Congress has delegated rule-making authority. The Treasury Department's proposed interpretation of regulating Fannie and Freddie's debt issuance will be analyzed under Chevron and Skidmore deference. The Treasury Department's interpretation of Fannie and Freddie's debt issuance will be analyzed under Chevron and Skidmore deference. The statutes clearly give the Treasury Secretary approval authority over their debt issuances, without limitations to a traditional role. The Secretary of the Treasury has the power to approve or disapprove debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as stated in their charters. This approval authority implies the ability to withhold approval. In cases of ambiguity, the Supreme Court has considered congressional and agency actions to interpret statutory language. The Treasury Department has the authority to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's debt issuances, as stated in their charters. Unlike the FDA in a previous case, the Treasury Department has not disclaimed this authority. Congress has not passed any legislation indicating a different intent from the statutory language, allowing the Treasury Department to potentially exercise its regulatory power in a different manner. The Treasury Department has the authority to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's debt issuances, as stated in their charters. Agencies must be allowed to adapt their rules to changing circumstances. The reported proposed exercise of authority by the Treasury Department would likely be legal under Chevron's second prong, which requires courts to accept an agency's interpretation if it is reasonable. Congress could have limited the Treasury Department's approval authority but chose not to. Congress could have limited the Treasury Department's approval authority, but chose instead to use broad language, leading to a likely broad interpretation of that authority. Under the Skidmore analysis, the court considers the agency's interpretation as one tool among many in determining the statute's meaning. The statutory language should be the initial focus for courts in statutory interpretation, with the Supreme Court emphasizing that the meaning of the statute must be found in the language itself. The approval power granted to the Secretary of the Treasury is unambiguously stated without limitations, making legislative history irrelevant for interpretation. The legislative history can be examined even for clear statutes, especially if it contradicts the language. Fannie Mae's authority to issue debt obligations was conditioned on the Secretary of the Treasury's approval in 1954, despite being authorized since 1934. The Secretary of the Treasury was given broad authority to regulate Fannie Mae's debt issuances, coordinating them with Treasury Department's debt issuances. In 1989, Freddie Mac was granted similar powers to issue debt parallel to Fannie Mae. The House Report granted the Secretary of the Treasury approval authority over Freddie Mac's issuance of debt obligations and securities, similar to the powers already held over Fannie Mae. The Treasury is expected to ensure that Freddie Mac's financing activities align with its statutory purpose, acting as a \"traffic cop\" to oversee the orderly marketing of securities. The Secretary of the Treasury has approval authority over Freddie Mac's financing activities to ensure orderly marketing of securities. Congress may have had a different intent in mind when granting this authority, but historical practices suggest otherwise. The 1989 report language may not be sufficient to limit the Secretary's power in this regard. The language in the committee's opinion does not hold the same weight as a statute passed by Congress. Federal statutes must go through the proper legislative process to become law. While committee reports are important for interpretation, they must be considered alongside the statutory language. Courts cannot enforce principles solely based on legislative history without a statutory basis. Congress could have explicitly limited the Treasury Secretary's authority but chose not to do so. The report language does not completely constrain the Treasury Secretary's authority, as Congress chose not to explicitly limit it. The language describes the department functioning largely as a \"traffic cop,\" suggesting other ways for Treasury to exercise authority. The legislative history does not clearly indicate that courts should deviate from the statutory language. Additionally, the Treasury Department's opinion on regulating debt issuances by Fannie and Freddie would be considered in a Skidmore analysis. The Treasury Secretary has the authority to regulate debt issuances by Fannie and Freddie, with the likely outcome being the same under Skidmore analysis as under Chevron deference."
