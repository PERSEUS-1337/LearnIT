    "content": "Consumers in the United States have shown interest in environmentally friendly products, leading manufacturers to promote the environmental benefits of their products in marketing materials. Environmental claims can be self-declared or certified by a third party, but concerns have been raised about the potential for these messages to deceive consumers. The report examines the FTC's role in regulating environmental marketing claims to prevent deception of consumers and ensure fair competition in the marketplace. It discusses the FTC's enforcement powers under the FTC Act, including their application to claims made by foreign entities. The report discusses the FTC's enforcement powers under the FTC Act regarding environmental marketing claims and legal issues related to regulating such claims, including First Amendment concerns and federal preemption of state law. It does not address the role of other federal agencies in regulating environmental claims or the use of the Lanham Act for private actions against deceptive claims. Additionally, it does not cover private industry self-regulation through the National Advertising Division. The FTC derives its consumer protection powers from Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce. The commission can issue trade rules, investigate practices, and enforce the act through administrative or judicial processes. There is no private right of action under the FTC Act. The FTC Act authorizes the commission to promulgate trade regulation rules, interpretive rules, and policy statements addressing unfair or deceptive acts in commerce. Trade regulation rules must follow specific procedures outlined in the FTC Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. These rules are subject to judicial review and entities can petition for exemptions. Additionally, the FTC Act grants the commission general rulemaking powers and the authority to investigate certain trade practices. The FTC Act grants the FTC general rulemaking powers to investigate trade practices, including foreign practices. The commission may require reports, share information with law enforcement agencies, and enforce the act through administrative and judicial processes. This includes issuing cease and desist orders for violations. The FTC may seek civil penalties, injunctions, and other relief in federal court if an entity violates a final order. Respondents often settle with the FTC, agreeing to a consent order without admitting liability. The FTC Act allows for various forms of relief, such as injunctive relief, civil penalties, and consumer redress. Cases are often settled before trial. Section 13(b) of the FTC Act allows the FTC to seek injunctive relief in federal court if there is reason to believe a violation is occurring. This relief can include monetary consumer redress and civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation for entities knowingly violating FTC rules on unfair or deceptive acts. The FTC can seek civil penalties against entities violating FTC rules on unfair or deceptive acts, even if they had prior knowledge of the violation. The commission can also seek redress for consumers in court for violations of trade regulation rules or final cease and desist orders. The FTC can seek civil penalties for violations of unfair or deceptive acts, including rescission or reformation of contracts, refunds, damages, and public notification. Complaints about cross-border fraud are common, with foreign entities sometimes making false environmental claims that harm U.S. consumers. Congress amended the FTC Act to address cross-border fraud. Congress amended the FTC Act in 2006 to expand the FTC's international enforcement authorities, allowing greater cooperation with foreign countries and extraterritorial application of the FTC Act by U.S. courts to certain conduct by foreign entities. However, litigating cases against foreign defendants without a legal presence in the U.S. poses challenges such as serving process, personal jurisdiction, discovery abroad, and enforcement of U.S. judgments by foreign courts. The FTC can assist foreign law enforcement agencies in investigations and enforcement actions involving potential violations of foreign consumer protection laws. They can negotiate international agreements with foreign agencies for information and enforcement assistance. Commission attorneys may help the Attorney General in foreign litigation, and the FTC can reimburse the Attorney General for retaining foreign counsel. This expands the FTC's international enforcement authorities, allowing cooperation with foreign countries and extraterritorial application of the FTC Act. The FTC Act allows for extraterritorial application to protect U.S. consumers from conduct in foreign countries that may cause harm within the United States. Amendments in the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 clarify the FTC's enforcement powers for unfair or deceptive acts that impact the U.S. or involve conduct within the U.S. Congress's intent is demonstrated through these amendments. The U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 clarifies the extraterritorial application of the FTC Act to protect U.S. consumers from foreign conduct that affects them. The amendments show Congress's intent for the FTC to enforce against foreign companies impacting U.S. consumers, even if the conduct occurs outside the United States. However, challenges may arise in litigating against foreign entities without a legal presence in the U.S. The FTC enforces Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, including environmental marketing claims. The agency issues nonbinding \"Green Guides\" to interpret Section 5 for businesses and the public. Enforcement actions must show a violation of Section 5 or other applicable laws. The U.S. SAFE WEB Act allows the FTC to pursue foreign companies impacting U.S. consumers, even if the conduct occurs outside the U.S. Challenges may arise in litigating against foreign entities without a U.S. legal presence. The FTC enforces laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, including environmental marketing claims. The agency provides guidance through nonbinding \"Green Guides\" to assist businesses and consumers in understanding lawful environmental marketing claims. These guides build upon existing agency policies on deception and advertising substantiation. The Green Guides provide general principles for environmental marketing claims, including claim qualification, overstatement of attributes, comparisons between products, and unqualified benefit claims. They also offer guidance on specific claims like carbon offsets, certifications, \"free-of\" claims, renewable materials, and more. The guides do not include specific regulations. The Green Guides offer general principles for environmental marketing claims, including various types of claims like content, refillable, and source reduction claims. They are not legally binding FTC rules but provide interpretations of how the FTC views environmental marketing claims under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Compliance with state laws does not exempt from FTC enforcement, and the FTC enforces trade regulation rules under the FTC Act. The FTC enforces laws regulating environmental marketing claims, including the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) which directs the FTC to create labeling rules for energy and water use of consumer products. EnergyGuide labels must display estimated annual operating costs. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the FTC to establish uniform labeling requirements for alternative fuels and vehicles to assist consumers in their purchasing decisions. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1990 prohibits misrepresentation of tuna products as \"dolphin safe\" if harvested in a harmful manner. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 regulate the labeling of alternative fuels and vehicles to aid consumers in making informed purchasing decisions. The FTC enforces these regulations to ensure proper representation of automotive fuel ratings and biomass-based diesel content. In the environmental marketing context, the FTC or Attorney General files complaints against entities for unfair or deceptive practices related to environmental claims in advertising or selling products. Allegations include misrepresentations, failure to substantiate claims, or deceptive omissions of material facts. Examples of violations include false claims about recycled content, recyclability, degradability, chemical-free status, and certifications. The FTC or Attorney General files complaints against entities for unfair or deceptive environmental marketing practices, including misrepresentations about product attributes like biodegradability, energy savings, and certifications. Enforcement actions have been taken for misrepresentations about LED lamps, fuel additives, pesticides, and coffee filters. The FTC enforces trade regulation rules and has settled cases with entities for misrepresentations regarding product attributes. Consent orders require entities to refrain from making false environmental benefit claims and to provide evidence to substantiate any representations. The FTC enforces trade regulation rules and settles cases with entities for misrepresentations regarding product attributes. Consent orders require entities to comply with record-keeping requirements, disseminate the order, notify the commission of major events, and submit a compliance report. Environmental marketing messages have the potential to deceive consumers and may discourage companies from creating more environmentally beneficial products. Environmental marketing claims can be certified by a government or third party through a \"seal of approval\" or \"environmental label\" based on specific criteria. The FTC enforces regulations on these claims under Section 5 of the FTC Act, with nonbinding guidelines provided in the Green Guides. Federal agencies also enforce laws on specific environmental claims like \"dolphin-safe\" or \"organic.\" The federal government has established voluntary labeling programs like Energy Star for environmental claims. Manufacturers may need to disclose product information on labels. Environmental marketing claims are shaped by the FTC's Green Guides and private standards like ISO 14020. Regulations can include government standards or private voluntary standards for stricter requirements. The federal government has established voluntary labeling programs like Energy Star for environmental claims, which could be expanded to cover more product categories and attributes. Congress could compel manufacturers to disclose certain environmental attributes of a product or its packaging, as it has done with the EnergyGuide label. Legal issues potentially implicated by federal regulation of environmental marketing claims are examined. Challenges related to the First Amendment right to free speech may arise from federal regulation of environmental marketing claims. This section discusses the tests a reviewing court may apply in a First Amendment challenge to legislative schemes regulating environmental claims in advertisements and on product labels. Legislation could regulate how manufacturers make certain claims about their products, raising questions about the constitutional limits of regulating commercial speech. Requiring manufacturers to disclose environmental information in advertisements and labels may raise questions about the constitutionality of compelling commercial speech. The Supreme Court affords less protection to commercial speech than other forms of expression, subjecting it to intermediate scrutiny. Commercial speech involves proposing a commercial transaction and is characterized by advertising that references a specific product with an economic motivation. The Central Hudson test analyzes the permissibility of regulating commercial speech under the First Amendment. It requires that the speech be lawful and not misleading, there must be a substantial government interest, the regulation must directly advance that interest, and the restriction must not be more extensive than necessary. The Central Hudson test analyzes the permissibility of regulating commercial speech under the First Amendment. The restriction must be no more extensive than necessary to further the government interest. The fit between the regulation and the interest need not be perfect, but simply reasonable. If a restriction applies where commercial and noncommercial speech are inseparable, strict scrutiny analysis is required. A 1994 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit provides a sample case for a First Amendment challenge to restrictions on speech relating to environmental marketing. In 1990, California enacted a law prohibiting misleading environmental marketing claims on consumer goods. The law was challenged in court for restricting commercial and noncommercial speech. The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the law regulated noncommercial speech, stating that it only restricted claims about specific consumer goods in advertisements. The speech met the criteria for commercial speech and was subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Central Hudson test. The court in Central Hudson determined that the speech in question should be protected under the First Amendment as it pertained to lawful activity and was not blatantly misleading. Terms like \"recyclable\" and \"biodegradable\" were considered potentially misleading due to factors like access to recycling facilities and composting techniques. California's interest in truthful environmental advertising and recycling was found to be substantial. The statute was deemed to directly advance California's interests, as environmental marketing was shown to increase consumer demand for eco-friendly products. The court determined that standardized terms for environmental marketing would prevent misleading claims and promote consumer protection. It found no less restrictive alternatives available to achieve California's interests in truthful advertising. Legislation regulating environmental marketing claims in advertisements and labels must align with the government's interest in overseeing commercial speech. Compelling commercial speech, like requiring disclosure of environmental information, may face different standards of review. Requiring accurate, factual information in commercial speech does not violate First Amendment values. Compelled commercial speech, such as environmental marketing requirements, must meet criteria established in Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel. The disclosure must be factual, related to a legitimate government interest, and not unduly burdensome. This relaxed scrutiny applies to promoting efficient information exchange or protecting individual liberty interests. Laws regulating environmental marketing claims on product labels may raise trade obligation issues under WTO agreements like GATT and TBT Agreement. The GATT prohibits discrimination against imported products unless an exception applies. The WTO agreements, including the TBT Agreement, focus on ensuring that labeling measures do not hinder international trade while allowing for actions to protect human health and the environment. WTO Members, like the United States, must comply with the TBT Agreement's disciplines. If a Member believes a labeling measure is not in compliance, they can challenge it through WTO procedures. Dispute settlement under the TBT Agreement follows the rules of the GATT. The WTO Members have challenged the U.S. environmental marketing laws, specifically the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1990 (DPCIA), for violating the TBT Agreement by discriminating against tuna products imported from Mexico. In response, the United States modified its regulations to comply with the TBT Agreement. The United States modified its regulations to comply with the Appellate Body's ruling on the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1990 (DPCIA). Mexico requested a compliance panel to assess if the changes brought the regulations in line with WTO obligations. The analysis focuses on the TBT Agreement's trade obligations regarding environmental marketing claims on product labels. The United States must comply with trade obligations under the TBT Agreement for labeling measures on consumer products, including requirements for nondiscrimination, transparency, and reliance on international standards. Compliance is necessary for measures defined as \"technical regulations\" or \"standards\" by a WTO panel. States must ensure compliance with the Code of Good Practice for Standards in the TBT Agreement. Environmental labeling measures may qualify as technical regulations under Annex 1.1, with criteria for marking products falling within this definition. The United States has obligations under the TBT Agreement for such measures. An environmental labeling measure may qualify as a technical regulation under the TBT Agreement, laying down mandatory product characteristics for products that claim to be biodegradable. Compliance with the Code of Good Practice for Standards is required, with criteria for marking products falling within this definition. The United States has obligations under the TBT Agreement for such measures. The Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) in the United States lays down mandatory product characteristics for tuna products labeled as \"dolphin-safe.\" It prohibits the voluntary use of such labels if the product's harvesting methods do not meet certain dolphin safety criteria, with penalties for non-compliance. This measure falls under the TBT Agreement as a technical regulation. Environmental labeling measures may regulate claims on product characteristics, including non-product-related processes and production methods (NPR PPMs). An example is a law requiring furniture to be made with \"sustainably managed wood\" to carry a certain label. The TBT Agreement's coverage of labeling measures for NPR PPMs is unclear due to ambiguity in the text, potentially leading to GATT obligations for U.S. labeling measures. The TBT Agreement's coverage of labeling measures for NPR PPMs is ambiguous, potentially leading to GATT obligations for U.S. labeling measures. GATT provisions may not allow treating imported products less favorably based solely on differing PPMs, raising questions about compliance and potential defenses under GATT Article XX. The United States may have WTO obligations regarding environmental labeling measures under the TBT Agreement, including nondiscrimination, trade-restrictiveness, transparency, and reliance on international standards. This includes ensuring that imported products are not treated less favorably than domestic or products from other countries. A panel determining competitive relationships between products may consider factors like health and environmental concerns. This could lead to imported products being treated less favorably under U.S. environmental labeling measures compared to domestic or products from other countries. The Appellate Body considers if a measure discriminates against imported products by granting them less favorable treatment than domestic or products from another country. Access to an environmental label may provide a marketplace advantage, so denying access to imported products could be seen as treating them less favorably. A violation under the TBT Agreement requires a genuine relationship between labeling measures and negative impacts on imported products' competitive opportunities. Discrimination may be allowed if based on a legitimate regulatory distinction, but must be even-handed to avoid violating the agreement. The TBT Agreement requires using relevant international standards for technical regulations, such as the ISO 14020 series for environmental labeling. The US may need to base its regulations on such standards to fulfill its legitimate objectives. The United States must use relevant international standards as the basis for regulations, ensuring they align with the same product characteristics or subject matter. The standard must be the fundamental principle of the regulation and not contradictory. This is necessary for fulfilling legitimate objectives, such as environmental labeling using ISO 14020 series. The WTO panels have suggested that an international standard may be ineffective or inappropriate for providing consumers with information if it does not allow the Member to convey all critical information. Technical regulations must not create unnecessary trade obstacles and should not be more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfill a legitimate objective. Legitimate objectives for environmental labeling measures include providing accurate and reliable information to protect consumers. The labeling measure aims to provide accurate information to protect consumers and ensure the safety of human health, animal and plant life, and the environment. Evaluating whether a labeling measure is trade-restrictive involves examining if it contributes to the legitimate objective pursued by the Member. The TBT Agreement promotes transparency in the promulgation of mandatory technical regulations by central government bodies. The TBT Agreement requires the United States to notify and allow comments from other Member countries on technical regulations that may impact trade. Members must make adopted technical regulations available to interested parties. There are obligations to reassess regulations to ensure they are necessary and least trade-restrictive. Regulations should be based on product performance requirements. The TBT Agreement requires technical regulations to be based on product performance requirements, not design or descriptive characteristics. It includes rules for conformity assessment by various bodies, technical assistance for developing countries, and unclear federal preemption of state laws on environmental marketing claims. Some states, like California, have specific laws regulating such claims. California's law allows conformance with the FTC's Green Guides as a safe harbor for environmental marketing claims. Scholars debate federal preemption of state laws on this issue, with arguments for uniformity and cost savings for manufacturers. Some commentators argue that states should have the authority to create environmental marketing laws that go beyond federal standards to better address local concerns. They believe that state involvement is crucial for effective enforcement against deceptive environmental marketing practices, as federal resources may be insufficient. Additionally, state laws could complement federal enforcement efforts and prevent companies from using misleading environmental claims to gain a competitive advantage. Federal regulation of environmental marketing claims under the FTC's Section 5 may discourage companies from creating more eco-friendly products. Legal issues such as First Amendment rights and preemption of state law are raised by legislation regulating manufacturers' environmental claims in advertisements. Legislation requiring manufacturers to disclose environmental information in advertisements and on labels may raise constitutional questions about compelled speech. Additionally, laws regulating environmental marketing claims on product labels could pose challenges under international trade law, such as the WTO TBT Agreement. This agreement mandates adherence to obligations regarding nondiscrimination, trade-restrictiveness, transparency, and reliance on international standards for regulation. The extent to which the TBT Agreement applies to measures regulating claims on labels addressing non-product-related processes and production methods is uncertain. The debate over federal preemption of state laws in environmental marketing regulations is ongoing. While some argue for uniformity to reduce costs for manufacturers and aid consumers in evaluating claims, others believe states should have the flexibility to tailor regulations to local conditions."
