    "content": "Federal campaign finance law allows political parties to support candidates through direct contributions, coordinated expenditures, and independent expenditures. Direct contributions are subject to strict limits, while independent expenditures have no limits but cannot be coordinated with candidates. Coordinated expenditures allow parties to purchase goods or services for a campaign and discuss those expenses with the campaign. Parties can make coordinated expenditures on behalf of a campaign, reporting them to the FEC. Limits for these expenditures are determined by a formula based on office sought, state, and VAP. In 2016, Senate candidate limits ranged from $96,100 to $2.9 million. House candidate limits were $48,100 in multi-district states and $96,100 in single-district states. State party committees can authorize national expenditures. In single-district states, state party committees can authorize national party expenditures on their behalf. Parties may also make coordinated expenditures for presidential candidates, with a limit of $23.8 million for 2016. The Supreme Court's Buckley v. Valeo decision in 1976 ruled limits on independent expenditures unconstitutional but upheld limits on contributions. Independent expenditures include spending on communications that advocate for or against a specific candidate. The Buckley Court determined that spending money in the form of contributions or expenditures is protected as \"speech\" under the First Amendment. Contribution limitations are seen as a way to prevent improper influence on candidates, safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process. The Supreme Court found that FECA's expenditure limits on individuals, PACs, and candidates restrict political speech and are not justified by a significant governmental interest. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, the Court ruled that political parties have the right to make unlimited independent expenditures, and the coordinated party expenditure limit was unconstitutionally enforced against the Colorado Republican Party's radio ads criticizing a likely opponent. The Supreme Court ruled in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC that political parties can make unlimited independent expenditures. The Court found that the Colorado Republican Party's radio ads criticizing a Democratic candidate in the 1986 U.S. Senate election were protected as independent expenditures, emphasizing the importance of lack of coordination between the candidate and the source of the expenditure. The Court's opinion was limited to the constitutionality of applying FECA's coordinated party expenditure limit to an independent expenditure. The Supreme Court ruled in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC that political parties can make unlimited independent expenditures, emphasizing the importance of lack of coordination between the candidate and the source of the expenditure. In FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado II), the Court considered a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the limit on coordinated party spending, ruling that coordinated party expenditures may be constitutionally limited to prevent circumvention of FECA contribution limits. The Court invalidated a statutory provision in McConnell v. FEC that required political parties to choose between making coordinated or independent expenditures after nominating a candidate. In McConnell v. FEC, the Court found that the statute burdened parties' right to make unlimited independent expenditures, deeming it unconstitutional. Citizens United v. FEC overruled part of McConnell, invalidating restrictions on corporate and union spending for electioneering communications. The Fifth Circuit Court noted that Citizens United did not impact the Supreme Court's ruling in Colorado II, which addressed limits on independent spending. The Court in Citizens United emphasized the risk of quid pro quo with large campaign contributions. In Buckley v. Citizens United, the Court found that limiting independent expenditures does not serve any substantial government interest in preventing corruption. Bills to alter coordinated party expenditure limits have not been recently considered, such as H.R. 6286 (Cole) in the 111th Congress and S. 1091 (Corker) and H.R. 3792 (Wamp) in the 110th Congress. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration held a hearing on S. 1091 on April 18, 2007. Since the 110th Congress, legislative activity on coordinated party expenditures has been limited. Most proposals to change expenditure limits have been part of other bills. Only one bill, S. 1910, has progressed, but it was replaced by a different measure without the expenditure language. Party reliance on coordinated expenditures has decreased in recent elections. Recent elections show a shift in party spending, with a decrease in reliance on coordinated expenditures. From 2004 onwards, there has been a significant increase in total independent expenditures compared to coordinated expenditures. In 2014, the two major parties spent over eight times more on independent expenditures than on coordinated party expenditures. In 2014, there was a significant disparity in spending between independent expenditures and coordinated party expenditures, with parties favoring independent expenditures. This shift in spending patterns may be due to the absence of a presidential race and parties relying more on outside spending like super PACs. Despite some exceptions, Democrats and Republicans have generally allocated similar amounts to coordinated party expenditures since 1996. Since 1996, Republicans have consistently raised more funds than Democrats, although the gap has narrowed in recent years. In 2012, both parties raised similar amounts, with Republicans holding a slight advantage in 2006. Despite disparities, both parties have generally allocated similar amounts to coordinated party expenditures. In 2014, Democrats raised 16% more than Republicans in party fundraising ($657.2 million versus $565.7 million). If caps on party coordinated expenditures were lifted, it is suggested that both parties would likely have roughly equal resources for campaigns. Lifting the caps could allow parties to orchestrate unified campaigns with their candidates more effectively. Expenditures could shift party spending away from independent expenditures, with parties choosing between independent and coordinated expenditures based on their communication and resource needs. Coordinated expenditures could strengthen ties between parties and campaigns, while proponents of limits argue they reduce money in politics. The caps on party-coordinated expenditures are seen as reducing the amount of money in politics and preventing donors from circumventing individual contribution limits. Lifting or raising these caps may be objectionable to those who support regulating political money, as it could undermine regulatory efforts since the 1970s and go against public sentiment favoring limiting money in politics. Revisiting coordinated party expenditure limits may be relevant following the 2014 McCutcheon v. FEC Supreme Court decision on contribution limits to political parties. After the McCutcheon decision, increasing limits on coordinated party expenditures could be seen as a natural progression, allowing parties to solicit donors who were previously restricted. This could have implications for party fundraising efforts."
