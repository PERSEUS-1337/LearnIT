    "content": "The report provides background information on the Columbia-class program, a project to build 12 new ballistic missile submarines to replace aging Ohio-class submarines. The Navy considers this program a top priority and aims to procure the first boat in FY2021. Congress faces funding and oversight issues related to the program, which could impact U.S. military capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. The Columbia-class program is a top priority for the Navy, aiming to replace aging Ohio-class submarines with 12 new ballistic missile submarines. The program is discussed in CRS reports focusing on Navy shipbuilding and U.S. strategic nuclear forces. The U.S. Navy operates three types of submarines: SSNs, SSGNs, and SSBNs, each with different missions and capabilities. SSBNs are specialized submarines armed with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) for strategic nuclear deterrence. They have large-diameter vertical launch tubes to launch SLBMs and remain hidden at sea to demonstrate the US's assured second-strike capability. SSBNs, also known as \"boomers,\" are part of the US strategic nuclear deterrent force along with land-based ICBMs and long-range bombers. The Navy's SSBNs, also known as Trident submarines, are considered the most survivable leg of the US strategic nuclear deterrent force. These submarines, armed with Trident D-5 SLBMs, are virtually undetectable while on patrol. The Navy operates 14 Ohio-class SSBNs, designed and built by General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division. The DOD's 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlights the importance of maintaining the SSBN force's survivability against potential advances in anti-submarine warfare. The Ohio-class SSBNs, designed by General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division, were originally built for 30-year service lives but later certified for 42-year service lives. They undergo a midlife nuclear refueling overhaul, reducing the number of SLBMs they can carry to comply with U.S.-Russia strategic nuclear arms control limits. Eight of the 14 Ohio-class SSBNs are homeported at Bangor, WA, and the other six at Kings Bay, GA. The Ohio-class SSBNs have alternating crews to maximize time at sea. The first SSBN will reach the end of its service life in 2027, with the rest following at a rate of one per year until 2040. The Navy plans to refurbish D-5 SLBMs until 2040, transferring them to new Columbia-class SSBNs. The D-5s will be replaced by a successor after 2040. The Navy plans to refurbish D-5 SLBMs until 2040, transferring them to new Columbia-class SSBNs. The UK's Vanguard-class SSBNs will be replaced by Dreadnought-class next-generation SSBNs, each carrying eight D-5 SLBMs. The United States is providing technical assistance for the UK's Dreadnought-class program. The United States is providing technical assistance to the United Kingdom for the Dreadnought-class program, which includes building nuclear-powered submarines at two shipyards - General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division and Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding. These shipyards, along with supplier firms and research facilities in various states, contribute to the construction of submarines. The construction of submarines in the United States heavily relies on sole-source suppliers for materials. The Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier construction program also provides stability for nuclear-propulsion component suppliers. The Columbia-class program, previously known as the Ohio replacement program, is the Navy's top priority and will be funded even at the expense of other programs. The Navy's Columbia-class program aims to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs with 12 new boats to ensure strategic nuclear deterrence. This decision is based on the need for 10 operational SSBNs at any given moment, as the Ohio-class boats often undergo lengthy maintenance actions, reducing the number of available operational boats. The Columbia-class program will require 12 boats to meet the operational requirement for 10 boats due to shorter midlife overhauls compared to Ohio-class boats. The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review emphasizes delivering a minimum of 12 SSBNs for strategic capabilities. The Navy plans to procure 12 Columbia-class boats, with the first boat expected in FY2021 and the rest delivered one per year from FY2026 to FY2035. The lead boat will undergo testing and be ready for its first deterrent patrol in 2031. The SSBN force is projected to decline to 10 boats by FY2037-FY2040 before increasing. The Navy plans to procure 12 Columbia-class boats, with the first boat expected in FY2021 and the rest delivered one per year from FY2026 to FY2035. The SSBN force is projected to decline to 10 boats by FY2037-FY2040 before increasing back to 11 boats in FY2041 and 12 boats in FY2042. The Navy acknowledges the risk of having the SSBN force drop to 11 or 10 boats, as it provides little margin for unforeseen events that might require unscheduled maintenance. The projected minimum level of 11 or 10 boats can be increased to 12 or 11 boats by accelerating the planned procurement dates. The Navy plans to accelerate the procurement dates of boats 2 through 12 in the Columbia-class program, with the second boat to be procured in FY2023 instead of FY2024. The Columbia-class design includes 16 SLBM tubes and is larger in submerged displacement than the Ohio-class design. This could impact the Navy's funding plan for other shipbuilding programs during FY2022-FY2025. The Columbia-class design includes 16 SLBM tubes and is larger in submerged displacement than the Ohio-class design. The UK's Dreadnought-class SSBN will use a similar missile compartment design. The UK provided funding for the Columbia-class design. The Navy's FY2020 budget estimates the total procurement cost of the 12-ship class at $109.0 billion. The Navy estimated the total procurement cost of the Columbia-class program at $122.3 billion in then-year dollars. The lead ship in the Columbia class is estimated to cost $8.2 billion in constant 2017 dollars, with ships 2 through 12 costing $6.5 billion each in constant FY2017 dollars. The total acquisition cost of the program as of June 2018 was approximately $103.0 billion. The Columbia-class program cost as of June 2018 was $103.0 billion in constant FY2019 dollars, with $13.1 billion in research and development costs and $89.9 billion in procurement costs. The Navy estimated the average annual operation and support cost of each Columbia class boat at $119 million. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was created to financially insulate other Navy shipbuilding programs from the potential cost impact of the Columbia-class program. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was established to support the procurement of Columbia-class boats and other Navy nuclear-powered ships. The Navy plans to build Columbia-class boats jointly at GD/EB and HII/NNS, with most of the work at GD/EB. The fund also serves as a repository for special acquisition authorities to potentially reduce costs. The Navy plans to adjust the division of work on the Virginia-class attack submarine program between GD/EB and HII/NNS, with HII/NNS receiving a larger share. Congress must decide on FY2020 funding for the Columbia-class program, considering cost estimates and the risk of cost growth. CBO and GAO have highlighted the potential for cost overruns in lead ships of Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy's Columbia-class program faces a significant risk of cost growth, according to CBO and GAO. Navy officials prioritize the program, potentially impacting funding for other Navy programs. Cost growth in the Columbia-class program could affect the affordability of other DOD programs, particularly Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy's Columbia-class program faces a significant risk of cost growth, with a confidence level of 43% for the lead ship's procurement cost and 46% for ships 2 through 12. This indicates a greater than 50% chance of costs exceeding estimates. The risk analysis considered 54 parameters affecting shipbuilder labor. The risk analysis for the Navy's Columbia-class program considered 54 parameters influencing shipbuilder labor and material costs. A Navy information paper from December 1, 2017, provided confidence levels and estimated unit procurement costs. By May 2019, the Navy's confidence level for cost estimates had increased to 50%, indicating a 50% chance that procurement costs could be higher or lower than estimated. The Navy's estimate for the cost of the 12 Columbia class submarines is $85 billion, with an average cost of $7.1 billion per ship. Research and development costs would amount to $13 billion, bringing the total acquisition cost to $98 billion. This estimate is higher than previous plans due to uncertainties in future shipbuilding costs. The Columbia class in the 2019 shipbuilding plan has real cost growth and is approved to Milestone B status by the Department of Defense. The cost per thousand tons for the first Columbia is estimated to be 14% less than the first Virginia class attack submarine, with lower costs anticipated due to recycling design and technology from the Virginia class. The Navy believes that missile submarines like the Columbia class will be easier and cheaper to build compared to attack submarines such as the Virginia class. However, there is a high probability that the cost of the first Columbia and subsequent ships may exceed estimates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates costs about 9% higher than the Navy's projections. Historical data shows that ballistic missile submarines may not necessarily be cheaper to build by weight compared to attack submarines. For example, the first Ohio class submarine was more expensive to build than the lead ships of attack submarines built during the same period. The cost-to-weight ratio of submarines has remained consistent across different classes. The first Virginia class submarine cost the same by weight as the first Seawolf submarine, despite the Seawolf being larger and older. The Navy and CBO estimates for the cost of the first Columbia class submarine differ slightly. CBO estimates that 12 Columbia class submarines would cost $93 billion in total, with an average cost of $7.7 billion each. This is $0.4 billion more per submarine than the Navy's estimates. Research and development costs are estimated to be between $13 billion and $17 billion. The Navy expects a 14 percent improvement in the cost-to-weight ratio compared to the Virginia class, but CBO is less optimistic, predicting a 6 percent improvement. The CBO estimates a 6 percent cost improvement for the Navy's Columbia and Virginia class submarines due to concurrent production. The Navy purchases submarines through the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund, potentially leading to lower costs. Savings could come from special procurement authorities, allowing bulk purchases of components for multiple submarines and other ships. The Navy could save costs by using a block-buy strategy for submarines, allowing for bulk purchases of components and materials. However, this strategy may limit flexibility in changing procurement plans or purchasing fewer submarines if needed. The costs for the Columbia class submarines could exceed the Navy's estimates. The new SSBN submarine, part of the Columbia class program, is expected to be the largest ever built by the United States. It will incorporate new technology like an all-electric drive system and a nuclear reactor designed for a 42-year service life. The Navy's $115 billion cost estimate is considered unreliable due to optimistic labor hour assumptions and lack of margin for cost overruns. The Navy is updating its cost estimate for the lead submarine in the Columbia class program. An independent assessment may not be ready in time for the 2021 budget request to Congress, potentially leading to unrealistic budget projections. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund is being used to start construction early on multiple submarines, with anticipated savings from bulk component purchases not included in the cost estimate. The Navy's cost estimate for the lead submarine in the Columbia class program may have overestimated savings, potentially affecting the 2021 budget request. Congress faces oversight issues regarding technical challenges, funding-related risks, and potential delays in designing and building the submarine for its scheduled deployment in 2031. The Navy is working to mitigate technical challenges and funding risks for the Columbia-class submarine program to ensure its scheduled first deterrent patrol in 2031. Continuous Production is being implemented to reduce cost and schedule risk, with Advance Construction activities starting in June 2019 at General Dynamics Electric Boat. Advance Construction activities are set to start in June 2019 at General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries-Newport News to proactively manage schedule margin and reduce controlling path risks for COLUMBIA. Two technical challenges have occurred in the Columbia-class program, one involving an electric motor in 2017 and another involving faulty welds in the missile tube sections in 2018. Navy officials have stated that these challenges did not jeopardize the lead boat's schedule for its first patrol in 2031 due to built-in schedule margin. The Navy faced technical challenges with faulty welds in the missile tube sections of the submarine, which absorbed a significant amount of schedule margin. The electric-drive propulsion system of the Columbia-class design has also been a focus of concern, with ongoing efforts to mitigate risks through testing and validation. The Navy continues to experience problems with the electric drive system, which could potentially impact construction of the lead submarine. The Navy faced technical challenges with faulty welds in the missile tube sections of the submarine, which absorbed schedule margin. A manufacturing defect affected the propulsion motor, requiring extensive repair and consuming 9 months of schedule margin. The Navy plans to test the motor before starting production, potentially limiting timely corrective actions. The goal is to complete 83% of the Columbia class submarine's design before lead submarine construction begins in October 2020 to mitigate delays. The shipbuilder is making efforts to improve design progress and mitigate schedule risks for the aggressive construction schedule of the submarine. Additional designers have been hired, and advance construction of components will begin in fiscal year 2019. The Navy aims to mature a significant amount of the submarine's design before construction starts and begin advance construction of modules before October 2020 to meet the schedule goals. Maintaining an increased design pace is crucial to mitigate risks associated with constructing the lead submarine. The Navy is facing challenges in ensuring timely delivery of critical components for the lead submarine construction due to manufacturing defects and technology development issues. A GAO report highlighted the maturity status of critical technologies for the Columbia-class program, with the carbon dioxide removal system expected to reach full maturity in late 2019. The Navy faced challenges in identifying critical technologies for the Columbia class program. Despite the nuclear reactor being fully mature, other critical technologies like the integrated power system and the common missile compartment faced delays and issues, with the latter experiencing significant weld defects in missile tubes. The shipyard found defects in seven tubes, leading to rework due to inexperienced welders and inspectors. The Navy's Columbia class program has consumed 52 percent of its schedule margin. Delays in the integrated power system's motor production may impact the lead submarine's construction sequence. Testing of the motor is ongoing to recover schedule margin, with potential design modifications causing further delays. The Navy's Columbia class program is facing challenges with the shipbuilder behind schedule in completing the submarine's design. Despite efforts to increase design staff by 18 percent, the shipbuilder has not achieved planned efficiencies with new design software. The completion of 83 percent of the detail design by October 2020 is crucial to meet cost and schedule goals. The Navy's Columbia class program faces challenges with the shipbuilder behind schedule in completing the submarine's design. The program's design stability is based on unproven assumptions about critical technologies. The Navy aims for an aggressive construction schedule, but the $115 billion procurement cost estimate lacks reliability due to optimistic labor hour assumptions. Recommendations were made to improve cost estimates. The Navy's Columbia class program is facing challenges with the shipbuilder behind schedule in completing the submarine's design. The program's design stability is based on unproven assumptions about critical technologies, leading to unreliable cost estimates. The Navy plans to update the cost estimate for the lead ship but may not complete it in time for the fiscal year 2021 budget request. The program office aims to provide needed capabilities on schedule and at an affordable price by committing to stable requirements and reducing costs. The Columbia-class program aims to reduce costs and complete 83% of the design by construction start. The Navy plans to update cost estimates in 2019 for lead submarine funding. The program recognizes supplier base risks and focuses on manufacturing oversight. Compliance with Navy, Department of Defense, and statutory requirements for critical technologies is maintained. The program faces challenges to ensure the lead boat is ready for its first patrol in 2031. The Columbia-class program, as the Navy's top priority, requires funding and personnel to mitigate technical challenges for the lead boat's 2031 first-patrol date. However, being the program's prototype poses inherent risks. Congress is concerned about the program's impact on funding for other Navy programs, especially during the FY2026-FY2035 period when one Columbia-class boat is planned for procurement each year. The Navy plans to procure one Columbia-class boat per year starting in FY2026, requiring roughly $7 billion per year in procurement funding. Concerns exist about the potential impact of the program on funding for other Navy shipbuilding programs, with observers worried that the Columbia-class program could absorb as much as half of the Navy's shipbuilding budget during the FY2026-FY2035 period. The Navy's shipbuilding budget, increased to $24 billion annually, may be heavily impacted by the Columbia-class program, requiring $7 billion per year from FY2026. Concerns arise about funding availability for other ship types, potentially causing delays in procurement. The Navy's shipbuilding budget, increased to $24 billion annually, may be heavily impacted by the Columbia-class program, requiring $7 billion per year from FY2026. Navy officials testified that the Columbia Class program is the Navy's top acquisition priority, on track to start construction in October 2020, and deliver for its first patrol in FY 2031. Additional resources will be needed for serial production of the Columbia Class SSBN, leading to the establishment of Program Executive Office Columbia. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was created in response to concerns about the impact of the Columbia-class program on Navy funding. One option to mitigate this impact is to reduce the number of Columbia-class boats from 12. Some have suggested reducing the SSBN force to 8 boats as a cost-saving measure. The CBO reports have presented options for reducing the SSBN force to 8 boats as a cost-reduction measure. Other recommendations include reducing the force to 7 boats, 6 boats, or 10 boats, depending on assessments of strategic nuclear threats and the role of SSBNs in deterring such threats. The Navy's position is that the current requirement for having a certain number of SSBNs on patrol translates into a need for a force of 14 Ohio-class boats, and that this requirement can be met in the future by a force of 12 Columbia-class boats. Congress also has oversight concerns about potential industrial-base challenges of building both Columbia-class boats and Virginia-class attack submarines (SSNs) simultaneously. The Navy faces concerns about the industrial base's ability to meet the procurement rate for VPM-equipped Virginia-class and Columbia-class boats as planned in the FY2020 shipbuilding plan. Challenges at submarine construction shipyards and component supplier firms have raised worries about schedule delays. Congressional action on Navy funding for FY2020 is summarized in Table 3. The Navy's FY2020 funding request for the Columbia-class program is summarized in Table 3. Appendix A provides background information on past U.S. SSBN designs, showing the growth in size and number of SLBMs carried on each boat over time. The Ohio-class design, with a submerged displacement of 18,750 tons, is more than twice the size of earlier U.S. SSBNs. Appendix B discusses U.S.-UK cooperation on SLBMs and the UK's next-generation SSBN. The UK's cooperation with the U.S. on SLBMs for its SSBNs is part of a long-standing nuclear-related partnership under the 1958 Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes. This collaboration includes the 1963 Polaris Sales Agreement and a 1982 Exchange of Letters. The Navy testified in March 2010 about the shared commitment to nuclear deterrence between the U.S. and the UK. The United States and the United Kingdom have maintained a shared commitment to nuclear deterrence through the Polaris Sales Agreement since April 1963. The UK plans to extend the service life of the Vanguard-class SSBNs into the late 2020s and early 2030s. They intend to replace these boats with next-generation Dreadnought-class boats equipped with 12 missile launch tubes, carrying eight D-5 SLBMs each. The UK plans to replace the Vanguard-class SSBNs with the next-generation Dreadnought-class boats, with the first new boat to be delivered by 2028. The US is assisting with aspects of the Dreadnought SSBN program, including the Common Missile Compartment and the new PWR-3 reactor plant. Collaboration between the UK and US includes the design concept for the Dreadnought class, which incorporates a new propulsion plant based on US design and next-generation UK reactor technology. The US Navy, through Naval Reactors, is exchanging naval nuclear propulsion technology with the UK Ministry of Defence under the US/UK 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement for the UK's next-generation SUCCESSOR ballistic missile submarine. The technology exchange involves collaboration between the US and UK Governments, Naval Reactors prime contractors, private shipbuilders, and suppliers. The US provides engineering support for the UK's naval nuclear propulsion technology under the 1958 mutual defence agreement. The US transferred a nuclear propulsion plant to the UK for their nuclear-powered submarine program. The UK Navy's first nuclear-powered ship, the attack submarine Dreadnought, was installed with a nuclear propulsion plant provided by the US under a mutual defense agreement. Cooperation between the UK and US on nuclear submarine technology continues, with collaboration on sonar arrays and combat systems integration. Vice Adm. Terry Benedict praised the unique relationship between British and American naval officers responsible for nuclear weapons on ballistic missile submarines, stating that Brexit would not affect historic cooperation. Terry Benedict, director of the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, reassured that Brexit vote would not affect the relationship between the US and UK in terms of the Columbia-class program. The program originated from an exchange of letters in 2006 between President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair regarding the Trident II D-5 SLBM extension and next-generation SSBNs. In the 2040s, the Department of Defense (DOD) began studying a next-generation sea-based strategic deterrent (SBSD) to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs. An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for the new SBSD was approved in 2008, signaling the new system would likely be a submarine. The Navy established a Columbia-class program office around the same time. The Navy conducted an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) in 2008-2009 to determine the best option for replacing the Ohio-class SSBNs with a new-design SSBN. The AOA concluded that a new-design SSBN was the preferred option. The program achieved Milestone A in December 2010 and entered the Technology Development Phase in February 2011. The program to replace the Ohio-class SSBNs with 12 Ohio Replacement Submarines has been approved to enter the Technology Development Phase by the Defense Acquisition Board. The new submarines will have 16 missile tubes each, utilizing TRIDENT II D5 Life Extended missiles. The decision was made in January 2011 after the program was presented to the DAB in December 2010. The Columbia-class program received Milestone B approval in January 2017, allowing it to enter the engineering and manufacturing development phase. This phase will focus on refining warfighting requirements to meet operational and affordability goals, with design, prototyping, and technology development efforts continuing to ensure technological maturity for lead ship procurement in 2019. Frank Kendall chaired the Milestone B Defense Acquisition Board and signed the acquisition decision memorandum on 4 January, 2017, approving the COLUMBIA Class program as an Acquisition Category ID major defense acquisition program. This decision allows entry into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase, transitioning from preliminary design to detail design using SCN funds. Cost estimates for the program have been rebaselined to CY2017 dollars, with the MS B Navy Cost Estimate for Average Follow Ship End Cost at $5.0 billion in 2010$. The shipbuilding indices have been reduced to $5.0 billion, aiming to achieve the affordability target of $4.9 billion set at Milestone A. The Navy will focus on cost control through stable requirements, high design maturity, manufacturing readiness plans, and cost reduction actions. Affordability caps have been set based on updated cost estimates, adjusting the Base Year to 2017. The unique metric used for the affordability target accounted for hulls 2-12. The Navy is negotiating the DD&C contract for the COLUMBIA Program, with design efforts continuing without interruption. A contract modification allows detail design progress on the existing R&D contract, ensuring design continuity. Milestone B approval and appropriation are in place for the program. The Navy has deposited funding for the Columbia-class boats into the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund, allowing for detail design progress. The design features include a 42-year expected service life and no midlife nuclear refueling requirement. The Columbia class submarine will have a life-of-the-ship nuclear fuel core, eliminating the need for midlife nuclear refueling. It will undergo a midlife nonrefueling overhaul for its full 42-year service life. The submarine will feature an electric-drive propulsion system for stealthier operation and SLBM launch tubes similar to the Ohio class. The Columbia class will have a beam of 43 feet, slightly larger than the Ohio-class. The Columbia class submarine will have a beam of 43 feet and a length of 560 feet, with 16 SLBM launch tubes compared to 24 on the Ohio-class design. It will have a reported submerged displacement of 20,815 tons, making it larger than the Ohio-class design. The Navy emphasizes the need for the Columbia-class boats to have the most up-to-date capabilities and stealth for their 40-year lifespan. The Navy is replacing the Ohio-class SSBNs with the Columbia class submarines, which will have improved capabilities and stealth for their 40-year lifespan. Various replacement options were considered, with a new design leveraging lessons from the Ohio and advancements in shipbuilding. The Ohio-class SSBNs are being replaced by the Columbia class submarines with improved capabilities and stealth. Alternative options such as the Virginia-based SSBN design or restarting the Ohio-class production line were considered but found to be lacking in military effectiveness and cost efficiency. The Virginia-based SSBN design with a Trident II D5 missile was rejected due to various shortcomings in survivability and at-sea availability. The Virginia-based SSBN design with a larger missile compartment would be more expensive, require more submarines, and reduce deterrent value. It would also have longer refit times and mid-life overhauls, leading to reduced at-sea warhead presence and survivability. Some suggest developing a new, smaller missile for a Virginia-based SSBN. Developing a new, smaller nuclear missile for a Virginia-based SSBN would be challenging, costly, and risky. It would compromise survivability, require more submarines at sea, and weaken deterrence effectiveness. There are significant cost, technical, and schedule risks associated with this option. Re-opening the Ohio production line to build Ohio-based SSBNs is not feasible due to modernization for Virginia-class SSNs. Redesigning the Ohio for new production facilities would result in performance issues, increased SSBN numbers, and higher costs. The Navy's analysis has led to the development of a new design SSBN that improves on the Ohio class submarine. It will have enhanced stealth capabilities, common systems with the Virginia class submarines, and modular construction to reduce costs. Re-opening the Ohio production line is not feasible due to modernization for Virginia-class SSNs. The Navy's new design SSBN, the Columbia-class, incorporates lessons from previous submarines to reduce costs and improve efficiency. It will have 16 SLBM tubes, a decision made to lower procurement costs while maintaining effective strategic deterrence capabilities. The Navy's decision to reduce the number of SLBM tubes on the Columbia-class submarines from 20 to 16 raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S. strategic nuclear forces' capability in the future. This decision was made to lower procurement costs, but some observers worry it may affect the submarines' deterrent role. The decision to design the Columbia class submarines with 16 tubes instead of 20 raised concerns about future strategic deterrent capabilities. Navy and DOD officials believe that 16 tubes will still provide enough capability for U.S. strategic nuclear forces in the 2030s and beyond. Admiral Gary Roughead expressed confidence in the direction of the SSBN-X program in a 2011 hearing. The decision to design the Columbia class submarines with 16 tubes instead of 20 is consistent with the new START treaty and the missions the ship will perform. In a 2011 hearing, General Kehler discussed the reduction of tubes and its impact on strategic posture. General Kehler emphasizes the importance of modernizing the entire triad, including the Trident and Ohio-class replacement. The number of tubes per submarine is not a simple decision, as the focus should be on the overall number of tubes and the flexibility in warhead configurations. The decision on the number of tubes per submarine is complex, considering factors like operational flexibility, maintenance, and future warfare environments. General Kehler is not overly concerned about increasing to 16 tubes, as long as there is flexibility in the triad and decision-making space for the ultimate number of submarines. General Kehler is not overly troubled by the idea of submarines with 16 tubes, understanding the arguments for having 20. The decision on the number of tubes per submarine is complex, but he remains open to the possibility of 16 tubes. The Navy is considering reducing the number of missile tubes on the Columbia class submarines from 24 to 16. This decision was based on extensive analysis and input from various levels of leadership, including STRATCOM and OSD. The rationale for this reduction was supported by senior Navy officials and is seen as necessary for the future mission of the submarines. The Navy is confident in reducing the number of missile tubes on the Columbia class submarines to 16, based on analysis of system capability and target requirements. This decision was supported by senior officials and discussed in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Navy's decision to reduce the number of missile tubes on the Columbia class submarines to 16 was based on analysis of system capability, target requirements, and cost considerations. This decision was supported by senior officials and discussed in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Navy's decision to reduce the number of missile tubes on the Columbia class submarines to 16 was supported by senior officials and discussed in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Rear Admiral Benedict, as the director of SSP, expressed comfort with the decision based on technical aspects and the capability of the D-5 missile. Section 242 of the FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act required DOD to submit a report on the matter. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act required the Department of Defense to submit a report on options for replacing the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine program, including cost assessments and capabilities of each option. The report on options for replacing the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine program includes assessments of meeting at-sea requirements, nuclear employment guidance, and postulated threats. Options considered are fleets of 12 submarines with 16 missile tubes, 10 submarines with 20 missile tubes, 10 submarines with 16 missile tubes, and 8 submarines with 20 missile tubes. The report on options for replacing the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine program includes assessments of meeting at-sea requirements, nuclear employment guidance, and postulated threats. The report compares four different options for the OHIO Replacement (OR) fleet ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) program, including fleets of 12 submarines with 16 missile tubes, 10 submarines with 20 missile tubes, 10 submarines with 16 missile tubes, and 8 submarines with 20 missile tubes. The report is required to be submitted in unclassified form, with a possible classified annex. The assessment of the SSBN program analyzed four options with varying numbers of submarines and missile tubes. The SSBN force is crucial for deterrence with a second strike capability. The number of SSBNs and missile tube capacity impact our flexibility to respond to threats. Options with more SSBNs can be adjusted based on the threat level. The assessment of the SSBN program analyzed different options with varying numbers of submarines and missile tubes. A smaller SSBN force would be less expensive but may not meet current requirements and increase risk in force survivability. The program of record, 12 SSBNs with 16 missile tubes each, provides the best balance of performance, flexibility, and cost for meeting strategic deterrence goals. The classified annex contains detailed analysis not available to the public. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was created by P.L. 113-291 Section 1022 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. It is a separate fund in the DOD budget, codified at 10 U.S.C. 2218a, from the Navy's regular shipbuilding account. Amendments by subsequent acts have provided additional acquisition capabilities. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was established by P.L. 113-291 to provide additional acquisition authorities for national sea-based deterrence vessels. The Fund is administered by the Secretary of Defense and can only be used for construction, purchase, alteration, and conversion of these vessels as authorized by law. All funds appropriated for vessel construction are deposited into the Fund. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund (NSBDF) was established for the Department of Defense to fund construction, purchase, alteration, and conversion of deterrence vessels. Appropriated funds are deposited into the Fund and must be used within five years. The Secretary of the Navy can use the funds to enter into economic order quantity contracts for efficiency in procurement. The Secretary of the Navy can use funds from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to enter into contracts for advance construction of deterrence vessels, with limitations on liability and the requirement of availability of appropriations. This allows for cost savings, workload management, and manufacturing efficiencies. The Secretary of the Navy can use funds from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to enter into contracts for advance procurement of high value, long lead time items for nuclear powered vessels. The contracts are incrementally funded to support construction schedules, achieve cost savings, and allow for properly phased installment payments. Total liability to the Government for contract termination is limited to the total amount of funding obligated at the time of termination. The Secretary of the Navy can use funds from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to enter into contracts for advance procurement of critical components for nuclear-powered vessels. Total liability for contract termination is limited to the amount of funding obligated at that time. The Secretary of the Navy can use funds from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund for procurement of critical components for nuclear-powered vessels. Budget requests to Congress must clearly identify funds for components and specific ships/programs. Contracts must be contingent on appropriations availability, with liability limited to funding obligated at termination. Budget requests for the Fund must detail amounts for construction projects separately. The National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund is used for procurement of critical components for nuclear-powered vessels. The Fund must detail amounts for construction projects separately. The Fund defines national sea-based deterrence vessels as those carrying operational intercontinental ballistic missiles. Precedents for Funding Navy Acquisition Programs Outside Navy Appropriation Accounts Prior to the establishment of the NSBDF, some observers had suggested funding the procurement of Columbia-class boats outside the Navy's shipbuilding budget to preserve funds for other Navy shipbuilding programs. Construction of certain DOD sealift ships and Navy auxiliary ships was funded in the National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF), outside the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) appropriation account. Funding missile defense programs through Defense-Wide accounts allows for better visibility of trade-offs and optimization of funding. This approach also applies to DOD sealift ships to avoid competition within Navy budget accounts. The NSBDF may impact funding for other programs by centralizing decision-making and potentially reallocating resources. The NSBDF aims to preserve funding for Navy shipbuilding programs, including the Columbia-class program, by placing it outside the Navy's budget. This national fund encourages funding from the DOD budget as a whole, rather than solely from the Navy's budget. The NSBDF aims to preserve funding for Navy shipbuilding programs, including the Columbia-class program, by sourcing it from the DOD budget as a whole. Acquisition authorities in 10 U.S.C. 2218a could reduce procurement costs for various nuclear-powered ships. The FY2016 NDAA directed DOD to submit a report on the acquisition strategy for Ohio-class replacement submarines leveraging enhanced procurement authorities. The Navy submitted a report on April 18, 2016, proposing to leverage authorities from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to make the management of the Ohio-class replacement more efficient. The high cost of this next-generation strategic deterrent requires extraordinary measures for affordability, and the Navy is working on acquisition efficiency, reducing schedule risk, and improving program affordability. The Navy is assessing Continuous Production for Columbia-class boats to improve efficiency and cost savings. Authorities from the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund are essential for reducing acquisition costs and schedule risks on the Ohio-class replacement program. The Navy utilizes authorities like Economic Order Quantity contracts and Advance Construction to achieve cost savings and schedule efficiencies in submarine shipbuilding. These authorities help reduce acquisition costs and schedule risks on programs like the Columbia-class boats and Ohio-class replacement program. Activities like Advance Construction help reduce construction risk for first-of-a-kind projects, streamline the transition from design to production, and optimize shipyard workload. The FY2016 NDAA allows for incrementally funded procurements for long lead components, leading to schedule improvements and cost savings. Continuous Production procurement of components and systems can maximize economic advantage through manufacturing efficiencies. Continuous Production procurement aims to provide savings through manufacturing efficiencies, increased learning on the production line, and retention of critical production skills. It would reduce schedule risk for U.S. and UK SSBN construction programs and minimize funding spikes. The Navy needs authority to enter contracts for components and systems for OR SSBNs. Missile Tube Continuous Production could cut procurement costs by 25% for the Columbia Class. The Navy estimates that procuring Missile Tube Modules in Continuous Production lines would result in a one year schedule reduction for the OR Class, reducing ship delivery risk and increasing schedule margin. This approach could also lead to savings of up to 20% compared to single shipset procurement costs. Re-phasing of funding from outside the FY17 Future Year's Defense Program is required for Continuous Production, but it results in significant overall program benefits. The Navy is considering Continuous Production opportunities for nuclear and nonnuclear components for VIRGINIA Class submarines and FORD Class aircraft carriers, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars per submarine. Design stability is a prerequisite for Continuous Production, with potential cost benefits not fully developed. The Navy is exploring Continuous Production for submarine and aircraft carrier components to save money. Cost reductions from new acquisition authorities will be evaluated to support updated cost estimates. The OR Program Acquisition Strategy emphasizes using alternative tools to lower costs and reduce schedule risks. The Navy will work with Congress to implement granted authorities and explore additional cost-saving initiatives. The Navy will evaluate new acquisition authorities to support updated cost estimates for the OR Program. These authorities, including the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund, RDTEN, and SCN appropriations accounts, will help reduce acquisition costs and shorten construction schedules without room for delays."
