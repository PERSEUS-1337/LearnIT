    "content": "The Unified Command Plan (UCP) and Combatant Commands (COCOMs) provide operational instructions to the Armed Forces, impacting organization, training, and resources. Congress oversees their role in military and foreign policy, with Combatant Commanders testifying annually on posture and budget requirements. The UCP, approved by the President, guides all unified combatant commands. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) is a classified document approved by the President, providing guidance to combatant commanders on missions, responsibilities, force structure, and geographical areas of responsibility. It is prepared by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) and updated every two years, with the ability to be revised based on strategic, political, and budgetary needs. The UCP assigns missions, responsibilities, and geographic areas to Combatant Commands (COCOMs), considering strategic documents like the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. The Unified Command Plan (UCP) is a classified document approved by the President, providing guidance to combatant commanders on missions, responsibilities, force structure, and geographical areas of responsibility. The UCP process considers strategic context, command guidance, and is reviewed by senior service leaders, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council before submission to the President. Congress has visibility into issues affecting UCP development. Combatant commands, designated by the President through the Secretary of Defense, work to achieve national security objectives by integrating air, land, sea, and amphibious forces. They are organized geographically or functionally, with some focusing on specific threats and opportunities. The combatant commanders work with military forces in their theaters, reporting to the commander in chief and secretary of defense. There are nine active COCOMs, with one disestablished in 2010. Functional combatant commands provide unique capabilities worldwide. The United States has geographic combatant commands with regional military focuses, such as USAFRICOM, USCENTCOM, USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM, USPACOM, and USSOUTHCOM. These commands operate in specific areas of operation. The importance of unified military effort was learned from World War II, where unity of command was crucial for success. During World War II, Dwight Eisenhower's attempts to establish unified command in the Pacific were hindered by differences between the Army and Navy. General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Chester Nimitz led separate commands, causing friction. President Truman later emphasized the need for better cooperation between military branches to avoid inefficiencies in future wars. The Chief of Naval Operations also criticized the Pacific command arrangement as \"ambiguous and unsatisfactory.\" After World War II, there was a proposal for a single command over the Pacific region, but the Army and Army Air Forces preferred unified command based on mission and forces rather than geography. A worldwide system of unified command was established in December 1946, with seven commands created as an interim measure. These commands included Far East Command, Pacific Command, Alaskan Command, Northeast Command, Atlantic Fleet, Caribbean Command, and European Command. Despite efforts to achieve unity, some commands were service-specific. The Unified Combatant Command (UCC) system was established in 1946 to achieve unity, but services continued to act independently. The UCP has evolved over the years, influenced by three major legislative initiatives, including the National Security Act of 1947 which created the UCC system and gave the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) the responsibility to establish unified commands in \"strategic areas\". In 1958, President Eisenhower proposed the DOD Reorganization Act to establish unified commands in strategic areas, allowing the President and Secretary of Defense to approve combat forces deployment. This act aimed for complete unification of military planning and combat forces, creating a clear chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense. Goldwater-Nichols Act established a clear chain of command from the President to combatant commanders, emphasizing jointness and rebalancing power between geographic commands and services. Combatant commanders had full operational control over assigned forces, which could only be transferred with presidential approval. The act required the Chairman of the JCS to review missions and force structure of each COCOM every two years. The Goldwater-Nichols Act established a clear chain of command from the President to combatant commanders, giving them full operational control over assigned forces. The act required the Chairman of the JCS to review missions, responsibilities, and force structure of each combatant command every two years, recommending changes to the Secretary of Defense and the President. The act also expanded the powers of the CJCS and combatant commanders, allowing for greater interaction with Congress and participation in the DOD budget process. The CJCS will recommend changes to combatant commands' missions, responsibilities, and force structure to the President through the SECDEF. The President must notify Congress within 60 days of establishing a new command or making significant revisions. The CJCS must assess distribution of responsibilities, potential consolidation of commands, redundancy of assets, adequacy of war fighting plans, and challenges posed by excluding certain nations from Areas of Responsibility during periodic UCP reviews. The UCP update cycle typically lasts 12 to 18 months and involves five phases, starting with reviewing key national security documents and receiving command guidance. Stakeholders identify issues during this process, such as potential conflicts between U.S. Central and European Commands in a major regional conflict in the Middle East. During the UCP update cycle, stakeholders identify issues for discussion and submit Issue Development Papers (IDPs) for validation. Validated IDPs are then slated for further development in the next phase, where courses of action (COA) are developed for each issue. The Assessment Conference develops courses of action (COA) for validated Issue Development Papers (IDPs) to address the issues. The COA are reviewed online, finalized, and closed out. The adjudication phase involves approval at various levels of the Joint Staff, leading to the publication of a final draft UCP. The Review phase involves revising the UCP before final review. During the final review phase, the UCP is reviewed and revised by various levels of authority, including Service Chiefs, Combatant Commanders, SECDEF, NSC, and the President for approval and publication. Other executive branch agencies also have a vested interest in the UCP due to intersecting responsibilities. Other executive branch agencies, such as the Secretary of State and Attorney General, have access to the UCP development process through liaison officers at COCOMs and the Joint Staff. They can voice concerns to senior DOD leadership, and during the NSC UCP Review, agencies can raise issues publicly. Congress does not have a statutory role in the UCP process. Congress does not have a statutory role in the UCP development process but can express concerns through hearings, private conversations, and legislation. For example, prior to the creation of AFRICOM in 2007, Members called for a separate combatant command for Africa. Congress also includes provisions in annual defense acts for DOD studies on COCOM structure. The 2011 UCP is classified, but DOD released it on April 8, 2011. The 2011 UCP, a classified document, was released by DOD on April 8, 2011. It establishes missions and responsibilities for combatant commanders, with new missions assigned in the UCP 2011. The review process involves the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, combatant commanders, service chiefs, and DOD leadership every two years. Significant changes in UCP 2011 include shifting areas of responsibility. The 2011 UCP, released by DOD on April 8, 2011, establishes missions and responsibilities for combatant commanders. Significant changes in UCP 2011 include shifting areas of responsibilities boundaries in the Arctic region, giving USNORTHCOM advocacy for Arctic capabilities, disestablishing U.S. Joint Forces Command, expanding U.S. Strategic Command's responsibilities, and giving U.S. Transportation Command responsibility for global distribution operations planning. President Obama signed Change One to the 2011 UCP on September 12, 2011, reflecting administrative changes such as the disestablishment of USJFCOM and Efficiency Initiatives. This included transferring missions from USJFCOM to USSTRATCOM, adding global standing joint headquarters responsibility to USTRANSCOM, and removing certain language and responsibilities from USSTRATCOM. The origins of COCOMs are rooted in the U.S. experience in World War II, where the services operated independently due to bureaucratic distrust and service rivalry. The Marine Corps feared being eliminated as a redundant service, while the Army sought to control the country's air arm. World War II presented unique challenges not faced in World War I. During World War I, the United States had limited involvement in primarily land-centric operations in Europe. In contrast, World War II saw the U.S. taking a leadership role in both the European and Pacific theaters, with different strategic approaches and military operations. During World War II, the United States played a leading role in the Pacific and European theaters, leveraging its military and industrial resources. Post-war, U.S. leaders avoided isolationism due to concerns about communist Russia and China, maintaining a global military presence to counter communist expansion. The establishment and governance of COCOMs are outlined in Sections 161 through 168 of Title X, Armed Forces, U.S. Code. The establishment and governance of Combatant Commands (COCOMs) are outlined in Sections 161 through 168 of Title X, Armed Forces, U.S. Code. These provisions assign responsibilities to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), including regular reviews of missions, force structure, and responsibilities for each combatant command. Suggestions for changes are then provided to the President through the Secretary of Defense. The provisions assign responsibilities to the military departments for the Combatant Commands (COCOMs), with forces under the command of the COCOM commander. The President, SECDEF, and CJCS form the chain of command, with the CJCS serving as a link between them. The CJCS can relay guidance and concerns between the President, SECDEF, and COCOM commanders, but has no command authority over the COCOMs. The CJCS participates in national security discussions but not in formal decision-making for COCOMs. COCOM commanders are responsible for missions, joint training, logistics, and military operations. They establish command relationships and organize subordinate units. Combatant Commanders control units from different services, while services retain administrative control over personnel. COCOMs request annual Operations and Maintenance funding, with forces funded by respective services. Funding for COCOMs is provided separately from operations like those in Afghanistan and counterterror operations, which are primarily funded through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account. The SECDEF submits an annual budget proposal for COCOMs, which may include funding for joint exercises, force training, contingencies, and special operations forces (SOF) training with foreign forces. COCOMs can also receive funds through the Combatant Commander Initiative Fund, including the U.S. element of NORAD. Authorized activities include force training. Authorized activities for COCOMs under the \"Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund\" include procurement and maintenance of security equipment, improvement of security sites, security management planning under extraordinary circumstances, support for security forces and technicians, security reviews, investigations, vulnerability assessments, and other security-related activities. COCOM commanders, who are four-star flag rank officers, are nominated by the President based on SECDEF recommendations. The Senate confirms the nominees after holding confirmation hearings. While officers from any service can serve as combatant commanders, some appointments traditionally go to specific services. COCOM staffs are organized similarly to the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. COCOM staffs are organized similarly to the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, with various directorates such as Manpower, Intelligence, Operations, Logistics, Strategic Plans, Command, Control, Communication, and Computer, Operational Planning, Force Structure, and Interagency Partnering. Joint Task Forces (JTFs) are created to address specific policy concerns or crises, with some COCOMs having a political advisor (POLAD) to interface with the commander. COCOMs have integrated assets and representatives from other U.S. government agencies to enhance operations. Examples include State Department Deputy Commander for Civil-Military Activities in USAFRICOM, Interagency Action Group in USCENTCOM, J-9 Directorate for Interagency Partnering in USEUCOM, and Joint Interagency efforts in USNORTHCOM. USSOCOM is responsible for organizing, training, and equipping special operations forces (SOF) for the Geographic Combatant Commanders. They also develop strategies, procure specialized equipment, and lead DOD planning against terrorists globally. USSOCOM can conduct operations against terrorist networks when directed by the President or Secretary of Defense, requiring extensive collaboration with other U.S. government agencies. The 1980 Desert One tragedy and the 1983 loss of 237 Marines in Beirut, along with command and control issues during Grenada in 1983, raised concerns about DOD's ability to manage special operations forces. In 1983, Congress began to sense the need for military reforms, leading to the creation of the Joint Special Operations Agency in 1984, which did little to address SOF issues. In response to concerns about DOD's ability to manage special operations forces, Congress, led by Senators Nunn and Cohen and Representative Daniel, pushed for a radical restructuring of SOF. They believed that the U.S. military needed to improve its special operations capabilities and have a more direct chain of command. In early 1986, reform bills were introduced in the House. In early 1986, SOF advocates introduced reform bills in the House and Senate. The Senate bill called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in DOD to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for special operations. Representative Daniel proposed a national special operations agency headed by a civilian to bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the SECDEF. Congress held hearings on the bills, with CJCS Admiral William J. Crowe proposing a new special operations forces command led by a three-star general, which was not well received. President Reagan approved the establishment of USSOCOM on April 13, 1987, with Army General Lindsay nominated as its first commander. USASOC includes Army Special Forces, Rangers, Civil Affairs, and MISO units. NSWC consists of SEAL teams, SDV teams, and Special Boat Teams for maritime and ground operations. SOF units receive rotary wing support from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. AFSOC provides specialized support to USSOCOM units, including Combat Controllers, Pararescue Jumpers, and Special Operations Weather Teams. MARSOC, established in 2005, is the newest USSOCOM subcomponent with Marine Special Operations Battalions. JSOC is a sub unified command focused on special operations requirements and equipment standardization. JSOC is a sub unified command focused on special operations requirements and equipment standardization. It conducts special operations exercises, develops joint special operations tactics, and is home to USSOCOM's national mission forces. JSOU's mission is to educate special operations forces leaders and decision-makers. SOC-JC, formerly SOCJFCOM, trains conventional and special operations force commanders in the integration of Special Operations Forces with conventional forces for enhanced warfighting readiness. USSOCOM operates globally in overt and classified missions, primarily focusing on attacking terrorists worldwide. Admiral McRaven stated that U.S. special operations forces are present in 78 countries to support U.S. policy objectives. Admiral McRaven testified that there will be a constant demand for a \"steady state\" SOF-deployed force of almost 12,000 troops to support COCOM requirements even after operations conclude in Afghanistan. USSOCOM aims to have adequate capacity by FY2017 to meet COCOM demand without risking global counterterrorism operations, with a growth rate of 3% to 5% annually. Deployment strains have affected U.S. SOF, limiting family time and professional training. Admiral McRaven has identified deployment strains on U.S. Special Operations Forces (SOF), leading to limited family time and professional training. A lack of predictability and difficulties in reconnecting with family after deployments are major sources of ongoing stress. To address these issues, a task force has been established to implement innovative solutions across USSOCOM. Reports indicate a push for more control over deployed SOF, as currently they are controlled by geographic combatant commanders once deployed. USSOCOM is seeking expanded authorities to have more control over Special Operations Forces (SOF) deployments, currently managed by combatant commanders. This would allow USSOCOM to allocate SOF units to national-level missions in support of regional objectives. The goal is to enhance coordination and effectiveness across different regions through TSOCs. If USSOCOM receives the additional authorities it has requested, it could allow the USSOCOM Commander to have direct relationships with TSOCs, potentially violating the principle of \"unity of command.\" This move has been seen as a power grab and could create friction with regional commands, leading to a dual chain of command and impacting deployed SOF units negatively. USSTRATCOM, established in 2002, is responsible for U.S. nuclear weapons stewardship, detecting and deterring attacks, and coordinating strategic deterrence, space and cyberspace operations, global strike, missile defense, ISR, and WMD combat. It has supported coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and monitors satellites and space debris. USSTRATCOM, established in 2002, is responsible for U.S. nuclear weapons stewardship, detecting and deterring attacks, coordinating strategic deterrence, space and cyberspace operations, global strike, missile defense, ISR, and WMD combat. It has supported coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, monitors satellites and space debris, and provides limited protection against ballistic missile attacks. The primary missions of USSTRATCOM are deterrence and global strike, with a focus on nuclear deterrence and employing nuclear forces in response if deterrence fails. The late 1950s saw the development of space systems to meet SAC's needs for surveillance, warning, meteorology, and communications. In 1985, USSPACECOM was created to manage military space operations. USSTRATCOM was established in 2002 through the merger of USSTRATCOM and USSPACECOM. Missile defense and cyberspace operations gained importance around 2000. The U.S. military's reliance on computer networks grew in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to the creation of a Joint Task Force for Computer Network Defense in 1998 under USSPACECOM. U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) was established on May 21, 2010, under USSPACECOM. It became fully operational on October 31, 2010, to address sophisticated computer attacks against the Department of Defense. AFGSC oversees Air Force's ICBM and bomber wings, while AFSPC provides space and cybersecurity forces for USSTRATCOM. USSTRATCOM has two numbered air forces, the Fourteenth Air Force which controls satellite systems and launch vehicles, and the Twenty-Fourth Air Force which conducts cyberspace operations. ARSTRAT handles space and missile defense operations for USSTRATCOM, while Fleet Forces Command is responsible for the Atlantic Ocean and surrounding waters. MARFORSTRAT serves as the Marine Corps component, and USCYBERCOM focuses on cybersecurity under USSPACECOM. USCYBERCOM is a sub unified command subordinate to USSTRATCOM, responsible for defending DOD information networks and conducting cyber space activities. JFCC-GS optimizes planning and force management to deter attacks, JFCC-IMD focuses on global missile defense planning, JFCC-ISR coordinates intelligence operations, and JFCC-Space executes integrated space operations. JIOWC provides joint information operations planning, execution, and integration of Electronic Warfare, Operations Security, and Military Deception to support national objectives. The structure and missions of JIOWC may change due to a transfer of missions from USSTRATCOM to the Joint Staff. SCC-WMD advises USSTRATCOM on WMD-related matters and focuses on detecting, deterring, and preventing attacks against the United States. USSTRATCOM is responsible for defending the nation through deterrence and command and control of nuclear forces. They implement treaties, sustain the nuclear triad, and support other combatant commanders in missile defense and ISR operations. USSTRATCOM also operates with USCYBERCOM to defend the DOD information network and military space operations. In 2012, the USSTRATCOM commander expressed concerns about the aging nuclear weapons and the erosion of the nuclear enterprise's capabilities, emphasizing the need for investment in stockpile certification, warhead life extension, and infrastructure recapitalization to maintain the nation's nuclear deterrent. Additionally, the commander highlighted challenges in processing and analyzing data from advanced ISR platforms, citing increased data volume and operational tempo as key issues. The USSTRATCOM commander expressed concerns about the need for a 100% increase in analysts to meet COCOM requirements, citing unrealistic growth expectations in a fiscally constrained environment. There were also concerns about USCYBERCOM's technical capacity and workforce, with a focus on the need for well-trained individuals in cyberspace. Suggestions were made to improve STEM education from an early age to address workforce issues, as traditional military recruitment may not be sufficient for building a stable cyber cadre for the long term. The need for a capable transportation system for national security was highlighted by World War II, the Berlin blockade, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. A 1978 exercise revealed gaps in understanding between military and civilian participants, leading to recommendations for Transportation Operating Agencies to report directly to the JCS. The Joint Deployment Agency (JDA) was established in 1979 at MacDill Air Force Base, FL to integrate deployment procedures. In 1987, President Reagan ordered the creation of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to provide global transportation for national security needs. The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) was established in 1987 to provide global air, sea, and land transportation for national security needs. It consisted of three transportation component commands - the Air Force's Military Airlift Command, the Navy's Military Sealift Command, and the Army's Military Traffic Management Command. The first USTRANSCOM commander was Air Force General Duane H. Cassidy. Operational direction came from the National Command Authority through the CJCS, but there were limitations to USTRANSCOM's authorities, primarily focused on wartime operations. On February 14, 1992, the SECDEF gave USTRANSCOM a new charter, expanding its mission to provide air, land, and sea transportation for DOD in both peace and war. This new charter granted the USTRANSCOM commander increased authorities, with the Service Secretaries assigning components to the commander in all circumstances. The USTRANSCOM commander was designated as the Distribution Process Owner (DPO) by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld on September 16, 2003. This role made the commander responsible for directing and supervising the Strategic Distribution system to improve efficiency and interoperability of distribution activities in peace and war. USTRANSCOM collaborated with other entities to enhance Joint Deployment and Distribution. USTRANSCOM, under the leadership of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff, and industry, has enhanced the Joint Deployment and Distribution Enterprise since 2003. The command has taken on additional responsibilities, such as managing DOD logistics IT systems and overseeing the procurement of necessary services to transform the DOD supply chain. SDDC, on the other hand, provides ocean terminal and traffic management services for deploying U.S. forces globally, as well as managing surface transportation and interfacing with commercial carriers for DOD shipments. This includes moving household goods and vehicles for over 500,000 servicemembers. SDDC is the nation's largest customer to the moving industry, handling over 500,000 household goods moves annually. They also provide transportation for troops and materiel to ports of departure in the U.S. and overseas, managing 24 ports worldwide. MSC provides sealift transportation services for U.S. forces globally with a fleet of government-owned and chartered U.S.-flagged ships, executing Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) contracts. They move unit equipment to theaters of operation and operate prepositioned ships loaded with supplies for various military operations. The Air Mobility Command (AMC) provides strategic airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation services for U.S. forces. They deploy quickly to deliver urgently needed equipment and supplies. USTRANSCOM conducts military and commercial transportation, distribution, terminal management, aerial refueling, and global patient movement daily. AMC's air fleet supports America's global reach with swift response capabilities. In 2011, the Air Mobility Command (AMC) deployed a rotational force of over 60 C-130 tactical airlift aircraft, 120 KC-135 and KC-10 aerial refueling aircraft, and 21 C-17 transport aircraft in support of global operations. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) and the Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) moved over 19.9 million tons of cargo worldwide, including 1.6 billion gallons of fuel delivered by MSC tankers. The Pakistan Ground Lines of Communication (PAK GLOC) is the quickest and most cost-effective route for surface transportation into Afghanistan. The Pakistan Ground Lines of Communication (PAK GLOC) reopened in July 2012 after negotiations, but there is no guarantee it won't close in the future. USTRANSCOM aims to enhance the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) to supply Afghanistan, with 40% of cargo for Operation Enduring Freedom moving through NDN routes in 2011. 27,000 containers were delivered via NDN surface transportation in 2011, a 15% increase from 2010, showing the growing importance of NDN as U.S. forces prepare to leave Afghanistan. As U.S. forces prepare to leave Afghanistan by 2014, USTRANSCOM emphasizes Guam's role as a key logistics node and supports infrastructure improvements in the region. They have invested in fuel hydrant infrastructure and a JP-8 pipeline. Africa Command strengthens defense capabilities in African states and conducts military operations when directed to protect U.S. national security interests. USAFRICOM conducts military operations to deter and defeat transnational threats and provide a secure environment for governance and development in 54 African countries, including islands like Cape Verde and Madagascar. It allows the US government to work towards stability and growth by consolidating three former commands into one. The creation of USAFRICOM consolidated three former U.S. commands into one, aiming to prevent war rather than engage in traditional warfighting. This shift reflects the previous low priority given to Africa within the U.S. military structure, with other commands focused on different regions and security priorities. The creation of USAFRICOM consolidated three former U.S. commands into one, aiming to prevent war rather than engage in traditional warfighting. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates criticized the previous command arrangements for Africa as outdated remnants of the Cold War era. U.S. foreign policy towards Africa has been characterized by a lack of attention and coherent policy, with scholars labeling it as \"benign neglect.\" Despite the geopolitical changes after the Cold War, America's focus remained on Eurasian states, neglecting Africa. In the late 1990s, U.S. perception of security interests in Africa began to shift due to terrorist attacks. The events of 9/11 prompted a reassessment of U.S. policy towards Africa in the global war on terrorism. The growing strategic importance of Africa was highlighted in government documents, emphasizing weak states' role in global instability. The 2006 National Security Strategy solidified Africa's increasing geo-strategic importance for the United States. The National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD 50) signed by President Bush in September 2006 updated U.S. strategy towards Africa, emphasizing its growing geo-strategic importance. Africa's natural energy resources attract countries like the United States, China, and India. U.S. officials are concerned about soft targets, recruitment of marginalized youth, and potential terrorist sanctuaries in Africa. Previous terrorist attacks in Africa include bombings on U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998, and other incidents in Mombasa, Kenya, and Algiers. The Horn of Africa is a concern for terrorism experts and military personnel due to previous attacks in Tanzania, Kenya, and Algiers. International piracy in the region is also a serious problem. In 2007, the White House announced the creation of U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM), which became fully operational in 2008. There are plans to possibly move the USAFRICOM headquarters to Africa in the future, but regional sensitivities and security concerns make this challenging. USARAF, headquartered in Vicenza, Italy, is the Army component to USAFRICOM, conducting security engagement with African land forces for peace and stability. USAFRICOM can deploy as a contingency headquarters for crisis response. NAVAF, part of U.S. Naval Forces Europe/NAVAF, conducts maritime operations to advance security in Europe and Africa. Their areas of responsibility cover half of the Atlantic Ocean. USARAF, headquartered in Vicenza, Italy, is the Army component to USAFRICOM, conducting security engagement with African land forces for peace and stability. NAVAF, part of U.S. Naval Forces Europe/NAVAF, conducts maritime operations to advance security in Europe and Africa. NAVEUR-NAVAF covers all of Russia, Europe, and nearly the entire continent of Africa, encompassing 105 countries with a combined population of more than one billion people. The U.S. Sixth Fleet supports NAVAF operations in the AFRICOM AOR and is headquartered in Naples, Italy. AFAFRICA, or 17th Air Forces, promotes air safety, security, and development in Africa from Ramstein Air Base in Germany. MARFORAF, located in Stuttgart, Germany, is the Marine's service component headquarters for USAFRICOM, conducting operations, exercises, training, and security cooperation activities throughout Africa. MARFORAF conducts operations, exercises, training, and security cooperation activities throughout the African Continent. CJTF-HOA is USAFRICOM's forward operating task force located at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti with approximately 2,000 personnel assigned on rotating tours. The task force works on building partner security capability, capacity, and infrastructure through regional cooperation and military-to-military programs. SOCAFRICA, established in 2008 as USAFRICOM's Theater Special Operations Command, is headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany. In 2011, President Obama deployed U.S. military personnel to Uganda and Central Africa to assist in capturing the leadership of the Lord's Resistance Army. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is a nonreligious terror group known for kidnapping children to serve as soldiers in central Africa. USAFRICOM has been involved in training central African militaries to combat the LRA, reducing their numbers to about 200 core fighters and 600 supporters. Approximately 100 U.S. service members are currently operating in Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo as advisors. USAFRICOM regularly reviews and assesses the effectiveness of this mission. USAFRICOM regularly reviews and assesses the effectiveness of the OEF-TS effort, which is the US Military regional plan against terrorist and violent extremists in Africa. The focus is on enhancing stability, deterring terrorist activity, and promoting greater security in North Africa through military cooperation, training, and intelligence-sharing with partner nations. USAFRICOM conducts exercises to develop partner nations' security capabilities and professionalism in Africa's military and security forces. Africa faces challenges due to weak states and threats from Al Qaeda, illicit trafficking, and violent extremist organizations. MANPADS disappeared during the 2011 Libyan conflict, raising concerns for regional security and U.S. national interests. During the 2011 Libyan conflict, MANPADS went missing from unsecured storage sites, posing a threat of trafficking to extremist groups. USAFRICOM seeks to expand ISR activities in Africa, particularly with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Plans are in place to deploy 1,200 troops to Africa for partner building, engagement, and crisis response, following the Benghazi attacks in 2012. In response to the Benghazi attacks in 2012, a U.S. SOF Commander's in-Extremis Force was established to be stationed in Ft. Carson, Colorado, with the flexibility to deploy to Africa for crisis response and training operations. This force, along with general-purpose Army forces, provides added security and support for USAFRICOM in promoting cooperation, deterring aggression, and supporting development efforts. The Iranian hostage crisis and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan highlighted the need for a stronger U.S. presence in the region. President Carter established the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) in 1980, which was later transformed into USCENTCOM in 1983. The focus shifted from a potential Soviet invasion of Iran to the emerging threat of Iraq under General Schwarzkopf. This shift became a reality when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to the formation of a coalition by the United States and other nations. Operation Desert Storm was launched on January 17, 1991, resulting in the liberation of Kuwait by February 27. Operation Provide Comfort followed to aid the Kurds and enforce a no-fly zone in Iraq. Operation Southern Watch began in August 1992 due to Saddam's noncompliance with U.N. resolutions. Throughout the 1990s, USCENTCOM conducted various operations in response to Iraqi threats and to enforce U.N. resolutions. This included Operation Provide Relief in Somalia and northeastern Kenya to prevent starvation, as well as Operation Northern Watch to enforce the northern no-fly zone. Despite some success, violent confrontations in Mogadishu led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Somalia. Terrorist attacks also had a significant impact during this period. In the 1990s, terrorist attacks in the region had a major impact on USCENTCOM forces. Attacks included the bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the attack on the USS Cole. These events led to the initiation of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Additionally, Iraq's lack of cooperation with UNSC Resolutions on weapons of mass destruction was noted post-9/11. Operation Iraqi Freedom began on March 19, 2003, authorized by the UNSC due to Iraqi resistance. USCENTCOM provided security in Afghanistan and Iraq after defeating the Taliban and Saddam Hussein's government. They also conducted counterinsurgency operations in the Horn of Africa and provided disaster relief in Pakistan and Lebanon. On October 1, 2008, DOD transferred responsibility for Sudan. On October 1, 2008, DOD transferred responsibility for Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, and Somalia to the newly established USAFRICOM while Egypt remained in the USCENTCOM AOR. ARCENT serves as an expeditionary headquarters for limited duration operations, with a forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar. NAVCENT, headquartered in Manama, Bahrain, commands naval forces in the region and is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet. NAVCENT forces typically include Carrier Strike Groups, Expeditionary Strike Groups, or Amphibious Strike Groups and also lead the Combined Maritime Forces in combating terrorism. The 9th Air Force at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, is responsible for overseeing naval forces from two dozen nations combating terrorism, piracy, and illegal drug trafficking in the region. MARCENT, the Marine Corps service component for USCENTCOM, provides Marine Expeditionary Forces with a forward headquarters in Bahrain. SOCCENT, headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, offers unique capabilities for operations in the region. SOCCENT, headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, FL, plans and conducts Special Operations in the USCENTCOM AOR. It exercises operational control of SOF for training and missions as directed by the USCENTCOM commander. USCENTCOM forces are engaged in a theater-wide campaign against Al Qaeda and its allies, with a main effort in Afghanistan. USCENTCOM is focused on counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan and training Afghan military and police forces. With U.S. forces out of Iraq, the command will have a more maritime focus, with special operations and air forces supporting operations. Concerns exist over unrest in Egypt, Bahrain, Jordan, Syria, and Yemen related to demands for democratic rights. Despite progress towards democracy, widespread demonstrations continue. Despite overtures towards democracy, widespread demonstrations in Egypt, Jordan, Yemen, and Bahrain have caused varying degrees of instability. This unrest could impact U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region. In Syria, open conflict persists, raising concerns of a potential long-term civil war that threatens regional security. Calls for military intervention have been made, but the prevailing approach is hands-off. USCENTCOM may need to protect U.S. national interests in these volatile countries. Iran is believed to be providing support, including arms and money, to fuel the unrest. Iran has been accused of providing arms, money, and support to insurgents in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, which could lead to regional instability. USCENTCOM and USEUCOM are tasked with mitigating Iranian interference and enhancing transatlantic security through military operations and partnerships. The Supreme Allied Commander of NATO (SACEUR) oversees NATO military command. SACEUR is responsible for overall command of NATO military operations, conducts military planning, identifies forces needed for missions, and reports to the Military Committee. He collaborates with the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation and makes recommendations on military matters affecting his responsibilities. SACEUR has direct access to Chiefs of Defense and national authorities to facilitate tasks. USEUCOM was established in 1952 to provide unified command over all U.S. forces in Europe after concerns about U.S. commitment to defending Western Europe against the Soviet Union. The Berlin Crisis of 1948-1949 and the Korean War in 1950 led to the establishment of NATO in 1949. In 1951, NATO established Allied Command Europe and Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) with General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). U.S. reinforcements to Europe increased to deter Soviet aggression, leading to the growth of U.S. military personnel from 120,000 to over 400,000. General Matthew B. Ridgway became the first U.S. Commander-in-Chief Europe (USCINCEUR) under the newly established USEUCOM in 1952. In the 1960s, USEUCOM conducted out-of-sector operations and faced policy disagreements within NATO. France demanded the removal of U.S. and NATO forces, leading to SHAPE moving to Mons, Belgium. USEUCOM continued preparing for defense in Europe with annual REFORGER exercises. Cold War crises persisted, including the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, while U.S. forces' readiness in Europe slowly declined. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Cold War era saw tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union despite negotiations. The Soviet Union deployed missiles in Eastern Europe and invaded Afghanistan in 1979. NATO responded by deploying Pershing II missiles. U.S. forces in Europe grew to over 350,000 by the 1980s. In the 1980s, USEUCOM transferred responsibility for Israel, Lebanon, and Syria to USCENTCOM, while also taking on Africa south of the Sahara. After the Cold War ended in 1989, USEUCOM supported Desert Storm in 1991 and engaged in outreach programs with emerging democracies. Despite a decrease in forces, USEUCOM participated in peacekeeping missions in the Balkans. Following the 9/11 attacks, USEUCOM played a significant role in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. USEUCOM provided major forces for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, while also focusing on protecting U.S. interests in Europe and Africa. The organization worked to build partner capacity for peacekeeping operations and launched Operation Enduring Freedom and Trans-Sahara in 2007. USAEUR in Germany trains, equips, and deploys land forces for joint operations, while NAVEUR in Italy conducts maritime operations and security cooperation. The U.S. Sixth Fleet, a subcomponent of AFRICOM, conducts maritime operations and security cooperation with NATO allies. USAFE, the Air Force component command based in Germany, operates from five main bases supporting nine air wings for various air support missions. MARFOREUR in Stuttgart employs pre-positioned assets for rapid deployment of expeditionary forces and partner capacity building. SOCEUR at Patch Barracks in Germany provides flexibility for a full range of military operations, including combat and special operations. USEUCOM provides support to ISAF by preparing partner nations' forces for deployment to Afghanistan through activities such as assessing equipment and training requirements. Multi-national and joint interagency exercises are a significant form of peacetime interaction with NATO allies and partners, with 22 major exercises conducted in 2011 involving almost 50,000 personnel from 42 nations. USEUCOM supports ISAF by preparing partner nations for coalition operations, enhancing NATO interoperability, and deploying forces to Afghanistan. Currently, about 12,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Afghanistan, with USEUCOM playing a central role in training and deploying non-U.S. forces. As U.S. involvement in Afghanistan decreases, NATO involvement is expected to follow suit. As U.S. involvement in Afghanistan decreases, NATO's role is also expected to diminish. USEUCOM and SACEUR will need to plan for a smooth transition as NATO forces draw down and hand over security functions to the Afghan National Army. Residual support requirements may still be needed post-transition, requiring resources and management. USEUCOM's historical involvement in NATO operations in the Balkans highlights the importance of continued engagement for regional stability. USEUCOM's participation in NATO exercises in the Balkan region is crucial for improving capabilities, diffusing tensions, and demonstrating long-term U.S. commitment. There is a growing ballistic missile threat from Iran, Syria, and non-state actors like Hizbollah. The U.S. and Poland have a partnership for air and missile defense, rotating Patriot batteries to Poland and conducting training. Romania agreed to host interceptor missiles, and Turkey accepted U.S. radar. The U.S. Navy also enhanced ballistic missile defense capabilities. The U.S. Navy added two ballistic missile defense-capable ships in 2012 to improve NATO missile defense. This has caused opposition from Russia and complicated NATO's relationship with Moscow. USNORTHCOM's mission is to conduct homeland defense, civil support, and security cooperation to defend the United States and its interests. It was established in 2002 to provide command and control of DOD homeland defense efforts. The area of operation for USNORTHCOM includes air, land, and sea approaches covering the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, and surrounding waters. It also encompasses the Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, and parts of the Caribbean region. The commander of USNORTHCOM is responsible for theater security cooperation with Canada, Mexico, and The Bahamas. Additionally, the commander of USNORTHCOM commands NORAD, a joint U.S.-Canadian command responsible for aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning for Canada, Alaska, and the continental United States. NORAD provides integrated tactical warning and attack assessment for aerospace control using a network of satellites, radar, and fighters. NORAD uses a network of satellites, radar, and fighters to detect and intercept air-breathing threats to North America. It also assists in monitoring aircraft involved in illegal drug trafficking. USNORTHCOM operates the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System to defend against limited ballistic missile attacks. Its civil support mission includes disaster relief operations and counter-drug efforts. USNORTHCOM was established in 2002 to consolidate homeland defense and civil support missions previously handled by other military organizations. It provides assistance in response to disasters like hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as in counter-drug operations and managing the aftermath of terrorist events involving weapons of mass destruction. Military forces can offer civil support but cannot engage in law enforcement activities. General Ralph E. Eberhart was appointed as the first commander, and USNORTHCOM became operational on October 1, 2002. USNORTHCOM provided support for the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2002 and participated in terrorism response exercises in 2003. They conducted exercises to evaluate their ability to command multiple missions and announced full operational capability in 2003. In 2004, they practiced homeland defense missions with various organizations. In 2004, USNORTHCOM supported interagency efforts to deter threats against National Security Special Events and tested their response to chemical, radiological, and explosive hazards in California and Virginia. They also assisted FEMA in providing relief after Hurricane Charley and supported disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2006, USNORTHCOM participated in Exercise Ardent Sentry 06, a simulation of terrorist activities and natural disasters. They also detected and responded to the launch of six ballistic missiles by North Korea. During missile launches, Midcourse Defense System interceptors at Fort Greely, AK, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA, were operational. JFHQ-NCR at Fort McNair, Washington, D.C. is responsible for homeland defense in the National Capital Region, coordinating resources from various military branches. JTF-AK at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, works with government agencies to deter and prevent threats. The mission of JTF-CS is to deter, detect, prevent, and defeat threats in the Alaska Joint Operations Area to protect U.S. territory and interests. The task force consists of military members from all service branches and civilian personnel, commanded by a National Guard general officer. JTF-CS plans and integrates DOD support for domestic CBRNE consequence management operations. The commander of JTF-CS deploys to the incident site to provide timely and effective command and control of designated DOD forces, supporting civil authorities to save lives and prevent injury. JTF North, based at Biggs Army Airfield, Fort Bliss, TX, supports federal law enforcement agencies in interdicting suspected transnational threats within the continental United States. ARNORTH, located at Fort Sam Houston, TX, conducts homeland defense, civil support operations, and theater security. ARNORTH's mission is to conduct homeland defense, civil support operations, and theater security cooperation activities, including developing military response capability for CBRNE incidents. The Civil Support Readiness Directorate trains National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams. 1st Air Force, headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, ensures air sovereignty and defense of the continental United States as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. USFF, located in Norfolk, VA, controls air sovereignty activities for the continental United States. Its mission includes providing maritime forces for homeland defense, civil support operations, and theater security cooperation. USFF also generates ready Navy forces for global assignments, executes the Fleet Response Plan, coordinates Fleet warfighting requirements, and supports operational planning for USTRATCOM. USNORTHCOM and NORAD focus on homeland defense, air and missile defense, and maritime warning through continuous monitoring and detection operations. USNORTHCOM's operations include monitoring, detection, warning, and interception of air-breathing threats. They focus on countering terrorism, transnational criminal organizations, air defense, maritime and ballistic missile defense, and the Arctic. One of their primary concerns is Mexican transnational criminal organizations involved in illicit trafficking. USNORTHCOM collaborates with the Mexican government to combat these organizations. USNORTHCOM supports Mexican military with material solutions and operational insights to combat transnational criminal organizations. They provide border surveillance support to U.S. law enforcement agencies along both southern and northern borders. Concerns exist about potential constraints on assets if support is increased along one border. The Arctic has been designated as a key focus area for USNORTHCOM, with plans to provide support in search and rescue, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, and law enforcement in the region. USNORTHCOM has identified deficiencies in all-domain awareness, communications, infrastructure, mobility, search and rescue capabilities, Arctic Ocean charting, and environmental change observation. USPACOM protects and defends US territory and interests, promotes security cooperation, and is committed to enhancing stability in the Asia-Pacific region through partnership, presence, and military readiness. USPACOM's Area of Responsibility (AOR) covers half of the earth and is home to 3 billion people in three dozen countries, including five U.S. allies. It contains the world's three largest economies and a significant portion of U.S. trade. Established in 1947, USPACOM is the oldest and largest of the United States' COCOMs, incorporating responsibilities from other unified commands. The Alaskan Command and individual Army and Air Force component commands for the Pacific were established in Hawaii. USPACOM's responsibilities were expanded in 1972 to include the Indian Ocean, Southern Asia, and the Arctic. The Pacific Command's area was further expanded in 1976 to the east coast of Africa, covering over 100 million square miles. In 1983, CINCPAC was given responsibility for China, North Korea, Mongolia, and Madagascar, and was redesignated USCINCPAC. ALCOM was established in 1989 as a subordinate unified command under USCINCPAC. Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska became a subordinate unified command under USCINCPAC, consolidating defense leadership in the region. USPACOM's area of responsibility was adjusted multiple times from 1989 to 2000, with shifts to USCENTCOM and USEUCOM. The events of September 11, 2001, and the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review prompted changes in the UCP, marking a global division for defense strategy. USNORTHCOM was created for homeland security, leading to significant changes for USPACOM. The West Coast of North America was reassigned to USNORTHCOM, while Alaska remained under USPACOM. Antarctica was added to USPACOM's area of responsibility. The 2008 UCP transferred areas of the Indian Ocean to USAFRICOM, including four island countries previously under USPACOM. USARPAC, located in Fort Shafter, Hawaii, is the Army's component command in the Pacific. USFK, a subcommand within USPACOM, is responsible for U.S. forces in Korea. The U.S. Eighth Army operates in conjunction with USFK and the United Nations Command in Korea, supporting deterrence of North Korea aggression. If deterrence fails, Eighth Army supports Non-combatant Evacuation Operations and transitions to hostilities. The United Nations Command/USFK conducts combat operations in the Korea Theater of Operation. PACFLT is the world's largest fleet command with 180 ships, 2,000 aircraft, and 125,000 personnel. PACAF plans and conducts air operations in the Asian and Pacific region with components in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Guam. MARFORPAC is the Marine component. The United Nations Command/USFK conducts combat operations in the Korea Theater of Operation. PACFLT is the world's largest fleet command with 180 ships, 2,000 aircraft, and 125,000 personnel. PACAF plans and conducts air operations in the Asian and Pacific region with components in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Guam. MARFORPAC, the Marine component headquarters, includes the First Marine Expeditionary Force in California and the Third Marine Expeditionary Force based in Okinawa. SOCPAC, located in Hawaii, serves as the SOF component command for USPACOM. SOCKOR, in Korea, is responsible for special operations on the Korean peninsula. JIOC is the central clearing house for intelligence in the theater. APCSS supports USPACOM security cooperation efforts through international education programs. USPACOM's mission is to achieve the fullest possible accounting of all Americans missing as a result of past conflicts. They conduct 18 major exercises with partner nations and played a crucial role in assisting Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. USPACOM provided disaster relief support in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The commander highlighted major issues in the region, including North Korea's nuclear threat and transnational violent extremist organizations. The USPACOM commander expressed concern about China's military modernization and territorial disputes, which could lead to conflict. Cyber threats, transnational criminal activities, humanitarian crises, and environmental challenges were also highlighted. Additionally, a new defense strategy was unveiled in 2012 to address future security challenges and budget constraints. The new defense strategy aims to rebalance the Army's global posture, with a focus on the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. The Navy plans to shift its fleet towards the Asia-Pacific, increasing its presence in the region by 2020. Concerns about resources for this strategy led to a required review by the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will conduct a review of military resources necessary for the United States force posture strategy in the Asia Pacific region. This includes analyzing force structure, modernization plans, infrastructure, budget, and other defense program elements to determine required resources. The review will assess the military resources needed for the United States force posture strategy in the Asia Pacific region, including timing for operational capability, transportation requirements, specific military capabilities, and forward presence for conflict deterrence and response. The review will evaluate military resources required for the US force posture strategy in the Asia Pacific region, including equipment for conflict deterrence and response. Budget recommendations independent of the President's submission to Congress will be included. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will provide an assessment of risk and necessary capabilities after the review. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress one year after the Act's enactment, detailing the review results, including elements and assumptions used in the examination. USSOUTHCOM is responsible for contingency planning, operations, and security cooperation in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the defense of the Panama Canal. The Secretary of Defense will submit a report to Congress detailing the review results one year after the Act's enactment. During World War II, the U.S. Caribbean Defense Command was established to defend the Panama Canal and surrounding area, organizing regional defense operations. It also conducted military training missions in Latin America, distributed equipment through the Lend Lease program, and trained Latin American soldiers. At its peak, 130,000 personnel were stationed in Latin America and the Caribbean, with half under the command of the U.S. Caribbean Defense Command. During the 1950s, the U.S. Caribbean Command expanded its security responsibilities beyond the Panama Canal to include inter-American cooperation in Central and South America. In the 1960s, it was renamed USSOUTHCOM by the Kennedy Administration, focusing on defending the Panama Canal and Cold War contingency planning. During the 1970s, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended disestablishing USSOUTHCOM to reduce the U.S. military presence abroad, but it narrowly survived with limited responsibilities and resources. In the 1980s, conflicts in El Salvador and Nicaragua reignited U.S. military interest in Latin America, leading to a revitalization of USSOUTHCOM by the Reagan Administration. After the Cold War, USSOUTHCOM shifted focus to counter-drug operations, expanded its geographic area to include the Caribbean, and increased its capabilities. USSOUTHCOM expanded its geographic focus to include the Caribbean and enhanced its capacity for humanitarian missions. ARSOUTH, located in Ft. Sam Houston, Texas, supports regional disaster and counterdrug operations, as well as humanitarian and civic assistance projects. COMUSNAVSO/COMFOURTHFLT in Mayport Naval Base, Florida, provides naval capabilities and ensures freedom of maneuver in the region. AFSOUTH, based in Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, is responsible for Air Force forces in the region and oversees forward operating locations. USMARFORSOUTH in Miami advises USSOUTHCOM on Marine forces, deployment planning, and mission execution. USSOCSOUTH near Miami provides theater contingency response and special operations support. JTF-Bravo in Honduras operates a C-5 Galaxy-capable air base for multilateral exercises and humanitarian assistance in Central America. JTF-Guantanamo is also mentioned. USSOUTHCOM is involved in various operations in Central America, including counterdrug efforts and disaster relief. JTF-Guantanamo conducts detention and interrogation operations in support of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. JIATF-South in Key West integrates U.S. counterdrug operations and monitors suspect drug activity. CHDS in Washington, DC provides education and research on defense and policy making. USSOUTHCOM also participates in military exercises and operations to support the Theater Engagement Plan. USSOUTHCOM conducts various military exercises and operations in support of the Theater Engagement Plan, including medical readiness training, engineering exercises, and disaster relief efforts. Examples include civic assistance exercises in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. JTF-Guantanamo serves as a detention and interrogation center for suspected terrorists, while JTF-Bravo and JIATF-South focus on countering illicit trafficking activities. USSOUTHCOM task forces combat Transnational Criminal Organizations and violent extremist groups in Latin America and the Caribbean. The primary threats to regional security are drug, weapon, and human trafficking. Efforts include demand reduction, source material regulation, money laundering suppression, and interdiction of illegal shipments. Collaboration with regional partners and U.S. Interagency offices is crucial. Natural disasters, poverty, and violence negatively impact regional security and stability. Natural disasters and poverty in the region worsen economic and social conditions, leading to social stagnation and creating opportunities for criminal organizations to recruit members. Establishing relationships with extra-regional actors like China, Russia, and Iran can bring economic benefits but also presents challenges. In Latin America and the Caribbean, countries receive military training from China and Venezuela became the largest importer of Russian arms in 2011. Violent extremist organizations from the Middle East are active in the region, engaging in fund-raising activities. Congress faces national security policy issues impacted by the UCP and COCOM construct, especially as the U.S. shifts strategic emphasis to the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. New threats like cyber attacks are also a concern. The Administration's shift in strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific and Middle East raises issues for Congress to consider. Potential concerns include the need for a new UCP to codify the change, new Title 10 authorities, and additional resources for USPACOM to implement the new strategy effectively. The shift in strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region raises questions about the adequacy of USPACOM's command infrastructure and the impact on other COCOMs. Concerns include potential resource loss for USCENTCOM and USAFRICOM, and the ability to fulfill UCP-directed missions. Additionally, the response of allies and adversaries to the strategic shift is a key consideration. Former U.S. Ambassador Edward Marks highlighted the shift in military engagement programs, emphasizing the need for a whole-of-government approach to address security challenges like terrorism and international criminal networks. Military engagement with other countries should be integrated into broader U.S. government activities. The concept of a \"whole of government approach to national security\" has gained importance post-9/11. Senior military leaders advocate for increased involvement of other government agencies in national security, including higher funding for the State Department and USAID. Combatant Commanders are facing security challenges beyond traditional military issues, such as transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). TCOs are a significant concern for COCOMs and the President, necessitating their inclusion in security planning. The UCP process needs enhanced interagency involvement from the Justice Department and other U.S. law enforcement entities. Military engagement programs may become the primary focus for geographical COCOMs as hostilities decrease. Interagency participation in UCP development is limited, but a greater role in planning military engagement activities is crucial. The UCP process requires increased interagency involvement, particularly from the Justice Department and other law enforcement entities. Enhancing military engagement programs and including more Interagency representatives in planning could help identify redundancies and improve strategic planning. However, there may be resistance from the DOD towards greater involvement of other government agencies in military planning. Congress should consider a thorough examination of the UCP development process to assess current Interagency participation levels. In September 2000, Washington Post reporter Dana Priest's articles sparked a debate on Combatant Commanders' political influence overseas, questioning if they have assumed too much power, despite the Interagency's increased role in foreign policy. In 2007, Mark Malan from Refugees International criticized the DOD's marketing of USAFRICOM in Africa, stating that the military's humanitarian and developmental role is a facade to secure access to natural resources, particularly oil. The U.S. is seeking access to Africa's natural resources, especially oil, and establishing bases to combat Al-Qaeda networks. There are concerns that the true intentions behind promoting a combatant military command in Africa are being hidden from Africans. Geographic Combatant Commanders believe their role is more political than military, with a significant amount of time spent on political-military issues despite ongoing combat operations. The complexities of U.S. involvement in various countries have required Combatant Commanders to take on a more political role, as noted by some government officials. The relationship between Combatant Commanders and the State Department has been beneficial in achieving goals, as seen in examples from Turkey and Colombia. The relationship between Combatant Commanders and the State Department has been beneficial in achieving goals in countries like Colombia. Congress has examined this relationship in the broader context of civil-military relations and U.S. foreign policy. Consideration should be given to the role Geographic COCOMs play in U.S. foreign policy abroad, involving not just the State Department but other government agencies as well. The potential benefits of COCOM involvement overseas include a more \"civilian\" approach to U.S. engagement, leading to greater acceptance and efficacy in sensitive regions. Examining the roles of COCOMs, the State Department, and others could reveal areas of redundancy and areas needing more emphasis, improving U.S. political-military relations. With shrinking budgets predicted for the military and State Department, a cost-effective approach to foreign policy may be necessary. Some argue that the strict regional focus of COCOMs no longer aligns with the current global organization. Critics argue that the current regional alignment of COCOMs no longer fits the global organization due to globalization and localism trends. They suggest creating a separate command for the Subcontinent or Indian Ocean region to address this disparity. This new command could focus on countering violent extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan without being burdened by other issues like Iran's nuclear ambitions or the Israel-Palestine conflict. India's relationships with Pakistan and China could also play a significant role in this strategic recalibration. Some suggest creating a new COCOM for the Subcontinent or Indian Ocean region to address regional issues, including India's relationships with Pakistan and China. However, critics argue that establishing new COCOMs may not be financially sustainable due to resource-intensive nature. Establishing new COCOMs, whether Geographic or Functional, would be resource-intensive, requiring additional personnel, infrastructure, and potentially causing political and diplomatic issues. In a fiscally constrained environment, these considerations may outweigh any operational benefits. One proposal is to elevate U.S. Cyber Command to a Combatant Command for better Unity of Command/Effort. Establishing a separate USCYBERCOM as a Combatant Command would provide five key benefits: Unity of Command/Effort, greater authority and visibility, improved synchronization of cyber operations, prevention of adverse impacts from unsynchronized actions, and the ability to mass cyber activities effectively. Elevating USCYBERCOM to full combatant command status would enable mass coordination of cyber activities for greater offensive operations focus and a single mission focus, addressing current lack of direction and discipline in DOD and government entities. Some experts believe that elevating USCYBERCOM to full combatant command status could be challenging due to fiscal constraints, potential resistance from other COCOMs, and difficulties in recruiting cyber-qualified personnel. They argue that the COCOM construct is outdated and suggest a more radical approach to addressing cyber threats. Some experts propose a radical approach to modernize COCOMs post-9/11 by replacing service-centric Subcomponent Commands with Joint Task Forces (JTFs) at COCOM headquarters. JTFs, designed regionally or functionally, would enhance flexibility, streamline infrastructure, and improve crisis response time. This restructuring could allow for focused planning and operational execution in smaller, more manageable portions of COCOM Areas of Responsibility (AORs), with the ability to rapidly disestablish JTFs once specific conditions are resolved. The proposal suggests replacing COCOMs with permanent civilian-led interagency organizations to streamline operations and reduce costs. These organizations would have regional responsibility for U.S. foreign policy, include representatives from all major government agencies, and report directly to the President through the NSC. DOD would still exercise its Title 10 authority through JIATFs, leading to increased unity of effort across all national instruments. A new civilian-led interagency organization could improve unity of effort in U.S. national power operations, enhance coalition partnerships, and reduce the military presence in sensitive regions. This alternative to the current COCOM construct offers potential benefits for regional engagement and development efforts. While Congress may not directly address COCOM reform, pursuing this new construct could address current and future security needs. As Congress, the Administration, and DOD pursue government-wide efficiencies to reduce federal spending, exploring alternatives like a new civilian-led interagency organization could inform the debate on addressing current and future security needs."
