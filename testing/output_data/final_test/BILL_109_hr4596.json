SEC. 4. Graduate Scholar Awards in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (GSA-STEM). The National Science Foundation will establish the Graduate Scholar Awards in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (GSA-STEM) program to award graduate fellowships in these fields. Fellowships will include a $30,000 annual stipend for recipients and $15,000 for tuition at their institution. An advisory board will be set up to identify national needs for the program. The GSA-STEM program will address shortages of scientific and engineering personnel with advanced degrees in areas of national need. The advisory board will be selected from federal agencies supporting research in STEM fields. Selection criteria for fellowship awards will be based on the Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship program, with an additional criterion being pursuit of an advanced degree in a national need area identified by the advisory board. Authorization of Appropriations: $225,000,000 for fiscal year 2007, $450,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, and $675,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2009 through 2011. The Presidential Innovation Award is established. The Presidential Innovation Award is established to recognize individuals who develop unique scientific or engineering ideas in the national interest. The award aims to stimulate advances in science and engineering, highlighting the connection between these fields and national needs. The Presidential Innovation Award recognizes individuals who develop unique scientific or engineering ideas in the national interest, aiming to stimulate advances in these fields and highlight their connection to national needs. Recipients must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents eligible for naturalization. The award is presented by the President with appropriate ceremonies. The President presents the Presidential Innovation Award with appropriate ceremonies, including attendance by Members of Congress. SEC. 6. NATIONAL COORDINATION OFFICE FOR RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE. The Office of Science and Technology Policy will establish a National Coordination Office for Research Infrastructure to identify deficiencies in research facilities and instrumentation, prioritize them, and recommend resource allocation. The Director will appoint staff from federal agencies supporting research in sciences, mathematics, and engineering, including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Funds authorized will be competitively available for construction and maintenance of research facilities at higher education institutions. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will provide an annual report to Congress detailing research infrastructure needs and proposed projects for funding. $333,000,000 is authorized for the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.
