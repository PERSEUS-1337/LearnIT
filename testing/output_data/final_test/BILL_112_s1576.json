Over 316,000 people died, including 103 Americans and 100 UN personnel. Around 3 million people were directly affected. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti directly affected an estimated 3 million people, displacing over 2.1 million from their homes. Casualties and infrastructure damage made it one of the worst disasters in modern times, with economic losses totaling $7.8 billion. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, faced a devastating earthquake in 2010. More than 70% of Haitians lived on less than $2 per day before the disaster. House Resolution 1021 expressed condolences for the loss of life and bipartisan support for Haiti's recovery. The initial emergency response was led by the United States Government. After the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the United States Government, through agencies like USAID and US Southern Command, swiftly deployed urban search and rescue teams from various locations to assist in the disaster response. Additionally, a month later, the House of Representatives unanimously passed House Resolution 1059 in support of Haiti's recovery efforts. House Resolution 1059 expressed gratitude to US urban search and rescue units for their efforts in Haiti, where they rescued over 130 people from the rubble. Various individuals, businesses, and organizations supported Haiti through innovative methods like text message fundraising. The Haitian diaspora in the US played a crucial role in emergency relief efforts by providing significant monetary support through remittances. Significant challenges persist in Haiti's recovery and rebuilding efforts, with approximately 680,000 people still in camps. Reconstruction progress has been slow, and irregularities in the 2010 elections have caused unrest. The elections in Haiti on November 28, 2010, led to violence, while an outbreak of cholera in October was exacerbated by Hurricane Tomas, causing widespread deaths and infections. The United States has provided over $62 million in assistance to combat the cholera epidemic in Haiti, reducing the mortality rate from nearly 7 percent to 1.7 percent. The people of Haiti have shown resilience, dignity, and courage throughout the crises. On March 20, 2011, Haiti held presidential and parliamentary elections without major disruptions. An international donors conference in March 2010 pledged over $5 billion to support Haiti, with $1.9 billion disbursed and $2 billion committed. Haiti will require ongoing international support to address the cholera epidemic and promote reconstruction and development. SEC. 3. REPORT. The President must submit a report to Congress within six months of this Act's enactment on post-earthquake efforts in Haiti, including cholera prevention and treatment. The report will assess relief, recovery, and reconstruction progress, including US Government programs and projects. The report to Congress will evaluate US Government programs and projects in Haiti, focusing on vulnerable populations, water, sanitation, and health improvements, coordination efforts among agencies, and engagement with Haitian ministries and local authorities. The report to Congress will assess US Government programs in Haiti, including communication of progress, involvement of Haitian civil society and diaspora, and Haiti's capacity to receive deported individuals. Funding for the report required under subsection (a) will come from existing discretionary funds of specified departments and agencies."
