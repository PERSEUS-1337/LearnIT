    "content": "On January 21, 2019, Venezuela's Supreme Court declared the National Assembly illegitimate. Venezuelan military authorities arrested 27 National Guard members for attempting to incite an uprising. On January 15, 2019, the National Assembly declared President Maduro had usurped the presidency and appointed Juan Guaid\u00f3 to lead a transitional government. On January 13, 2019, Venezuela's intelligence service detained and released Juan Guaid\u00f3, who had expressed willingness to assume the presidency on an interim basis. The U.S. Department of State and the Organization of American States condemned Maduro's power grab. On January 10, 2019, the OAS rejected the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term due to an election deemed illegitimate by the opposition and international community. The US imposed sanctions on individuals and companies involved in a $2.4 billion currency manipulation scheme. Investors demanded payment on a defaulted $1.5 billion bond from the Venezuelan government. On December 14, 2018, Venezuela's last independent newspaper, El Nacional, ceased its print edition after facing government restrictions and threats. The United Nations launched an appeal for $738 million to aid Venezuelan refugees and migrants in 2019 amidst the country's deep political, economic, and humanitarian crisis. Venezuela's current leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has worsened the economic crisis caused by low oil prices through mismanagement and corruption. Under his rule, Venezuela has transitioned from being \"partly free\" to \"not free\" according to Freedom House. Maduro has suppressed dissent, replaced the legislature with a controversial National Constituent Assembly, and won reelection in 2018 in elections deemed illegitimate by several countries. Relations with the U.S. have deteriorated due to concerns over human rights violations and lack of democratic principles. The Maduro government in Venezuela has deepened concerns by manipulating democratic institutions, cracking down on opposition, media, and civil society, engaging in drug trafficking and corruption, and refusing humanitarian aid. Efforts to restore democracy have failed, leading to international criticism and sanctions. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's victory in 1998 reflected Venezuelans' rejection of traditional politics. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's victory in 1998 signaled Venezuelans' rejection of the traditional parties that had dominated politics for 40 years. His rise to power was fueled by popular disillusionment with politicians who were seen as mismanaging the country's oil wealth. Ch\u00e1vez promised constitutional reform to address the dominance of a small elite class and the mismanagement of revenues from the state oil company. In 1992, two attempted military coups threatened the P\u00e9rez presidency, one led by Ch\u00e1vez, who was a lieutenant colonel at the time. Ch\u00e1vez served two years in prison for the failed coup attempt. In May 1993, P\u00e9rez was dismissed from office for misusing public funds. The election of Rafael Caldera as president in December 1993 brought political stability, but a severe banking crisis occurred. A recession began in 1998 due to a decline in oil prices, leading to Ch\u00e1vez's landslide election. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela adopted a new constitution and a new name for the country - the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. After the 1998 election, President Ch\u00e1vez expanded state control over the economy, nationalizing private enterprises and asserting majority state control in the oil sector. His use of oil revenue for social programs, subsidized oil to other countries, and opposition to the United States gained global attention. Ch\u00e1vez's legacy includes reducing poverty by 20%, improving literacy and healthcare, and empowering the poor through community councils and cooperatives. However, his presidency was criticized for a concentration of power and disregard for democratic norms. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency was marked by a concentration of power and disregard for human rights guarantees, especially after his brief ouster in 2002. Venezuela's constitution was amended in 2009 to centralize power in the presidency and establish five branches of government. The president of Venezuela serves six-year terms and can be reelected indefinitely, with the power to be subject to a recall referendum. Ch\u00e1vez exerted influence over government branches and appointed pro-Ch\u00e1vez justices to dominate the Supreme Court. The National Assembly can act as a check on presidential power and consists of a unicameral Chamber of Deputies with 167 seats. Members serve for five years and may be reelected once, with the ability to approve or reject legislation with a simple majority. After President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's death in March 2013, Venezuela held presidential elections the following month where acting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro narrowly defeated Henrique Capriles. Maduro faced opposition allegations of irregularities and protests. Seeking to consolidate his authority, Maduro's security forces violently suppressed protests. In 2014, violent clashes between pro-government forces and student-led protesters resulted in 43 deaths and 800 injuries. President Maduro imprisoned opposition figures, including Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, for allegedly inciting violence. The Maduro government cracked down on the opposition in 2015 and faced setbacks in the December 2015 legislative elections when the MUD captured a two-thirds majority in Venezuela's National Assembly. The Maduro government took actions to thwart the legislature's power, including blocking three MUD deputies from taking office. The PSUV-aligned Supreme Court blocked three MUD deputies from taking office, depriving the opposition of a two-thirds majority needed for certain legislative actions. The Supreme Court assumed many of the legislature's functions from January 2016 to August 2017. Opposition efforts to recall President Maduro in a national referendum were hindered by government delaying tactics. The recall effort was suspended in October 2016 after allegations of fraud in a signature collection drive. The Venezuelan government and opposition engaged in talks mediated by the Vatican and other international leaders. The opposition left the talks in December 2016 due to lack of government progress. President Maduro appointed a controversial vice president and cracked down on dissent, including media outlets and journalists. Popular protests had decreased, but the opposition remained active. In response to the Supreme Court's rulings in March 2017, the MUD opposition in Venezuela became reenergized, leading to protests against President Maduro's government. The government banned opposition leader Henrique Capriles from seeking office for 15 years, sparking more demonstrations. Clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in over 130 deaths and hundreds injured. President Maduro faced international criticism and calls for political prisoners' release and an early presidential election. In May 2017, President Maduro announced plans for a constituent assembly to revise the constitution, leading to July 30 elections boycotted by the opposition. Despite protests and international criticism, a 545-member National Constituent Assembly was elected to draft a new constitution. The 545-member National Constituent Assembly (ANC) was elected in July 2017 to draft a new constitution in Venezuela. The ANC's legitimacy was questioned due to allegations of inflated votes and its actions to consolidate power, including dismissing the Attorney General and assuming legislative powers. President Maduro further solidified his control over the government from mid-2017 to May 2018. President Maduro strengthened his control over the PSUV and gained the upper hand over the MUD despite international condemnation. PSUV won 18 of 23 gubernatorial elections in October 2017, with evidence of linking food assistance to votes for its candidates. The opposition could not prove widespread fraud, leading to a fractured coalition. President Maduro and the ANC moved to consolidate power, blaming U.S. sanctions. President Maduro and the ANC consolidated power, blaming U.S. sanctions for economic issues. Maduro replaced officials in PdVSA for corruption, appointing a general as oil minister. The ANC passed a law restricting freedom of expression. PSUV dominated municipal elections in 2017. Opposition parties faced re-registration requirements for the 2018 presidential contest. The Venezuelan opposition leaders negotiated with the PSUV for guarantees in the presidential elections, but the ANC called for early elections in violation of the constitution. The MUD declared a boycott, but Henri Falc\u00f3n ran independently, promising reforms like accepting humanitarian aid and dollarizing the economy. Former governor of Lara, Henri Falc\u00f3n, pledged to accept humanitarian assistance, dollarize the economy, and promote national reconciliation in Venezuela's minimally competitive presidential election. President Maduro's control over state institutions weakened Falc\u00f3n's campaign, with reports of coercion, propaganda, and lack of international monitors. Maduro won with 67.7% of the votes, followed by Falc\u00f3n (21%) and Bertucci (10.8%). Voter turnout was low at 46%, leading to calls for new elections due to widespread fraud. Falc\u00f3n and Bertucci called for new elections to be held following President Maduro's mounting economic problems, coup attempts, and international isolation. Maduro's government released political prisoners and reshuffled his Cabinet to strengthen control. In December 2018, PSUV-dominated municipal council elections saw low participation as most opposition parties boycotted. The opposition remained weak and divided in 2018. During 2018, Maduro focused on quashing coup plots and dissent within the military, leading to the arrest of perceived threats, including military officers and an opposition legislator. The government held 278 political prisoners, with reports of torture documented by human rights groups. The death of opposition politician Fernando Alb\u00e1n in custody sparked protests and international concern, amidst a backdrop of 70% of the population favoring Maduro's resignation. Observers predict mounting protests and internal dissent against Maduro's regime, with potential defections. Former ally Christian Zerpa fled the country, citing the lack of free and competitive elections. Juan Guaid\u00f3, elected president of the National Assembly, has declared himself willing to serve as interim president of Venezuela. Secret police detained individuals in response to the escalating political situation. Secret police detained and released Guaid\u00f3 on January 13, 2019; it is unclear if they acted under Maduro's authority. The Brazilian government and OAS support Guaid\u00f3 as \"interim president,\" while the US urges Venezuelans to rally behind him. The National Assembly has declared Maduro illegitimate, established a transition government framework, and asked 48 countries to freeze Maduro's assets. The Supreme Court, aligned with Maduro, has ruled on the situation. The Maduro-aligned Supreme Court has invalidated the new leadership of the National Assembly, raising concerns about the deterioration of democratic institutions and human rights abuses in Venezuela under President Maduro. Security forces' response to protests and calls for change remains uncertain. The UNOCHR issued a report on human rights violations by Venezuelan security forces against protestors, citing excessive force, torture, and cruel treatment. They called for an international investigation. Another report in June 2018 documented abuses by crime-fighting units, a health and food crisis, and impunity for security officers involved in protest-related deaths. Foro Penal and Human Rights Watch reported over 5,300 Venezuelans affected. In 2017 and 2018, human rights groups documented over 5,300 Venezuelans detained during protests, with more than 300 detainees subjected to inhumane treatment. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights criticized the violation of separation of powers in Venezuela, highlighting government interference in the legislature. The State Department's report noted a dramatic deterioration in human rights, including trials of civilians in military courts and restrictions on social protests and freedom of expression. In 2017, the Venezuelan government faced criticism for trying civilians in military courts and arresting opposition mayors. An independent panel recommended the ICC investigate reports of crimes against humanity. PROVEA, a human rights organization, reported 2017 as the worst year for human rights in Venezuela. PROVEA criticizes Maduro government for neglecting humanitarian crisis, leading to deaths and mass emigration. International calls for investigation into human rights abuses in Venezuela, with U.N. Human Rights Council adopting resolution expressing deep concern. The June 2018 report highlighted serious human rights violations in Venezuela, prompting calls for humanitarian assistance and a UNOCHR investigation. Former Venezuelan officials, the OAS, and neighboring countries have urged the ICC to investigate the Maduro government for human rights abuses, with a preliminary investigation opened in February 2018. Former Attorney General Luisa Ortega presented evidence to the ICC of over 1,800 extrajudicial killings by the police and military, urging charges against Maduro and his officials for human rights abuses. An exiled judge appointed by the National Assembly also accused senior Maduro officials of systemic human rights abuses before the ICC. The governments of Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru requested an investigation of Venezuela's actions by the ICC in September 2018. Venezuela, once prosperous, heavily relied on oil exports to fund its government budget. President Ch\u00e1vez used oil revenues for social programs, leading to a significant increase in government debt. Ch\u00e1vez used oil revenues to expand influence abroad through PetroCaribe, while also implementing policies that discouraged foreign investment and led to economic mismanagement. When Maduro took office in 2013, he inherited an economy heavily reliant on oil exports, which struggled when oil prices crashed in 2014. The Maduro government faced economic challenges after oil prices crashed in 2014, leading to a budget deficit. Instead of adjusting fiscal policies, they printed money, causing inflation. Attempts to control inflation through price controls failed, leading to shortages and black market transactions. The government also struggled with a substantial debt burden owed to various entities. Initially, they tried to service the debt by cutting imports, including food and medicine. The Trump Administration imposed sanctions on Venezuela in 2018, worsening the government's fiscal situation. Venezuela's economy has been contracting since 2014, with a significant decline in GDP. Hyperinflation has led to shortages of critical supplies. The government's rapid expansion of the money supply has caused hyperinflation in Venezuela, leading to shortages of critical supplies like food and medicine. This has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and massive migration. Despite defaulting on its debt, the government has made no progress in negotiations with creditors. Venezuela remains in default with nearly $8 billion owed to private creditors. The government runs large budget deficits, with debt levels estimated at 160% of GDP. Blaming the economic crisis on a foreign \"economic war,\" the government launched the digital currency \"petro\" to raise funds, claiming to have raised $3.3 billion. The Venezuelan government launched the digital currency \"petro\" to raise funds through blockchain technology, claiming to have raised $3.3 billion. However, the amount raised has not been independently confirmed, and there are doubts about the petro's operational viability. In August 2018, the government acknowledged its role in hyperinflation and introduced new policies to address the economic crisis, including a new currency and budget deficit reduction measures. Since August, Venezuela's government has struggled to restore confidence in the economy despite implementing new policies. President Maduro sought financial aid in Moscow, but doubts were raised about investment deals with Russia. Investors holding defaulted Venezuelan bonds may soon challenge the government in U.S. courts for repayment, potentially seizing assets like Citgo. Creditors of Venezuela are demanding payment on a defaulted $1.5 billion bond, with expectations that other creditors will follow suit. The country's economic crisis has been ongoing for years with no clear resolution in sight, exacerbated by political turmoil. U.S. sanctions complicate restructuring efforts, and investors may seize assets like Citgo through legal challenges. The government's policy responses to the economic crisis have been criticized as inadequate, with reluctance to adopt necessary measures like removing price controls, creating an independent central bank, engaging with the IMF, and restructuring debt. Venezuela has resisted IMF surveillance since 2004, but provided some economic data in 2018. Analysts are unsure if this signals a change in the government's stance towards the IMF. Venezuela's economy heavily relies on oil revenues, accounting for 98% of export earnings. Despite having the largest oil reserves globally, production has been declining over the past four years. In 2017, oil production averaged 1.9 million barrels per day, with projections indicating a further decrease to just over 1 million barrels per day by 2023. Production in Venezuela has been declining, with November 2018 averaging 1.13 million b/d. PdVSA's performance is affected by corruption allegations, arrests of executives, and infrastructure challenges. Massive debt, U.S. sanctions, and revenue-generating issues add to the company's woes. Corruption, revenue-generating issues, and declining production have plagued PdVSA. In mid-2018, Conoco's attempt to seize PdVSA facilities led to delivery delays due to nonpayment. Corruption has led to billions disappearing from the company, with former executives accused of laundering oil income. Since 2017, military control has replaced technocrats, further impacting performance. Production by PdVSA-controlled assets declined by 27.5% from 2010 to 2015, while joint ventures saw a 42.3% increase. Maduro's government's actions, like arresting Chevron executives, have caused uncertainty in these ventures. Military officials are now signing contracts with inexperienced companies for basic functions, as PdVSA faces pressure to make payments to bondholders and Crystallex to prevent the transfer of Citgo ownership control. The International Court awarded Crystallex a $1.4 billion settlement linked to Venezuela seizing the company's assets. Venezuela agreed to make payments towards the settlement but violated terms in December 2018, casting doubt on Crystallex's ability to collect. Sanctions imposed on Venezuela aim to impact PdVSA's operations, including limiting access to debt. This raises uncertainty about the future of Citgo's ownership control. Sanctions on PdVSA limit debt access, impacting business activities. Venezuela faces challenges with insecurity, lack of essentials, and a growing exodus of people to neighboring countries like Colombia. The economic crisis in Venezuela has led to a significant increase in poverty and malnutrition. Basic consumer goods are scarce, and inflation has made food unaffordable for many. Malnourishment has risen sharply, with a high percentage of children suffering from malnutrition and stunted growth. Venezuela's health system has also been severely affected by budget cuts. Venezuela's health system has been severely affected by budget cuts, leading to shortages of medicines, doctors, nurses, and basic supplies. Hospitals face critical shortages of antibiotics, intravenous solutions, and even food, with many operating rooms not in use. A national hospital survey found that 88% of hospitals lack basic medicines and 79% lack surgical supplies. Thousands of doctors and nurses have emigrated, exacerbating the healthcare crisis. The health system in Venezuela has been severely affected by budget cuts, leading to shortages of medicines, doctors, nurses, and basic supplies. A report in 2017 showed a significant increase in infant mortality rates and the spread of infectious diseases like diphtheria and measles. Malaria cases also saw a sharp rise, and HIV/AIDS deaths increased due to a collapse in treatment programs. Concerns are raised about the lack of reliable contraception leading to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and dangerous abortions. The World Health Organization is assisting Venezuela in purchasing vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella. Doctors urge more assistance to address the health crisis. $9.2 million in emergency funding is allocated for nutritional support and healthcare for vulnerable populations. As of November 2018, over 3 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants had left the country, with the majority in Latin America and the Caribbean. UNHCR estimated over 1 million Venezuelans in Colombia, 500,000 in Peru, 220,000 in Ecuador, and significant numbers in other countries. Smaller territories like Trinidad and Tobago have also been impacted, hosting around 60,000 Venezuelans by late 2018. Between September 2014 and 2018, roughly 400,000 Venezuelans in the region and beyond applied for political asylum, while a further 960,000 Venezuelan arrivals in Latin America had been granted alternative legal forms of stay. Humanitarian experts are most concerned about the roughly 60% of Venezuelans in need of international protection. Humanitarian experts are concerned about the 60% of Venezuelans in neighboring countries lacking identification documents, making it difficult to obtain legal status. This displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere poses risks of arrest, deportation, and abuse. Neighboring countries are urged to review migration policies and address the legal status of Venezuelan refugees. Humanitarian organizations and governments are providing assistance to displaced Venezuelans in the region. Protection and assistance needs for displaced Venezuelans in the region are significant, including support for reception centers, emergency relief items, legal assistance, protection from violence, and temporary work programs. International organizations have launched appeals for additional assistance, with the U.S. government providing humanitarian aid and coordinating regional response efforts. The international response to the Venezuelan refugee crisis involves various organizations, including the U.N., Red Cross, and civil society. Former Guatemalan Vice President Eduardo Stein is the U.N. Joint Special Representative for Venezuelan Refugees and Migrants. The regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) aims to assist Venezuelans on the move and support their inclusion in host communities. The RMRP, supported by 95 organizations in 16 countries, seeks $738 million in funding for emergency assistance and protection. The Maduro government in Venezuela has maintained alliances with Cuba and other leftist governments in Latin America, but its economy has weakened its foreign policy. President Maduro now relies on financial support from China and Russia. More countries are criticizing his authoritarian actions, bringing concerns to global organizations and implementing sanctions. Over 50 countries did not recognize the results of the 2018 presidential elections. The international community does not recognize Maduro's presidency as legitimate, leading to increasing isolation. The OAS, U.S., and EU have all refused to acknowledge his current term. Paraguay has cut diplomatic ties, Peru recalled its diplomat, and other countries may follow suit. Venezuela faces sanctions from various countries, including Canada and the EU, targeting corrupt officials. The EU expanded arms embargo against Venezuela and imposed sanctions on officials for human rights violations and undermining democracy. Panama and Switzerland also sanctioned Venezuelan officials. South American countries have distanced themselves from Venezuela due to Maduro's authoritarian actions. Mercosur suspended Venezuela over government violations in December 2016. Market (Mercosur) trade bloc suspended Venezuela for violating democratic institutions. UNASUR members oppose Venezuelan Supreme Court power grab. Colombia working with South American countries to create new regional entity isolating Venezuela. Colombia supports OAS actions, aids Venezuelan migrants, monitors border. Colombian and Brazilian Presidents pledge to hasten Maduro's exit. Tensions high along border with Guyana. Tensions remain high along the border with Guyana as Venezuela's navy stopped ExxonMobile ships conducting surveys for the Guyanese government. The Lima Accord, signed by 12 Western Hemisphere countries, rejects democracy rupture and human rights violations in Venezuela, criticizes the government's refusal of humanitarian aid, and does not recognize the ANC. The signatory countries include Mexico, Canada, Central American countries, and South American countries. Most Lima Group countries support targeted U.S. economic sanctions but reject military intervention discussions. On February 13, 2018, Guyana and St. Lucia joined the Lima Group in calling for negotiations for a new electoral calendar in Venezuela agreed upon with the opposition. They also supported Peru's decision to disinvite President Maduro to the Summit of the Americas. The Lima Group, which includes 19 countries, did not recognize the results of the May 20, 2018, Venezuelan elections and authorized sanctions to help hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela. The Lima Group, consisting of 13 members, urged President Maduro to cede power to the National Assembly until elections can be held. They resolved to reassess diplomatic engagement, impose travel bans or sanctions on high-level Maduro officials, suspend military cooperation, and evaluate financial assistance. Mexico, a former member, abstained from the declaration due to a policy of nonintervention. Mexico abstained from voting on the Lima Group's resolution urging President Maduro to step down. Some critics question this policy shift, while others suggest Mexico could mediate between the government and the opposition. Thirteen countries, including the United States, supported an OAS resolution on Venezuela, not recognizing Maduro's second term. The Maduro government still receives support from Cuba, Bolivia, and Nicaragua, key members of the ALBA group. Caribbean ALBA members were hesitant to take action against Maduro until recently. Ecuador, also an ALBA member, has been critical of Maduro since Len\u00edn Moreno took office in May 2017. Since Len\u00edn Moreno took office in May 2017, Ecuador has been critical of the Maduro government. In January 2019, Ecuador and Haiti voted in favor of an OAS measure deeming Maduro's second term illegitimate, while only Bolivia, Dominica, Nicaragua, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname supported Venezuela. Cuba solidified its relationship with Venezuela in 2000 through an oil agreement. Estimates suggest there were around 40,000 Cuban personnel in Venezuela in 2014, with a majority being healthcare workers. In 2014, an estimated 40,000 Cuban personnel were in Venezuela, with 75% being healthcare workers. Cuban military and intelligence advisors in Venezuela, coordinated by Cuba's military attach\u00e9, may have ranged from hundreds to thousands. Cuban intelligence officers have reportedly assisted the Maduro government in identifying and disrupting coup plots. Despite importing more oil from Russia and Algeria since 2017, Venezuela remains committed to providing what it can, even if purchased from other sources. Maintaining close relations with China and Russia, the country's largest sources of financing and investment, has become a priority as Venezuela's economic situation deteriorates. China provided $62.2 billion in financing to Venezuela from 2007 to 2016. In 2016, China provided $62.2 billion in financing to Venezuela for infrastructure and economic projects, including military equipment loans. Repayment is through oil deliveries, but China stopped new loans in fall 2016. Critics question China's support for Maduro's government. China refrained from negative comments after the Constituent Assembly elections and accepted the May 2018 election results. Russia remains a strong ally of the Maduro government. Russia has been a strong ally of the Maduro government in Venezuela, supporting peaceful resolution of the political crisis. Trade relations between Russia and Venezuela were not significant in 2016, with most of the $336 million total trade being Russian exports to Venezuela. However, Russia had a major market for arms sales in Venezuela between 2001 and 2013, totaling over $11 billion. Russia's decision in 2017 to allow Venezuela to restructure $3.15 billion in debt provided financial relief to the Maduro government. Russian state oil companies Rosneft and Gazprom have significant investments in Venezuela's oil and gas markets. Russia has been a strong ally of the Maduro government in Venezuela, supporting peaceful resolution of the political crisis. In early December 2018, Maduro visited Russia to seek investment, resulting in Rosneft lending PdVSA $6.5 billion. Russia also sent nuclear-capable jets to Venezuela for joint exercises in a show of support. The United States has had friction in relations with Venezuela under the Maduro regime due to concerns about human rights and lack of cooperation on counternarcotics and counterterrorism. The United States has expressed concerns about Colombian criminal and terrorist groups in Venezuela, providing democracy and human rights funding, political support, and humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans who have fled to neighboring countries. Sanctions have been imposed in response to activities of the Venezuelan government, escalating after President Maduro's actions in 2017 and the illegitimate elections in 2018. The Trump Administration has sought to increase pressure on the Maduro government. The Trump Administration has increased pressure on the Maduro government in Venezuela through targeted sanctions on officials accused of corruption, antidemocratic actions, or human rights abuses. Executive orders have been issued to restrict Venezuela's access to the U.S. financial system, digital currency, and debt. Sanctions have also been imposed on those involved in Venezuela's gold sector or corrupt transactions with the government. The Trump Administration has escalated pressure on the Maduro government in Venezuela through targeted sanctions. Following President Maduro's second inauguration, U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, supported National Assembly leader Juan Guaid\u00f3's claim to the presidency. Vice President Pence also backed Guaid\u00f3. The U.S. is considering limiting or prohibiting petroleum trade with Venezuela, with some analysts believing oil sanctions could hasten the regime's downfall while others warn of increased suffering for the Venezuelan people. The U.S. has provided democracy-related assistance to Venezuelan civil society for over a decade through USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy. The U.S. has provided democracy-related assistance to Venezuelan civil society through USAID and NED. Assistance included small grants and technical support to monitor democratic stability and strengthen institutions. Funding amounts varied from $4.3 million to $7 million annually, but the Trump Administration did not request assistance for FY2018. Congress provided $15 million in democracy and human rights programs for Venezuela. For FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $9 million to support democracy and human rights programs in Venezuela. Congress has yet to enact a full-year FY2019 appropriations measure, with the House Committee bill recommending $15 million and the Senate Committee bill recommending $20 million for programs in Venezuela. In FY2017, NED funded 43 projects in Venezuela totaling $2.6 million. The U.S. government provided humanitarian and emergency food assistance, totaling approximately $96.5 million for the Venezuela regional response in FY2017 and FY2018 combined. The U.S. Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort provided medical support in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, and Honduras to assist arrivals from Venezuela. The U.S. government also provided $37 million in bilateral assistance to Colombia for responding to Venezuelan arrivals. Targeted sanctions were used in Venezuela to signal disapproval of officials violating U.S. laws or human rights norms. Sanctions can target officials with international travel and assets in the US without harming the population. Some believe sanctioning Venezuelan officials could increase pressure on the Maduro government, while others think it may harden their positions. The Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 required sanctions against those responsible for violence or human rights abuses. In July 2016, Congress extended sanctions against individuals undermining democratic processes or human rights in Venezuela until December 31, 2019. President Obama's Executive Order 13692 authorized targeted sanctions on those involved in corruption or limiting freedom of expression. The Treasury Department has imposed these sanctions. The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on 65 Venezuelans involved in public corruption, including members of the Supreme Court, CNE, Cabinet, Constituent Assembly, and security forces. President Maduro and other officials have also been sanctioned. The Treasury sanctioned four members of President Maduro's inner circle, including his wife and executive vice president, under E.O. 13850. Sanctions were also imposed on individuals and companies involved in corrupt transactions and illegal mining in Venezuela. Venezuela has received a Tier 3 ranking in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons reports since 2014. The U.S. has not imposed TIP-related sanctions on Venezuela, as aid goes to NGOs and is in national interest. Government arrested trafficking suspects but lacks data on prosecutions. President Trump's E.O. 13808 restricts Venezuelan government's access to U.S. financial markets to deny financing for Maduro's regime and allow for humanitarian assistance. Sanctions targeting Venezuelan sovereign debt aim to cut off new funds to the Maduro government, restricting transactions by U.S. investors and prohibiting purchases of Venezuelan government securities. CITGO is barred from sending profits to Venezuela but can operate in the U.S. Short-term debt is also targeted to maintain trade access, including oil imports. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to restrict financing and trade, impacting oil imports and government finances. Treasury issued licenses to mitigate economic effects, while debates arose on potential defaults and alternative financing sources. International banks halted transactions with Venezuela, worsening its fiscal position. Additional executive orders were issued in 2018 to further limit Venezuela's access to U.S. financial markets. Executive Order 13827 and 13835 were issued in 2018 to restrict Venezuela's access to U.S. financial markets, prohibiting U.S. investors from purchasing the petro digital currency and Venezuelan government debt. Venezuela faces high crime rates, with a decline in homicides in 2018 attributed partly to migration. In Venezuela, the homicide rate is high, with a decline in 2017 due to migration. The impunity rate for homicide is around 92%, with extrajudicial killings by security forces and criminal groups on the rise. Amnesty International reported human rights abuses by security forces, while Insight Crime identified high-level officials involved in criminal activities, blurring the lines between crime groups and the state. In Venezuela, kleptocracy has cost the country $70 billion, with pervasive corruption facilitating drug trafficking and money laundering. Cooperation with the U.S. DEA was suspended in 2005 over spying allegations, hindering antidrug efforts. Venezuela has failed to approve an antidrug cooperation agreement with the U.S. and has been designated annually as not adhering to international antidrug obligations since 2005. In 2018, President Trump designated Venezuela as one of two countries not meeting antidrug obligations but waived economic sanctions. The State Department reported Venezuela as a preferred trafficking route for illicit drugs due to porous borders, economic crisis, weak judicial system, and corruption. The report highlights cocaine trafficking routes through Venezuela, facilitated by Colombian and Mexican drug-trafficking organizations. Despite a significant increase in coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia, drugs transiting Venezuela in 2017 were destined for various regions including the Caribbean, Central America, the United States, West Africa, and Europe. The report states that Venezuelan antidrug forces seized only 32 metric tons of drugs in the first six months of 2016, compared to 66 MT in the first eight months of 2015. Venezuelan authorities struggle to prosecute drug traffickers due to political corruption and lack the necessary equipment, training, and resources. Cooperation with the United States on interdiction has decreased, with Venezuela working on six maritime drug interdiction cases in 2016. The report by Insight Crime reveals the involvement of Venezuelan military, particularly the National Guard, in drug trafficking since 2002. It identifies sanctioned officials and provides evidence of their ties to the drug trade. The Cartel of the Suns has collaborated with illegal armed groups and trafficked cocaine through various countries. High-level Venezuelan officials or their relatives have been implicated in international drug trafficking, with President Maduro either dismissing the cases or appointing the accused to Cabinet positions. On August 1, 2016, the U.S. Federal Court unsealed an indictment against two Venezuelans for cocaine trafficking to the United States. General N\u00e9stor Luis Reverol Torres and Edylberto Jos\u00e9 Molina, former officials, were accused of drug-trafficking activities from 2008 to 2010. President Maduro appointed General Reverol as Minister of Interior and Justice in response to the indictment. In December 2017, two nephews of First Lady Cilia Flores were sentenced to 18 years in a U.S. federal prison for conspiring to transport cocaine into the United States. The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on individuals and companies with connections to Venezuela for narcotics trafficking. The 2018 INCSR discusses Venezuela's vulnerability to money laundering and financial crimes, with widespread money laundering evident in various industries. Venezuela's currency-control system creates incentives for trade-based money laundering. The country revised its laws against organized crime and terrorist financing in 2014 but excluded the government and state-owned industries from investigations. The unit investigating financial crimes has limited capabilities, and there is a lack of political will in the judicial system to combat money laundering and corruption. The 2018 INCSR highlights Venezuela's vulnerability to money laundering due to weak AML supervision, lack of political will, and endemic corruption. A U.S. district judge sentenced Florida owners for laundering $100 million from Venezuela. The Treasury advised U.S. financial institutions to report suspicious transactions related to Venezuela. The 2018 INCSR highlights Venezuela's vulnerability to money laundering due to weak AML supervision, lack of political will, and endemic corruption. Recent sanctions against Venezuelan officials could lead other non-designated political figures to protect their assets. Illegal gold mining in Venezuela has surged, contributing to deforestation, environmental degradation, and violence among criminal gangs and miners. Illegal mining in Venezuela has led to violence among criminal gangs, including extortion and human rights violations such as child labor recruitment. Armed groups control smuggling routes and guerrillas seek to control mining areas near the borders. Venezuelan migrants are also exploited through human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Violent conflict and security threats are escalating in border regions between Colombia and Venezuela. Human trafficking, sexual exploitation of migrants, and drug trade disputes involving FARC guerrillas and the ELN are contributing to the instability. Freddy Bernal, a figure on the U.S. Kingpin List, is involved in security operations in T\u00e1chira state, where clashes between armed groups and Venezuelan military have resulted in casualties. The ELN attacked a Venezuelan military base in October 2018, killing three soldiers, and also killed three Venezuelan national guardsmen in November 2018. Colombia has protested Venezuelan troops crossing into its territory. Venezuela is under a U.S. arms embargo due to not cooperating fully with antiterrorism efforts. Sanctions were imposed on individuals and travel agencies in Venezuela for supporting Hezbollah. The State Department designated Hezbollah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under E.O. 13224 to impede terrorist funding. Critics question if Venezuela has repeatedly supported international terrorism as required by law. Sanctions could include aid restrictions and financial limitations. Bilateral petroleum trade between the U.S. and Venezuela is heavily weighted towards Venezuelan crude oil exports. In recent years, Venezuela's crude oil exports to the United States have declined significantly. In 2017, Venezuela was the fourth-largest foreign supplier of crude oil to the U.S., providing an average of 618,000 b/d, down from 1.5 million b/d in 2015. By 2018, oil imports from Venezuela had further decreased to around 500,000 b/d, the lowest since 1989. This decline is reflected in the value of Venezuela's oil exports to the U.S., which were $11.7 billion in 2017, down from $29 billion in 2014. The United States has seen a significant decline in oil imports from Venezuela, dropping from $29 billion in 2014 to $11.7 billion in 2017. This decrease is due to Venezuela's decreased production, increased U.S. oil imports from Canada, and difficulties in importing oil from Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions. PdVSA, Venezuela's state-owned oil company, has been facing fiscal problems and has resorted to delaying payments and using promissory notes for payments, which may be considered as new credit under the sanctions. The Trump Administration is considering various sanction options on Venezuela's petroleum sector to pressure the Maduro government. Sanctions could impact oil production due to delayed payments and promissory notes being considered as new credit. Prohibiting Venezuelan petroleum exports to the U.S. could have the greatest impact, affecting Venezuela's cash flow and access to a key market. The Trump Administration is considering sanctions on Venezuela's petroleum sector to pressure the Maduro government. Prohibiting Venezuelan petroleum exports to the U.S. could impact Venezuela's cash flow and access to a key market. Venezuela may need to find alternative markets like India and China, potentially leading to price discounts on crude oil. U.S. oil refiners would also be affected, with substitute crude oil prices likely to rise. U.S. oil producers, however, could benefit financially from an increase in oil prices. The U.S. government has supported OAS efforts on Venezuela under Secretary General Luis Almagro. Almagro invoked the Inter-American Democratic Charter to address the situation in Venezuela. The OAS Secretary General Almagro issued reports on Venezuela's political and economic situation, highlighting disruptions to the democratic order. The Permanent Council struggled to reach a consensus on how to respond until mid-2018. In March 2017, Almagro called on Venezuela to take measures to restore constitutional order or face suspension from the OAS. In May 2017, President Maduro instructed his foreign minister to begin the process for Venezuela to withdraw from the OAS in protest of its recent actions, the first time in OAS history that a country has sought to quit. Despite the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, some countries were reluctant in 2017 to follow Almagro's lead in responding to the situation in Venezuela. During the OAS General Assembly meeting in June 2017, 20 countries voted in favor of adopting a resolution to press the Venezuelan government to take concrete actions, but it failed because it needed 23 votes. In July and September 2017, Secretary General Almagro spoke out against the Maduro government's actions, describing abuses against protesters and denouncing the formation of a \"dictatorial regime.\" He initiated a process to analyze if these actions constitute crimes against humanity, leading to a report in May 2018 recommending a referral to the ICC. Secretary-General Almagro's activism on Venezuela has been praised by some, but others doubt his credibility as a mediator with the Maduro government. The OAS has voted against the Maduro government since the May 2018 election, declaring the electoral process as lacking legitimacy. Financial sanctions have been authorized to help restore democracy. The Permanent Council also refused to recognize Nicolas Maduro's new term, with Almagro supporting Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim President. On January 11, 2019, Juan Guaid\u00f3 was welcomed as interim President of Venezuela in accordance with Article 233 of the Venezuelan constitution. Despite President Maduro's reelection, Guaid\u00f3's leadership in the National Assembly poses a challenge to Maduro's control. Recent arrests of high-level military officials indicate dissent within the military forces, raising questions about their response to the National Assembly's approval of a transition government framework and an amnesty law for military members. The Trump Administration has increased pressure on the Maduro government through sanctions and assistance to neighboring countries hosting Venezuelan refugees. There is uncertainty surrounding Juan Guaid\u00f3 potentially declaring himself interim president and how Maduro and the international community would respond. Stronger measures, such as a ban on petroleum trade with Venezuela, have been considered but not implemented to avoid worsening the humanitarian crisis. The Trump Administration has increased pressure on the Maduro government through sanctions and assistance to neighboring countries hosting Venezuelan refugees. Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo have condemned Maduro's term as illegitimate and supported Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the National Assembly. The 116th Congress may consider measures to address the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, including funding for democracy and human rights programs. Congress could also authorize U.S. humanitarian assistance. Congress may consider measures to address the situation in Venezuela, including funding for democracy and human rights programs, U.S. humanitarian assistance, adjusting immigration status for Venezuelans in the U.S., and imposing sanctions to influence the Venezuelan government. Oversight may focus on external actors in Venezuela and the impact of the crisis on the region. In the event of a change in government, Congress may authorize support for the country's reconstruction. The Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017, later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, was signed into law on May 5, 2017.

The House resolution supported humanitarian aid to Venezuela, urged UN relief delivery, called for sanctions on corrupt officials, and expanded criteria for imposing sanctions. S. 1018, introduced in 2017, aimed to prevent Rosneft from controlling U.S. energy infrastructure, coordinate assistance with other donors, support OAS election observation in Venezuela, and report on activities of Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba. S. 1018 authorized $10 million in humanitarian assistance for Venezuela, $9.5 million for democracy and human rights assistance, and $500,000 for OAS electoral missions. S. 3486, introduced in 2018, contained similar provisions and authorized an additional $40 million in humanitarian assistance. The bill authorized $40 million in humanitarian assistance, required a donor's conference on Venezuela, supported holding Venezuelan officials accountable for crimes against humanity, allocated $15 million for democratic actors, mandated efforts to recover stolen assets, planned for economic reconstruction contingent on governance change, increased intelligence reporting on drug trafficking and corruption, expanded sanctions, and collaborated with Latin American governments on sanctions regimes. The Organization of American States (OAS) Secretary-General invoked the Inter-American Democratic Charter to address disruptions of the democratic order in Venezuela. Despite calls for diplomatic efforts to restore democracy, the OAS Permanent Council did not take further action. The OAS Permanent Council urged the Venezuelan government to allow the recall referendum process to proceed and encouraged dialogue efforts to achieve concrete results. As dialogue failed, Secretary-General Almagro called for measures to resume the constitutional order, including holding general elections without delay, or face possible suspension from the OAS. Article 21 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter allows for the suspension of Venezuela from the OAS if the government does not address recommendations. A two-thirds vote of member states is needed for suspension. The Permanent Council expressed concern over the unconstitutional actions in Venezuela and planned diplomatic initiatives for restoring democracy.

In February and June 2018, resolutions were passed calling for early elections and denouncing the lack of legitimacy in the electoral process in Venezuela. The Panel of Experts found reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed in Venezuela. The OAS passed a resolution in January 2019 to not recognize Nicolas Maduro's new term and urged member states to take measures to hasten a return to democracy in Venezuela, including calling for new presidential elections with international observers and addressing the humanitarian needs of Venezuelan migrants.
