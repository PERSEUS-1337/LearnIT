    "content": "The budget cycle involves practices by Congress and the President that impact revenue and expenditure trends. Budget baselines measure how legislative changes affect the budget outlook. The process spans four years, starting with agencies compiling budget requests overseen by OMB. The President submits the budget to Congress around February, about eight months before the fiscal year begins. The budget cycle involves practices by Congress and the President that impact revenue and expenditure trends. The budget resolution, agreed upon by the House and Senate, sets the framework for subsequent budgetary legislation. If there is disagreement, a \"deeming resolution\" may be implemented. House and Senate Appropriations Committees begin reporting discretionary spending bills after the budget resolution is agreed upon. During the budget cycle, Congress and the President set funding levels through appropriations acts. Authorizing committees and committees overseeing revenues also influence budget decisions. Baseline projections are used to forecast the impact of current laws and future legislation on spending and revenues, included in the President's budget and congressional budget resolution. Treasury and GAO conduct year-end audits after the fiscal year ends on September 30. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes baseline projections using assumptions from budget enforcement legislation. The 2017 tax revision made changes to individual and corporate income tax rates set to expire within the 10-year budget window. Discretionary spending levels are constrained by caps and automatic reductions from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline projections are based on current law, including caps on discretionary spending and expiring tax policy changes. This leads to lower spending and higher revenue levels compared to a \"current policy\" baseline. The Congressional Budget Office's baseline projections are influenced by economic and technical assumptions, such as GDP growth, inflation, and interest rates. Changes in these assumptions can lead to significant variations in future deficit levels. The latest CBO baseline shows increasing budget deficits in the coming years, a shift from previous declines due to higher employment and reduced discretionary spending. Despite continued decreases in discretionary outlays, rising mandatory spending offsets these reductions. Mandatory spending increases, driven by rising costs of Social Security and Medicare, along with declines in federal revenues, offset reductions in discretionary spending. Baseline projections also show a rise in debt held by the public, reaching 96.2% of GDP by FY2028. Alternative policy assumptions project spending and revenue levels if current policies continue. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a significant increase in the budget deficit if tax reductions from the 2017 tax revision are extended. Federal deficits are expected to grow due to rising health care and retirement costs, with little change in projected revenue levels. Federal spending has exceeded revenues since FY2002, resulting in annual budget deficits. Between FY2009 and FY2012, the U.S. government experienced significant budget deficits due to the economic downturn and policy responses to financial turmoil. In FY2017, spending was $3,982 billion and revenue was $3,316 billion, resulting in a deficit of $665 billion, higher than the historical average. Federal outlays are divided into discretionary, mandatory, and net interest spending categories, with entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid making up the bulk of mandatory spending. Total outlays in the federal budget are primarily composed of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which fall under mandatory spending. Congress determines eligibility and benefits for these entitlement programs, leading to outlays being made without annual appropriations. Net interest includes government interest payments on public debt. Outlays as a percentage of GDP have fluctuated over the years, reaching a peak of 24.4% in FY2009 and projected to rise to 23.6% in FY2028 according to CBO baseline data. Discretionary spending in the federal budget peaked at 13.1% of GDP in FY1968, gradually declined to 6.1% in FY2000, increased to 9.1% in FY2010, and fell to 6.4% in FY2017. Short-term increases are projected due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 led to significant increases in discretionary spending in FY2018 and FY2019. Projections show a decrease in discretionary spending to 5.9% of GDP by FY2021, reaching 5.4% by FY2028. This decline is mainly due to reductions in the Budget Control Act. Mandatory spending has also increased over time, now totaling 4.7% of GDP. Mandatory spending has consistently grown, driven by increases in programs like Social Security and Medicare. It peaked in FY2009 at 14.5% of GDP due to the recession, but has since decreased with the economic recovery. However, it is projected to increase again starting in FY2019. CBO projects mandatory spending to reach 15.2% of GDP in FY2028, surpassing the FY2009 level. In FY2017, mandatory spending was 63% of total outlays, discretionary spending was 30%, and net interest was 7%. The largest mandatory programs were Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, making up 48% of federal spending. CBO projects a rise in net interest and a decline in discretionary spending by FY2028. Some experts argue that reducing mandatory spending is necessary for long-term federal spending decline. In FY2017, federal revenue collections totaled 17.3% of GDP, with real revenues increasing due to an improving economy. The 2017 tax revision significantly altered federal receipt projections. Experts warn that cuts in mandatory spending may disrupt households and that addressing increasing deficits and high debt levels is crucial for long-term fiscal health. The 2017 tax revision led to changes in federal receipt projections, including reductions in individual and corporate income tax rates. Revenues are projected to decline to 16.5% of GDP in FY2019 before gradually increasing to 18.5% of GDP in FY2028. Individual income taxes remain the largest revenue source for the federal government. In FY2017, individual income tax revenues were 8.3% of GDP, while social insurance programs increased to 6.1% of GDP. Corporate income and other outlays decreased to 1.5% and 1.4% of GDP, respectively. The CBO projects higher individual tax revenues in FY2028, lower other receipts, and corporate and payroll taxes similar to FY2018 collections. The 2017 tax revision's impact on government revenue and spending resulted in a $665 billion deficit in FY2017, equivalent to 3.5% of GDP. Excluding off-budget items, the on-budget federal deficit was $715 billion. This deficit influences the level of publicly held federal debt and interest payments. The FY2018 budget deficit is projected to be $804 billion, with outlays increasing to 20.8% of GDP and revenues falling to 16.6% of GDP. Gross federal debt includes debt held by the public and intragovernmental debt, with the former being the total amount borrowed from the public. The federal debt limit is set by Congress to control the amount of debt sold in credit markets. It requires visible action from Congress and the President to authorize further borrowing. The debt limit can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage finances when approaching the ceiling, leading to extraordinary measures to meet obligations. The Treasury has had to take extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations when facing a binding debt limit, leading to inconvenience and uncertainty. Consequences include reduced ability to borrow funds, turmoil in global economies, and penalties for late payments. This could also impact the perceived credit risk of federal government borrowing, potentially decreasing borrowing capacity. In FY2017, the US spent $263 billion on net interest payments on the debt. Currently, low interest rates have kept net interest payments as a percentage of GDP below the historical average despite increased borrowing. Concerns exist that rising interest rates could strain the budget in the future. The 115th Congress passed legislation impacting the federal budget, including the 2017 tax revision with significant changes to the tax code. The 2017 tax revision made extensive changes to the federal tax system, including temporary modifications to individual income tax brackets and a reduction in the top rate. Congress has also enacted legislation impacting discretionary spending caps and the statutory debt limit. The 2017 tax revision made extensive changes to the federal tax system, including temporary modifications to individual income tax brackets with a reduction in the top rate from 39.6% to 37%, an increase in the income threshold for the top bracket, and a temporary increase in the individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption. Additionally, there was a permanent modification in corporate income tax rates from a graduated rate structure to a flat rate of 21%, and a permanent repeal of the corporate AMT. Numerous modifications, mostly temporary, were made to tax expenditures available to individual and corporate income tax filers, including changes to the standard deduction, mortgage interest deduction, and deduction for state and local taxes paid. There was also a temporary increase in the federal estate and gift tax exclusion scheduled to expire at the end of tax year 2025, and a permanent shift in the taxation of foreign income from a modified worldwide basis to a new system. The 2017 tax revision shifted from a worldwide taxation basis to a territorial profits basis. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a $1,456 billion increase in deficits from FY2018 to FY2027, with a projected deficit decrease in FY2027 due to expiring provisions. Excluding macroeconomic effects, deficits were estimated to decrease by $385 billion over the same period. The 2017 tax revision shifted to a territorial profits basis, increasing deficits by $1,456 billion from FY2018 to FY2027. The BBA 2018, enacted on February 9, 2018, modified deficit reduction measures imposed by the BCA, aiming to reduce deficits by at least $2,100 billion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. The BCA included caps on discretionary budget authority and a sequester on some mandatory spending. The 2017 tax revision increased deficits by $2,314 billion from FY2018 to FY2028, with macroeconomic feedback reducing deficits by $461 billion. Including macroeconomic feedback, the act was estimated to increase deficits by $1,854 billion over the same period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018) amended deficit reduction measures established by the Budget Control Act (BCA) through short-term increases in discretionary spending and extension of the sequester on mandatory programs. Unlike previous amendments, the budgetary effects of BBA 2018 were not offset by other changes in the law. Table 3 illustrates the changes in discretionary caps from FY2014 to FY2021 since the enactment of the BCA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018) raised discretionary caps in FY2018 and FY2019 by $296 billion, significantly more than previous amendments to the Budget Control Act (BCA). This increase is projected to be $114 billion higher than the initial caps set by the BCA. However, caps for FY2020 and FY2021 remain largely unchanged since 2012. Congress enacts laws each year for discretionary appropriations, giving federal agencies the authority to incur obligations for a single fiscal year through regular, supplemental, or continuing appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) provided full-year appropriations for federal agencies through the end of FY2018. Funding lapses may lead to partial or full shutdowns of federal operations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 suspended the debt limit until March 1, 2019, allowing for additional federal borrowing. Treasury had used extraordinary measures before the enactment of BBA 2018 to manage the debt limit. The Trump Administration submitted its FY2019 budget to Congress on February 12, 2018, outlining national priorities and policy initiatives. The budget projects a deficit of $873 billion for FY2018, with deficits expected to increase in FY2019 before declining over the budget window. The budget proposes significant spending cuts in nondefense discretionary programs, Medicaid, ACA, and Medicare, while also suggesting increases in infrastructure spending. The budget proposes increases in infrastructure and defense spending, resulting in total outlays increasing by $199 billion over the FY2019-FY2028 period. Policy changes are estimated to reduce net interest spending by $319 billion and decrease deficits by $813 billion over the same period. The budget forecasts additional growth due to the 2017 tax revision, with smaller deficit reduction estimates. The President's budget projects a 3.0% real economic growth rate per year, higher than CBO's projections of 1.9% per year from FY2019 through FY2028. The President's budget projects a 3.0% real economic growth rate per year, higher than CBO's projections. Differences in economic projections with CBO have been smaller than in previous budgets. The Administration estimated that a 1% lower growth rate would increase projected budget deficits by $3,144 billion over the FY2018 to FY2028 period. The FY2019 budget provided two deficit projections, with the BBEDCA baseline projecting a deficit of $0.969 trillion (4.6% of GDP). The FY2019 budget provides two deficit projections: under current law, the deficit is projected to total $0.969 trillion (4.6% of GDP), while under the proposed budget, deficits would decrease steadily, reaching $363 billion (1.1% of GDP) in FY2028. The cumulative deficits over the FY2019-FY2028 period are projected to be $11,540 billion under current law and $7,095 billion under the proposed budget. Neither projection includes the budgetary effects of BBA 2018, which would increase deficits by $252 billion over FY2018-FY2027. The President's budget proposes deficit reductions of $4,445 billion over the next decade compared to the pre-policy baseline. Adjustments to discretionary spending caps are included in the budget, originally established by the Budget Control Act. Since the enactment of the BCA in 2011, Congress and the President have made several modifications to allow for additional spending cuts. The President's budget proposes changes to discretionary spending caps established by the Budget Control Act, with increases to defense caps and decreases to nondefense caps in FY2020 and FY2021. The budget also suggests modifications to discretionary spending in FY2022-FY2028. The Administration proposes increases to defense spending ranging from $87 billion to $92 billion annually from FY2022-FY2028. Nondefense spending is set to decrease from $132 billion in FY2022 to $274 billion in FY2028. Congress is focusing on the FY2019 budget after passing FY2018 appropriations. The budget committees in the House and Senate are developing budget legislation based on information from various sources. Discretionary budget authority limits for FY2019 are set to be $647 billion for defense activities and $597 billion for nondefense activities, $36 billion higher than FY2018 limits. The federal budget faces ongoing challenges with deficit reduction and long-term sustainability. Increased spending on entitlement programs may lead to rising deficits and debt. Congress may revisit deficit reduction measures, including discretionary caps on defense and nondefense budget authority through FY2021. Discussions over FY2019 discretionary appropriations legislation are expected to be prominent in near-term congressional debates. The federal budget faces challenges with deficit reduction and long-term sustainability. Congress may modify discretionary caps on defense and nondefense budget authority through FY2021 and spending reduction measures on certain mandatory programs through FY2027. The debt limit is currently suspended through March 2019, and Treasury may enact extraordinary measures to postpone when the debt limit binds. The latest CBO budget forecast projects a larger nominal budget deficit. The latest CBO budget forecast projects a larger nominal budget deficit in FY2019 ($981 billion) than in FY2017 ($665 billion), potentially reducing the effectiveness of extraordinary measures to postpone the debt limit. Deficit spending can help smooth outlays and revenues in the short term, but persistent deficits lead to growing federal debt with adverse long-term consequences. The United States faces a future imbalance due to rising retirement and healthcare costs, leading to a borrowing crisis. Additional deficit reduction is needed to ensure long-term fiscal solvency. Deficit reduction policies like the BCA have improved near-term deficits but do not address long-term budget growth. Additional measures such as tax increases or spending cuts are necessary for sustainable budgeting. The CBO projects sustained deficits despite economic growth, which is deemed unsustainable by CBO, GAO, and the Trump Administration due to rising health care costs and an aging population. Federal health spending is expected to increase significantly as a percentage of GDP by 2047. The CBO and GAO project rising federal spending on programs like Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, leading to growing debt and interest payments consuming a larger share of future federal spending. Interest payments on the federal debt are projected to increase from 1.4% of GDP in FY2017 to 5.2% in FY2047. Without changes, debt held by the public could exceed historical highs in the next 15 to 25 years. Drastic reductions in spending would be needed to maintain federal outlays at 20% of GDP. Under CBO's extended baseline, maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at today's level in FY2047 would require significant cuts in non interest spending or revenue increases. To bring debt levels down to historical averages, even larger spending reductions or revenue increases would be necessary. The federal government can reduce deficits by either cutting spending or increasing revenues through tax system modifications. The 2017 tax revision reduced revenues over a 10-year period, but projections show revenues increasing to 18.5% of GDP by FY2028. The long-term constraint on increasing federal debt is the amount of remaining \"fiscal space\" that creditors are willing to finance. The federal government's fiscal space depends on debt size, growth rate, and investor interest in federal debt. As debt increases, there is a point where investors may stop financing deficits. Presently, low interest rates mitigate concerns about running out of fiscal space in the short term. The Congressional Budget Office provides data and analysis to Congress on budget and appropriations. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides data and analysis to Congress on budget and appropriations. CBO issues Budget and Economic Outlook reports with baseline estimates of outlays and revenues, evaluating legislative proposals' budgetary consequences. Baseline estimates show spending and revenues under current law, not predicting future outcomes. CBO updates projections in late summer, setting a current-law baseline as a benchmark for legislative evaluation. The CBO evaluates legislative and revenue proposals, releases publications on the fiscal health of the US, and provides budget projections over 30 years. They offer policy options and their impact on spending and revenues. The President's budget includes five major volumes with projections. The Administration's budget documents include projections of the fiscal outlook and proposed spending levels for federal departments. The Historical Tables volume provides budget data dating back to 1962. The Department of the Treasury's Green Book offers further details on revenue proposals in the budget."
