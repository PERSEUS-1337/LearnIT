    "content": "The Enron Employee Pension Recovery Act of 2002 may be cited as the ``Enron Employee Pension Recovery Act''. Securities and Exchange Commission is granted authority to provide relief. Proceeds of Enron and Andersen Enforcement Actions: In SEC proceedings against Enron Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, or Arthur Andersen L.L.C., and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners for securities law violations related to services for Enron, funds may be recovered. The SEC may order an accounting and disgorgement of funds from corporations involved in securities law violations. The disgorgement fund will be allocated according to specific requirements. Former Enron employees have priority in receiving funds from the disgorgement fund, with allocations based on their participation in individual account plans. The Enron Employee Pension Recovery Act of 2002 dictates that allocations from the disgorgement fund should be based on the investments made by individuals in the securities of the Corporation, subsidiary, or affiliate. Additionally, any civil penalties collected by the SEC in related proceedings will be directed to the disgorgement fund. Federal campaign contributions can also be transferred to the disgorgement fund as per the Act. The Enron Employee Pension Recovery Act of 2002 allows the Commission to accept gifts, bequests, and devises for the disgorgement fund, which includes money and proceeds from property sales. The Commission is defined as the Securities Exchange Commission in this section. The term \"securities laws\" refers to various acts including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The \"disgorgement fund\" is a fund established in certain legal proceedings, and a \"subsidiary or affiliate\" is an entity related to a person through control. The term \"officer, director, or principal shareholder\" in relation to Enron Corporation or its subsidiaries refers to individuals subject to Securities Exchange Act requirements. The terms \"nonforfeitable\", \"accrued benefit\", and \"individual account plan\" are defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974."
