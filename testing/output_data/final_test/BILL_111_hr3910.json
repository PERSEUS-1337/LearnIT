    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Longline Catcher Processor Subsector Single Fishery Cooperative Act\" and grants authority to approve and implement a single fishery cooperative for the Longline Catcher Processor subsector in the BSAI. The Secretary can approve a single fishery cooperative for the longline catcher processor subsector in the BSAI upon request from eligible members holding 80% of the licenses. The cooperative must limit each member from harvesting more than 20% of Pacific cod, with penalties for violations, except for CDQ quota allocations. The Stevens Act requires the longline catcher processor subsector to submit a contract for a fishery cooperative by November 1 each year. Any modifications to the contract must be submitted 60 days before fishing begins. Additionally, before the first year of fishing, a letter requesting a business review from the Attorney General must be submitted to the Secretary. The Secretary must implement a single fishery cooperative within 2 years of receiving a request. If the longline catcher processor subsector does not submit a contract, it will operate as a limited access fishery for the following year. SEC. 3 allows a single fishery cooperative to harvest BSAI Pacific cod and prohibited species allocations, as well as any reallocated Pacific cod. SEC. 4 addresses the longline catcher processor subsector non-cooperative limited access fishery. Eligible members not participating in a fishery cooperative will operate in a non-cooperative limited access fishery under the license limitation program. They can collectively harvest a percentage of BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch allocated to the longline catcher processor sector. Eligible members in the license limitation program for 2006-2008 must use catch data for their licenses and adhere to the BSAI Pacific cod prohibited species catch allocation. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has the authority as stated in Section 5. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council has the authority to recommend conservation measures under the Magnuson-Stevens Act to ensure effective fishery management in the BSAI and Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod fishery. The Council is limited in altering the methodology for allocating BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch and prohibited species catch to a single fishery cooperative. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council can recommend harvest limitations for the Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod Fishery to protect coastal communities. The Council may modify harvest limitations for a single fisheries cooperative after 7 years if it does not harm eligible members of the longline catcher processor subsector. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council can recommend harvest limitations for the Gulf of Alaska Pacific Cod Fishery to protect coastal communities and other participants from potential competitive advantages provided to the longline catcher processor subsector by this Act. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO THE MAGNUSON-STEVENS ACT. A single fishery cooperative approved under this Act aims to enhance conservation, sustainable fishery management, reduce bycatch, promote social and economic benefits, and improve vessel safety in the BSAI. It is deemed to meet certain requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act unless the Secretary determines otherwise within 30 days. The Secretary can recover reasonable costs to administer a fishery cooperative approved under this Act, in line with Magnuson-Stevens Act regulations. SEC. 7. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA PROGRAM. The Act does not impact the western Alaska community development program under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, including fishery resource allocation in the Pacific cod fishery. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, BSAI refers to the Pacific cod total allowable catch and prohibited species catch allocation for the directed longline catcher processor subsector in the BSAI, as established annually by the Council and approved by the Secretary. The Council, as defined by the Magnuson-Stevens Act, approves the annual Pacific cod total allowable catch and prohibited species catch allocation for the longline catcher processor subsector in the Gulf of Alaska. Eligible members hold licenses to participate in this subsector. The term \"Magnuson-Stevens Act\" refers to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Commerce."
