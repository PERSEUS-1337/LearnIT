    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Cats Conservation Act of 2007\". The findings section follows. Congress finds that many wild populations of felids are in decline, with all 37 wild felid species worldwide recognized as needing protection. Felids are important global resources with intrinsic value and serve as indicator species for ecosystem health. Measures to benefit these keystone species will also benefit other species. Endangered felids face various threats such as habitat loss, human activities, and disease. Conservation efforts require global commitment and adequate funding to protect these species effectively. Additional targeted funding can significantly enhance existing protections for endangered felid populations and their habitats. The Act aims to provide financial resources and promote international cooperation to restore healthy populations of great cats in the wild and aid in the conservation of these populations globally. The Act defines CITES as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and conservation as methods to ensure sufficient populations of great cats in the wild for long-term viability, including habitat protection, research, monitoring, and law enforcement. The Act defines CITES as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and conservation as methods to ensure sufficient populations of great cats in the wild for long-term viability, including habitat protection, research, monitoring, law enforcement, community outreach, conflict resolution initiatives, and capacity building for conservation programs. The Fund refers to the Great Cats Conservation Fund, and great cats include lions, leopards, jaguars, snow leopards, clouded leopards, cheetahs, and Spanish lynx. The Secretary refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The Act establishes the Great Cats Conservation Assistance program. The Great Cats Conservation Assistance program provides financial assistance for projects aimed at conserving great cats. Project proposals can be submitted by wildlife management authorities or individuals with expertise in great cat conservation. The Great Cats Conservation Assistance program requires project proposals to include a statement of purpose, responsible individual, qualifications of project staff, implementation methods, staffing logistics, community involvement, and estimated funds and time. The project proposal for the Great Cats Conservation Assistance program must include details such as estimated funds and time required, support from relevant governmental entities, information on matching funding, and any other necessary information for evaluation by the Secretary. The Secretary will review and approve project proposals within 30 days of receiving them. The Secretary will review project proposals within 30 days of receiving them and consult with relevant wildlife management authorities and government officials for approval or disapproval within 180 days. The Secretary will review and approve or disapprove project proposals within 180 days, notifying relevant parties. Approval criteria include conservation programs, addressing human-wildlife conflicts, compliance with laws, and scientific research on great cats. The Secretary gives preference to conservation projects promoting great cat habitat health, population monitoring, and long-term sustainability. Matching funds availability and project reporting are also considered for project approval. Each recipient of assistance for a project must submit periodic reports to the Secretary, containing necessary information for evaluating project progress and success. These reports, along with related documents, will be made available to the public. The Secretary may convene an advisory group to assist in implementing the Act. The Secretary may convene an advisory group representing organizations involved in great cat conservation. The group must hold open meetings for public participation, provide timely notice and keep minutes of each meeting. The Secretary may convene an advisory group for great cat conservation, with open meetings and minutes kept. The group's records will be public, and it is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Great Cats Conservation Fund is established under SEC. 6. Established within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund is the Great Cats Conservation Fund, which consists of transferred amounts, appropriations, and interest earned. The Fund allows for expenditures as requested by the Secretary of the Treasury without further appropriation. The Secretary may determine necessary amounts for assistance under section 5, with up to three percent or $80,000 for administrative expenses. The Treasury Secretary can invest excess Fund amounts in US interest-bearing obligations.
