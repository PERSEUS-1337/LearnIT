Congress finds that Haiti, Grenada, and the Cayman Islands were severely devastated by Tropical Storm Jeanne and Hurricane Ivan. In Haiti, over 1,500 people are confirmed dead and more than 1,000 are missing due to Tropical Storm Jeanne. Prime Minister Gerard Latortue expressed concerns about the risk of an epidemic due to the lack of electricity and functioning morgues in the affected areas. The United Nations urged for the immediate burial of storm victims in mass graves to prevent the spread of disease. In Haiti, 250,000 people were homeless and 4,000 homes were destroyed by Tropical Storm Jeanne. Hurricane Ivan left 39 dead in Grenada, with 40,000 residents living in converted shelters. Grenada's Prime Minister declared a national disaster, stating the island was 90% devastated. Hurricane Ivan caused widespread devastation in Grenada, with 125 mph winds flattening homes, disrupting power, and damaging critical infrastructure. Electrical engineers estimated that 85-90% of electricity systems on the west and north coasts were destroyed. An environmental health hazard emerged from contaminated rivers due to runoff containing pathogens, including human waste. Hurricane Ivan caused extensive damage in Grenada, with reports of looting and a need for $2.2 billion for rebuilding. Assistance from abroad is crucial as the main industries of nutmeg exports and tourism have been severely affected. Hurricane Ivan devastated the Cayman Islands with 150 mph winds, causing extreme damage to homes. Temporary protected status was granted to nationals unable to return due to the hurricane's impact in the Caribbean region. Granting temporary protected status to nationals of Haiti, Grenada, and the Cayman Islands is consistent with US interests and values due to the extraordinary and temporary conditions caused by natural disasters in these countries. Designation for granting temporary protected status to Haitians, Grenadians, and Caymanians. Designation for temporary protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act for Haiti, Grenada, and the Cayman Islands. Initial designation period is 18 months from the date of enactment. Aliens from these countries must meet specific requirements to be eligible. Aliens granted temporary protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act must meet specific requirements, including continuous physical presence in the US since September 7, 2004, admissibility as an immigrant, and registration as established by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary shall provide consent for travel abroad to eligible aliens. Aliens with temporary protected status can travel abroad for brief trips due to emergency circumstances if approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Upon returning to the US, they will be treated the same as other returning aliens with temporary protected status."
