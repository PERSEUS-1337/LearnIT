The designated areas must have the highest average ranking with respect to specific criteria. The Secretary of Commerce will prescribe regulations within 4 months of the enactment of the \"NAFTA-Impacted Communities Relief Act\" for nominating areas, specifying size and population parameters, and evaluating nominated areas based on specific criteria.
