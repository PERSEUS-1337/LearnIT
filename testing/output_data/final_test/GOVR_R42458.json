    "content": "One long-standing policy question facing Congress is how to budget for and deal with unexpected costs incurred in response and recovery from disasters. This question was raised in the 112th and 113th Congresses (2011-2013) as part of discussions about government funding decisions and their impact on the economy, budget deficit, and national debt. The Budget Control Act (BCA, P.L. 112-25) changed the terms of the debate by outlining separate treatment for disaster relief and redefining \"disaster relief\" as federal government assistance provided for major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. Funding designated as disaster relief in future spending bills could be \"paid.\" The House Appropriations Committee proposed offsetting $1 billion of emergency supplemental appropriations for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which had been depleted faster than projected due to major storms and floods. The House suggested rescinding unspent money from another department's budget to cover the additional funding, but the proposal was not supported in the Senate's version of the bill. The House proposed offsetting emergency supplemental appropriations for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, but the Senate did not support the proposal. The issue of offsets for disaster assistance funding continued to be debated as Hurricane Sandy relief efforts called for $60.4 billion in supplemental appropriations, including $11.5 billion for the DRF. The House proposed offsetting emergency supplemental appropriations for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, but the Senate did not support the proposal. Despite debates on offsets, the DRF has generally been funded promptly in times of need without offsets. CRS analyzed legislation from FY1990 through FY2013, looking for connections between DRF funding and offsets. The report analyzes legislation from FY1990 through FY2013 to find connections between supplemental DRF funding and offsets. It reveals that Congress fully offset supplemental funding for the DRF through budget cuts only once during that period. The report also examines Congress's actions from 2011 to 2013 regarding offsetting DRF funding, particularly after the BCA came into effect. It concludes by discussing issues related to offsetting disaster assistance and special budgetary designations for disaster relief funding. Congress uses the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to evaluate the costs of legislation and determine if it is \"fully offset\" or partially offset. Offsetting provisions may not be directly linked to specific appropriations but can be identified through analysis of report language or committee documents. For example, in S.Rept. 112-74, the Senate recommended $18.3 million for Coast Guard helicopters and included rescissions totaling $18.3 million to offset the cost. The curr_chunk discusses how rescissions totaling $18.3 million were included to offset the cost of additional appropriations in a bill. It highlights the importance of linking rescissions to specific funding allocations to ensure transparency in budgetary decisions. In the curr_chunk, $500 million is rescinded from unobligated balances, and $1 billion is transferred to the Department of Homeland Security for Disaster Relief. This transfer is designated as an emergency funding. The provision was added as an amendment to provide additional resources to the Disaster Relief Fund by transferring and rescinding funds. Supplemental appropriations, including disaster relief and assistance, are additional budget authority provided by Congress. Disaster relief specifically refers to resources from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, while disaster assistance includes funding from various federal agencies. This report focuses on supplemental disaster funding. The report analyzes supplemental disaster relief funding, with FEMA being a major recipient in the 1990s. Over 24 fiscal years, 59 bills included supplemental appropriations, with some bills offsetting discretionary budget authority. Six bills had spending reductions that fully offset their costs. Since 1990, supplemental disaster relief has only been fully offset once, with spending reductions offsetting the entire discretionary cost of the bill. This occurred shortly after the 1994 midterm elections when the new Republican majority in Congress assembled a large rescissions package to cut previously approved spending for FY1995. The Clinton Administration also submitted a package of rescissions and supplemental spending for FY1995, including $2.2 billion in rescissions and $10.4 billion in additional spending. The Clinton Administration requested $10.4 billion in additional spending, including $6.7 billion for the DRF. Speaker Newt Gingrich asked for offsets, but Alice Rivlin argued that the supplemental request should be treated as an emergency without requiring offsets. The Bush administration and current Administration have used authority to exempt genuine emergencies from statutory caps for disasters like the Northridge earthquake and Midwest floods. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees proposed different spending packages for disaster recovery funding, with the Senate providing $6.7 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in response to various emergencies. Additionally, an extra $142 million was requested for assistance related to the Oklahoma City bombing, leading to a conference agreement that included $16.4 billion in rescissions, $6.7 billion for the DRF, and $251 million for bombing-related needs. The President vetoed a spending agreement due to the makeup of the rescissions package. A new package was approved with $16.3 billion in rescissions, $6.6 billion for the DRF, and $290 million for needs related to the Oklahoma City bombing. Congressional majority aimed to offset the Administration's budget requests, linking disaster assistance with spending reductions and tax legislation. Representative Anthony Beilenson criticized this approach. The House package combined emergency assistance and rescissions, forcing a difficult choice for lawmakers. Chairman Robert Livingston claimed it set a historic precedent, despite a previous emergency supplemental bill being offset. The new congressional majority had announced plans for a rescission package prior to this. In February 1996, Congress faced resolving six appropriations bills after a budgetary standoff. The final conference agreement included $222 million for the DRF but rescinded $1 billion from other parts of the budget. The bills included $222 million for the base budget for the DRF but rescinded $1 billion from contingent disaster relief funding provided earlier. The debate on H.R. 3019 addressed offsets for disaster assistance, with the original House version including offsets. Senate amendments proposing offsets for disaster assistance were withdrawn without a vote. The conference report notes that Senate provisions for disaster assistance offsets were dropped as unnecessary, as the House legislation and conference agreement already included adequate offsets. P.L. 104-134 provided new budget authority for the DRF for FY1996, but the billion-dollar rescission resulted in a net loss of $778 million for the DRF. This legislation used DRF funds for other government elements instead of providing supplemental appropriations. Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, with Congress quickly passing $60 billion in emergency funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Initial cost estimates were uncertain due to ongoing flooding, leading to a slowdown in FEMA spending as recovery efforts progressed. A month later, two-thirds of the allocated funds remained unspent, prompting Congress to reallocate the unused DRF funds to other disaster relief efforts. Congress reallocated unspent DRF funds to other disaster assistance programs, including a $23.4 billion package approved in December 2005. This response to Hurricane Katrina was swift and involved the largest non-war supplemental funding to date, adjusting allocations to meet evolving recovery challenges. The redistribution of DRF resources to disaster assistance in later legislation, such as the $1 billion offset in 2011, drew funding from the Department of Energy instead of the Department of Homeland Security. This offset was debated during consideration of H.R. 2017 and a continuing resolution for government funding. In September 2011, an agreement was reached on a continuing resolution to fund government operations and the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) at $2.65 billion annually. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set discretionary spending caps and provisions for adjusting them for disaster assistance. The bill passed both the House and Senate with broad support, but fell short of majority support in the House due to discussions on spending caps and budget mechanisms. In December 2011, the House passed legislation providing $700 million for the Disaster Relief Fund and an additional $8.1 billion in disaster assistance. The House passed legislation providing $700 million for the Disaster Relief Fund and an additional $8.1 billion in disaster assistance. The Senate only passed the consolidated appropriations act and supplemental, rejecting the offset package for additional disaster assistance. Chairman Harold Rogers stated the purpose of H.Con.Res. 94 was to offset the $8.1 billion in disaster assistance, while Ranking Member Norman Dicks did not object to its provisions. Despite legislative activity, the first session of the 112th Congress ended without offsets being implemented. The first session of the 112th Congress ended without offsets being applied to supplemental appropriations for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) after Hurricane Sandy caused $62 billion in damage. Calls for a supplemental appropriations package for disaster assistance were made, with expectations for disaster assistance to be offset. The Administration requested $60.4 billion in supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Sandy, including $11.5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate ultimately passed the legislation (H.R. 1) on December 28, 2012, by a vote of 62-32, without offsetting the cost. Senator Leahy opposed offsetting the cost of the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, arguing that cutting funding from essential government functions to pay for natural disaster response is absurd. Mandating offsets for emergency spending like Hurricane Sandy relief is impractical and would severely impact essential government functions. Senator Schumer also questioned the need for offsets in the proposed funding. Senator Schumer opposes the idea of mandating offsets for disaster relief funding, arguing that it would delay the much-needed aid and set a harmful precedent. He emphasizes the importance of treating disaster funding separately from other federal programs to ensure timely assistance during emergencies. The $3.4 billion for mitigation projects was no longer designated as emergency funding, impacting discretionary spending limits. This reduced the budget authority for future appropriations in FY2013. Some saw it as a precedent-setting offset for disaster assistance, while others viewed it as including disaster preparedness costs in the discretionary budget. The Senate debated an amendment to reduce the size of the bill for Sandy relief by only paying for the amount obligated in FY2013 and offsetting it with cuts in foreign assistance. Senator Rand Paul argued for spending only 1 year at a time and offsetting with cuts due to Congress's poor handling of money. Senator Rand Paul argues for spending Hurricane Sandy relief funds one year at a time to ensure proper oversight and prevent wasteful spending. He suggests allocating the $9 billion needed for the next year by cutting wasteful spending in other areas, rather than printing more money or raising taxes. Paul emphasizes the need to prioritize infrastructure projects in the US over sending money overseas. Senator Rand Paul argues for spending Hurricane Sandy relief funds by cutting wasteful spending in other areas instead of printing more money or raising taxes. The House introduced a new supplemental appropriation bill at the beginning of the 113th Congress, including $17 billion of the Administration's request. An amendment was filed to further include portions of the request. The House introduced H.R. 152 with funding for immediate needs and longer-term recovery efforts. Amendments were proposed to offset costs, including across-the-board cuts. The House passed the bill without offsets, but an amendment in the Senate aimed to reduce spending by 0.5% over nine years. The Senate passed the bill without offsets, but an amendment to reduce spending by 0.5% over nine years was defeated. The bill was signed into law by the President as P.L. 113-2. Congress may need to reconsider offsetting disaster relief in the future and modifying budgetary flexibility for disaster relief under the BCA provisions. In FY2012 and FY2013, Congress debated extensively on disaster assistance funding, with ongoing concerns about federal spending. Requests for supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance, including for the DRF, were in the range of hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Congress faced political pressure to respond promptly to ensure relief resources are available beyond the immediate term. In response to disaster assistance funding debates, Congress faced pressure to quickly provide relief resources. Identifying offsets for additional funding could delay Congress's response. Common offsets include spending cuts, but it may be challenging to find acceptable cuts during a crisis. Across-the-board cuts could have unintended consequences, potentially affecting recovery programs. Raising additional revenues is another option for covering costs. Offsets could be made through raising additional revenues to cover costs from a disaster, but this carries political implications for some Members of Congress. There are significant obstacles in both the House and Senate to a combined revenue and appropriations bill. House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees handle revenue matters, while House and Senate Appropriations committees oversee discretionary spending. Regular procedures mandate separate consideration of revenue and appropriations legislation. Legislative provisions are barred from general appropriations bills in the House, and revenue provisions must begin in the House according to the Constitution. The House rules require revenue provisions to start in the House, making it difficult for the Senate to use them as offsets in appropriations bills. Offsetting funding for the Disaster Relief Fund would be a departure from Congress's usual practice. The discussion focuses on the budgetary impact of current disaster funding practices and the unpredictability of disasters. Congress is considering whether the current situation justifies a change in the traditional approach. Identifying emerging trends in events that cannot be accurately forecast and determining if they warrant policy change is challenging. Changing disaster assistance policies may impact future disaster victims, but government policies evolve to save money and improve efficiency. Requiring offsets for disaster funding is a departure from Congress's usual practice, prompting a debate on the budgetary impact and unpredictability of disasters. Congress is considering if the current situation justifies a change in approach. Requiring offsets for disaster funding may delay federal relief funds and hinder aid delivery. The Budget Control Act has changed the traditional process of using supplemental appropriations for disaster costs. The urgency of the process may not allow for careful review of programs facing sudden reductions. The Budget Control Act has allowed for adjustments to cover disaster costs under the Stafford Act without competing with the discretionary budget. Only two supplemental appropriations for disaster relief have been enacted since the BCA, providing billions of dollars in assistance. Emergency designations have been used in the past to provide additional funding without violating budget caps. Supplemental disaster assistance has historically been designated as emergency funding to bypass budget caps. The Budget Control Act defines disaster relief as assistance for major disasters under the Stafford Act, allowing for adjustments to discretionary budget caps. This has enabled the use of emergency funding without offsetting costs. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to discretionary budget caps for disaster relief, but does not explicitly restrict emergency funding for major disasters. Initially, there were no enforcement mechanisms to prevent broad application of disaster relief or emergency designations by Congress. Congress used emergency designations to fund disaster relief in excess of allowable adjustments under the Budget Control Act, instead of budgeting for disasters in the regular budget. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rogers emphasized the need to budget for disasters but acknowledged that some disasters may exceed budget offsets, like Hurricane Sandy. This approach results in additional deficit spending in the current budgetary environment. Supplemental appropriations legislation leads to additional deficit spending, potentially causing unplanned reductions in other budget areas. Overuse of emergency funds for non-appropriate spending could result in stricter budget control legislation in the future, limiting flexibility in dire circumstances. The Budget Control Act's constraints will expire in FY2021, prompting Congress to decide on long-term discretionary spending limits or a new budget approach. Congress may consider new approaches to budgeting for major disasters or extend current discretionary spending caps. Table A-1 breaks down appropriations bills from FY1990 to FY2013, showing supplemental spending, rescissions, and funding for the DRF, with notes on offsets and usage of DRF funding for other activities."
