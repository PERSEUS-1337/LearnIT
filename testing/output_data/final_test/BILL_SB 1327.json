    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016, as outlined in Section 6033 of the Penal Code, aims to reduce recidivism among criminal offenders and provide adequate funding for local governments to implement responsible criminal justice policies. The 2011 Realignment Legislation on public safety focuses on justice reinvestment to manage criminal justice populations more cost-effectively. It represents a significant shift of responsibilities with broad county discretion in implementation, offering an opportunity to identify best practices in community corrections and impacts of correctional decentralization. The 2011 Realignment Legislation on public safety did not mandate data collection on outcome measures or provide resources for it. The Bureau of State Audits identified the realignment as high-risk due to a lack of reliable data for monitoring progress towards goals. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation published a document in April 2012 detailing their plan to implement the 2011 Realignment Legislation and save billions of dollars. A report in January 2016 indicated significant budget savings for the department, with the intent to reinvest some or all of these savings in programs. The Legislature aims to reinvest savings from the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation into programs that reduce criminal recidivism, including establishing reporting systems for evidence-based local programming opportunities for offender reintegration. The Criminal Justice Reinvestment Assessment Grant Program of 2016 is established to help offenders reintegrate into society by providing grants to counties for reporting systems and infrastructure. The program is administered by the Board of State and Community Corrections. Each local community corrections partnership must report their capacity to collect and report required data by June 1, 2016. The report should include a plan for additional resources needed to meet data reporting requirements. The Board will review assessments and prioritize grants for programs identified in the local plan. Grant funds must supplement existing programs and not replace them. The board will submit a report to the Legislature by June 15, 2016, detailing the need, cost, and schedule for counties to collect and report criminal justice information. Minimum standards, funding schedules, and grant procedures will be established, with preference given to counties that independently collect data. Each county must report specified data to the board annually, including individual identifiers, county identifiers, date of birth, gender, race, conviction offense, sentence received, jail time served, release status, probation violations, rearrests, reconvictions, return to custody, use of flash incarceration, risk level, participation in pretrial programs, specialty court, day reporting release programs, and electronic monitoring programs. The curr_chunk lists various programs and services available for individuals involved in the criminal justice system, including electronic monitoring, community service, work release, probation supervision, needs assessment, reentry programming, therapy, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, gender-specific programming, family programming, health care assistance, housing assistance, income support, employment assistance, vocational training, educational enrollment assistance, mentoring, and peer support. The board compiles local reports on mentoring and peer support programs provided, submitting a summary report to the Governor and Legislature annually by May 15. Counties must provide data on violations, rearrests, reconvictions, returns to custody, and use of flash incarceration for individuals under supervision. The board compiles reports on various aspects of individuals under supervision, including rearrests, reconvictions, returns to custody, use of flash incarceration, participation in various programs like therapy, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, gender-specific programming, family programming, and assistance provided in healthcare, housing, income support, employment, vocational training, and educational enrollment. The board compiles reports on individuals under supervision, including mentoring, peer support, and educational enrollment assistance provided. A report is submitted to the Governor and Legislature summarizing county data. $____ is appropriated from the General Fund for implementing these programs. The board may award grants to counties to establish data reporting systems for criminal justice information. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be provided to local agencies. This act is an urgency statute for public peace, health, or safety. The 2011 Realignment Legislation addressing public safety requires immediate implementation to collect and report relevant data for stakeholders to measure its effectiveness. Amendment to Penal Code Section 487 defines grand theft based on value thresholds for various types of stolen property. The value of stolen domestic fowls, avocados, olives, citrus, fruits, vegetables, nuts, artichokes, or other farm crops exceeding $250 can be proven with credible evidence. Additionally, theft of fish, shellfish, mollusks, crustaceans, kelp, algae, or other aquacultural products worth over $250 from commercial or research operations is also considered grand theft. Grand theft can occur in various situations, such as when property is taken from the person of another, or when the property taken is an automobile or firearm. It also includes cases where money, labor, or property is taken by a servant, agent, or employee from their employer and amounts to $950 or more in a 12-month period."
