Congress finds the need to enhance homeland security to protect the US from terrorist attacks, including cyber and chemical threats. Key aspects include antiterrorism activities and consequence management by government entities. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive governmentwide strategy for homeland security crisis and consequence management in response to domestic attacks against the United States. The development and implementation of such a strategy will require the cooperation and support of various executive departments and agencies to ensure successful execution, including adequate resourcing and funding for personnel and equipment. The United States lacks a strategic sense of unconventional threats and needs a layered homeland security strategy. The Department of Defense has assets that could enhance homeland security.

REQUIREMENT TO DEVELOP HOMELAND SECURITY STRATEGY. The President is required to develop a comprehensive strategy for homeland security, ensuring coordination between Federal, State, and local government organizations. The strategy must include identifying specific threats, developing antiterrorism activities, and determining the roles of relevant departments and agencies. The comprehensive strategy for homeland security includes coordination between Federal, State, and local government organizations, specifying roles, selective use of Armed Forces personnel, optimization of intelligence assets, augmentation of medical response capability, and development of a multiyear plan. The President will conduct a threat and risk assessment for homeland security to identify specific threats. A multiyear plan and budget will be developed for phased implementation of the strategy. The implementation of the strategy will be carried out according to a multiyear plan and budget developed after a threat and risk assessment for homeland security. The President shall implement the homeland security strategy developed under section 3, designate a responsible official for homeland security, ensure agency heads' participation in strategy implementation, and restructure appropriations accounts as necessary. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will restructure appropriations accounts as needed to implement the changes in the homeland security strategy. The President must submit a report to Congress within 90 days of this Act's enactment, detailing the development process, timeline, funding, and legislative changes for the homeland security strategy. The term \"homeland security\" in this Act refers to protecting the US territory, critical infrastructures, and citizens from various threats using military or other means."
