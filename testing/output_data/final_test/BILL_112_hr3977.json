The \"Domestic Violence Judicial Support Act of 2012\" acknowledges the prevalence of intimate partner violence, with 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men experiencing severe physical violence. The Act highlights the risk of continued victimization during the pretrial period, emphasizing the importance of addressing offenders who violate no-contact orders or intimidate victims. In 2002, 36% of intimate partner violence cases had children present, with 60% directly witnessing the violence. Courts collect information on children to provide necessary services. Domestic violence cases involving intimate partners require careful consideration by the criminal justice system. In the 1990s, specialized domestic violence courts were created to aid victims, hold offenders accountable, and ensure follow-through on cases. These courts aim to process cases efficiently, deliver consistent rulings, focus on rehabilitation and deterrence, and direct victims to community resources. One-third of violent felony defendants in State criminal courts are charged with domestic violence, and teen dating violence cases are best handled by courts. Teen dating violence cases are best handled by courts with training and resources for services like counseling, victim witness services, and assistance with civil orders. Juvenile courts oversee child welfare cases, and judges focused on effective oversight can save foster care costs for states. The Court Appointed Special Advocate program has been shown to save significant foster care costs for states. A 2009 study found that Kentucky saved $85,000,000 in one year through protection orders, reducing violence. Children with a volunteer advocate spend less time in foster care, have improved education performance, and fewer out-of-home placements. This program reduces long-term foster care placements, victimization, and reentry into the system, leading to substantial savings in child welfare costs. SEC. 2. CONSOLIDATION OF GRANTS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND VICTIMS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. Amends Title III of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 to include improvements in court training and supervised visitation. The Attorney General may grant funds to various entities to enhance the justice system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and child sexual abuse cases. Funds can be used for supervised visitation services and developing legislation and policies to improve civil practices. Legislation, policies, and best practices aim to improve court functions in cases involving domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and child sexual abuse. Court personnel and child protective services workers are educated on dynamics of violence, perpetrator behavior, risk factors, and victim needs. The curr_chunk discusses the need for courts to provide resources and services for victims of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking in juvenile court matters. This includes ensuring safety, security, privacy, and confidentiality for victims, as well as developing court infrastructure and community-based initiatives to support victims. The curr_chunk outlines the need for courts to offer various services for victims of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, including offender management programs, information-sharing databases, community outreach programs, and civil legal assistance. The curr_chunk focuses on providing assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, as well as nonoffending parents in cases involving child sexual abuse and family matters. It also includes collecting data, offering training, and developing model codes to improve the capacity of grantees and communities to address the needs of these victims. The curr_chunk focuses on providing assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking with legal representation or pro se, improving training for justice system personnel, and considering factors like serving underserved populations when making grants. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of collaboration with nonprofit organizations and local court systems when applying for grants to assist victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The Attorney General considers applicant experience in providing training related to family violence, child custody, abuse, adoption, and more. Grant applicants must demonstrate expertise in domestic violence and ensure fees for supervised visitation are income-based. The Attorney General requires grant applicants to certify that victims of domestic violence are not charged fees for court-based programs and demonstrate adequate security measures to prevent violence. The applicant for program funding must certify organizational policies do not require mediation or counseling with offenders and victims present in cases of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Legal assistance providers must undergo training on related issues, and custody evaluators must also be certified. Training on domestic violence and sexual assault dynamics, including child sexual abuse, is required for those providing evaluation or guardian ad litem services funded under this section. The training includes reviewing evidence of past abuse and using evidence-based theories to make custody and visitation recommendations. Authorization of $22,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017 is provided for this program. SEC. 3. COURT-APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE PROGRAM. Subtitle B of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 is amended to update certain sections and reporting requirements for grantees receiving funds for child welfare programs. Subtitle B of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 is amended to update sections and reporting requirements for grantees receiving funds for child welfare programs, including adjustments to fiscal years for funding allocation. SEC. 4. Reauthorization of Child Abuse Training Programs for Judicial Personnel and Practitioners authorizes $2,300,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017 under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990."
