    "content": "The \"Energy Productivity Innovation Challenge Act of 2015\" or the \"EPIC Act of 2015\" aims to promote energy policy innovation in the States to double electric and thermal energy productivity by January 1, 2030. The \"Energy Productivity Innovation Challenge Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as energy productivity, Indian tribe, and State. It aims to double electric and thermal energy productivity by 2030. The Energy Productivity Innovation Challenge Act of 2015 requires States to submit plans for an electric and thermal energy productivity challenge within 30 days of enactment. Grants of $500,000 to $1,750,000 will be provided to up to 25 States. States must submit applications within 90 days of the invitation to receive a grant. The Secretary will base grant decisions on State energy conservation plans focusing on energy productivity improvements and other relevant factors, ranking plans by their potential contribution to energy productivity in the State. Grants will be provided accordingly. The plan submitted under subsection (c) must describe how energy savings will be monitored, establish a baseline for energy use, promote energy savings goals, and leverage investments in energy efficiency with Federal funding. The plan must ensure efficiency with Federal funding, avoid cost-shifting among utility customer classes, and not negatively impact low-income populations. It should also involve cooperation between the State energy office, energy utilities, and public service commission, as well as collaboration with local governments, Indian tribes, and energy utilities to expand programs. Grants provided should supplement, not supplant, existing funding sources. A State may use grants provided under this section to promote the expansion of policies and programs that advance industrial energy efficiency, waste heat recovery, combined heat and power, waste heat-to-power utilization, energy efficiency construction, and retrofits for public and private commercial buildings. This includes schools, hospitals, and residential buildings, through various energy-saving methods such as energy service contracts and improved building energy efficiency codes. The curr_chunk discusses the expansion of residential policies and programs to implement best practices for energy efficiency projects, streamline contractor engagement, and encourage private investment. It also mentions incentives in the electric utility sector to enhance demand response and energy efficiency. The Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 promotes cost-effective policies for energy efficiency, including rate structures, grid improvements, behavior change, combined heat and power incentives, financing programs, data use incentives, district heating, and energy audits. States are encouraged to lead by example in energy efficiency efforts, with potential expansion through Federal grants. Phase 2 involves the subsequent allocation of grants to states. States that received grants under section 4 must submit a report on program performance and how additional funds would be used. The Secretary will then provide grants to up to 6 states for carrying out programs and activities. The Secretary will provide grants to up to 6 States, with each grant not exceeding $15,000,000. The decision will be based on state performance, program potential, diversity in project portfolio, and non-Federal fund availability. The grants will be awarded to up to 6 States, with each grant not exceeding $15,000,000. States must demonstrate diverse involvement, leverage non-Federal funds effectively, have plans for project continuation, and involve various groups such as utilities, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. SEC. 6. ALLOCATION OF GRANTS TO INDIAN TRIBES. The Secretary will invite Indian tribes to submit plans for an energy productivity challenge within 30 days of the Act's enactment. To receive a grant, tribes must submit a plan to increase energy productivity within 90 days. The Secretary will decide on grant allocations within 90 days based on the submitted plans. The Secretary will consider plans for improving energy productivity, ensuring continuation of improvements, and other relevant factors like geographic diversity and tribe size differences. Each Indian tribe is limited to receiving no more than 20 percent of the total available funds for this section. The administration of the funds for improving energy productivity among Indian tribes is limited to no more than 20 percent of the total available funds. The Secretary will consult with the National Research Council to evaluate program performance and effectiveness under the Act. Grants to States will supplement State energy conservation programs without replacing funds provided under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Minimum funding of $50,000,000 under the base formula of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is required for a State to receive a grant under this Act. State participation in challenges established by this Act is voluntary. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Funds allocated as follows: 30% for initial grants to States, 61% for subsequent grants to States, 4% for grants to Indian tribes, and 5% for administration costs. Offset provision is included. SEC. 9. OFFSET. Amends Section 422(f) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to allocate specific amounts for fiscal years 2013 through 2018."
