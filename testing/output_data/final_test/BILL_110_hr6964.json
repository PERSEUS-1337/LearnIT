    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2008\". Congress finds that before acting on proposed Federal mandates, careful consideration should be given to their effects on consumers, workers, and small businesses. Congress has often lacked adequate information on the costs of Federal mandates, focusing only on benefits. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 has increased awareness of intergovernmental mandates without impacting existing environmental, public health, or safety laws. The implementation of this Act will enhance public awareness of prospective Federal mandates on various sectors without adversely affecting existing laws and regulations. The costs of private sector mandates are often borne by consumers through higher prices and reduced availability of goods and services, by workers through lower wages, reduced benefits, and fewer job opportunities, and by small businesses through hiring disincentives and stunted economic growth. The purpose of this Act is to improve Congress' deliberation on private sector mandates by providing more information and ensuring focused deliberation. It also aims to help distinguish between harmful and beneficial Federal mandates. The reporting requirements of the Act also apply to policies involving changes in conditions of grant aid. Section 423(c) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include an assessment of the authorized level of funding to determine the prospective costs of changes to conditions of Federal assistance imposed on State, local, or tribal governments. The assessment should compare these costs with the funds being authorized and provide estimates for bills or resolutions that provide necessary sums. SEC. 5. Expanding legislative reporting requirements to include indirect costs. Expanding legislative reporting requirements to include identification and description of any reasonably foreseeable indirect costs to State, local, or tribal governments, or by the private sector, incurred as a result of implementing the Federal mandate in the bill or joint resolution. The term 'reasonably foreseeable indirect costs' refers to costs incurred by affected entities from implementing a Federal mandate, excluding their direct costs. These costs encompass lost income and secondary monetary expenses resulting from the mandate. SEC. 6 amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to include indirect costs in regulatory reporting requirements. SEC. 7 expands reporting requirements to include regulations from independent regulatory agencies. SEC. 8 clarifies that reporting requirements apply to all regulatory actions. SEC. 9 closes loopholes allowing regulatory agencies to disregard reporting requirements. Section 202(a) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 is amended to include Federal mandates that may result in costs to governments or the private sector before promulgating any rule. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 is amended to include a Federal mandate that may result in costs to governments or the private sector, requiring a written statement to be prepared by the agency."
