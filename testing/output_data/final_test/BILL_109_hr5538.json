    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Act of 2006\" and includes a Near-Term Vehicle Technology Program. In this section, definitions include \"battery\" as a device for energy storage, \"biomass\" as defined in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, \"E85\" as a fuel blend with 85% ethanol, and \"electric drive transportation technology\" encompassing various vehicles using electric motors. The curr_chunk discusses definitions related to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, flexible fuel plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. It includes details about the capabilities and components of these vehicles. The curr_chunk defines different types of electric vehicles, including fuel cell vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A hybrid electric vehicle can operate on liquid fuel or electric power and uses regenerative braking technology. A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle can run solely on electric power for at least 20 miles and recharge its battery from an external electricity source. The Secretary of Energy conducts a program on technologies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including high capacity batteries, efficient charging components, and power drive train systems for vehicles. The Secretary of Energy conducts a program on technologies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including high capacity batteries, efficient charging components, power drive train systems, onboard energy management systems, lightweight materials, and a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program with competitive grant pilot demonstration program. The Secretary of Energy conducts a program on technologies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including high capacity batteries, efficient charging components, power drive train systems, onboard energy management systems, lightweight materials, and a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program with competitive grant pilot demonstration program. The program allows governments, transportation authorities, or combinations thereof to carry out projects demonstrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Applications for grants must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary, including data collection on vehicle performance and components under various driving conditions.

The program allows governments, transportation authorities, or combinations thereof to carry out projects demonstrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Applications for grants must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary, including data collection on vehicle performance and components under various driving conditions. The data collected includes speeds, trip ranges, traffic, costs of the vehicle, emissions, and how the project will be self-sustaining after Federal assistance is completed. This information is summarized for dissemination to the Department, other grantees, and the public. The Secretary of Energy conducts a program on technologies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Demonstration Program with a competitive grant pilot demonstration program. Applicants may partner with private entities for projects, and selection criteria include preference for proposals demonstrating the greatest electric power range under city driving conditions. The Secretary of Energy's program on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles includes a competitive grant pilot demonstration program. Selection criteria prioritize proposals with the greatest electric power range under city driving conditions and a commitment to project sustainability. Grants will demonstrate plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in various driving circumstances. The Secretary of Energy's program on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles includes a competitive grant pilot demonstration program. Selection criteria prioritize proposals with the greatest electric power range under city driving conditions and a commitment to project sustainability. Grants will demonstrate plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in various driving circumstances, considering trip ranges, driving and climate conditions, and topography to optimize understanding and function. Pilot project requirements include a limit of $10,000,000 in Federal assistance to any applicant for the period encompassing fiscal years 2007 through fiscal year 2011. The Secretary will establish mechanisms to ensure information and knowledge sharing. The Secretary will determine grant amounts based on the declining cost of producing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The program will be carried out in compliance with specific sections of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Authorization of appropriations is provided to the Secretary for the program. The Secretary is authorized appropriations for carrying out specific subsections of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, with $250,000,000 allocated for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 for subsection (b) and $50,000,000 for subsection (c) during the same period. Up to $50,000,000 may be used for a specific program under subsection (b)."
