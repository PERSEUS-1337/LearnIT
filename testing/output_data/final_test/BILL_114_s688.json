    "content": "The Act titled \"Establishing Beneficiary Equity in the Hospital Readmission Program Act of 2015\" aims to establish beneficiary equity in the Medicare Hospital Readmission Program. The Act \"Establishing Beneficiary Equity in the Hospital Readmission Program Act of 2015\" introduces a transitional adjustment for dual eligible population and socioeconomic status in determining hospitals' excess readmission ratio for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Secretary will provide risk adjustment to prevent unfair penalization of vulnerable populations in the program. Adjustment will consider a hospital's proportion of full-benefit dual eligible inpatients and the socioeconomic status of patients served. The Secretary will use a quantitative method to apply this adjustment. The Secretary will utilize recent Census data to develop a quantitative method for adjusting for socioeconomic status, focusing on income, education level, and poverty rate. Other socioeconomic factors may also be considered in this method. The Secretary will measure the socioeconomic status of patients served by each hospital, using patient-level data and supplementing it with geographic region data when necessary. The Secretary will measure the socioeconomic status of patients served by each hospital without imposing additional reporting requirements. Risk adjustments under the readmission program will be based on IMPACT and MedPAC reports. The Secretary will base risk adjustment on reports from various sources, including the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will incorporate these recommendations for risk adjustment in the readmission program. The Secretary may use alternative adjustment mechanisms in the readmission program to account for socioeconomic factors for hospitals treating vulnerable populations. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission will conduct a study on the appropriateness of using a 30-day readmission threshold under the Social Security Act. Additionally, regulations may consider excluding noncompliant patient cases based on appropriate codes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study to recommend excluding patients with clinical conditions requiring frequent hospitalizations from excess readmissions calculations under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will convene a technical expert panel to provide input on a study considering exclusions for patients with certain clinical conditions from excess readmissions calculations under the Social Security Act. The Secretary will exclude certain clinical conditions from excess readmissions calculations under the Social Security Act starting in fiscal year 2018. The final report on the study must include recommendations based on public comments and be submitted to Congress by October 1, 2016. Starting in fiscal year 2018, the Secretary will exclude relevant clinical conditions from hospitals' readmission rates and excess readmissions ratios under the Social Security Act. The Secretary is also encouraged to apply these exclusions to other Medicare public reporting and pay-for-performance programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will make necessary payment adjustments to ensure budget-neutral implementation of this section. The implementation of this section should not increase expenditures under section 1886."
