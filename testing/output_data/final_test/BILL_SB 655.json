    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1941.7 of the Civil Code states that a landlord is not obligated to repair mold-related dilapidations until they have notice of the issue or if the tenant is in violation of certain sections. The landlord can enter the dwelling unit to make repairs as long as they comply with Section 1954. Section 17920 of the Health and Safety Code defines terms related to building standards. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to building standards and enforcement, including the definition of \"building standard,\" \"department,\" \"enforcement,\" and \"fire protection district.\" It outlines the Department of Housing and Community Development's role in enforcing compliance and the responsibilities of fire protection districts. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to building standards and enforcement, including \"labeled,\" \"listed,\" and \"listing agency\" for products, materials, equipment, and installations. These terms are crucial for indicating compliance with appropriate standards and performance. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to building standards and enforcement, such as \"mold,\" \"noise insulation,\" \"nuisance,\" \"public entity,\" and \"testing agency.\" These definitions are important for understanding regulations and compliance in building construction. Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to declare conditions that make a building substandard, including inadequate sanitation like lack of proper plumbing fixtures and heating. The building may be deemed substandard due to lack of heating, proper ventilation, natural light, adequate room dimensions, required electrical lighting, dampness, and infestation of insects or rodents. Structural hazards that may deem a building substandard include visible mold growth, general dilapidation, lack of connection to sewage disposal system, and inadequate garbage and rubbish storage facilities. This can also include deteriorated foundations and defective flooring. Defective or deteriorated flooring, insufficient size of floor supports, walls, partitions, or vertical supports splitting or leaning, ceilings or roofs sagging or buckling, fireplaces or chimneys listing or settling, and any other structural hazards are considered substandard conditions in a building. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for maintaining various systems in a building, including wiring, plumbing, and mechanical equipment, to ensure they are in good and safe condition. The curr_chunk specifies faulty weather protection requirements, including deteriorated plaster, ineffective waterproofing, lack of paint on exterior walls, and broken exterior coverings. It also mentions any items or vegetation that could pose a fire hazard according to the fire department chief. The curr_chunk outlines prohibited materials and conditions on premises that pose fire, health, or safety hazards, as well as criteria for determining unsafe buildings due to inadequate maintenance. Buildings must have adequate exit facilities as required by the code, additional exits may be required if an unsafe condition exists due to lack of proper exits. Substandard buildings lack required fire-resistive construction or fire-extinguishing systems, are not designed for living purposes, or have inadequate structural resistance to horizontal forces. A building is considered substandard if it does not comply with Section 13143.2. Displacement of sound walls or ceilings to meet certain requirements does not automatically classify a building as substandard unless it was built in violation of those requirements. The text chunk discusses the lack of reimbursement required by a new act in California due to potential costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
