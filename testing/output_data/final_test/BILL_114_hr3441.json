    "content": "The \"Accurate Education for Prenatal Screenings Act\" is cited as the Act. It amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a section on Cell-Free DNA Prenatal Screening Education Programs. The \"Accurate Education for Prenatal Screenings Act\" mandates the development of education programs by the Secretary of Health to inform patients and healthcare providers about cell-free DNA prenatal screening, including its purposes, conditions detected, risks, and benefits. The Act requires education programs on prenatal screenings, including methods, possible results, accuracy, need for diagnostic testing, and communication of results. The Act mandates education programs on prenatal screenings, providing materials with peer-reviewed, balanced, and up-to-date information. These materials aim to help patients understand their options, promote informed consent, and address the diversity of the patient population. Communication of screening results to patients and appropriate follow-up are also emphasized. The Secretary, through the CDC Director, consults various organizations and assesses existing education activities for prenatal screenings. The Secretary must submit an annual progress report to Congress on the development and implementation of education programs for prenatal screenings, their accessibility and adoption by the target audience, and efforts to ensure healthcare providers and patients receive the necessary materials. The Secretary must develop and implement education programs for prenatal screenings within one year of the enactment of the Act."
