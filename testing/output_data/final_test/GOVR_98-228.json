    "content": "In the House, there are four forms of votes: voice vote, division vote, yea and nay (or roll call) vote, and recorded vote. Members may vote in the House, while Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner may vote in the Committee of the Whole. The Speaker counts division votes and determines support for yea and nay votes and recorded votes. Postponed votes occur within two legislative days. Most questions are initially put to a voice vote, where Representatives call out \"aye\" or \"no.\" The Speaker then asks for those in favor to say 'Aye' and those opposed to say 'No.' In the House, there are four forms of votes: voice vote, division vote, yea and nay vote, and recorded vote. The Speaker determines support for yea and nay votes and recorded votes. Division votes are rare, and only vote totals are announced. Yay and nay votes provide a record of how each Member voted, usually taken electronically. If the system malfunctions, standby procedures are used. The procedures for conducting yea and nay votes in the House are outlined in Rule XX, clause 2(b) and the Constitution (Article I, Section 5). Any Member can demand a yea and nay vote if supported by one-fifth of those present, even if a quorum is not met. Rule XX, clause 6 allows for a yea and nay vote if a lawmaker objects to a voice vote due to lack of quorum. The procedures for conducting yea and nay votes in the House are outlined in Rule XX, clause 2(b) and the Constitution. Any Member can demand a yea and nay vote if supported by one-fifth of those present. Recorded votes are taken by electronic device if requested by a Member and supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum. In the House, recorded votes can be requested by a Member with support from at least one-fifth of a quorum. Three voting methods are available in the Committee of the Whole: voice, division, and recorded. Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner have the right to vote. If the question is decided within the margin of votes cast by Delegates and the Resident Commissioner, the committee shall rise, and the Speaker shall put the question de novo to the House. In the House, a recorded vote can be requested by a Member with support from at least 25 Members, Delegates, and the Resident Commissioner. The Chair will order the vote if the request is supported, and a quorum call may be made if necessary. Under House Rule XX, clause 8, the Speaker can postpone and cluster certain votes, with most postponed votes occurring within two legislative days. A vote to agree to the Speaker's approval of the Journal must occur within the same legislative day. The minimum time for a recorded vote by electronic device is 15 minutes, with the chair having the discretion to hold the vote open longer. The accuracy of vote counts for yea and nay votes, recorded votes, division votes, and quorum presence is assumed and cannot be challenged. The Speaker may reduce voting time to not less than five minutes on certain questions following electronic votes or Committee of the Whole reports. Some votes in the Committee of the Whole may be reduced to not less than two minutes."
