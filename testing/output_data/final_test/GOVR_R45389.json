    "content": "Student loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid after meeting specific criteria, such as working in certain fields for a set period. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, a federal initiative, allows borrowers of Direct Loans to have their remaining balance forgiven after 10 years of full-time employment in public service and 120 qualifying monthly payments. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program allows borrowers to have their remaining balance forgiven after 10 years of full-time employment in public service and 120 qualifying monthly payments. Borrowers first became eligible for PSLF forgiveness benefits on October 1, 2017. Issues related to program implementation and interactions with other programs have been raised, including defining public service jobs, certifying qualified employment, determining qualifying payments, and administering complex eligibility criteria. The PSLF program interacts with other programs and benefits, impacting borrowers' choices and maximizing benefits. This includes understanding loan repayment plans, interactions with other service benefits, borrowing student loans, and tax treatment. From the government's perspective, it involves achieving desired targeting of benefits and managing potential costs. Changes to benefits, like expanding loan repayment plans, can affect targeting and program costs. Broad program-related issues focus on how PSLF fits into federal student aid programs. The report provides a legislative and regulatory history of the PSLF program, describes how it works, and discusses various program issues that have received recent attention. The PSLF program was authorized in 2007 under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. H.R. 1306 proposed a program for loan forgiveness for individuals in public service facing student loan debt constraints, aiming to address staffing shortages in professions like teaching and nursing. Various iterations of this program have been introduced in Congress over the years to encourage public service employment. Some proposals aim to address staffing shortages in public service professions by offering loan forgiveness to individuals with student loan debt. Eligibility for forgiveness may be based on employer type or job function, with options for full loan balance forgiveness or percentage forgiveness based on years of public service employment. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program was authorized by Congress in 2007 to encourage individuals to work in public service and alleviate financial burdens associated with federal student loans. Borrowers employed in certain public service jobs for 10 years while making 120 qualifying payments are eligible for loan forgiveness. The CCRAA authorized the PSLF program in 2007 for individuals working in public service jobs for 10 years with 120 qualifying payments. It specified that payments under the ICR or IBR plans would qualify, and only Direct Loan borrowers are eligible. The CCRAA also introduced the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014, borrowers, in addition to the existing ICR plan. The CCRAA introduced the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014, borrowers, where payments are capped at 15% of annual discretionary income. Borrowers make payments for 25 years, and any remaining balance is forgiven. Payments under both the ICR and IBR plans qualify for PSLF. The PSLF program, coupled with the IBR plan, offers loan forgiveness after 10 years of public service and reduced monthly payments. Supporters believe it incentivizes professions with shortages and helps alleviate the burden of increasing tuition. Opponents argue the benefits are not well-targeted. The PSLF program may not make sufficient distinctions among types of borrowers, potentially benefiting higher-income students more. Changes to federal student loan programs before and after PSLF enactment could impact the program. The Reduction Act of 2005 authorized Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students without borrowing limits, potentially leading to significant loan forgiveness benefits under the PSLF program. The availability of PLUS Loans for these students was relatively new at the time of PSLF enactment, and the impact on the program was not fully assessed due to limited data availability. Additionally, the SAFRA Act terminated the authority to make new loans under the program. The SAFRA Act (P.L. 111-152, Title II) ended new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010, making the Direct Loan program the primary federal student loan program. This change increased the number of borrowers eligible for PSLF benefits. New IDR plans like Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and Revised Pay As You Earn offer more benefits to borrowers than previous plans. The introduction of new repayment plans has expanded eligibility for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, allowing more borrowers to qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) benefits. This could result in borrowers repaying less of their loans and receiving larger forgiveness benefits. The PSLF program, authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965, encourages individuals to work in public service for 10 years to have their remaining loan balance forgiven. Eligible jobs include government, 501(c)(3) organizations, and private nonprofits providing specific public services. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program requires borrowers to make 120 qualifying monthly payments on their Direct Loans while working in public service for 10 years. Qualifying repayment plans include income-driven plans and standard plans with a 10-year repayment period. Payments made under these plans often qualify for PSLF. To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), borrowers must make 120 qualifying monthly payments on their Direct Loans while working in public service. Payments made under income-driven plans are more likely to qualify for PSLF benefits compared to standard plans with a 10-year repayment period. All 120 monthly payments must be on-time, for the full scheduled amount, and not made during deferment or forbearance periods. Borrowers must be employed in public service at the time of forgiveness application and not be in default on the loans. To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), borrowers must make 120 qualifying monthly payments on their Direct Loans while working in public service. Loan amounts forgiven under the program are not subject to federal income tax. Borrowers must apply for forgiveness from ED via FedLoan Servicing using an ED-developed form. FedLoan Servicing reviews the application and determines eligibility for forgiveness benefits. FedLoan Servicing reviews PSLF applications and forwards them to ED for final approval. If approved, ED directs FedLoan Servicing to forgive remaining loan balance. Borrowers can dispute denials and reapply. Eligibility began on October 1, 2017. Borrowers can track progress by submitting Employment Certification Forms to their loan servicer. FedLoan Servicing evaluates forms for qualifying Direct Loans. The borrower's qualifying Direct Loans are evaluated for PSLF eligibility, with ED-held loans transferred to FedLoan Servicing for servicing. FedLoan Servicing determines qualifying payments made in public service, and borrowers can dispute eligibility aspects. Congressional interest has been sparked by issues in the PSLF program since October 1, 2017. Implementation issues in the PSLF program include defining public service employment, determining qualifying payments, effects of loan consolidation, and administrative challenges faced by ED, borrowers, and loan servicers. The program's statutory requirements have been operationalized, but difficulties persist in borrower participation and program administration. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program requires individuals to be employed in a public service job for 10 years to be eligible for benefits. Qualifying jobs include government, military service, law enforcement, public education, public health, public interest law services, and jobs in 501(c)(3) organizations. Regulatory decisions have defined qualifying employment based on employer characteristics, leading to difficulties in identifying eligible employers and perceived inequities among borrowers. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program requires individuals to be employed in public service jobs for 10 years to be eligible for benefits. Qualifying jobs include government, military service, law enforcement, public education, public health, public interest law services, and employment in 501(c)(3) organizations. The program's regulations focus on the type of employer rather than the nature of the work performed by the individual. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program defines \"employed\" as being hired and paid by a public service organization. Individuals hired by non-qualifying employers under contract with public service organizations are ineligible for PSLF benefits. 501(c)(3) organizations must not engage in religious activities to qualify for PSLF. 501(c)(3) organizations are nonprofit entities that must not engage in religious activities to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. These organizations are limited in their ability to lobby and are prohibited from engaging in political campaign activity. They include hospitals, schools, charities like the American Red Cross, and foundations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Private organizations that are not tax-exempt under IRC Section 501(c)(3) may still qualify as employers for the PSLF program if they meet certain criteria. These organizations must not be organized for profit, a labor union, a partisan political organization, or engaged in religious activities unless the work is unrelated to religious activities. They must also provide public services to be considered qualifying employers. The regulations for the PSLF program require nonprofit organizations, including those not classified as 501(c)(3), to offer enumerated public services as their primary purpose. Criticisms have been raised about the broad range of occupations and pay levels that qualify for PSLF, leading to concerns about inequities among borrowers and the effectiveness of using employer type as a proxy for public service providers. The PSLF program aims to encourage individuals to work in public service by offering forgiveness benefits. There are concerns about using employer type as the sole determinant of eligibility, suggesting a need to consider job functions instead. This could lead to challenges in identifying qualifying job types and may create uncertainty for borrowers. The PSLF program aims to encourage public service employment by offering forgiveness benefits. Criticisms have been raised regarding the program's eligibility criteria based on employer types, as it may not accurately target individuals with student loan debt. Distinctions among employer types may be relevant due to potential differences in pay levels between public service and private sector positions. The PSLF program aims to encourage public service employment by offering forgiveness benefits. Policies to define qualifying employment more narrowly may have tradeoffs between targeting specific services and providing a broader public service category. Determining eligibility based on employer characteristics rather than services rendered may lead to disparities in program access. Some have questioned ED's interpretation of qualifying public service jobs, where eligibility is based on employer characteristics rather than services rendered. For example, a full-time Department of Defense (DOD) employee may qualify for PSLF, but a contractor performing the same tasks may not if the hiring entity is not a qualifying public service organization. State laws also play a role in determining eligibility. Some state laws may prevent certain workers from being directly employed by organizations that qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). For example, physicians in some states may need to form physician corporations to provide services within a nonprofit hospital setting, making them ineligible for PSLF based on their employment status. Employment with governments and most nonprofit organizations qualifies for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), while for-profit organizations and certain nonprofits do not qualify. The determination of public service is based on the employer's status, not the individual's job functions. This raises questions about whether distinctions should be made between individuals performing similar tasks but working for different types of organizations. There are important differences in the nature of individuals' employment in public service jobs, such as the employer's mission and salary structures. Concerns may arise if an employer's mission does not align entirely with public service goals, potentially overshadowing public interest aspects of operations. Additionally, distinctions may be relevant for contract employees working on multiple projects. Concerns have been raised about the qualification of contract employees working on multiple projects for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) benefits. There is debate over whether all 501(c)(3) organizations should automatically qualify for PSLF, as some may not meet the criteria of exclusively benefiting charitable and educational activities. Some 501(c)(3) organizations may not meet the criteria for tax-exempt status, such as hospitals and private nonprofit IHEs engaging in non-educational activities. Questions have been raised about whether all 501(c)(3) organizations automatically qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) due to concerns about their charitable and educational activities. Some 501(c)(3) organizations may not automatically qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) due to concerns about their activities. Administering the PSLF program efficiently by granting blanket qualification to all 501(c)(3) organizations may not accurately reflect public service. Clarification is needed on which non-501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations may qualify for PSLF based on providing enumerated public services. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program may encompass a variety of employers, including non-501(c)(3) organizations, but the determination of qualifying PSLF employers is case-by-case. The lack of clarity on whether certain organizations meet the primary purpose requirement for PSLF eligibility creates uncertainty for borrowers and may hinder the program's goal of encouraging public service employment. Some organizations see PSLF eligibility as a recruitment tool, but without a guarantee of qualification, they may struggle to attract employees. To address inequities in PSLF eligibility based on employer type, considering eligibility based on job function rather than organizational affiliation could provide more certainty to borrowers. This approach would avoid the need to identify specific job types that qualify under the HEA definition of public service, which could be inefficient and less certain for borrowers. Borrowers must make qualifying payments on or after October 1, 2007 to be eligible for PSLF. To qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), borrowers must make 120 qualifying monthly payments on their Direct Loans while working full-time in public service. Qualifying payments must be on-time, full, scheduled, and made under a qualifying repayment plan. Enrolling in an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan may maximize PSLF benefits, but borrowers may struggle to choose the best plan. Meeting requirements for on-time payments and specific payment amounts without understanding loan servicing practices can be challenging. Qualifying payments include those made under IDR plans and the Standard 10-year repayment plan. Table 1 provides information on repayment plans available to Direct Loan borrowers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Payments made under certain plans, including IDR plans, may qualify for PSLF if they meet criteria for on-time, full, scheduled, and separate payments. Repaying loans under IDR plans is generally recommended to maximize forgiveness benefits under PSLF. Repaying Direct Loans under IDR plans can be beneficial for borrowers, with lower monthly payments compared to a Standard 10-year plan. This can result in lower total payments over 10 years, leaving more outstanding loan principal and interest at the time of PSLF forgiveness. Other repayment plans may also qualify for PSLF, but may not offer as much value in terms of forgiveness benefits. Recent attention has been given to the difficulties borrowers face when selecting a repayment plan for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Payments under Standard 10-year plans qualify for PSLF, but making payments for the entire 10 years may result in no forgiveness benefits due to no remaining loan balance. The Higher Education Act specifies that qualifying PSLF payments can be made under standard, graduated, or extended repayment plans, as long as they are equal to or greater than the monthly amount due on a Standard 10-year repayment plan. Payments made under these plans may qualify for PSLF depending on the borrower's circumstances, such as with the Standard repayment plan for Consolidation Loans, where fixed monthly payments are made for 10-30 years based on the total outstanding student loan debt. Under the graduated repayment plan, monthly payments start small and increase over time, with the repayment period not exceeding 10 years. Payments made with a repayment period greater than 10 years generally do not qualify for PSLF, except in limited circumstances. Under the Graduated Repayment Plan for Consolidation Loans, borrowers may make increasing payments over a period of 10 to 30 years, potentially qualifying for PSLF. Extended Repayment Plan allows new borrowers with over $30,000 in Direct Loan debt to make fixed monthly payments over a maximum of 25 years. Under the Extended Graduated Repayment Plan, new borrowers with over $30,000 in Direct Loan debt can make graduated monthly payments over a maximum of 25 years. Payments may increase over time, potentially exceeding those of the Standard 10-year repayment plan and qualifying for PSLF. Borrowers may face challenges in choosing the right repayment plan. Some borrowers may struggle to choose the best repayment plan for maximizing PSLF benefits. Making 120 on-time monthly payments under the extended graduated plan may not qualify for PSLF if payments are less than the Standard 10-year plan amount. This misunderstanding can lead to delays in eligibility for forgiveness benefits. Issues may arise due to borrowers' misunderstandings of program requirements and administrative complexities. Recent legislation has addressed nonqualifying payment issues. Loan payments must be the full required monthly amount to qualify for PSLF. If an individual with multiple loans makes a payment less than the total amount due, it will be applied proportionally to each loan unless requested otherwise. For example, if someone with eight loans makes a $300 payment on $400 total due, $37.50 would be applied to each loan. If a borrower with multiple loans makes a payment less than the total amount due, it will be applied proportionally to each loan unless requested otherwise. For example, a $300 payment on $400 total due would allocate $37.50 to each of the eight loans. The remaining amount after addressing any past due amounts would be considered PSLF qualifying if it covers the full scheduled monthly amount. When a borrower with multiple loans makes a payment less than the total amount due, it will be applied proportionally to each loan unless specified otherwise. For example, a $300 payment on $400 total due would allocate $37.50 to each of the eight loans. The remaining amount after addressing any past due amounts would be considered PSLF qualifying if it covers the full scheduled monthly amount. Payments must be scheduled to be considered qualifying for PSLF, and the timing of loan forgiveness eligibility may vary. Loan payments must be scheduled to qualify for PSLF. Payments made during deferment, grace status, or forbearance are not considered qualifying. Direct Loans enter repayment after the grace period, and PLUS Loans enter repayment upon full disbursement. Borrowers can decline in-school deferment. When enrolled in an eligible program on a half-time basis, individuals can decline in-school deferment for loans in repayment to continue making qualifying payments while employed in public service. However, if new Direct Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loans are borrowed for school, in-school deferment cannot be declined, preventing PSLF qualifying payments. PLUS Loans enter repayment upon full disbursement, allowing borrowers to decline in-school deferment and make PSLF qualifying payments while in school. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program requires separate monthly payments to qualify. Making larger payments does not expedite forgiveness. Exceptions allow lump sum payments from specific sources to count as up to 12 required monthly payments. A lump sum payment can be divided by the required monthly payment amount under a qualifying repayment plan or 12 monthly payments. Any excess amount paid may cover future monthly payments, advancing the next payment due date. Being \"paid ahead\" may result in only one qualifying PSLF payment, even if it equals multiple months' worth of payments. Subsequent payments during a paid ahead status will not qualify for PSLF unless the borrower requests otherwise. Loan consolidation may affect a borrower's eligibility for PSLF benefits. Only Direct Loan borrowers qualify for PSLF, but borrowers with other federal student loans can consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan to pursue PSLF benefits. Borrowers making advanced payments may not realize they do not qualify for PSLF, impacting their progress towards loan forgiveness. When borrowers consolidate loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan for PSLF benefits, previous qualifying payments may not count towards the required 120 payments. Additionally, unique benefits associated with the original loans, such as loan cancellation for Perkins Loan borrowers, may no longer be available after consolidation. When borrowers consolidate their Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan for PSLF benefits, they may lose out on loan cancellation benefits. Some borrowers were unaware of this impact and would have made different choices if they had known. The administration of the PSLF program poses challenges for ED, loan servicers, and borrowers due to the multiple requirements for qualifying employment and payments. Communication issues between loan servicers and borrowers regarding PSLF eligibility requirements and processes, along with imperfect information on both sides, contribute to difficulties in program administration. The program's complexity, lack of automation, coordination issues among servicers, and fragmented guidance from ED may lead to mistakes and inconsistencies that affect borrower eligibility for benefits. Loan servicers are responsible for various PSLF-related activities, including borrower communication. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program is administered by a single loan servicer, FedLoan Servicing, who handles tasks such as determining eligibility, processing forgiveness applications, and communicating with borrowers. Borrowers must actively seek forgiveness benefits and have knowledge of the program's availability to successfully utilize PSLF. Imperfect information on eligibility requirements can also impact borrower participation in the program. Imperfect information on program eligibility requirements can hinder borrower progress towards loan forgiveness in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Communication issues have been reported, including a lack of awareness among some borrowers about the program. The Department of Education (ED) has not notified all borrowers in repayment about PSLF, relying on loan servicers to communicate with borrowers but with few requirements on what information should be provided. ED has taken steps to increase borrower awareness, such as requiring servicers to include PSLF information in initial communications. Communication issues have been reported regarding the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, with borrowers experiencing confusion about program requirements. Servicers are required to include PSLF information in initial communications but not in ongoing ones, potentially leading to borrower forgetfulness and eligibility issues. Borrowers may make extra payments, prolonging time to forgiveness, or render loans ineligible for PSLF due to imperfect communication. Borrowers face communication issues regarding PSLF eligibility requirements, such as loan servicers not informing them about program availability or loan qualifications. Despite efforts by the Department of Education to outreach and inform borrowers, reports indicate a need for clearer information on how to qualify for PSLF. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 authorized $2.3 million for the Secretary of Education to address issues related to PSLF eligibility. Loan servicers may not provide specific information on individual borrower's PSLF eligibility, hindering informed decision-making. The act directs outreach to borrowers to ensure they meet program terms and conditions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 authorized $2.3 million for the Secretary of Education to address issues related to PSLF eligibility and conditions. It directs outreach to borrowers to ensure they meet program requirements and improve the process for filing the ECF. A 2017 CFPB report highlighted challenges borrowers face with the PSLF program, including delays in loan consolidation and incomplete information from loan servicers. Some borrowers face issues with PSLF eligibility and conditions, including incorrect denials or lack of opportunity to correct application deficiencies. Problems arise during loan transfer to FedLoan Servicing, such as removal from IDR plans without notice, leading to payments not qualifying for PSLF. Additionally, incomplete payment history transfer to FedLoan Servicing impedes accurate processing. Some borrowers have reported issues with FedLoan Servicing, including inaccurate tracking of qualifying payments for PSLF forgiveness and delays in correcting errors. Loan servicers have also failed to process IDR plan recertification paperwork promptly, leading to placement in repayment plans that do not qualify for PSLF. A recent lawsuit between ED and the American Bar Association raises questions about FedLoan Servicing's determination of employment eligibility for borrowers. The American Bar Association filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education regarding FedLoan Servicing's determination of employment eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The lawsuit questions the reliability of FedLoan Servicing's determinations and highlights concerns for borrowers relying on their employment status for PSLF qualification. The American Bar Association filed a lawsuit against the Department of Education regarding FedLoan Servicing's determination of employment eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The lawsuit questions the reliability of determinations, potential delays in forgiveness benefits, and implications for employers. The ABA lawsuit against the Department of Education questions the reliability of FedLoan Servicing's determinations for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Employers may use PSLF as a recruitment tool, but inaccurate information from loan servicers could lead to issues with borrowers' qualifications. Borrowers may face challenges with individual recordkeeping for PSLF eligibility. Individual recordkeeping is crucial for borrowers to substantiate and resolve issues with loan servicers regarding payment counting errors, especially for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. FedLoan Servicing may not always provide sufficient information, and inconsistencies from previous loan servicers can lead to mistakes in counting payments. Without proper records, borrowers may struggle to dispute errors in payment counts. Proposed policies aim to address administrative issues faced by borrowers in disputing payment counts with FedLoan Servicing or ED. Suggestions include strengthening loan servicing standards related to PSLF eligibility, such as better communication of requirements and accessible tracking of payments. Other options focus on ED's outreach to increase awareness about the program. Strengthened borrower engagement may help navigate the PSLF process more easily. One might consider targeting PSLF information to specific subgroups of borrowers, such as those in public service, to ease the process. Using a one-size-fits-all approach may lead to confusion and imprudent decision-making. Loan servicers face administrative challenges due to the program's complexity and lack of automation in determining eligibility. Fragmented guidance from ED to FedLoan Servicing adds to the issues faced in administering the PSLF program. Determining Employment Eligibility for PSLF is an administrative task affected by the lack of automation. FedLoan Servicing faces challenges in identifying qualifying employers without a definitive source from ED. They rely on limited resources and sometimes have to make their own determinations. A master list of qualifying employers from ED would streamline the process. The lack of automation in determining PSLF employment eligibility poses challenges for FedLoan Servicing. Data matching initiatives could streamline the process and provide certainty, especially amidst the current ABA lawsuit. Counting PSLF qualifying payments is also affected by inconsistent information from other loan servicers. FedLoan Servicing transfers loans and relevant documentation, but faces difficulties in obtaining accurate prior payment information. The complexity of determining qualifying payments for PSLF is exacerbated by inconsistent reporting among loan servicers, leading to delays and potential miscounting of payments. Standard definitions and terminology, as well as different IT systems used by servicers, contribute to this issue. FedLoan Servicing's ability to notify borrowers of qualifying payments made may be hindered by the labor-intensive process. FedLoan Servicing faces challenges in administering the PSLF program due to fragmented and incomplete guidance from the Department of Education. Communication through emails and gaps in guidance have led to uncertainty in how to administer certain aspects of the program. A more consistent and automated process could improve the accuracy and timeliness of tallying and notifying borrowers of qualifying loan payments. The Department of Education has been working to provide clearer guidance to FedLoan Servicing for administering the PSLF program. However, there is a need for a central source of guidance, such as a processing manual, to address administrative concerns and ensure consistent administration. Issues have also arisen regarding interactions between PSLF and other federal programs, impacting borrowers' understanding of the program. The interaction between PSLF and other federal programs is crucial for borrowers to maximize benefits. Understanding loan repayment plans, tax provisions, and program benefits is essential. The federal government must ensure proper targeting of benefits and avoid unintended double benefits. Consideration of overlapping benefits and changes to interacting benefits is necessary for effective program administration. The PSLF program interacts with loan limits and repayment plans, affecting borrowers' decisions on borrowing amounts and maximizing benefits. Key issues for the federal government include the amount of forgiven loans, potential outsized benefits for certain borrowers, and associated costs. Changes to benefits can impact targeting and costs. Loan forgiveness benefits under PSLF have no limit, potentially benefiting borrowers with large loan amounts. Borrowers with large amounts of Direct Loan debt, especially those who borrowed Direct PLUS Loans for graduate or professional education, may realize significant forgiveness benefits under the PSLF program. Data shows that individuals pursuing graduate or professional education have the potential for larger loan forgiveness benefits. Borrowers who borrowed for graduate or professional education, especially with large amounts of Direct Loan debt, may benefit significantly from PSLF loan forgiveness. Those who borrowed Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional studies have the potential for even greater forgiveness benefits. The PSLF program requires 120 qualifying monthly payments, and tying payments to income through IDR plans can help address pay disparities between public service and nonpublic service professions. Under IDR plans, monthly payments for borrowers may be lower than under a Standard 10-year repayment plan, with some plans capping payments at the amount under the Standard plan. This could lead to increased loan forgiveness under PSLF, potentially encouraging over-borrowing for some individuals based on income and family size. Some borrowers may not face increased loan payments when borrowing more under certain conditions, potentially leading to over-borrowing. Critics argue that the program's benefits may disproportionately benefit certain borrowers, allowing them to accrue large amounts of debt and receive significant benefits through reduced monthly payments and eventual loan forgiveness. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program may provide significant benefits to graduate and professional student borrowers who tend to accrue large amounts of debt and have higher earning potential. Borrowers with modest debt and low incomes could repay as little as $0 on their loans and receive substantial forgiveness. Critics argue that the program's features, such as lower monthly payments and unlimited debt forgiveness, may incentivize over-borrowing. The PSLF program offers unlimited debt forgiveness, attracting individuals with high debt burdens who may not consider public service otherwise. Changes in federal student loan programs have expanded eligibility for PSLF benefits, with various income-driven repayment plans now available. The expansion of income-driven repayment plans has made it easier for more borrowers to qualify for IDR plans and potentially qualify for PSLF benefits. Monthly payments are now based on 10% of discretionary income, benefiting high-income participants, while the amount of nondiscretionary income excluded from calculations remains the same. The enhancement of income-driven repayment plans has made it easier for borrowers to qualify for PSLF benefits. Monthly payments are based on discretionary income, with income excluded from calculations remaining at 150% of the federal poverty guidelines. This benefit can be significant for low-income borrowers and those with large debts who experience income growth. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program allows borrowers to have a larger portion of their loans forgiven within a 10-year period. Factors such as higher debt amounts, the switch to Direct Loans, and interaction with other loan programs contribute to the potential for increased debt forgiveness under PSLF. The issue of receiving loan repayment or forgiveness benefits under other programs while qualifying for the PSLF program is complex. Borrowers need to understand how their service may qualify for multiple benefits, while the government must determine what constitutes a \"double benefit.\" Borrowers can use benefits from other federal loan repayment programs to make payments on their Direct Loans, potentially counting towards PSLF qualifying payments. In some cases, the service for receiving benefits under another program may also qualify as PSLF employment. The monetary benefit from loan repayment programs like Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program or Student Loan Repayment Program for House and Senate Employees can be considered qualifying employment for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Borrowers can use these benefits to make payments on their Direct Loans, which may count towards the required 120 payments for PSLF. This could be seen as providing multiple benefits for the same service performed. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized under HEA, Title IV prohibit borrowers from receiving a reduction in their loan repayment obligations through more than one program for the same service performed. This could be viewed as providing overlapping or double benefits across multiple federal programs with similar goals, which could be considered akin to a windfall. Under the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program, individuals must teach full-time for five consecutive academic years in qualifying positions to receive up to $17,500 in forgiveness benefits. This program prohibits individuals from receiving benefits under both the Teacher Loan Forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness programs for the same service performed, requiring them to choose between the two benefits. Forgiveness options include a longer 10-year period under PSLF. It can be challenging to determine the most beneficial program between Teacher Loan Forgiveness and PSLF. Qualifying PSLF payments must be on-time, full, and separate monthly payments. Lump-sum payments may result in being \"paid ahead,\" counting as one qualifying payment. Subsequent payments during a paid ahead status do not qualify for PSLF. When a borrower is paid ahead, they will not qualify for PSLF. Lump-sum loan repayment benefits from employers may limit an individual's ability to benefit from multiple programs. This can impact private employer loan repayment benefits and federal student loan repayment programs. Such policies may decrease the effectiveness of programs meant to aid in recruitment and retention of qualified employees. The provision of double benefits to individuals employed in public service, such as excluding PSLF benefits from gross income for federal income taxation, can be seen as a windfall. Federal income tax provisions may further lower tax liability and reduce loan burdens, potentially increasing PSLF benefits. Education tax benefits, like the student loan interest tax deduction, play a role in postsecondary education efforts. Monthly payments under an IDR plan are based on an individual's AGI reported to the IRS on a federal income tax return. Various federal income tax provisions can reduce an individual's AGI, potentially lowering monthly IDR payments and increasing debt forgiveness under PSLF. The student loan interest tax deduction allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest payments. If a borrower and their spouse file separate tax returns, only the borrower's AGI is used to calculate monthly payments under most IDR plans. When borrowers file jointly, their monthly payments are based on combined AGI, leading to potential disparities in PSLF benefits. Regulations for the REPAYE plan aim to address issues of unequal treatment based on tax filing status by requiring married individuals to use combined spousal AGI for loan payment calculations. The PSLF program calculates loan payments based on combined spousal AGI for married borrowers filing jointly. Program-related considerations include fitting into federal student aid benefits, estimating participation costs, and borrowers not needing to declare intent until seeking forgiveness after 10 years. Federal policy has historically focused on providing financial assistance to support postsecondary education, including programs like the GI Bill for veterans and Pell Grants for low-income students. Federal policy has historically focused on providing financial assistance to support postsecondary education, including programs like the GI Bill for veterans and Pell Grants for low-income students. Today, federal student aid grants and loans are available to students based on financial need or low-income status, such as Pell Grants and Direct Subsidized Loans, as well as to students without regard to financial need, like Direct Unsubsidized Loans and Direct PLUS Loans. The Federal Pell Grant program provides need-based aid that does not need to be repaid, while the Direct Loan program offers both need-based and non-need-based loans that must be repaid. The number of federal programs to alleviate repayment burden on student loans has increased, with over 50 forgiveness and repayment programs authorized. These programs aim to provide debt relief and incentivize individuals to enter specific professions. The first major effort was established in 1958 under the National Defense Education Act, offering loan forgiveness for full-time teachers. The expansion of loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as the PSLF program, signals a shift towards providing more assistance to individuals after incurring student loan debt. This move may alleviate financial burdens associated with postsecondary education borrowing and is based on post-enrollment economic circumstances rather than need at enrollment. The expansion of loan forgiveness and repayment programs focuses on aiding individuals based on their post-enrollment economic circumstances. This shift towards targeted aid post-enrollment may signal a broader federal effort to encourage specific occupational pursuits. Consideration is needed on the balance between widely available aid at enrollment versus targeted aid post-enrollment, as granting loan forgiveness benefits incurs costs to the federal government. The federal government incurs costs from granting loan forgiveness benefits, but estimating these costs is challenging due to various factors. Initial estimates in 2008 projected a cost of $1.5 billion over five years, but lacked details on borrower participation and program changes. Since then, no updated cost estimates have been provided. Since 2008, there have been no updated cost estimates for the PSLF program despite the switch to 100% Direct Loan lending. Speculation exists that the program's cost to the federal government could be higher than expected due to limited information on borrower participation and loan balances. Limited insight into the program's performance is provided by two datasets published by ED, with other publicly available data potentially shedding light on the program's actual and future costs. ED recently released data on the number of individuals who applied for loan forgiveness under the program. FedLoan Servicing processed 28,913 forgiveness applications, with 1% approved. Between October 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018, 32,601 applications were received from 28,081 individuals. Some denied applicants may still qualify in the future as they complete program requirements or provide missing information. Between October 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018, FedLoan Servicing processed 28,913 forgiveness applications, with 71% denied for not meeting program requirements and 28% denied for missing information. 289 applications were approved, totaling $5.52 million in loan forgiveness for 96 borrowers. 193 applications await final approval from ED. As of June 30, 2018, applications approved by FedLoan Servicing for loan forgiveness were awaiting final approval from ED, delaying the forgiveness of associated loans. Limited conclusions can be drawn about future participation and costs of the program due to recent eligibility for forgiveness benefits and potential differences in cohort sizes and repayment plan options. Despite 28,624 denied applications for PSLF forgiveness, borrowers may still be eligible in the future if they resubmit complete applications or meet program requirements later on. For example, borrowers initially denied for not meeting payment requirements could become eligible after making additional qualifying payments. Communication issues and administrative issues may also impact eligibility. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 874,000 individuals had submitted at least one PSLF ECF, with at least one ECF approved and a qualifying Direct Loan. These numbers give a general estimate of progress towards PSLF program requirements, but not the final eligibility for forgiveness benefits due to various reasons. Borrowers may submit ECFs at any time to track their progress. Some borrowers may choose to submit ECFs to track their progress towards PSLF eligibility, but approval does not guarantee forgiveness benefits. Disapproval of an ECF also does not rule out future eligibility for PSLF benefits. While approval of an Employment Certification Form (ECF) does not guarantee forgiveness benefits, disapproval for administrative reasons or changing employment status may impact future eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). Borrowers must make qualifying payments on Direct Loans while employed in public service, but ECF approval does not confirm this. Additional data on approved ECFs provide insight into borrower characteristics and potential program costs. Figure 1 shows the amount borrowed by individuals with qualifying Direct Loans and approved ECFs, while Figure 2 displays the annual AGI of borrowers enrolled in IDR plans. This information helps in understanding potential program costs and the importance of repayment under IDR plans for maximizing PSLF benefits. To maximize potential borrower benefits under PSLF, qualifying monthly payments are typically made under an IDR plan based on a borrower's AGI."
