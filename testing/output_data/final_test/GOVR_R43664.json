    "content": "Foreign nationals in the United States can apply for asylum with USCIS or EOIR. To qualify, they must show a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Credibility of the claim and likelihood of persecution are key factors in assessing asylum cases. The regulations for asylum seekers specify that they must have a well-founded fear of persecution based on certain criteria, including race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. It is also required that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering persecution if they were to return to their country of origin and that they are unable or unwilling to return due to fear. Additionally, asylum seekers do not qualify if they could avoid persecution by relocating within their country. Foreign nationals apprehended at the border without proper documents can request asylum in the US and have a hearing with an immigration judge. Prior to 1996, they were eligible for a hearing to determine admissibility and could seek review of unfavorable decisions. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 amended the INA to allow DHS immigration officers to exclude foreign nationals arriving without proper documentation, unless they express fear of persecution. This was in response to concerns about abuse of the asylum system due to lengthy backlogs and multiple levels of hearings and appeals. Expedited removal allows CBP officers to exclude foreign nationals without proper documentation from the US without placing them in removal proceedings. They must ask specific questions to identify those who fear returning to their home country. If fear is expressed, the individual is supposed to be detained. The INA allows for expedited removal of foreign nationals without proper documentation. If a foreign national expresses fear of return, they are detained and interviewed by USCIS asylum officer for a \"credible fear\" determination. This concept serves as a pre-screening standard for eligibility for asylum, broader than the well-founded fear of persecution standard. Those found to have a credible fear are referred to an EOIR immigration judge. The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) of 2008 made significant revisions to asylum policy for unaccompanied children, including changes to initial processing and immigration relief options. Prior to these revisions, unaccompanied children seeking asylum did so during a removal proceeding before an immigration judge in EOIR. The legislative journey towards these TVPRA provisions began in the 1980s and 1990s. Provisions on asylum for unaccompanied children began in the 1980s and 1990s, leading to the establishment of the Flores Settlement in 1997, which set policies for the detention and treatment of UAC. The settlement recognized the vulnerability of UAC and allowed them the opportunity to seek asylum before an immigration judge. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established guidelines for the processing of unaccompanied alien children, dividing responsibilities between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Immigration officials have faced criticism for their treatment of unaccompanied children, with expedited removal being considered for minors with criminal records or previous removal orders. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 defined \"unaccompanied alien children\" as minors without lawful immigration status in the US, under 18, and lacking a parent or guardian. Despite reforms, criticism of their treatment persists. Upon apprehension, these children are screened for credible fear of returning home, with a 48-hour deadline for those from contiguous countries. This screening determines whether they are returned or transferred to HHS for removal proceedings. The TVPRA requires screening of unaccompanied children to ensure they are not victims of trafficking or at risk if returned to their home country, have no asylum claim, and can make an independent decision to return. A policy issued in 2009 extended these screening provisions to all unaccompanied alien children. Those who do not voluntarily return or are from noncontiguous countries are transferred to HHS for removal proceedings. They can request asylum during these proceedings with EOIR. The TVPRA revised procedures for unaccompanied children filing for asylum, giving USCIS initial jurisdiction over their applications. USCIS also has jurisdiction over asylum applications from unaccompanied children with pending claims in immigration court or on appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals. USCIS guidelines for immigration appeals require child-appropriate interviews considering age, language development, and background. Age can impact asylum status analysis. If a child can't identify all persecution motives, nexus can still be found based on protected grounds. If an unaccompanied child is deemed ineligible for asylum, case processing depends on EOIR status. Figure 1 shows asylum seekers' procedures. Unaccompanied children face fewer hurdles in requesting asylum compared to unauthorized adults or families with children. If asylum is not granted by USCIS, unaccompanied children resume formal removal proceedings overseen by EOIR. The TVPRA mandates formal removal proceedings for unaccompanied children, with only a small portion requesting asylum with USCIS. The TVPRA allows unaccompanied children to request asylum with USCIS, with only 26% applying within the first 300 days in the US. Most apply after 400 days, and the patterns hold for children from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. USCIS has granted asylum to 108 out of 167 cases adjudicated through the third quarter of FY2014. In FY2014, USCIS granted asylum to 108 unaccompanied alien children out of 167 cases adjudicated. Congress is considering revising laws on how unaccompanied children are treated for asylum and expedited removal. Some propose subjecting children to expedited removal with a credible fear screening, while others advocate for a more child-sensitive standard of immigration relief. Some advocate for a child-sensitive standard of immigration relief for unaccompanied children fleeing violence, prioritizing the best interests of the child over INA provisions. Others support current policies that allow children to recover before making asylum claims and suggest increasing appropriations for a prompt response to the surge of unaccompanied children."
