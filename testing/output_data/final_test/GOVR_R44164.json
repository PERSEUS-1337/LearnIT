The U.S. Department of Education uses four funding formulas to determine grants to local educational agencies (LEAs). States then adjust the grant amounts, including funds for administration and school improvement, as well as grants for charter schools. Title I-A of the ESEA provides grants to low-achieving schools with high numbers of low-income students. States adjust grant amounts and distribute funds to LEAs, who then allocate funds to schools based on the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The ESSA reauthorized the ESEA in 2015 with few changes to the Title I-A formulas, which will take effect in FY2017. This report outlines the four formulas used to allocate Title I-A funds and changes made by the ESSA. In FY2016, Title I-A appropriations are allocated through four formulas: Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). These formulas determine the distribution of funds to LEAs and states, with each formula receiving a specified percentage of the total appropriation. The maximum grant for each formula is calculated based on a \"formula child count\" and an \"expenditure factor,\" with additional factors applied in some cases. Once funds reach LEAs, the amounts allocated under the four formulas are combined and used jointly. Under Title I-A, funds are allocated to LEAs through four formulas: Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG). LEAs must meet certain criteria to be eligible for grants under specific formulas. Funds are initially calculated at the LEA level and then adjusted to apply state minimum grant provisions. Allocations are made at the state level for EFIG formula, while state total grants are the sum of allocations for LEAs in the state for Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grant formulas. Under the EFIG formula, state grants are calculated based on child population and expenditure factors, with LEAs competing within each state for funding. In contrast, the other Title I-A formulas allocate grants at the LEA level, where each LEA competes nationwide. The formula child population used for grants includes children aged 5 to 17 in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The formula child count for Title I-A grants includes children ages 5 to 17 in poor families, institutions, and TANF recipients. The formula child rate is updated annually and calculated by dividing the number of formula children by the total child population in an LEA. The Title I-A grant formula determines funding based on state average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for K-12 education, with minimum and maximum thresholds. State APPE is adjusted to 80-120% of national APPE for Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants, and 85-115% for EFIG. After adjustments, state APPE is multiplied by 0.40. Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas include weighting schemes to increase aid to LEAs. The Targeted Grant and EFIG formulas use weighting schemes to provide more aid to LEAs with higher concentrations of formula children. Children in the formulas are assigned weights based on each LEA's formula child rate and number of formula children. The higher of the two weighted counts is used to determine LEA grant amounts. Hold harmless provisions are included in all four formulas to prevent large decreases in grant amounts from year to year, assuming sufficient appropriations. The Title I-A hold harmless provision ensures that LEAs receive a minimum percentage of their prior-year grant in the current year based on the percentage of formula children they serve. The hold harmless rate ranges from 85% to 95% depending on the percentage of formula children. LEAs must meet eligibility requirements to benefit from the hold harmless provisions, except for those receiving Concentration Grants. The hold harmless provisions ensure that LEAs meeting eligibility requirements receive a minimum grant amount based on the percentage of formula children served. The EFIG formula includes unique factors like the effort and equity factors, benefiting states with higher education spending relative to personal income. The effort factor and equity factor in the EFIG formula determine state grants based on education spending relative to personal income. The effort factor has narrow bounds to minimize its influence, while the equity factor favors states with more equitable funding distribution among LEAs. It also affects LEA weighted student counts. The use of different sets of weights in determining an LEA's weight formula child count rewards states with more equitable funding distribution among LEAs. Higher weights are used in states with less equitable funding distribution, resulting in higher grants for LEAs with a high number of formula children. Conversely, states with less variation in funding distribution among LEAs have lower weights, producing smaller differences in weighted formula child counts. Title I-A funds are allocated to schools based on formula child counts, with LEAs ranking schools by low-income student percentages for funding distribution. Schools must have a higher percentage of low-income students than the LEA average or 35%, whichever is lower. LEAs have discretion over a portion of Title I-A grants at the district level. The ESSA requires Title I-A funds to be allocated based on low-income student percentages, with schools needing to have a higher percentage than the LEA average or 35%, whichever is lower. Funding is distributed through various formulas, including Basic Grants, Concentration Grants, Targeted Grants, and EFIG. Appropriators have discretion in funding allocations, with set-asides for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas increasing in FY2017. The ESSA requires Title I-A funds to be allocated based on low-income student percentages. Funding is distributed through various formulas, with set-asides for the Bureau of Indian Education and Outlying Areas increasing in FY2017. The set-aside for state grants will increase to 1.1% without reducing total funds available. States will allocate grants to LEAs and make adjustments for school improvement, with a requirement to reserve 7% of Title I-A funds for this purpose. The ESSA changed the grant allocation process for schools, requiring LEAs to rank public schools by low-income student percentages and serve them in rank order. Schools with over 75% low-income students must be prioritized, with the option to serve elementary and middle schools with over 75% low-income students and high schools with over 50% low-income students first. High schools with over 50% low-income students must be prioritized for services under the ESSA grant allocation process."
