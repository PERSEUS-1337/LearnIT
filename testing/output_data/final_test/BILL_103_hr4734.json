    "content": "The Trade and Environment Reporting Act of 1994 may be cited as the official title of this Act. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Trade and Environment Reporting Act of 1994 acknowledges the impact of free trade agreements on environmental resources, both within and outside the United States. The complex relationship between liberalized trade and the environment is not well understood, and these trade actions have historically been exempt from environmental assessment requirements. The Congress considers legislation to grant negotiating authority to the President for free trade agreements and implement those agreements. Environmental effects of trade actions should be identified and considered by the President before entering into such actions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"environmental resources\" as including fish, wildlife, and natural resources. It also defines \"free trade agreement\" as an agreement between the US and another nation to regulate trade. \"Major trade action\" refers to any trade action that may impact environmental resources. The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with relevant agencies, will issue regulations describing major trade actions that impact environmental resources, including free trade agreements. SEC. 4. Consultation on major trade actions; environmental assessments of free trade agreements. Before entering into negotiations for any free trade agreement or major trade action, the United States Trade Representative must consult with Congress, advisory committees, federal agencies, environmental organizations, and interested persons to identify environmental resources that may be affected and determine the scope of environmental assessments required. The United States Trade Representative must consult with various entities before entering into negotiations for trade agreements or actions to identify environmental resources that may be affected. Within 90 days of this Act's enactment, regulations will be issued for consultations, including public comment opportunities. Environmental assessments will involve multiple agencies and departments. The United States Trade Representative, in consultation with various entities, must prepare environmental assessments for each free trade agreement. The assessments will identify potential environmental effects, laws that may be affected, measures to minimize adverse effects, and a summary of consultation results. The United States Trade Representative must submit environmental assessments for free trade agreements to Congress after the agreement is signed by the President and at least 60 days before legislation is transmitted to implement the agreement. The assessments must be made publicly available and notice of availability must be published. The United States Trade Representative must submit environmental assessments for free trade agreements to Congress after the agreement is signed by the President. The assessments must be made publicly available and notice of availability must be published in the Federal Register. SEC. 5 requires the United States Trade Representative to consider environmental effects in major trade actions by reviewing consultation results and ensuring compatibility with US laws. SEC. 6 mandates monitoring and reporting. The Council on Environmental Quality, along with other relevant agencies, will monitor the effects of major trade actions on environmental resources within and outside the United States. The Council on Environmental Quality will report to Congress every 3 years on the monitoring of environmental resources outside the US, while the US Trade Representative will report annually on compliance with section 5."
