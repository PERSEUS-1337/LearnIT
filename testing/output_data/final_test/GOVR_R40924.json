    "content": "One of the most significant developments in China's industrialization is the growth of its automotive industry, which has become the world's top auto producer and sales market. The Chinese auto market has been growing rapidly, with foreign auto makers like General Motors and Volkswagen benefiting from the government's stimulus spending and incentives. China's automotive industry is rapidly growing and becoming a major player in the global market. Industry data suggests that China may adopt a hybrid approach, focusing on domestic consumption while also exporting vehicles. The country's automotive parts manufacturing sector is increasingly complex and shifting towards more value-added production. This growth could have a significant impact on the U.S. industry, particularly in automotive parts exports. Bilateral trade in auto parts has grown significantly since 2001, with concerns about competition between U.S. and Chinese firms. Issues include China's export restrictions on raw materials, incomplete implementation of WTO commitments, and protection of intellectual property rights. This report provides an overview of China's auto sector development, including production, sales, market drivers, manufacturers, and trade. It discusses the operations of foreign auto makers in China, emergence of domestic manufacturers, and government policies guiding the sector's evolution. China's auto sector in China has been guided by government policies since the 1950s, with assistance from the Soviet Union. The industry saw significant development in the late 1980s under Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. Partnerships with major companies have led to increased sophistication in Chinese vehicles. Chinese vehicles have advanced through partnerships with major foreign automakers, requiring joint ventures with local partners for market access. The Chinese government aims to create a market dominated by competitive joint venture assemblers and local parts manufacturers. The domestic auto industry has made significant progress in the past three decades, with many domestic manufacturers aspiring to become global players. China's domestic auto industry has rapidly expanded, with annual vehicle output increasing from less than 2 million in the late 1990s to over 18 million in 2011. The industry has become a major force in the Chinese economy, with a gross output of more than Rmb 3 trillion yuan in 2009 and over 3.7 million workers in automotive production. China has quickly become one of the world's top automotive manufacturers, surpassing countries like South Korea and France. China's vehicle production has seen significant growth, surpassing South Korea and France in the early 2000s. By 2005, China approached Germany's production levels and overtook them for third place in 2006. Production continued to rise, reaching 7 million units in 2006 and nearly 9 million in 2007. During the global economic slowdown in 2008-2009, global vehicle production dropped, impacting U.S. automakers like GM and Chrysler. However, China's automotive industry remained strong and continued to grow. China's automotive industry in 2008 showed strength by producing 9.5 million vehicles, surpassing the United States for the first time. With a government stimulus package, China's auto industry continued to grow in 2009 and 2010, becoming the world's largest producer with over 13.6 million vehicles in 2009 and nearly 18.3 million in 2010. China has been the only leading vehicle producer with consistent growth since 2000, although growth slowed in 2011. In 2011, the growth of the auto sector in China flattened. The United States auto sector started to recover in 2010 and 2011, finishing as the second-largest auto producing country behind China. Other regions like North America and Western Europe saw declines in production during the economic crisis. Japan, the former largest motor vehicle producer, experienced little growth in production due to domestic economic slowdown, yen strengthening, and increased overseas manufacturing. Output remained around 10 million vehicles annually from 2000 to 2003, increasing to 11.6 million in 2007 and 2008. However, the global recession in 2009 caused production to drop below 8 million units. Recovery in 2010 was hindered by the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, leading to another drop below 8 million units. China's automotive production has surged ahead of other developing nations, particularly in the BRIC countries. The growth in vehicle production in China far surpasses that of Brazil, Russia, and India combined. The composition of Chinese motor vehicle output is shifting towards meeting domestic consumer demand for passenger cars, resembling a mature industrial market. This trend is driven by rapid growth in per capita income, especially in coastal regions and major inland cities. In the mid-1990s, China produced 300,000 passenger cars out of a total annual output of 1.2 million vehicles. The United States also produced more trucks than passenger cars during that time, with a focus on minivans, SUVs, and pickup trucks for personal use. In China, trucks were more oriented towards heavy duty and mass transit equipment, while buses included some types of minivans. As of 2004, combined truck and bus production in China was slightly higher than output of passenger cars. China's auto industry saw a shift towards passenger car production after 2000, moving away from joint ventures with foreign companies. The Chinese government used to dictate product choices for joint ventures, leading to mismatched products for the market. In 2000, China began granting more autonomy to automakers. China's auto industry shifted towards passenger car production after 2000, as China granted automakers more autonomy to tap into the high-volume Chinese market. By 2004, passenger cars accounted for nearly 50% of total vehicle production in China. China's motor vehicle market experienced rapid growth, with passenger car production surpassing commercial vehicles in 2005. The first wave of car buyers emerged in large cities along the eastern seaboard around 2000, followed by smaller coastal urban areas and major inland cities five years later. Vehicle sales in China slowed in 2008 due to economic challenges, prompting the government to introduce measures such as subsidies and lower purchase taxes to boost sales. The Chinese government introduced subsidies, lower purchase taxes, and expanded bank credit to boost car sales, extending incentives to 2010. This led to over 18 million units sold in 2010. Factors like low car ownership rates, rapid economic growth, and rising personal income are expected to drive market demand in the coming years. Foreign and domestic carmakers have increased production capacity in anticipation of continued growth, leading to significant competition in the market. The strong demand growth in China has led to increased competition and more affordable vehicles. Car prices dropped by nearly 6% in 2007, while urban residents' income increased by 12.2%. The expanding middle-class is driving rapid car ownership expansion. China's road network improvement and expansion, with about 74,000 km of high-speed roads by 2010, have also contributed to the greater demand for cars. The Chinese government's economic stimulus program led to a surge in vehicle sales, with annual growth rates of 46% and 32% in 2009 and 2010. However, this rapid expansion of the auto market may have caused overcapacity, as warned by an official from China's National Development and Reform Commission. The increase in vehicles on the road has resulted in severe traffic congestion and air pollution, particularly in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing. In August 2010, China experienced its worst traffic jam due to road work and high vehicle numbers. China experienced its worst traffic jam in history when road work and a high volume of commercial vehicles caused a 10-day gridlock on a highway north of Beijing, stretching up to 100 kilometers. Parking shortages in big Chinese cities have become a major issue due to the lack of spaces compared to the growing number of cars. Municipal governments, including Beijing, have implemented measures such as limiting new vehicle registrations to alleviate traffic congestion. In 1994, Shanghai started auctioning license plates, with 8,000 to 9,000 plates sold monthly at an average price of $6,000 or more. The city bans non-Shanghai plates from highways during rush hour to improve traffic flow. Despite successful results, the auction process lacks transparency, leading to frustration among car buyers. American automotive companies were early entrants into the Chinese market in the 1980s. American Motors Corporation (AMC) signed a joint-venture agreement with China's Beijing Automotive Works, marking the first major manufacturing deal by a Western company in China's automotive market. American companies initially lost out to Japanese and European investors, particularly VW. To allow foreign entry, China required joint ventures with local partners, often state-owned companies, with no more than 50% foreign ownership. For example, VW partnered with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. (SAIC) and First Automotive. VW has partnered with SAIC and FAW in China's automotive market. SAIC is also in a joint venture with GM, while FAW partners with Toyota. Honda and PSA Peugeot Citroen have alliances with Dongfeng Motor Corp. Various other domestic and foreign automakers have formed partnerships. Foreign investments in China's market occurred in three waves, with joint ventures dominating from the mid-1980s to late 1990s. GM and Honda entered the market in the late 1990s, followed by other foreign automakers after China's WTO accession in 2001. The Chinese government aimed for technological and management expertise transfer to local car producers through these partnerships. Foreign automakers partnered with Chinese producers to access the market, leading to dominance by international companies. Domestic firms feel they have not benefitted equally, resorting to copying international models. GM and VW lead the market with 12.4% and 10.4% shares respectively. The leading vendors in the Chinese market are GM and VW, each commanding 12.4% and 10.4% respectively. Other major car makers include Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Hyundai-Kia. Domestic manufacturers like Chana, FAW, and Dongfeng were also prominent in sales. Trucks and buses make up a significant share of total vehicles, with FAW and Dongfeng focusing on commercial vehicles. Major Chinese passenger car makers are Chery, Geely, SAIC, and BYD. The Chinese government is promoting indigenous brands by removing incentives for foreign investment in the auto sector. GM and VW are the leading automakers in the Chinese market, with GM making the biggest investment and achieving the most success. VW has nine auto plants in China and GM formed a joint venture with FAW Group to produce light trucks. Despite AMC's early entry, GM has been the most successful U.S. automotive manufacturer in China. In 1997, GM established a joint venture with SAIC to manufacture vehicles in China, including minivans and sedans. GM sold more cars in China than in the US in 2010 and 2011, aiming to double annual sales to over 5 million by 2015. GM manufactures various brands in China, with Buick and Chevrolet being the volume brands. GM has established joint ventures in China with SAIC to manufacture vehicles, including Wuling, Buick, and Chevrolet. These vehicles are based on designs by Daewoo or Opel and are re-engineered at the Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center. GM is building an advanced automotive technology center in Shanghai with 62 test labs and 9 research labs. The first phase, the Advanced Materials Lab, opened in 2011 for battery cell and lightweight automotive material research. GM has 11 joint ventures in China, a parts distribution center, and an investment subsidiary in Shanghai. They employ over 35,000 employees in China and relocated their international operations to Shanghai. GM relocated its international operations to Shanghai in 2009, establishing GM International Operations (GMIO) with functional and geographic control worldwide, except for GM North America. After selling 1% stake to SAIC during bankruptcy, GM regained equal authority in 2012 pending Chinese government approval. Chrysler does not manufacture in China, importing mainly Jeep vehicles since 2007. Chrysler stopped producing Jeep models in China in 2007 and began importing vehicles to supply the Chinese market. Tariffs and shipping costs made it difficult to compete, prompting Chrysler to consider local production. Despite failed partnerships with Beijing Automotive, Chery Automotive, and Great Wall Motor, Fiat SpA took control of Chrysler in 2009. The Fiat-Chrysler group is now exploring new opportunities in China. Ford has been slow to establish a manufacturing presence in China compared to other Detroit-based producers. They started producing trucks and vans in 1997 through a joint venture with Jiangling Motors, Corp. and entered the passenger car segment in 2003 with a joint venture involving Chongqing Changan of China and Mazda of Japan. Despite a sales increase from 2005 to 2006, Ford's sales in China have been relatively flat. In 2011, Ford's total sales of affiliated brands were 519,390 units, nearly one-fifth of GM's sales in China. Ford opened its third assembly plant in Chongqing in February 2012 as part of its expansion plan. Ford announced plans to build a $760 million assembly plant in Hangzhou as part of its expansion in China. The Chinese government's shift in policies to support domestic auto makers may pose challenges for global carmakers like Ford and Chrysler. Regulatory hurdles and slower approval processes for capacity expansion could impact their growth in the Chinese automotive market. The Chinese automotive market is highly fragmented with about 100 vehicle manufacturers, many of which are subsidized by provincial governments. Two-thirds of the top 25 domestic producers are state-owned. Industry consolidation is being encouraged by the central government, but faces challenges due to vested interests of local governments. Chinese parts producers have adopted various strategies, including direct relationships with foreign automotive suppliers. International parts manufacturers are increasingly forming joint ventures in China. Many international parts manufacturers have established operations in China to follow their OEM partners. For example, Magna International Inc. and Visteon have multiple facilities in China. Chinese OEMs and suppliers also opt for outright purchase of foreign automotive suppliers to acquire needed technologies and intellectual property. Geely Automotive acquired an Australian auto parts company in 2009 to enhance its gearbox development. In 2009, BeijingWest Industries (BWI) acquired Delphi Corp.'s suspension and brake units. China's Pacific Motors bought Nexteer Automotive in 2010. Nexteer's Saginaw plant is retooled to produce electronic-steering systems for GM vehicles. Chinese companies are investing in Western automotive parts companies amid declines in production and sales. Chinese companies are investing in distressed Western car makers' assets, with speculation arising in 2009 and 2010. Concerns exist over Chinese firms investing in the US, but they are making direct industrial investments and seeking automotive deals in the Midwest. The Chinese government is exploring allowing domestic automakers to acquire foreign brands, following opportunities that arose during the Asian financial crisis and the global economic slowdown. An early example of this was the purchase of MG Rover by SAIC and Nanjing Automobile Group in 2005 for advanced technology and manufacturing capacity. Chinese automakers acquired MG Rover, a company with a complex history stemming from the nationalized British Leyland Motor Corporation. Brands like Jaguar, Rover, Land Rover, and Mini were part of BL Ltd. Jaguar was privatized in 1984 and later sold to Ford and then Tata Motors. BL was renamed Rover Group in 1986, privatized in 1988, and sold to British Aerospace. BMW purchased the remainder in 1994 but faced financial strain, leading to the sale of MG and Rover to the Phoenix Consortium for \u00a310. In 2005, MG Rover went into receivership, and Nanjing Automobile Group purchased its assets for $100 million. SAIC acquired the intellectual property rights to Rover platforms and developed cars sold in China under brand names Roewe and MG Mingjue. SAIC later acquired Nanjing Automobile in December 2007. In December 2007, SAIC acquired Nanjing Automobile, aiming to create a stronger auto industry in China. The tie-up between SAIC and Nanjing Auto could serve as a model for smaller auto makers to merge with larger manufacturers. SAIC started selling the MG6 sedan in the UK in 2011, with 80% of the car built in China and shipped for final assembly. Geely acquired Volvo from Ford in August 2010 for $1.8 billion. Geely acquired Volvo from Ford for $1.8 billion, retaining management, headquarters, and manufacturing facilities in Sweden and Belgium. Volvo will establish a joint venture with Geely to produce cars in China and develop indigenous brand and electric cars. Geely acquired Volvo from Ford for $1.8 billion to help Chinese partners develop an indigenous brand of cars and electric cars. In March 2012, Geely and Volvo signed a technology transfer agreement to tap into Volvo's technology. Questions remain about whether Chinese auto companies can build upon acquired technology and become world-class car makers. In 2009, Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery's attempt to buy the Hummer marque from GM failed to receive approval from Chinese regulators. The acquisition of the Hummer brand by Tengzhong failed to receive approval from Chinese regulators, speculated to be due to the government's focus on promoting vehicle fuel efficiency and industry consolidation. Beijing Auto's bid for Opel was also rejected by GM due to intellectual property issues. In 2010, GM sold Saab to Spyker Cars NV, which later renamed itself Swedish Automotive NV. Saab faced challenges due to its small size, lack of credit access, and reliance on others for technology. Despite failed investments in 2011, including from Chinese firms, Saab filed for bankruptcy protection in September 2011 and later filed for bankruptcy again in December 2011, leading to liquidation. The bankruptcy was triggered after objections from its former owner, GM. In June 2012, a Chinese-Japanese investment group bought Saab and planned to convert it into an electric car maker. The purchasing group includes National Modern Energy Holdings Ltd. and Sun Investment. GM had objected to deals with Chinese investors over concerns about technology transfer to China. The United States and other producers criticized China's 1994 Industrial Policy for the Automotive Sector. The State Council released the Automotive Readjustment and Revitalization Plan in March 2009 to boost the Chinese auto sector amid the global economic slowdown. The three-year plan aims to ensure steady automobile production and sales in China, with goals including achieving a 10% annual growth rate and increasing auto consumption. The Automotive Readjustment and Revitalization Plan aims to restructure the auto market, consolidate manufacturing groups, increase Chinese brand vehicle market share to 40%, boost new-energy vehicle production capacity to 500,000 units, and enhance automotive research and development to meet international standards. The Automotive Readjustment and Revitalization Plan aims to improve automotive research and development, expand auto parts manufacturing capacity, seek technological independence in key auto parts, enhance automotive technologies for greater fuel efficiency and safety features. These measures align with the government's efforts to reduce energy dependence on imported oil and curb air pollution caused by cars in China's biggest cities. The Chinese government has implemented measures to reduce fuel consumption, such as raising fuel prices and offering incentives for purchasing alternative-energy vehicles. The National Development and Reform Commission releases a \"Foreign Investment Catalogue\" categorizing foreign investment as encouraged, permitted, or restricted, which influences government policies and local authorities. Foreign investment in automobile manufacturing was removed from the \"encouraged\" category in the latest catalog published in December 2011. In 2011, foreign investment in automobile manufacturing was removed from the \"encouraged\" category in China due to concerns over overcapacity and blind investment. This policy change impacted global automakers, with alternative-energy vehicles now being encouraged. The move by the NDRC to strengthen domestic companies will affect foreign companies in the Chinese market, leading to potential cost increases and increased reliance on Chinese partners. The Chinese government aims to improve domestic automakers' capability to produce complete vehicles and key components, promoting the creation of domestic brands by Chinese firms. This shift may lead to increased reliance on Chinese partners for foreign companies in the Chinese market. The Chinese government encourages foreign carmakers in joint ventures to develop local brands and add electric vehicles to their product lineups. This initiative aims to enhance the capabilities of domestic automakers and promote the creation of domestic brands in China. Industry experts question the business sense of developing local brands in China, as the central government and carmakers aim to reduce complexity. Honda Motors and General Motors have started producing models for their local brands, with Honda launching the Everus S1, a rebadged older model of Honda Fit, for its joint venture, Guangqi Honda. Honda introduced the Everus model, sold through the same dealership network as the new Honda Fit, with only 2,000 units sold per month. GM responded to local government requests in Liuzhou by launching the Baojun 630, developed by PATAC in Shanghai. Positioned as an entry-level car, Baojun outsold Everus with 22,000 units in the first three months of 2012. Industry analysts doubt the success of other joint-venture brands, suggesting indigenous brands may not meet market demand. The central government in China aims for automakers to consolidate operations and improve technology, with domestic automakers and their joint ventures expected to produce over 90% of vehicles. Most mergers and acquisitions have occurred among state-owned auto companies, such as SAIC acquiring Nanjing Automobile Group in 2008 and Changan acquiring Jiangxi Changhe Automobile Co. and Hafei Automobile in 2009. Changan acquired Jiangxi Changhe Automobile Co. and Hafei Automobile Industry Group Co. as part of the government's push for alternative energy vehicles to reduce oil consumption and address environmental issues. Support from the central government and local authorities has led to a surge in projects for producing alternative-energy vehicles and technologies in China. The municipality of Beijing exempts electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles from license-plate limits. Shenzhen city government supports advanced technology initiatives and provided fiscal support to BYD Auto Company, a subsidiary of a major battery manufacturer. Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway bought a 10% stake in BYD in 2008. BYD produces conventional and electric vehicles and has plans to export to the U.S. market. BYD America opened an office in Los Angeles in 2011 but delayed selling electric cars due to a lack of public chargers. They plan to focus on solar panels, batteries, LED lighting, and rechargeable buses. The central government in China offers incentives for new energy vehicles, including subsidies of up to 60,000 yuan for electric cars and 50,000 yuan for plug-in hybrids in certain cities. Local governments also provide subsidies, like Shenzhen offering up to 60,000 yuan for electric cars. Despite these incentives, consumer demand for new-energy vehicles has not met expectations, with only 8,159 sold in 2011. Many consumers are deterred by high prices and concerns about technology reliability. The Chinese government offers incentives for new energy vehicles, but consumer demand is low due to high prices, technology concerns, limited model selection, and inadequate charging infrastructure. The State Council approved a plan to have half a million electric cars and plug-in hybrids on the road by 2015 and 5 million by 2020, with support for pilot programs, purchase incentives, research, recharging facilities, and battery recycling. Support from central and local governments, who favor local champions, poses a risk of research bias. The Chinese government's ambition to advance new-energy vehicles, particularly electric cars, faces challenges due to consumer reluctance and the risk of research duplication and market fragmentation. Significant government spending on luxury vehicle procurement, estimated at up to 200 billion yuan annually, further complicates efforts to leapfrog conventional engine technology and gain a competitive edge over the West. The Chinese government spends up to 200 billion yuan annually on vehicle purchases and maintenance. New rules issued in November 2011 require officials to buy fuel-efficient, small vehicles, including electric cars, to address concerns over rising fuel consumption and corruption. Despite urging agencies to buy domestic brands, foreign brands still dominate the official vehicle pool. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information issued a preliminary list for official fleet procurement, excluding foreign brands and limiting vehicle models to 412 made by Chinese automakers. This proposed list has caused concerns among foreign car companies, with the European Union Chamber of Commerce planning to assess the effects and discuss the issue with the Chinese government. The Chinese government's proposal to limit official fleet procurement to vehicles made by Chinese automakers has raised concerns among foreign car companies. China has become a net exporter of vehicles since 2005, with exports growing steadily. Domestic companies like Geely, Chery, and Great Wall account for the majority of vehicle exports, with independent domestic automakers making up over 70% of total exports. Chinese car exports are mainly done by domestic companies like Geely, Chery, and Great Wall, accounting for over 70% of total exports. Vehicles are exported to developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with unit prices ranging from $6,000 to $15,000. Some Chinese automakers have set up plants in overseas markets, such as Chery in Venezuela in 2011. Chinese car manufacturers like Chery and Great Wall have set up plants in various overseas markets. Chery opened a plant in Venezuela in 2011 and is reportedly building an assembly operation in Brazil. Great Wall has production facilities in multiple countries including Bulgaria, Senegal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Iran, Vietnam, and Egypt. In the U.S., entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin attempted to sell Chery-made vehicles through a dealer network called Visionary Vehicles, but the plan was postponed multiple times due to safety requirements. Bricklin eventually filed a lawsuit against Chery and ended their partnership. The Chinese domestic car producer BYD Auto Co. has faced delays in exporting to the U.S. and EU markets due to poor product quality and failure to meet safety and emissions requirements. Jiangling Motors Co. Ltd. received criticism in Europe for its Landwind X6 SUV's lack of safety features and poor handling. Brilliance Auto also had to halt its European export plans after one of its cars performed poorly in crash tests conducted by the German automobile club ADAC. Chinese automakers are investing in better vehicle safety, with some success. SAIC's MG6 and Geely's Emgrand EC7 received four-star ratings in crash tests by Euro NCAP. Honda is one of the leading foreign manufacturers exporting vehicles from China, with a joint venture in Guangzhou. Government regulations in China limit foreign ownership in auto assembly joint ventures, but exceptions have been made. In 2003, the Chinese government allowed Honda to own 65% of an assembly plant in Guangzhou for export purposes. This operation accounted for 25% of China's passenger car exports in 2005. GM's joint venture began exporting mini-commercial vehicles to South America, North Africa, and the Middle East in 2009. GM planned to build a new small car in China for export to the United States, facing opposition from some Members of Congress and the UAW. In May 2009, GM announced plans to invest in a new compact car assembly plant in the US, a concession to the UAW. The plant in Orion, MI, now produces the Chevrolet Sonic. China has had limited involvement in exporting motor vehicles to the US, mainly small trucks and vans for off-road use. In 2011, the US had a trade surplus with China in motor vehicles, exporting $5.3 billion and importing $9 million worth of vehicles. In 2011, the United States exported 136,222 units of new passenger vehicles and light trucks to China, the fourth-largest export market for U.S.-produced vehicles. U.S. imports of Chinese auto parts have rapidly expanded, reaching over $12 billion in 2011. The value of auto parts imported from China to the United States increased nearly six times from 2001 to 2011, making China the second-largest source of U.S. imports of auto parts. This has raised concerns among labor and trade activists. The auto parts industry in China is highly fragmented, with over 10,000 registered companies and 15,000 non-registered companies producing auto parts. Foreign companies make up 7 of the top 10 auto parts producers in China, with many leading global companies having manufacturing operations in the country. This presence of foreign companies, including American ones, has led to a sharp rise in U.S. auto parts imports from China. The auto parts industry in China is attractive to foreign companies due to factors like no ownership limits, increased tariffs on imported parts, production logistics, competitive labor costs, and a skilled labor force. This has led to a rise in U.S. auto parts imports from China. The U.S. auto industry has restructured, leading to more competitive labor costs. Rising costs and pressure for China to appreciate its currency may reduce the advantage of cheap Chinese labor. Labor unrest in China in 2010 and 2011 resulted in higher wages and improved work conditions for workers in factories of global corporations like Foxxconn, Toyota, Honda, and LG. Strikes led to pay raises of 20-30%, with minimum wages increasing by 22% nationwide between 2010 and 2011. The minimum wages in China rose by 22% between 2010 and 2011 due to labor unrest and the need to attract migrant workers. Shipping costs for vehicle manufacturers fluctuate with oil prices, impacting the cost of container shipments. Maintaining a trans-Pacific supply chain may not be cost-effective despite low labor costs. The proximity between car makers and suppliers is crucial for JIT inventory management. Initially, Chinese auto parts quality was below expectations, but it has improved significantly. GM's defect rate for parts in China decreased from 2,197 per million in 1999 to 23 per million in 2003. In 2003, GM's defect rate for parts in China significantly dropped to 23 per million. Shanghai and surrounding provinces are major auto parts manufacturing centers in China. Domestic manufacturers focus on lower-end products but are aiming to move up the value chain. Geely acquired an Australian company in 2009 to enhance its capabilities. Geely acquired an Australian company, Drivetran Systems, to improve gearbox development and advance technologically. BYD Auto Company and other independent producers are also enhancing automotive technologies, potentially becoming strong competitors to American companies. The Chinese Automotive Industrial Policy of 2004 eliminated many restrictions but still discouraged auto parts importation and promoted domestic technology use, raising concerns about vague statements and regulations. China's 2004 automotive policy required foreign-owned assemblers to operate through joint ventures with limited ownership. Despite reducing duties on imported cars, China established regulations favoring local content, potentially violating WTO commitments. China announced the elimination of additional charges on imported auto parts, effective September 1, 2009. The United States has raised concerns about intellectual property rights (IPR) in China, leading to two IPR-related cases before the WTO. China remained on the U.S. Trade Representative's \"Priority Watch\" list in 2012 for insufficient IPR enforcement. China's IPR issues include obstacles in protection and enforcement of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Concerns arise from China's policies linking government preferences to national origin of IPR, and using market access to compel foreign firms to license or sell IPR to Chinese entities. This has affected U.S. and foreign automotive manufacturers in China, as seen in GM's case against Chery over alleged design infringement. Chevrolet Spark, a minicar designed by GM's Korean subsidiary, GM Daewoo, faced a design patent issue in China. GM and Chery settled, with Chery agreeing not to use its name when marketing cars in the US due to similarities with Chevy. China's independent carmakers have been accused of copying foreign brands. It remains uncertain if Chinese automakers can succeed in international markets due to quality and intellectual property concerns. The Chinese government is pressuring foreign car manufacturers to develop local brands with their Chinese partners, sparking complaints from multinational companies. GM was reportedly under pressure to share core technology of its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid in exchange for subsidies. GM faced pressure to share core technology of its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid with a Chinese joint venture partner. This raised concerns about foreign companies doing business in China, despite Chinese officials denying allegations of technology transfer requirements. China's agreement with the US as a non-market economy allows for temporary restrictions on imported Chinese products causing market disruption. The United Steel Workers filed a petition with the US International Trade Commission claiming that low-priced imports of tires from China caused market disruption to domestic producers, resulting in the loss of over 5,000 US jobs. U.S. tire manufacturers did not support the case, while tire dealers feared a drop in demand when prices increased. In June 2009, the USITC determined that imports of tires from China caused market disruption. President Obama imposed increased tariffs over three years, lower than recommended by USITC. China requested WTO consultations and dispute settlement panel due to the tariffs. In September 2009, China initiated an investigation into imports from U.S. poultry products and auto parts companies, alleging unfair dumping and government subsidies. This was seen as retaliation for U.S. actions on Chinese tires. China also launched an antidumping and anti-subsidy investigation into U.S. vehicles in October 2009, claiming unfair subsidies for American auto makers. China accused U.S. auto makers of unfair subsidies, with GM, Chrysler, GMAC/Ally Financial, and Chrysler Financial receiving $80 billion in government support. In December 2011, China imposed antidumping and countervailing duties on U.S.-made sedans and SUVs with engines over 2.5 liters. These duties, on top of existing tariffs, range from 6.2% to 12.9% for GM and Chrysler, and 2% to 2.7% for non-U.S. automakers like BMW and Daimler. The antidumping duties imposed on U.S. and non-U.S. automakers range from 2% to 21.5% and are set to expire in two years. These duties are seen as symbolic and are unlikely to have a significant impact on American automakers due to limited automobile volume in dispute. Most foreign automakers already produce the majority of their cars sold in China locally. Ford stated that it would not be affected by the tariffs as it builds most of its Chinese vehicles in China. Members from industrial states are urging the Obama Administration to take action against surging imports of auto parts from China. They accuse China of unfairly subsidizing its auto parts makers and restricting exports of crucial raw materials. The coalition is preparing legal briefs to challenge Chinese subsidies for auto parts exporters and rules pressuring American automakers to transfer electric car technology.
