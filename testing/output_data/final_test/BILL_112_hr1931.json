Congress recognizes the importance of locally organized entities in leading cost-effective projects that improve the environment, economy, and quality of life. Community involvement in land use is crucial for economic success. Neglected vacant lands decrease property values and burden tax bases. Involving citizens in landscaping and maintenance reduces negative stigma, promotes civic pride, and deters vandalism and illicit activities. Transforming idle lands and brownfields through cleaning, landscaping, and tree planting adds economic value to communities by increasing occupancy rates and enhancing the appeal of nearby real estate. This initiative, exemplified by federally backed Groundwork USA Trusts for over 8 years, helps combat vandalism and illicit activities typically associated with neglected vacant lands.
