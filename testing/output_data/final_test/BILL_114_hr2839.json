    "content": "SECTION 1. DOMESTIC REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT REFORM AND MODERNIZATION. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"community-based organization,\" \"Director,\" and \"national resettlement agencies.\" The section also discusses the assessment of refugee domestic resettlement programs by the Comptroller General after the enactment of the Act. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the effectiveness of domestic refugee resettlement programs, focusing on defining self-sufficiency and integration, evaluating program effectiveness, and exploring technological solutions for tracking secondary migration. The study will focus on tracking secondary migration, interagency data sharing, ORR budget resources, community-based organizations' role in serving refugees, and recertification processes for high-skilled refugees. The Comptroller General will submit a report to Congress on the study results within 2 years of the Act's enactment. Section 412(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to ensure assistance is provided to secondary migrant refugees. The Director must submit an annual report to Congress on secondary migration, detailing states affected, reasons for migration, impact on hosting states, social services availability, and unmet needs of secondary migrants. Amendments to social services funding under the Act include considerations for the total number of eligible populations served, projections on incoming refugees, and other populations served by the Office in the subsequent fiscal year. The Director will issue a proposed rule for a new formula for grants and contracts allocation, and solicit public comment. The amendments made by this subsection will be effective in the first fiscal year after the enactment of the Act. The Director will expand the Office of Refugee Resettlement's data analysis, collection, and sharing. Refugee Resettlement's data analysis and sharing activities align with CDC, resettlement agencies, and state programs to track medical conditions of arriving refugees. The Director examines the information sharing process to improve mental health data access for placements. The Director will utilize refugee health screening data to determine placements and prepare for mental health needs. Data on housing needs will be collected in partnership with state refugee programs and community-based organizations. The Director will collect data on refugee housing needs, including the number at risk of homelessness. Longitudinal information on refugee self-sufficiency and employment status will be gathered for a 2-year period after their arrival in the United States. Annual updates will be provided to Congress. The Secretary of State will provide guidance on refugee placement decisions, including consultation with local stakeholders. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will collect and share best practices on stakeholder consultation. This section, except for certain amendments, will take effect 90 days after the enactment of the Act."
