They claim that Egypt's inadequate sealing of the border allows for smuggling of weaponry into Gaza, posing a threat to Israeli security. Israel has criticized Egypt's security presence along the \"Philadelphi Route\" for not effectively preventing the smuggling of advanced weaponry into Gaza. Israel claims smuggling tunnels from Egypt to Gaza are now used to ship anti-tank weapons, Katyusha rockets, and anti-aircraft missiles. Egypt denies the threat and accuses Israel of trying to sabotage U.S.-Egyptian relations by linking military aid to anti-smuggling efforts. The U.S. has taken concrete steps to address the smuggling network and tunnels from Egypt to Gaza by withholding Foreign Military Financing (FMF) from Egypt for the first time. The U.S. government plans to allocate $23 million towards advanced detection equipment for border security. The divided border city of Rafah, epicenter of smuggling for decades, was divided under the terms of the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon requested Egypt to keep Rafah whole to prevent terrorist infiltration and arms smuggling, but Egypt refused. Palestinian families constructed underground tunnels to foster communication between Gaza and Egypt. Residents of Rafah constructed underground tunnels to facilitate communication and economic activities with Egypt, including smuggling subsidized gasoline, U.S. dollars, drugs, gold, and weapons. Israeli officials became aware of the security risks posed by these tunnels during the first Palestinian intifadah in 1987. Israeli concerns heightened with the creation of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, fearing that militants were using the tunnels to smuggle weapons and fighters out of Gaza. During the violent Palestinian intifadah starting in September 2000, demand for weapons surged, leading to increased tunneling activity between Gaza and Egypt. Israeli, Egyptian, and Palestinian Authority forces seized numerous weapons and ammunition. Israel built a 25-foot wall along the border, used sonar to detect tunnels, and collapsed them with explosives. Despite efforts to curb smuggling, economic incentives remained high. Profits from smuggling arms into Gaza are substantial, with a Kalashnikov selling for $200 in Egypt but fetching $2,000 on the Gaza black market. A single night's delivery of 1,200 Kalashnikovs can yield over $2 million in profit. Bullets are even more lucrative, with a profit of $750,000 from a standard one-night delivery. Tunneling operations involve wealthy families in Rafah financing tunnel openings, which are then rented to gunrunners affiliated with Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah militias. The primary investors receive a percentage of every shipment passing through the tunnels. The tunnels in Rafah are used for smuggling arms and ammunition, reaching depths of 50-60 feet to avoid detection. The weapons are believed to come from Yemen, Sudan, Egypt, and Israel. Israeli military operations in Rafah faced criticism for causing civilian casualties and destruction of homes. During Operation Rainbow in 2004, Israel used armored bulldozers to destroy homes suspected of concealing tunnels. During Operation Rainbow in 2004, Israeli forces demolished homes suspected of hiding tunnels, resulting in Palestinian casualties. The operation aimed to create a buffer zone near the Philadelphi Route to protect Israeli soldiers and prevent tunneling. Plans for a deep moat were abandoned due to environmental concerns. After Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Egypt deployed border guards to secure the area. Egypt deployed 750 border guards to secure the Philadelphi Route, with restrictions on equipment and patrol area. Tension in Israeli-Egyptian relations increased due to Hamas's takeover of Gaza, leading to a rise in smuggling activity under the Gaza-Egypt border. The rise in smuggling activity under the Gaza-Egypt border was attributed to rising poverty rates among Gazans, the international aid boycott of the Palestinian Authority, and Israel's closure of the Gaza Strip. Israeli officials blamed Egypt for the increased tunnel traffic, with claims of smuggling advanced weaponry by Palestinian terrorist groups. Minister Ehud Olmert expressed concerns about the smuggling of advanced weapons, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, into Gaza. Israeli lawmaker Yuval Steinitz accused Egypt of allowing Hamas to obtain a significant amount of weapons, leading him to call for a freeze on U.S. military aid to Egypt. In November and December 2007, Israeli officials criticized Egypt for failing to secure the border with Gaza, accusing them of ignoring or even aiding smuggling activities. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni called Egypt's actions \"terrible\" and damaging to the peace process. Israeli Public Security Minister Avi Dichter suggested that Egypt could easily intercept smugglers before they reach the border. Egyptian leaders accused Israeli officials of using arms smuggling accusations to sabotage relations and criticized Foreign Minister Livni's comments. President Mubarak warned against ruining relations with Israel and suggested they handle the issue themselves. Egyptian officials accuse Israeli officials of using arms smuggling accusations to sabotage U.S.-Egyptian relations. Foreign Minister Aboul Gheit warned Israel against harming Egyptian interests, stating Egypt will respond. Egypt lacks resources and manpower to effectively patrol the Gaza/Sinai border, with a third of their 750-troop regiment off-duty at any time. Egypt accuses Israel of providing imprecise intelligence on smugglers and requests renegotiation of agreements to deploy more troops in Rafah. Israel suggests better use of existing troops but is in talks with Egypt for additional troop deployment in Sinai. Tensions eased after Defense Minister Barak's visit to Egypt, emphasizing the strategic importance of peace between the two countries. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert emphasized the importance of the peace agreement with Egypt and acknowledged ongoing dialogue despite differences. To address smuggling issues, the U.S. government sent officials to Egypt to assess the situation and recommended providing tunnel-detection equipment to improve Egypt's capabilities. Egypt is working to improve its tunnel detection capability with unmanned ground vehicles and acoustic sensors. Israel had previously proposed the construction of a canal along the border. The United States, Egypt, and Israel are considering establishing a trilateral security commission to address issues such as weapons smuggling and border control. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has offered technical assistance and training to Egypt. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has emphasized the need for Egypt to take action against tunnels, offering technical help. Israel is against the idea of a trilateral security commission. U.S. Representative Steve Israel visited Rafah, Egypt in 2008 and mentioned the importance of closing tunnels with Army Corps equipment and U.S. technical advice. The Rafah crossing is crucial for Palestinians to leave Gaza, and an agreement was brokered in 2005 for access through the terminal. Israel allowed the EU to monitor the crossing without a physical presence. Israel monitored the Rafah crossing using closed-circuit cameras and had the power to open and close it based on security assessments. The crossing was mostly closed after Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, with occasional openings facilitated by EUBAM efforts. Egypt allowed some Palestinians, including Hamas members, to pass through in January 2008. In January 2008, Egypt allowed 2,200 Palestinians, including Hamas leaders, to exit and reenter Gaza for the Haj pilgrimage. This decision was criticized by Israel and Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas. Earlier, Egypt had allowed Hamas members and militants to enter Gaza in exchange for a wanted Al Qaeda militant. Additionally, Israel and Egypt had permitted 500 Fatah loyalists to cross into Gaza from Egypt. After a week-long closure of Gaza by Israel, Hamas supporters breached the border fence, allowing thousands of Gazans to enter Egypt.

Additionally, Israel and Egypt had permitted 500 Fatah loyalists to cross into Gaza from Egypt. After a week-long closure of Gaza by Israel, Hamas supporters breached the border fence, allowing thousands of Gazans to enter Egypt. A breach in the fence on the Palestinian side of Rafah allowed around 200,000 Gazans to enter Egypt, planned by Hamas for over a month. Palestinians bought various goods in Egypt, while Israeli officials expressed concerns about Palestinian terrorists crossing the border. In the aftermath of Hamas breaching the Gaza-Egypt border, concerns arose about re-sealing the border. Despite reduced flow, thousands of Palestinians remained in Egypt with two border crossings open. Egypt deployed police in Sinai to prevent Palestinians from reaching Cairo. Israeli officials noted progress in sealing the border in Rafah, impacting smugglers' profits. The Egyptian government is working to restore the Palestinian Authority's presence along the border, but Hamas is reluctant to give up control. Israel believes a broader solution is needed to address the smuggling issue, as adding more Egyptian Border Policemen has not been effective. Smugglers are losing business due to the reduced flow across the border. Israel claims that advanced weapons are being smuggled into Gaza, including anti-tank weapons, Katyusha rockets, and shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles. Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad fired a Katyusha rocket into Israel with a range of 10.8 miles. Israeli intelligence warned in 2005 that PIJ had received Grad-series rockets smuggled from Egypt. There is no consensus on how these weapons are reaching Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza. Israel claims advanced weapons are smuggled into Gaza, including anti-tank weapons and rockets. Analysts disagree on the scale of smuggling, with Egypt under-reporting and Israel exaggerating the threat. Hamas's arsenal is less sophisticated than Hezbollah's, but Israeli officials see Hamas adopting similar military tactics. Hamas has organized like a conventional army, with a fixed chain of command and ambush teams. Israel and Egypt disagree on the size of Egypt's Border Guard Force. Egypt has requested Israel to allow an additional regiment of soldiers in Rafah to combat smuggling and border breaches. Israel questions Egypt's political will but is considering deploying more forces along the Egyptian Gaza border. Despite efforts, smuggling continues with tunnel openings remaining a challenge for Egypt to address. Egypt struggles to destroy tunnels on the Palestinian side, hindered by open tunnels. The recent U.S. pledge of $23 million may improve Egypt's tunnel destruction efforts. Egypt's Border Guard Force's rules on Palestinians crossing the border are ambiguous to avoid harming civilians. Egypt refrains from shooting Hamas members or civilians unless in self-defense, allowing Hamas to exploit the situation. Egypt faces a dilemma of being seen as co-jailer of Gaza Palestinians. The recent tensions over the Gaza border have raised concerns about the long-term repercussions for the Israeli-Egyptian relationship. While both sides are committed to upholding the Camp David agreement, disagreements over managing the Gaza border could strain relations and impact cooperation on critical issues like countering extremism and promoting peace. This dispute could also distract from ongoing peace negotiations. Israeli-Egyptian tensions over border security are likely to continue, with Hamas expressing a desire to see the border reopened and managed by the Palestinian Authority. This poses challenges for Egypt, which wants to keep Hamas isolated but not be solely responsible for failing to do so. As violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues, these issues will persist. Despite Hamas expressing a desire for the border to be reopened and managed by the Palestinian Authority, there is no indication that it is ready to renounce its goal of Israel's destruction, making peace in the Gaza-Egypt-Israeli region seem distant."
