    "content": "House staff data were developed based on an estimate of staff working in Member offices and a full count of staff listed in all non-Member congressional offices. The House has limited the number of full-time staff in a Member's office since 1975 to 18 permanent employees, with up to four part-time employees authorized in 1979. A random sample of 45 Member offices was drawn each year to represent the distribution of Member offices. A sample of 45 Member offices was drawn in proportion to the distribution of Member offices in the Cannon, Longworth, and Rayburn House office buildings in 2014. Staff telephone data from those offices were counted and assumed to be in Washington, DC, if listed as working in those buildings, and outside of Washington, DC, if not. The average number of staff working in Washington, DC, and in district offices was computed and multiplied by the number of Member offices to estimate the total staff employed in personal offices. Data tables provide averages and estimates for House Member staff working in Washington, DC, and district offices. Committee data are based on a full count of all telephone directory listings for House standing, special, and select committees. The data includes staff information for House standing, special, and select committees, as well as associate staff for specific committees. Data tables show staff levels for various House committees, including leadership offices such as Speaker, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, and others. Joint committee staff data from the 114th Congress are also available. The House data includes staff information for various committees, officers, and officials, as well as commissions. This includes staff working for House officers like the Clerk, Sergeant at Arms, and Chief Administrative Officer, as well as officials in different offices. Commissions data includes staff working for entities like the Franking Commission and the Helsinki Commission. The House staff levels have shown slight but steady growth over the years, with fluctuations in numbers between 1977 and 2016. The number of House staff grew from 8,831 to 9,420, with peaks and declines in staffing levels. The growth has been characterized by two periods of increase separated by a brief decline, ending with another decrease in staff numbers.

Since 1977, House committee staff levels have fluctuated, with a significant decline of 31.36% by 2016. The staff levels experienced a moderate decline in 1977-1981, followed by steady growth until 1992, a sharp decline in 1992-1997, and slow growth from 1997 to 2010. However, there was another sharp decline from 2010 to the present. In 2016, there were 593 fewer staff compared to 1977 levels and 935 fewer staff compared to the peak in 1992. Committee staff also comprised a decreasing proportion of House staff, falling from 21.41% in 1977 to 13.78% in 2016. The number of staff in House leadership offices grew steadily from 62 in 1977 to 239 in 2016, peaking at 241 in 2011. Staff working in the offices of House officers and officials increased by 254.98% since 1977. Staff levels in House leadership offices grew steadily from 1977 to 1991, with a one-year drop in 1992 followed by increases in 1994 and 1995. Levels peaked at 1,056 in 2008 before falling to 962 by 2016. The number of staff in House leadership offices grew steadily from 62 in 1977 to 239 in 2016, peaking at 241 in 2011.
