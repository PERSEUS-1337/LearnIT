    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Constantine Menges Ukraine Democracy and Fair Elections Act of 2004\". Congress finds that the United States supports democracy, free elections, and human rights in Ukraine, which has not met international standards in recent elections. Independent journalists in Ukraine who supported democracy and published critical reports concerning governmental actions have been murdered or disappeared. Former government officials have alleged that current government officials were involved in these disappearances. The current Government of Ukraine, led by President Leonid D. Kuchma and Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, systematically harasses and represses independent media, trade unions, and journalists, suppresses freedom of speech, and encourages a blackout on national television stations of the main democratic opposition candidate. The opposition candidate faces obstacles such as police blocking transit, denial of access to airports and government-owned venues, and postal service interference in campaign activities. President Kuchma and Prime Minister Yanukovych claim the upcoming election will be free and fair despite these actions. The presidential election of October 1999, the national referendum of 2000, the parliamentary election of March 2002, and recent by-elections were deemed unfair by OSCE and other observers due to significant misconduct approved by the government, including harassment and disqualification of opposition candidates. The unfair practices in recent elections included police arresting and beating Parliament members acting as election observers, denying opposition candidates access to state-controlled media, seizing property of independent organizations, and implementing opaque voting procedures. Dr. Constantine Menges, a senior official on the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan, was known for his anti-Communist stance and support for Ukrainian independence. SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY. Congress expresses support for democracy, free elections, human rights, and the integration of Ukraine into the European community. It also condemns the murders and disappearances of journalists in Ukraine and calls for an end to persecution of political opponents and harassment of individuals exercising their rights. Calls upon President Kuchma and Prime Minister Yanukovych to end violations of OSCE commitments and respect freedoms of speech, assembly, and association. Calls for resolution of political crisis in Ukraine through a free and fair presidential election in 2004, access to state media for opposition, postal services, and public gathering spaces. The curr_chunk highlights the need for public auditoriums and meeting spaces for voters, unimpeded transit for opposition candidates, electoral code modifications in line with OSCE commitments, and freedom for international observers to monitor elections. The sense of Congress is for the President to work with other countries, especially European ones, to create a comprehensive strategy for Ukraine. This includes urging other countries to take similar actions as outlined in the Act. Sanctions are also mentioned against the government of Ukraine. Until the President certifies that Ukraine has met specified requirements, sanctions will be imposed immediately. The certification includes free and fair elections and the cessation of harassment and repression in Ukraine. Sanctions will be imposed on Ukraine until specified requirements are met, including the cessation of harassment and repression against media, trade unions, NGOs, religious organizations, and the political opposition. This includes withdrawing politically motivated legal charges against opposition figures and journalists. Sanctions involve denying entry to the US for senior government officials and seizing their assets in the US. The President will direct the seizure of personal assets or financial accounts in the United States obtained through improper means by senior government officials in Ukraine or their spouses, children, or agents. Additionally, there will be prohibitions on loans and investments provided by any US agency after the enactment of this Act. The President will direct the seizure of assets obtained improperly by Ukrainian officials in the US. US agencies are prohibited from providing loans or investments to Ukraine. The President may waive restrictions on loans to Ukraine if it is in the national security interest and a new president corrects election irregularities. The President can waive restrictions on loans to Ukraine if it is in the national security interest and a new president corrects election irregularities. If the waiver is used, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for it. SEC. 6. REPORTS.

If any assets were acquired through illicit means, the US will investigate and take appropriate actions. The President must report to Congress annually on Ukrainian officials' assets and bank accounts abroad. If acquired illicitly, the US will investigate and take action. Additionally, the report must detail weapons sales from Ukraine to countries supporting terrorism, including the goods received in exchange. The report on Ukrainian officials' assets and bank accounts abroad must be in unclassified form but may include a classified annex. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate. \"Senior government official\" in Ukraine includes various high-ranking positions such as the president, prime minister, government ministers, members of Parliament, and heads of security and tax services.
