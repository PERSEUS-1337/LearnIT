    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Syria Accountability Act of 2002\". Congress finds that President George Bush declared that nations must choose to support either the US or terrorists, and UN Resolution 1373 requires states to prevent support for terrorist acts. The Government of Syria is prohibited from receiving US assistance due to being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. Syria provides support to various terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas, operating in Lebanon and on Syrian territory. United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for the strict respect of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity, urging the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon. Over 20,000 Syrian troops occupy Lebanese territory, exerting undue influence and undermining its political independence. Multiple bills and resolutions have been passed by the US Congress since 1990, calling for the removal of Syrian forces from Lebanon. Large numbers of Lebanese people are calling for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon. Israel has already withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in compliance with UN Resolution 425. Despite this, Syria allows attacks on Israeli outposts by militant groups like Hizballah at Shebaa Farms, claiming it as Lebanese land. Syria prevents Lebanon from deploying troops to southern Lebanon, allowing Hizballah to control the Israeli-Lebanese border. The United States provides $40,000,000 in aid to Lebanon, with $7,900,000 going to Lebanese-American educational institutions. President Bush pledges to support Lebanon in the State of the Union address. President Bush declared that the United States will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction. The Government of Syria is developing and deploying ballistic missiles, pursuing the production of biological and chemical weapons, and receiving oil from Iraq in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Syrian President Bashar Assad promised to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661 in February 2001, but this pledge remains unfulfilled. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes that Syria must cease support for terrorism, declare renunciation of terrorism, and close terrorist offices. Additionally, Syria should withdraw armed forces from Lebanon, while Lebanon should deploy its own armed forces in accordance with UN resolutions. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for asserting Lebanese sovereignty over all territory, removing terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Syria should cease ballistic missile development, halt biological and chemical weapons production, stop illegal oil imports, and comply with UN resolutions. Lebanon and Syria should engage in unconditional bilateral negotiations. The United States should engage in serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with Israel for a full and permanent peace. The US should provide humanitarian and educational assistance to Lebanon through private and international organizations until Lebanon asserts sovereignty and achieves full independence as per UN Security Council Resolution 520. SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States should engage in serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with Israel for a full and permanent peace. The United States policy towards Syria includes holding them responsible for attacks by terrorist groups, denying support for terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and listing Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism until they end their support for terrorist groups. Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) emphasizes the importance of Lebanon's sovereignty and independence, condemns Syria's occupation of Lebanese territory, and highlights the threat posed by Syria's weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. The United States will not provide assistance to Syria or support multilateral aid until Syria withdraws from Lebanon, stops developing weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, and complies with relevant UN resolutions. The United States will impose sanctions on Syria until it withdraws from Lebanon, halts weapons of mass destruction development, and complies with UN resolutions. Sanctions will be imposed on Syria until it meets specified requirements, including prohibiting exports and US government assistance to businesses in Syria. Sanctions imposed on Syria include prohibiting US exports (excluding food and medicine), restricting US businesses from investing in Syria, limiting Syrian diplomats' travel in the US, and reducing diplomatic contacts with Syria. The United States may block transactions involving property in which the Government of Syria has an interest. The President can waive certain sanctions if it is in the national security interest. A certification must be made that Syria does not support international terrorist groups. The Government of Syria has met certain conditions, including withdrawing military personnel from Lebanon, ceasing the development of ballistic missiles and weapons, and complying with UN resolutions. The Government of Syria has met conditions such as withdrawing military personnel from Lebanon, ceasing ballistic missile development, and complying with UN resolutions. SEC. 6. REPORT. The Secretary of State must submit a report every 12 months on Syria's progress towards meeting specified conditions and any connections between terrorists and attacks on the United States. The Secretary of State must submit an unclassified report every 12 months on Syria's progress towards meeting conditions, which may include a classified annex. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" in this Act refers to the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate."
