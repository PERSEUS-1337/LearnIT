    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 66406.7 of the Education Code is amended to establish the College Textbook Transparency Act, defining terms like \"adopter\" and \"complimentary copies\" for faculty members and academic departments selecting course materials for higher education institutions. The College Textbook Transparency Act defines terms like \"instructor copies\" and \"new edition of textbook\" for faculty members selecting course materials. \"Instructor copies\" are exclusive for teachers and contain answers, while a \"new edition of textbook\" is a subsequent version of a standard textbook published by a specific publisher. The College Textbook Transparency Act encourages adopters to consider cost when selecting textbooks. Publishers must provide transparency in the adoption process and respond promptly to requests for information on textbook cost and content. Starting January 1, 2010, publishers must include specific information on textbook covers or within the book itself. Starting January 1, 2010, publishers of textbooks for postsecondary education must provide a summary of content differences for new editions, the copyright date of the previous edition, and respond to adopters' requests for product lists, prices, and prior edition copyright dates. Additionally, instructor copies must be clearly marked as not for resale. Starting January 1, 2010, textbook publishers must provide a list of content differences between new and previous editions, along with the copyright date of the prior edition. Campus bookstores must disclose their pricing policies for new and used textbooks. Each public postsecondary educational institution should encourage timely ordering of course materials to ensure availability. Faculty retains authority over textbook selection decisions. Adopters cannot receive anything of value for selecting specific course materials, except for complimentary copies or review materials. Royalties or compensation from sales of course materials containing the instructor's work are subject to employer policies. Honoraria for academic peer review and training in course materials are also subject to employer policies on conflicts of interest and compensation. The section prohibits the sale or trade of instructor copies or complimentary teacher editions of textbooks by publishers or campus bookstores. Self-published textbooks by instructors for their classes are exempt if disclosed to their employer institution. Section 66407.3 of the Education Code requires faculty members in California universities and colleges to disclose their income from publishers, periodicals, or online content providers annually by April 15th. This disclosure includes royalties, advances, consulting fees, or any other income received in the previous calendar year. Faculty members must submit this information even if they had no income to report, and the form must be filed under penalty of perjury. Faculty members in California universities and colleges must disclose their income annually by April 15th, which includes royalties, advances, and consulting fees. The information provided by faculty members must be available on the institution's website for as long as they are employed. Failure to disclose income may result in an administrative fine of up to 25% of unreported income or $5,000. The administrative fines for faculty members who fail to disclose their income can be up to 25% of unreported income or $5,000. The fines collected will be deposited into the California State University Faculty Royalty Disclosure Fund for allocation towards general educational purposes at the faculty member's campus. The governing board of a community college district can use administrative fines for educational purposes at the faculty member's campus. The regents are asked to allocate fines similarly. If the act incurs state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes. However, if the Commission on State Mandates finds other mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
