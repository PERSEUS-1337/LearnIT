The order, based on a national emergency declaration, has been criticized for its broad language potentially affecting third parties, including U.S. citizens unknowingly supporting the insurgency. The President invoked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. President Bush issued Executive Order 13438 on July 17, 2007, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), blocking financial transactions and property controls for individuals or entities threatening stabilization efforts in Iraq. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers economic sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted countries, terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and those involved in weapons proliferation. OFAC has regulations for sanctions in various regions and activities. On September 13, 2010, OFAC issued regulations implementing Executive Order 13438 to address issues in Iraq, including diamond trading, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, narcotics trafficking, weapons of mass destruction proliferation, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, terrorists, and Zimbabwe. The regulations specify that blocking orders for sanctioned persons are effective upon notice of property being blocked, rather than upon publication in the Federal Register. Persons whose interests have been blocked may challenge the blocking orders in two ways: by claiming \"mistaken identity\" or seeking administrative review as a Specially Designated Terrorist. A list of designees added to OFAC's Special Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List under Executive Order 13438 was issued by Treasury on January 9, 2008. On January 9, 2008, the Treasury announced the designation of individuals including Ahmed Fruzandeh, a Brigadier General leading terrorist operations, along with Iran-based and Syria-based Iraqi nationals, and Al-Zawra Television Station. On September 23, 2008, five new individuals and two entities were added to the list under Executive Order 13438, including Iranian, Iraqi, and Syrian nationals. On July 16, 2009, OFAC announced the designation of two broadcasters in Syria: Al-Ra'y Satellite Television Channel and Suraqiya for Media and Broadcasting. On January 5, 2010, Jaysh Rijal Al-Tariq Al-Naqshabandi was added to the list of blocked entities. On January 10, 2012, Dr. Safa Al Habobi was removed from the list of blocked persons. OFAC removed Dr. Safa Al Habobi from the list of blocked persons in the United Kingdom. Additionally, several entities and individuals from Jordan and Italy were also removed from the list. The authority for these actions was cited as IEEPA. The July 17, 2007 executive order in the United Kingdom cites IEEPA as its authority, granting the President broad powers to impose economic embargoes on transactions and property involving foreign nations or persons. This includes regulating foreign exchange transactions, credit transfers, and importing/exporting currency or securities. The Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 grants the President authority to regulate transactions involving enemy countries during war, and was used in peacetime in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to close banks during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) in response to a national banking emergency, closing banks and interfering with financial transactions. Congress ratified this action and extended emergency powers to cover wartime and other national emergencies. TWEA was later used to block assets of Norway, Denmark, and eventually Axis enemies of the United States. A 1940 amendment expanded presidential power under TWEA. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was expanded in 1940 to authorize asset freezes and cover financial transactions involving any foreign state or national. A 1941 amendment added the power to seize and vest title to property of foreign entities, including those masquerading as innocent fronts. The Supreme Court upheld the seizure of property of non-enemy aliens in wartime and the authority to vest assets of enemy entities, making them unavailable to U.S. creditors. The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) was expanded in 1940 to authorize asset freezes and cover financial transactions involving any foreign state or national. A 1941 amendment added the power to seize and vest title to property of foreign entities, including those masquerading as innocent fronts. The Supreme Court upheld the seizure of property of non-enemy aliens in wartime and the authority to vest assets of an enemy (Austrian) entity, making them unavailable to U.S. creditors. In the 1970s, congressional concern with overseeing presidential emergency power led to the enactment of the National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA) and IEEPA in 1977, setting procedures for declaring and terminating national emergencies. IEEPA was enacted in response to the expanding use of emergency power by Presidents, aiming to revise and limit the President's authority in regulating international economic transactions during wars or national emergencies. It was a direct response to Presidents using emergency authority under TWEA to regulate economic transactions unrelated to declared emergencies. The enactment of IEEPA changed the termination of national emergencies, imposing reporting requirements on the President. IEEPA was enacted to limit the President's authority in regulating international economic transactions during wars or national emergencies. It distinguishes between peacetime and wartime powers, allowing the President to impose economic sanctions in peacetime emergencies originating abroad. The President must declare a national emergency for these powers to be used. IEEPA grants the President broad powers to impose controls on economic transactions involving transfers abroad and foreign property during a national emergency originating outside the United States. This includes regulating foreign exchange transactions, transfers of credit or payments, and import/export of currency or securities. The President can also investigate, block, regulate, direct, compel, nullify, void, prevent, or prohibit any acquisition or holding of property subject to US jurisdiction. IEEPA grants the President broad powers to regulate economic transactions involving foreign property during a national emergency. It allows for investigation, blocking, and control of property subject to US jurisdiction. The act does not cover international communications or informational materials, except for humanitarian aid which may be restricted under certain circumstances. The USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 expanded the President's authority under IEEPA to confiscate property of foreign entities involved in armed hostilities or attacks against the US. The first use of this power occurred in 2003 when President Bush ordered the blocking and confiscation of Iraqi government property to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq. The USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 expanded the President's authority under IEEPA to confiscate property of foreign entities involved in armed hostilities or attacks against the US. In 2003, President Bush ordered further blocking and confiscation of property of former Iraqi officials and their families, with the title vested in the Department of the Treasury to be transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq for humanitarian needs, economic reconstruction, disarmament, civilian administration, and other purposes benefiting the Iraqi people. Unlike TWEA, IEEPA appears to withhold certain powers from the President. IEEPA grants the President broad power to regulate foreign transactions and property, even if they involve only US parties. Constitutional challenges to IEEPA regulations have generally failed, with controls on foreign assets upheld. Blocked assets of US persons can still be subject to freeze orders under IEEPA if there is an \"interest\" of a foreign country or national. The executive order declaring a national emergency allows for freeze orders on assets intended for humanitarian aid without the need for notice or a pre-seizure hearing. Challenges on First Amendment grounds have been unsuccessful, with the Supreme Court upholding Presidential authority under IEEPA. The executive order does not specify individuals whose property is to be blocked or frozen. The executive order allows for freeze orders on assets without notice or a hearing, determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense. Individuals or entities falling into three categories are targeted for committing acts of violence threatening Iraq's peace or stability, undermining reconstruction efforts, or providing support for such acts. The executive order prohibits transactions with persons whose property is blocked, including contributions or provision of funds, goods, or services. It also covers attempts to evade the order's prohibitions and conspiracies to violate it. The executive order prohibits transactions with blocked persons, including contributions or provision of funds, goods, or services, and covers attempts to evade the prohibitions and conspiracies to violate it. The President made findings regarding aid and humanitarian assistance, and no prior notice is required for those with property to be blocked. Molly Millerwise, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, stated that the order aims to motivate foreign financial institutions to comply voluntarily. The executive order aims to supplement current sanctions programs by targeting insurgent groups in Iraq, including Shia militia groups linked with Iran, Sunni insurgent groups in Syria, and indigenous Iraqi insurgent groups. It will block assets of U.S. residents aiding these groups and maintain a public list of entities and individuals covered by the order. The order prohibits transactions with blocked persons and aims to encourage foreign financial institutions to comply voluntarily. The executive order, not defining \"property\" or \"interests in property,\" covers five categories of individuals or entities involved in destabilizing Iraq. It prohibits transactions by U.S. persons with those supporting violence in Iraq. The executive order prohibits transactions by U.S. persons that evade its prohibitions, leaving the designation of specific individuals and entities to the Secretary of the Treasury. Designees added to OFAC's list have their assets frozen, with blocking orders possible before listing. The executive order allows for blocking orders to be issued before individuals are listed by OFAC for sanctions. Regulations were issued on September 2, 2010, with broad definitions of \"property\" and \"transfer\" to block property transfers. There is an exception for property controlled by U.S. military forces and coalition partners in Iraq. The regulations issued under Executive Order 13438 give operational control to the commander of the United States Central Command. They include extensive bans on trade and financial transactions, specify types of legal services allowed under general license, and outline penalties for violations under IEEPA. Civil penalties for violations are defined as the greater of $250,000 or twice the transaction amount, while criminal penalties are $1 million and 20 years' imprisonment. The regulations under Executive Order 13438 outline penalties for violations under IEEPA, including civil penalties of $250,000 or twice the transaction amount, and criminal penalties of $1 million and 20 years' imprisonment. The regulations do not limit potential targets to \"foreign\" persons, and the list of blocked persons currently includes no U.S. person. The focus of the executive order was initially on foreigners, particularly terrorist groups linked with Iran, Syria, and Iraq. The regulations under Executive Order 13438 outline penalties for violations under IEEPA, including civil penalties of $250,000 or twice the transaction amount, and criminal penalties of $1 million and 20 years' imprisonment. The focus of the executive order was initially on foreigners, particularly terrorist groups linked with Iran, Syria, and Iraq. The preponderance of designees on OFAC's lists has led to blocking orders, seizures, and penalties against U.S. persons based on allegations of possessing property of a designated person or conducting prohibited transactions. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on U.S. persons inadvertently involved in assisting blocked entities under the executive order. The executive order designates individuals and entities, blocking their assets regardless of any connection to the blocked entity or foreign entity. Questions arise regarding the extent to which lawyers and donors to U.S. charities are subject to the order. Clarifications are provided in the licensing sections of the regulations, such as blocking charitable contributions for blocked persons unless authorized. The Global Terrorist Sanctions Program implements Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, declaring a national emergency with respect to terrorism committed by foreign terrorists. OFAC blocks assets of designated individuals and entities, with licensing sections clarifying restrictions on legal services and charitable contributions. Under the Global Terrorism Regulations, U.S. financial institutions must take precautions to avoid prohibited transactions involving individuals listed on OFAC's terrorist lists. The regulations specify procedures for compliance, nullification of property transfers made in violation, reporting requirements, and penalties. Executive Order 13438 is similar to Executive Order 13219, which authorizes property and transaction controls for persons threatening international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans. The Executive Order authorizes property and transaction controls for individuals posing a significant risk of committing acts of violence in the Western Balkans region. It also covers those obstructing international agreements related to Macedonia, Kosovo, or the Dayton Accords. OFAC issued a general license on July 9, 2003, allowing U.S. persons to provide legal services for persons with blocked property in cases before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The potential impact of OFAC regulations on attorney-client relationships has been a focus of litigation and commentary. The one federal case addressing this issue is American Airways Charters, Inc. v. Regan. The case of American Airways Charters, Inc. v. Regan held that OFAC could require a license for legal fees from blocked assets but not to prevent the formation of an attorney-client relationship without government approval. The court's analysis focused on whether denying legal counsel furthered the purpose of denying an enemy nation access to economic resources under TWEA. The opinion suggested that preventing a designated person from consulting an attorney could raise due process concerns. Despite the American Airways ruling, OFAC's regulations still include bans on providing legal services. Recent regulations differ in purpose and scope, particularly the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations post-9/11, which focus on individuals and entities under IEEPA authority. The question of whether OFAC's reach extends to forming lawyer-client relationships with blocked persons remains unanswered until a proper case is presented. The Iraq regulations, similar to other OFAC regulations, prohibit the provision of legal services to designated persons or blocked entities without a specific license. Reimbursement for legal services requires application to OFAC for a specific license, following the framework of the Global Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. Under 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 594.506, five types of legal services are authorized for persons with blocked property, with all payments requiring a specific license. Other legal services must also be specifically licensed, including legal advice, representation in domestic legal proceedings, and initiation of legal actions within the U.S. The general license allows for legal services in defense of property interests subject to U.S. jurisdiction, representation before federal or state agencies regarding U.S. sanctions, and provision of legal services required by prevailing U.S. law. However, the descriptions of permitted legal services have been criticized as ambiguous and narrow, leading to potential liability for lawyers. OFAC's list is constantly growing with names added frequently, requiring lawyers to secure a specific license to provide legal services to clients involved in transactions with designated persons or entities. The Iraq regulations outline procedures for imposing and challenging penalties under TWEA and IEEPA, including explicit rights for response, extensions, representation, and judicial review. The TWEA sanctions provide explicit rights such as receiving a prepenalty notice, responding in writing, requesting a hearing before an administrative law judge, and the opportunity to file proposed findings and conclusions of law. OFAC regulations also include procedures for enforcement, including Risk Matrices for banking institutions to evaluate compliance programs. The curr_chunk discusses enforcement procedures and civil enforcement tools that OFAC may use against banking institutions for sanctions violations. It also mentions coordination with banking regulators and factors considered by OFAC in enforcement actions. OFAC may impose civil penalties on banking institutions for sanctions violations based on various factors, including compliance history, size of violations, voluntary disclosure, corrective actions, and deterrent effect. Challenges to OFAC designations are generally unsuccessful, but there is a case where a federal court found an OFAC blocking order against a charitable organization to be unlawful. OFAC regulations allow for administrative appeals of designations, unblocking of funds for mistaken identity, and removal of names from designated persons lists. Information released by OFAC includes public information under FOIA, Privacy Act-required information, OFAC forms, and details on civil penalties. Website must disclose civil penalties imposed, including entity name and address. OFAC regulations allow for administrative appeals, unblocking of funds for mistaken identity, and removal of names from designated persons lists. Information released by OFAC includes public details on civil penalties imposed, including entity name and address. Names of individuals may not be disclosed, and challenges to designations may involve classified evidence presented ex parte and in camera. A person can challenge a blocked funds order if they believe there is mistaken identity by submitting a written request to OFAC with specific information. OFAC's regulations allow for unblocking funds due to mistaken identity or reconsidering a designation. Those named on terrorist lists can challenge the designation by presenting arguments to OFAC's director for review. The review process is not specified in the regulations. The regulations do not specify the review process for challenging OFAC designations. To succeed in a federal court challenge, the plaintiff must prove the designation is arbitrary and capricious. Mistaken identity cases can request funds release by providing specific information to OFAC. OFAC may require more documentation from applicants who believe their transactions were blocked due to mistaken identity. Instances show that names can be removed from OFAC lists if a mistake is proven. OFAC's anti-terrorism sanctions have blocked nearly $20 million in terrorist assets. As of December 31, 2009, OFAC blocked nearly $20 million in terrorist assets, with over $11.2 million belonging to Al Qaeda. The impact of economic sanctions goes beyond the frozen assets, as international cooperation is inspired and banks worldwide consult OFAC's terrorist lists to prevent prohibited transactions."
