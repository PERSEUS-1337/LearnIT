In FY2013, cash assistance accounted for only 28% of TANF funds, with the rest funding activities to alleviate child poverty. TANF also includes competitive grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. This report offers an overview of TANF, covering its history, financing, cash welfare programs, and other initiatives. The TANF block grant, created in the 1996 welfare reform law, replaced the AFDC cash assistance program. It provides grants for various benefits and services to address economic disadvantage, including cash assistance programs for low-income families with children. The TANF funds are used for activities to alleviate child poverty, including competitive grants for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives. The Social Security Act of 1935 created the Aid to Dependent Children program to provide cash assistance to needy families with children, initially benefiting widows or families with disabled fathers. Over time, the program evolved to include survivors benefits and aid to families where the father was absent. In 1950, amendments to the Aid to Dependent Children program authorized benefits for caretakers. By 1956, the program aimed to promote \"self sufficiency\" and strengthen family life, with funding for services to achieve these goals. In 1962, the program was renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). Concerns arose that cash assistance was a disincentive to work, especially for nonworking parents, as more women entered the workforce. Studies confirmed that cash assistance discouraged work, leading to restrictions on benefits for single-parent families. The trend of increasing children in single-parent families was influenced by the rise of single-parent families, particularly those headed by mothers. Research on the impact of assistance on family structure, like AFDC, was inconclusive. Cash benefits for two-parent families were available starting in 1961, but it wasn't until the Family Support Act of 1988 that states were required to provide benefits for such families, albeit on more restrictive terms. Two-parent families never made up a significant portion of the cash assistance caseload. The 1980s also saw a focus on \"welfare dependency,\" with research showing that while some single mothers received assistance for a short period, others remained on the rolls for longer. The Family Support Act of 1988 established the Job Opportunity and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program to move families off welfare rolls and into employment. States also began designing their own cash assistance programs and requirements for recipients. The 1996 welfare law abolished AFDC and consolidated funding into the TANF block grant, which involves federal and state monies. TANF funding is a fixed amount not adjusted for state circumstances. Federal grants go to states, with additional competitive grants for marriage and fatherhood programs. The bulk of funding is a $16.5 billion block grant for states, territories, and tribes. State entitlements are based on historical expenditures from the 1990s and have not been adjusted for inflation or changes in circumstances. States receiving TANF funding must meet maintenance of effort requirements, spending a minimum amount annually from their own funds. This requirement is based on historical expenditures from AFDC programs. In addition to state grants, $150 million is allocated for competitive grants to community-based organizations for marriage and fatherhood initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses funding of $150 million for healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood initiatives, including education, training, employment services, and media campaigns. States can use TANF funds to achieve goals such as assisting needy families and promoting job preparation, work, and marriage. The curr_chunk discusses the flexibility of TANF funds for various activities, including preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and promoting two-parent families. States have diverse programs funded by TANF and state MOE funds, with 28% used for basic assistance. TANF is often associated with cash assistance for needy families. The TANF program provides cash assistance to needy families, but it is broader than just cash assistance. There is variation in benefits among states, with benefits representing only a fraction of poverty-level income. Figure 2 shows the maximum cash assistance benefit by state for July 2012. In July 2012, TANF maximum benefits varied greatly by state, with Alaska offering the highest benefit of $923 per month for a family of three, while Mississippi had the lowest benefit of $170 per month. There is a regional pattern to benefit amounts, with states in the Northeast generally offering higher benefits than states in the South. TANF cash benefits have declined over time in real terms due to inflation, with states making ad hoc adjustments that fail to keep pace. Families receiving TANF cash assistance also benefit from SNAP, Medicaid, housing subsidies, EITC, and child credit. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program aims to increase state flexibility in achieving its goals, with states having broad discretion in designing cash assistance programs. While there are no federal rules on benefit size or income eligibility, states must meet work participation standards for a percentage of the caseload. The TANF program allows states to set participation rules for cash assistance recipients, with a time limit of 60 months for federal funds. States can use state funds to extend assistance beyond 60 months or impose shorter time limits. Recipients must assign child support to the state. States may pass along collected child support to the family, as long as it does not affect their eligibility for TANF cash assistance. In December 2013, the cash assistance caseload was at 1.7 million families, a significant decrease from the peak in March 1994. Figure 3 illustrates the historical trend of needy families receiving cash assistance from July 1959 to December 2013. The national economy's impact on cash assistance caseload trends is not strictly counter-cyclical. Factors like demographic trends and policy changes also influence caseload. Two sustained increases occurred from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s and from 1988 to 1994, peaking at 5.1 million families in March 1994. After the 1996 welfare reform law, caseloads fell rapidly in the late 1990s, leveling off in 2001. Another decline began in 2004, albeit slower than in the late 1990s. During the 2007-2009 recession, the cash assistance caseload rose from its post-welfare reform low in August 2008, peaking in December 2010 at close to 2 million families. By December 2013, the caseload had declined to approximately 1.7 million families, with an increasing share of \"child-only\" cases. The cash assistance caseload rose during the 2007-2009 recession, peaking in December 2010 at close to 2 million families. By December 2013, the caseload had declined to approximately 1.7 million families, with an increasing share of \"child-only\" cases. This represented families in various situations, such as nonparent relatives caring for children without legal financial responsibility, families with disabled parents receiving SSI, and families with ineligible noncitizen adults but eligible children. Additionally, there was an increase in families with a working recipient parent. The fixed funding of TANF, combined with the decline in the cash welfare caseload, provided states with new funds to address the broad purposes of TANF. In FY2013, federal TANF and state MOE funds were used for various activities beyond traditional cash assistance, including subsidized child care, refundable tax credits, subsidized employment programs, post-secondary educational programs, economic aid for families, programs addressing child abuse and neglect, and early child development programs. Funds from TANF are used for programs addressing child abuse and neglect, early child development programs, and providing benefits to disadvantaged families with children. These services often reach families with incomes above the cash assistance cutoff, extending to those up to 200% of the poverty line. TANF is a flexible funding stream used for a variety of benefits and services beyond cash assistance programs. Limited information is available on the populations served and specific activities funded by TANF. HHS has revised the financial reporting system to provide more detail on TANF expenditures. State cash assistance programs, including TANF, allocate funds for various activities beyond traditional cash assistance, such as child care, tax credits for low-income families, early childhood education, and services for child abuse and neglect. Less than half of TANF recipients are unemployed adults, shifting the focus from welfare to work. TANF addresses root causes of disadvantage among families with children."
