    "content": "The Act titled \"Estate Tax Reform Act of 2001\" increases the unified credit against estate and gift taxes. The \"Estate Tax Reform Act of 2001\" amends the applicable credit amount for estate tax purposes, defining it as the tentative tax based on the applicable exclusion amount. The decedent's exclusion amount is a key component in determining the applicable exclusion amount. The decedent's exclusion amount is determined according to a table in paragraph (2)(A). The exclusion amount for estates of decedents varies based on the year of death, starting at $1,000,000 in 2002 and increasing to $2,000,000 in 2006 and beyond. Unused spousal exclusion amounts are also considered for decedents whose spouse passed away after December 31, 2001. The amendment made by this section applies to estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2001. SEC. 3. INCREASE IN QUALIFIED FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS INTEREST DEDUCTION AMOUNT. The deduction allowed by this section shall not exceed the sum of the decedent's deduction amount and, in certain cases, the unused spousal deduction amount. The decedent's deduction amount is determined based on a specific table. The deduction amount for estates of decedents dying in 2002 is $875,000, increasing to $3,375,000 for those dying in 2006 or later. If a decedent's spouse died after 2001 and met certain requirements, the unused spousal deduction amount can be applied. The deduction amount for a decedent is determined by subtracting the allowable deduction amount for the estate of their predeceased spouse from the deduction amount for the decedent's own estate. Section 2057 is amended to replace specific amounts with the term \"decedent's deduction amount.\" This amendment applies to estates of decedents passing away after December 31, 2001."
