    "content": "SECTION 1. MASTER TEACHER EXCLUSION. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section regarding certain wages of certified master teachers. The new section of the Internal Revenue Code excludes 25 percent of wages earned by certified master teachers at qualified schools in need of improvement or Head Start programs. Certified master teachers are eligible for this exclusion for wages earned during a 4-year certification period and cannot be recertified for more than one period. The new section of the Internal Revenue Code excludes 25 percent of wages earned by certified master teachers at qualified schools in need of improvement or Head Start programs. A State may not certify any teacher if it would result in more than 10 percent of the State's public school teachers being certified master teachers. Qualified schools in need of improvement are defined as schools that employ certified master teachers during the certification period. The term 'school in need of improvement' refers to a public elementary or secondary school identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This includes schools eligible for a schoolwide program and those employing certified master teachers during the certification period. An eligible teacher for a schoolwide program must have 5 years of teaching experience, be highly qualified, hold a master's degree, and have advanced certification in their state or from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The text discusses the certification period for certified master teachers and the requirement for them to include the state of certification on their tax return. The section does not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2013. The Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress annually from 2007 to 2013 on the number of certified master teachers in each state who received income exclusions under section 139B of the Internal Revenue Code. These amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2006."
