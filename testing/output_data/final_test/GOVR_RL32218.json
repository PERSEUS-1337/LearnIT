    "content": "The collection of fees to support EPA pesticide program activities under FIFRA and FFDCA has been a complex issue for over 25 years. Various administrations have proposed modifying and increasing pesticide fees, which has been controversial in Congress. Congress has taken action to address concerns and facilitate timely completion of EPA's reviews through pesticide fee provisions. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act, known as PRIA, was enacted in 2004 to facilitate EPA's reviews through pesticide fee provisions. PRIA 2 was passed in 2007, extending fee collection provisions until FY2012. PRIA 3, enacted in 2012, further revised and reauthorized pesticide fees through FY2017. PRIA 3 amended FIFRA by eliminating pre-PRIA one-time reregistration fee collection authorities established under the 1988 amendments to FIFRA. Prior to PRIA 3, provisions were temporarily extended in legislation to reauthorize the farm bill and in the continuing appropriations resolution for FY2013. PRIA 3, enacted in FY2013, superseded PRIA provisions in the appropriations resolution. EPA's pesticide program is funded by U.S. Treasury revenues and fees from pesticide manufacturers. PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 modified pesticide fee authority to support EPA's statutory obligations under FIFRA and FFDCA. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 renewed and expanded the authority of FIFRA and FFDCA, with modifications to the fee payment process and an increase in the categories of pesticide registration subject to fees. EPA released its annual PRIA progress report in March 2013, detailing registration decisions and efforts to improve the process in FY2012. 1,574 registration decisions were completed in FY2012, compared to 1,544 in FY2011. The report provides a background on federal authority regarding pesticide fees, key elements and revisions in PRIA 3, historical overview of pesticide fee collection authorities, fee revenues collected over time, recent fiscal years' appropriations, and EPA's registration and reregistration review activities since PRIA 1 enactment. Refer to CRS Report RL31921 for a comprehensive overview of federal pesticide laws. FIFRA is a licensing statute that requires EPA to register pesticide products before they can be sold, used, and distributed within the United States. EPA evaluates proposed pesticide registrations under science-based safety standards. FFDCA requires a tolerance or tolerance exemption for \"food use\" pesticides. EPA reevaluates older pesticides through reregistration and reassesses existing tolerances to meet current safety standards. The 1996 amendments to FIFRA and FFDCA (FQPA) require EPA to establish tolerances based on risk assessments and human health criteria to ensure no harm from pesticide residues in food and feed. The EPA evaluates pesticide registrations under safety standards and establishes tolerances based on risk assessments and human health criteria to ensure no harm from pesticide residues in food and feed. Congress has amended FFDCA and FIFRA to authorize fee collection for pesticide review activities to meet statutory obligations efficiently. This includes reviewing new pesticide registrations, establishing maximum residue allowances, and reevaluating older pesticide registrations to meet current standards for human health and environmental protection. The 1954 amendments to FFDCA authorized the collection of fees for establishing pesticide residue levels on food. In 1988, EPA issued a rule for collecting registration fees under the IOAA. The rule was challenged in court, leading to a temporary suspension of registration fees until FY1997. The 1988 FIFRA amendments allowed for a one-time \"reregistration fee\" for active ingredients. The 1996 FIFRA/FFDCA amendments authorized the collection of a one-time \"reregistration fee\" for active ingredients and annual \"maintenance fees\" for pesticide registered products to accelerate reregistration. Congress extended EPA's authority to collect maintenance fees through FY2001 to address new safety standards introduced with the amendments. Following the 1996 FIFRA/FFDCA amendments, EPA's fee authority was expanded to support the reevaluation of existing tolerances. These pesticide maintenance fees, along with tolerance fees for new tolerances, were the only fees collected by EPA prior to PRIA 1. Proposals were made to increase revenues to cover administrative costs related to FQPA requirements. Proposals focused on finalizing a 1999 EPA rule to revise tolerance fees and recommended Congress lift the 1988 prohibition on pesticide registration fee authority. Industry groups questioned the authority to expand fee collection under FFDCA and opposed EPA's justification for proposing a tenfold increase in fees. Congress prohibited the 1999 proposal in EPA's FY2000 appropriations. The EPA's proposals to increase tolerance fees were prohibited through appropriations legislation, with PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 continuing the prohibition of fee authority through FY2012. Congress also banned EPA from rulemaking for collecting pesticide tolerance fees in FY2005. The EPA's proposals to increase pesticide tolerance fees were prohibited through appropriations legislation. PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 continued the prohibition of fee authority through FY2012. The President's budget requests included proposals for new fee schedules to increase fee revenue collected. PRIA 3 extends fee collection authority through FY2017, with phase-out authority for certain fees through FY2019. The PRIA 3 extends fee collection authority through FY2017, with phase-out authority for certain fees through FY2019, while also eliminating historical reregistration fee collection provisions under the 1988 FIFRA amendments. The funding mechanism in PRIA uses fee revenue to support agency performance, similar to other regulatory programs like the Clean Air Act Title V permitting program. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2012 (PRIA 3) amended and reauthorized provisions of previous acts through FY2017 to enhance EPA review of pesticide registration applications. PRIA 1, enacted in January 2004, effectively addressed issues with pesticide fees and had support from various stakeholders. PRIA 2 amended PRIA 1 provisions under FIFRA, adding new registration application categories and extending baseline appropriations protection for EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. PRIA 3 further enhanced pesticide registration processes by revising registration application categories, clarifying existing categories, and codifying fee schedules and decision timelines in law. Stakeholders urged reauthorization of PRIA with modifications to improve the program. PRIA 3 amended FIFRA by eliminating the one-time reregistration fee provisions and extended baseline budget protection for the EPA's OPP. It also added authority for fee reductions for small businesses, enhanced pesticide decision tracking systems, and extended fee collection authority through FY2017. PRIA 3 extended EPA's authority to collect registration service fees through FY2017, with reduced levels in FY2018 and FY2019. It also required pesticide registrations to be reviewed every 15 years and mandated EPA to identify reforms to reduce decision review periods. Additionally, EPA was required to provide annual reports on process improvements and analyze the impact of maintenance fees on small businesses. PRIA 3 reauthorized the collection of maintenance fees for pesticide registrations through FY2017, with revised fee amounts. Nonpayment of maintenance fees can lead to the cancellation of pesticide registrations. EPA canceled 198 registrations in 2012 for nonpayment. In 2012, EPA canceled 198 pesticide registrations for nonpayment of maintenance fees. In September 2013, EPA notified registrants of its intent to cancel 220 registrations for the same reason. PRIA 3 increased the annual maximum maintenance fees and amended FIFRA to adjust fee amounts for registrants with different numbers of pesticide registrations. PRIA 3 introduces changes to registration fees, with a fee reduction for small businesses and exemptions for public health pesticides. Qualified small businesses can receive a 25% waiver on maintenance fees for their first registration if they meet specific criteria. Under PRIA 3, maintenance fee revenues will be deposited in the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" to offset costs of reevaluating pesticides and expedited processing. Revenue from fees will also enhance information systems capabilities for tracking pesticide registration decisions. EPA must complete registration review decisions for all pesticides registered by October 1, 2007, by October 1, 2022. Under PRIA 3, the registration review program remains unchanged from PRIA 2. The program allows for the use of funds to offset costs of registration reviews under section 3(g). EPA completed the reregistration of active ingredients requiring tolerances or exemptions. Under PRIA 3, EPA completed the reregistration of active ingredients requiring tolerances or exemptions by October 3, 2008. Following this, EPA initiated the process of reregistering individual end-use products containing eligible pesticide ingredients, with completion expected for conventional pesticides in 2014. PRIA 3 extended the authority to collect maintenance fees, designating a portion for this purpose. The EPA uses a portion of annual maintenance fees collected for reviewing inert ingredients, expediting pesticide product registrations, label amendments, and public health pesticide uses. The 1996 FIFRA amendments emphasized inert ingredients' importance and EPA must approve all inert ingredients in pesticide products. Under FFDCA, inert ingredients in pesticide products must be approved by the EPA. The total percentage of inert ingredients is typically required on the product label, but specific names or percentages are not mandated by federal law. PRIA 3 introduced 10 new inert categories for registration fees and authorized funds for improving information systems to track registration decisions. The EPA has implemented electronic tracking for registration submissions and endangered species information. PRIA 1 established registration service fees for new pesticide applications, with PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 extending this authority. PRIA 3 authorizes the collection of registration service fees until FY2017, with a phase-out plan at reduced levels. The registration service fees, established under PRIA 1 and extended by PRIA 2 and PRIA 3, are set to expire at the end of FY2017. The fees cover only a portion of the costs for reviewing registration applications, with the remainder supported by appropriations. These costs include EPA staff, contractors, and advisory committees involved in pesticide applications and risk assessments. The amount of fees varies based on the type of application and required services. The EPA Administrator was directed to publish a detailed schedule of covered pesticide applications and corresponding registration service fees under PRIA 1 and PRIA 2. PRIA 3 required EPA to make the fee schedule publicly available on their website, with an increased number of actions covered by registration service fees and modifications to the payment process. The fee schedule includes 189 categories spread across 3 EPA Office of Pesticide Program divisions and newly included inert and miscellaneous categories. The EPA implemented revisions to existing categories and added new categories to the registration service fee schedule. Changes were made to decision-making time frames, allowing for adjustments without resubmission. A screening period was authorized for data completeness, and collected fees can now be used for electronic tracking. Detailed footnotes outline specific requirements for registrant submissions. EPA emphasized the importance of these footnotes at a workshop in April 2013. The EPA's PRIA 3 website provides guidance on the revised registration service fee schedule, including a fee determination decision tree. PRIA 3 authorizes a 5% increase in fees for registration applications received between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, with an additional 5% increase for applications received after October 1, 2015. Exemptions and reductions for minor uses and small entities are retained from PRIA 2. The EPA's PRIA 3 website provides guidance on the revised registration service fee schedule, including exemptions and reductions for minor uses and small entities. PRIA 2 had amended the small business waiver provisions, allowing for partial waivers of service fees. Between FY2008 and FY2012, EPA granted fee waivers or exemptions for over 95% of applications, with approximately 65% being 75% \"ultra-small business waivers\". During FY2008 to FY2012, EPA granted over 95% of fee waivers or exemptions for pesticide registration applications. 65% were \"ultra-small business waivers\" and 22% were small business waivers. In FY2007, 258 out of 374 waivers granted were 100% small business waivers. The total fees waived in FY2012 were $7.7 million, $2.2 million less than FY2011. PRIA 3 retained the Pesticide Registration Fund in the U.S. Treasury without fiscal year limitation. PRIA 3 allocated funds for worker protection and pesticide risk reduction activities for FY2013 through FY2017. It authorized $500,000 annually for Partnership Grants and a pesticide safety education program. The prohibition on registration service fees was extended unless congressional appropriations for EPA OPP functions remain consistent with FY2012 levels. The FY2013 appropriations act made an exception to the requirement that EPA OPP funds remain at FY2012 levels, allowing for the collection of registration service fees. The FY2013 appropriations act allowed for the collection of registration service fees, independent of the level of funds appropriated for pesticide program activities. PRIA 3 introduced changes to the screening process for registration applications, including new requirements and time frames for preliminary technical screening to identify potential deficiencies. Applicants are given the opportunity to correct these deficiencies to prevent delays in the review process. The collection of tolerance fees under PRIA 3 is authorized through FY2017, with revenues allocated from maintenance and registration service fees. Registration service fees are set to be phased out by FY2019. Prohibitions on other fees under PRIA 3 expire at the end of FY2017. EPA Administrator is restricted from levying additional fees for registration. The EPA Administrator is prohibited from levying any other fees for pesticide registration under PRIA. The collection of fees under the registration fee authority codified in 1988 is temporarily replaced by PRIA 3. One-time reregistration fees established under the 1988 amendments to FIFRA have been collected by FY1995, totaling $31.64 million. PRIA 3 extended the requirement for EPA to publish an annual report on relevant actions taken, with specific elements to be included. This includes reporting on decision time review period extensions, progress in implementing enhancements for tracking registration submissions, and rejection rates under amended technical screening provisions. The EPA retained reporting elements under PRIA 3, including progress in meeting registration review goals and resources related to decision making. PRIA 3 also required EPA to identify reforms to reduce decision review periods. Reports on PRIA activities were released annually from FY2004 to FY2012, with the most recent report in March 2013. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act - Fiscal Year 2012 required the EPA Administrator to submit a report analyzing the impact of maintenance fees on small businesses to the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture. Small businesses are defined as having 10 or fewer employees and annual global gross revenues less than $2.0 million. The report should include the number of small businesses paying maintenance fees and the number of registrations each entity holds. Various changes and proposed changes to pesticide fee authority led up to the 2004 enactment of PRIA 1. Fees collected by EPA. Changes to pesticide fee authority, including the collection of tolerance fees and maintenance fees, have evolved over time. The 1988 amendments to FIFRA expanded pesticide fee authority, introducing a nine-year schedule for reregistration. This led to the enactment of PRIA 1 in 2004, which further refined the fee collection process. The EPA was authorized to collect fees for reregistration of pesticide active ingredients registered before 1984. Despite fee revenues, concerns were raised about the pace of EPA's review efforts. Congress amended FIFRA in 1996 to extend fee collection authority through FY2001 and include reevaluating old tolerances. The FQPA requires EPA to ensure \"reasonable certainty\" of \"no harm\" and analyze aggregate and cumulative effects of pesticides. New requirements introduced responsibilities for EPA in establishing new tolerances and reassessing old ones. Maintenance fees authority was extended before the enactment of PRIA 1 provisions in 2004. EPA promulgated a final pesticide registration fee regulation in May 1988 to cover increasing administrative costs of pesticide registration reviews. The regulation included a schedule of fees for registration, amended registration, or experimental use permit. Registration fees were to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury and not directly available to EPA. Collection of registration fees was temporarily suspended through FY1997 and continued to be prohibited through FY2001 and subsequent years. In June 1999, EPA proposed a rule restructuring tolerance fees to cover the cost of establishing initial tolerances and tolerance reassessments. The EPA proposed a tenfold increase in fees for tolerance petitions and reassessments for \"other\" ingredients, which industry groups opposed. The 106th Congress prohibited the tolerance fee rule in EPA's FY2000 appropriations. The 107th Congress considered revising the overall fees structure for pesticide programs. The 107th Congress revised the fees structure for pesticide programs in the 2002 farm bill, but the fee provisions were deleted in the final Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. EPA's proposed tolerance fee rule was discouraged in the conference report, and Congress has prohibited additional pesticide fees through PRIA 1 and PRIA 2. The PRIA prohibitions on pesticide fees were continued through 2012. The President's budget requests for FY2005 through FY2012 proposed increased pesticide fees, but Congress rejected these proposals. In FY2005, language in a supplemental appropriations bill banned EPA from collecting pesticide tolerance fees. The President's FY2006 budget request included collecting $46.0 million in pesticide fees above those authorized under PRIA. The FY2006 appropriations bill did not reflect the Administration's anticipated pesticide fee revenues. The proposed fee changes would have required congressional approval, but no relevant legislation had been proposed. The President's FY2007 request included an additional $56 million in anticipated revenues from changes to fees. The Administration proposed changes to pesticide registration fees in FY2007, but Congress did not adopt them. The FY2007 appropriations bill maintained funding levels from FY2006 for EPA and other agencies. The FY2008 budget proposed modifications to pesticide fees to collect $66 million in revenues, including a new fee program for EPA's Registration Review Program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 did not include the Administration's anticipated pesticide fee revenues, but PRIA 2 allowed funds for Registration Review and mandated a 5% increase in registration service fees. The FY2009-FY2012 budget requests proposed modifications and increases in pesticide fees and existing maintenance and registration service fees. Additional fees totaling $51 million to $42 million were proposed for each fiscal year, but were not reflected in enacted appropriations. The President's FY2013 budget request did not include these fee modifications. The President's FY2013 budget request did not include proposed additional pesticide fees. Instead, legislative language was proposed to reauthorize and increase existing maintenance and registration service fees to cover more of EPA's program operating costs. Historical data on pesticide fee revenues and funds appropriated for EPA pesticide program activities are discussed. Pesticide fees collected over the years have varied based on statutory authority. Figure 1 illustrates the amount of tolerance and registration fees collected. The highest combined amount collected from various fees before and after the enactment of PRIA in January 2004 ranged from $39.1 million in FY1990 to $40.7 million in FY2010. PRIA 3 service fees apply to registration applications received after October 1, 2012, while PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 applied to applications received after March 23, 2004, and October 1, 2007, respectively. EPA began collecting fees under PRIA in FY2004. In FY2004, EPA collected $14.7 million in new \"registration service\" fees and spent $5.0 million, carrying forward a balance of $9.7 million to FY2005. In FY2012, EPA received $15.6 million in new net \"registration service\" fees, a 34% increase from FY2011 but 16% lower than FY2010. Expenditures in FY2012 totaled $13.4 million out of $20.3 million available, including $4.7 million carried forward from FY2011. In FY2012, EPA's expenditures totaled $13.4 million, with a remaining balance of $7.0 million carried forward to FY2013. The majority of the fee revenues (52%) were spent on payroll, amounting to $7.4 million, which was slightly lower than the previous fiscal years. In FY2012, EPA's expenditures totaled $13.4 million, with 52% spent on payroll ($7.4 million). Fee revenue used for contract expenditures was $3.0 million (22%), a decrease from previous years. Annual maintenance fee amounts collected per registration are set by statute. The maintenance fee requirement for registrations under FIFRA is set by statute and subject to adjustment by EPA. The initial authorization in 1988 set the annual aggregate limit at $14 million, with additional funds authorized in 1996. The statutory authority for maintenance fees expired in 2001 but was extended annually through appropriations legislation until the enactment of PRIA. The annual aggregate limit for maintenance fees under FIFRA was initially set at $14 million in 1988, with additional funds authorized in 1996. The authority for maintenance fees expired in 2001 but was extended annually through appropriations until the enactment of PRIA. PRIA 1 extended the authority to collect maintenance fees through FY2008, with varying annual limits. PRIA 2 set the limit at $22 million for FY2008 through FY2012, and PRIA 3 set it at $27 million for FY2013 through FY2017. EPA generally collected the maximum limit as set by PRIA. In FY2004 to FY2012, EPA collected maintenance fees ranging from $21.4 million to $27.9 million annually. In FY2012, $22.0 million was charged against the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund for pesticide program activities. In FY2012, $22.0 million from the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund was used for pesticide program activities, including reviews and processing of new products. EPA canceled registrations for nonpayment of maintenance fees and waived fees for some minor use registrations. Maintenance fees were paid for the majority of registrations on file. In September 2013, EPA reported that maintenance fees had been paid for 97% of FIFRA Section 3 registrations and 1,941 FIFRA Section 24(c) registrations. EPA sent a notice to cancel 220 registrations for nonpayment of 2013 maintenance fees. Annual tolerance fees collected averaged about $1.8 million before PRIA 1 in January 2004. PRIA 3 continued the prohibition on tolerance fees collection through FY2017. The reregistration fees under the 1988 amendments to FIFRA varied based on the pesticide's use, ranging from $0 to $150,000. By 1994, all one-time reregistration fees had been collected, totaling $31.64 million. PRIA 3 amended FIFRA by eliminating the one-time reregistration fee provisions, totaling $31.64 million. EPA had collected $300,000 in fees until the collection was suspended in FY1997. Pesticide fee revenues supplement EPA's pesticide program activities. PRIA 3, like PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, ensured fee revenues were not affected by decreases in appropriations for the Office of Pesticide Programs. If appropriations fall below a certain level, registration service fees are suspended. The minimum appropriations level has been met through FY2012. EPA and other agencies operated under two continuing resolutions for FY2013. In recent fiscal years, EPA's pesticide program activities have been funded through three EPA appropriations accounts: Science and Technology (S&T), Environmental Programs and Management (EPM), and State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG). Enacted appropriations for FY2004-FY2012 and FY2013 requested funding for specific pesticide program activities are shown in Table 2. Other funding for pesticide program activities, such as \"Chemical safety and sustainability research,\" is included in broader program activities within the S&T account. The EPA's pesticide program activities are funded through various appropriations accounts. Registration service fees received by the EPA are deposited in the Pesticide Registration Fund to supplement appropriations for improved processes and staff hiring. Maintenance fees collected are placed in the Reregistration Fund. The EPA's pesticide program activities are funded through various appropriations accounts. Maintenance fees collected by the agency are placed in the Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund. The agency uses these fees for reregistration, tolerance review activities, and registration review. Portions of the revenue are also used for new inert ingredient reviews and processing fast track amendments and new products under FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B).PRIA 1 had modified FIFRA with completion deadlines for reregistration decisions. EPA initiated the pesticide reregistration and tolerance reassessment programs, with completion expected by 2014. A final rule for the \"registration review\" program was published in 2006, aiming to review pesticides every 15 years. PRIA 1, PRIA 2, and PRIA 3 require EPA to identify key provisions in conjunction with fee revenues. EPA, under PRIA 1, 2, and 3, must reform pesticide registration processes to reduce decision review times. Annual reports detail process improvements and accomplishments. EPA completed 12,165 registration decisions/actions subject to PRIA between March 2004 and FY2012. During FY2012, EPA completed 1,574 registration decisions, with 68% for conventional pesticides, 21% for antimicrobials, and 11% for biopesticides. $1.0 million was spent on worker protection activities from the Pesticide Registration Fund, as required by PRIA 2. PRIA 2 and PRIA 3 maintained proportional distribution for worker protection, with a minimum of $1 million and $500,000 allocated for the Pesticide Safety Education Program (PSEP) from FY2008 to FY2012. Activities included stakeholder engagement through the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, training for workers and health-care providers on safe practices and pesticide risk recognition, and expansion of poisoning recognition and surveillance. EPA also allocated $500,000 in fee revenues for partnership grants under PRIA 2, supporting the National Pesticide Information Network in providing science-based information about pesticides to the public. No appropriated funds were used. In FY2011, no appropriated funds were used to augment allocated fee revenues for partnership grants. EPA's efforts to enhance the registration process included developing pesticide registration procedures and improving coordination. Detailed descriptions of projects funded from FY2008 to FY2012 are included in the annual PRIA implementation report. EPA focused on process improvements in the registration program, forming a workgroup to address recommendations and achieve timely decisions. Key areas of focus included labeling consistency, communication of schedules, application requirements, guidance materials, and electronic submissions. EPA improved pesticide registration processes with better guidance materials and electronic submissions. After reviewing pesticides, EPA issues risk management decisions like REDs, IREDs, or TREDs. By August 2008, EPA completed decisions for 605 pesticide cases, meeting statutory deadlines. EPA also reassessed 99.1% of preexisting tolerances by August 2006. The EPA completed the reassessment of 9,637 preexisting tolerances by August 3, 2006, resulting in the revocation of 3,200 food tolerances and modification of 1,200. The remaining 84 tolerance reassessment decisions for five carbamate pesticides were completed in September 2007. Additionally, EPA completed 1,284 product reregistration decisions during FY2012. During FY2012, EPA completed 1,284 product reregistration actions, including registrations, amendments, suspensions, and cancellations. By the end of FY2012, decisions were made for 18,208 out of 24,583 pesticide end-use products subject to reregistration. EPA also completed reregistration for 258 out of 384 REDs, with a goal of 1,200 decisions for FY2013. The 1996 FIFRA amendments mandated periodic review of pesticide registrations under Section 3(g)(1)(A). The EPA shall establish regulations for periodic review of pesticide registrations every 15 years to ensure they meet safety standards. The registration review final rule replaces previous programs and includes 721 cases with 1,135 active ingredients, covering conventional, antimicrobial, biochemical, and microbial pesticides. EPA initiated registration review in FY2007, opening 25 case dockets. The pace increased each year, with 79 dockets opened in FY2012. 744 pesticide cases were scheduled for review in FY2012 to meet the 15-year cycle goal by FY2022. EPA revised its four-year schedule for registration review, making changes to move certain pesticides between schedules based on their registered uses. Fumigants were all moved to the same schedule, and EPA plans to update the schedule annually. The EPA plans to update the registration review schedule annually, considering input from the public, registrants, and stakeholders. Concerns about timely completion of pesticide registration requirements have led to legislative efforts like PRIA 3. The Registration Improvement Renewal Act (PRIA 3) was enacted to address delays and complexities in EPA's pesticide registration reviews. PRIA 3, along with its predecessors PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, have led to more timely completion of registration applications and reregistration reviews. Advancements have been made with the enactment of PRIA 3, which has more prescriptive fee schedules for EPA actions. PRIA 1 and PRIA 2 improved efficiencies in the registration process, including reregistration decisions and reevaluation of older tolerances. PRIA 3's fee schedule is expected to further enhance processing efficiencies. The enactment of PRIA 3 is expected to result in further efficiencies in processing registration applications. EPA, Members of Congress, and stakeholders anticipate that refinements to pesticide fee provisions in PRIA 3 will provide stability for resource planning. EPA has shown progress in improving decision-making processes under PRIA 1 and PRIA 2, with continued reforms and improvements. The agency's ability to maintain efficiency while protecting human health and the environment is crucial for sustained improvement. EPA collaborates with stakeholders to develop and refine scientific protocols and guidelines. The EPA collaborates with stakeholders to develop and refine scientific protocols and guidelines for pesticide review processes, which can be complex and time-consuming due to uncertainties and technological advancements. Time line of key pesticide fee authorities and regulations is provided in Table A-1."
