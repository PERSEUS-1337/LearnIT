    "content": "The Act may be known as the \"Teen Parent Graduation and College Achievement Act\". Congress finds that the United States has the highest teenage pregnancy rate among industrialized nations, with nearly 750,000 American teenagers aged 15-19 becoming pregnant each year. While there has been a decline in teen pregnancy rates since the 1990s, rates increased in 2005-2006. Seventy percent of pregnant teenagers drop out of high school, with teenage fathers completing fewer semesters of high school compared to older fathers. Subsequent pregnancies can lead to more dropouts. Subsequent pregnancies accounted for 85,000, or almost 20 percent, of all teenage pregnancies. Marginalized racial or ethnic minority and immigrant communities have less access to education and support, leading to high rates of teenage pregnancy. This can result in a disproportionate dropout rate in these communities, with Latina and African-American teen girls having high pregnancy rates before the age of 20. Teenage pregnancy rates are higher among Latina and African-American youth aged 15-17 compared to Caucasian youth. Sexually active LGBTQ+ youth are three times more likely to experience unwanted pregnancies. Only 51% of teenage mothers have a high school diploma, leading to a high dropout rate among teenage women, with parenthood being a significant reason for dropping out. Teenage births are common among 18 and 19-year-olds, with higher rates among Latina and African-American women. Parenthood can hinder college graduation, with 61% of community college mothers not graduating compared to those without children. Increased support at higher education institutions, especially community colleges, could benefit older teenage parents. Comprehensive support from schools, public agencies, and community organizations can help reduce high school dropout rates for pregnant and parenting teenagers, ensuring they complete high school and pursue higher education. More data on the prevalence of teenage pregnancy is needed for targeted federal assistance in communities.
