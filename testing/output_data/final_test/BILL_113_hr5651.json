The \"Small Business Hardship Relief Act\" offers a hardship exemption for small businesses from the employer health insurance mandate under Section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Small businesses can be exempt if they demonstrate hardship by missing two or more consecutive loan payments or being a debtor in a title 11 case. The \"Small Business Hardship Relief Act\" provides exemptions for small businesses facing financial difficulties, such as receiving notices of utility service termination, eviction, foreclosure, property damage from disasters, or other hardships determined by the Secretary. The exemption is limited to five years. The \"Small Business Hardship Relief Act\" exempts small businesses from certain provisions if they have been subject to them for five previous calendar years. A small business is defined as an employer with an average of no more than 100 full-time employees in the preceding calendar year. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to months after the enactment of the Act.
