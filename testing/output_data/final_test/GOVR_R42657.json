    "content": "Congress appropriates federal payments to the District for funding activities and reviews the District's budget, including local funds, as outlined in the Home Rule Act. The District's appropriations act is now included in the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act. The act typically includes special federal payments for specific initiatives, the District's operating budget, and enterprise funds for government functions. The District's budget includes enterprise funds for government functions, funded by user-based fees and federal funds. General provisions in the budget cover fiscal directives, administrative controls, and congressional oversight. The Obama Administration's detailed budget request for FY2013 included $677.8 million in special federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on courts and criminal justice. This allocation represented an increase from the District's FY2012 appropriation. Key areas of funding included court operations, Defender Services, and the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request for the District of Columbia included $39.4 million for the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, $500,000 for investigating judicial misconduct complaints, and $95.6 million for education initiatives. The District of Columbia Council approved an FY2013 budget of $11.4 billion in operating funds and $1.1 billion in capital outlays on May 15, 2012. The mayor signed the measure (A19-0381) on June 15, 2012, which included $11.4 billion in operating funds and $1.1 billion in capital outlays. The provision in the act would grant the District budget autonomy in the expenditure of local funds if Congress failed to pass a DC appropriations act before the 2013 fiscal year. This provision was also supported by the Administration and included in the Senate Appropriations Committee bill. The 112th Congress, P.L. 112-175 and P.L. 113-6 referenced the District's FY2013 budget submission for congressional review. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $676.2 million in special federal payments for the District in FY2013, $10.6 million more than FY2012. The bill included more funding for court operations but less for elementary and secondary education initiatives compared to previous years. The FY2013 budget submission for the District included funds for public school improvements, support for public charter schools, and a private school voucher program. The Senate bill allowed the District to use locally raised funds without congressional approval. The bill also included provisions on budgetary and fiscal operations, and restrictions on federal funds for District statehood or voting representation. The bill included provisions for voting representation, funding for Statehood Representative and Senator, and support for DC's efforts for voting representation in Congress. It also made changes regarding abortion services, medical marijuana regulation, and federal funding restrictions. The House Appropriations Committee approved the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act of 2013, H.R. 6020, which included $673.7 million in special federal payments to the District. This was $12.2 million more than appropriated for FY2012, with increases in court operations funding and a reduction in Resident Tuition Support. Additionally, $60 million was allocated to support the District of Columbia Public Schools. The House bill allocated $60 million to support the District of Columbia Public Schools, public charter schools, and private school vouchers. It included provisions on budgetary controls, deficit spending, fund reprogramming, and required a revised operating budget submission within 30 days. Additionally, it addressed statehood and congressional representation issues. The House bill allocated $60 million to support education in the District of Columbia and included provisions on budgetary controls, deficit spending, and fund reprogramming. H.R. 6020 would have prohibited the use of funds for abortion services, needle exchange programs, and the medical use of marijuana. On June 12, 2012, the city certified four medical marijuana dispensaries, but the first one didn't open until June 2013. The Obama Administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 6020 on June 28, 2012, urging the House to allow the District to use its own funds if Congress didn't approve the budget. They also objected to provisions restricting federal funds for the District's needle exchange program. The statement objected to a provision restricting District funds for abortion services, citing it undermines home rule. Congress passed a continuing resolution (P.L.112-175) in 2012, allowing appropriations at 0.612% above FY2012 levels until March 27, 2013. The resolution also permitted the District of Columbia to spend locally-raised funds as outlined in the Budget Request Act of 2012 and allocated $24.7 million for emergency planning and security costs, including expenses for the Presidential Inauguration. On March 26, 2013, the President signed into law P.L. 113-6, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, which allowed the District of Columbia to use its local funds as specified in the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Request Act of 2012. The act established appropriations levels for special federal payments to the District at FY2012 funding levels, subject to sequestration. Both the President and Congress can propose financial assistance to the District through special federal payments for specific activities or priorities. The Obama Administration budget proposal for FY2013 included special federal payments for the District of Columbia. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended different amounts for these payments. The 112th Congress passed H.J. Res.117 to extend funding at a 0.6% increase above FY2012 levels until March 27, 2013. The District of Columbia was allowed to spend local funds as outlined in the Budget Request Act of 2012 and received $9.8 million for the Presidential Inauguration. P.L.113-6, signed into law on March 26, 2013, funded special federal payments to the District at FY2012 levels, with $24.7 million for emergency planning and security. Table 2 details federal payments for FY2013. The District of Columbia's FY2013 General Fund Budget, totaling $11.4 billion, included $9.4 billion for operating expenses and $1.9 billion for enterprise funds. Congress faced key policy issues such as funding a needle exchange program to address HIV and AIDS among intravenous drug abusers during the review of the District's appropriations for FY2013. The controversy surrounding funding a needle exchange program involves issues of home rule, public health policy, and government sanctioning of illegal drugs. Proponents argue that such programs reduce HIV spread among drug users by providing clean needles, while opponents believe it sanctions drug use and advocate for drug treatment programs instead. The debate also touches on the city's ability to use local funds for such programs without federal restrictions. The use of federal and District funds for a needle exchange program was approved by Congress in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999, P.L. 105-277. The prohibition on funding continued in the FY2001 act, but restrictions on privately funded needle exchange activities were also imposed. The Act for FY2001 made it illegal to distribute needles near schools, but this provision was removed in the FY2002 Act, P.L. 107-96. The FY2002 Columbia Appropriations Act, P.L. 107-96, allowed private funds for needle exchange programs but prohibited the use of District and federal funds. Prevention Works operates a needle exchange program and must track public and private fund usage. District officials tried to lift the funding prohibition in the FY2004 Act, but only private funds were allowed in the final bill. The FY2004 bill allowed private funds for needle exchange programs and required separate accounting for funds received. The FY2008 Appropriations Act allowed District funds for a needle exchange program to combat HIV/AIDS among drug users, departing from previous prohibitions on federal and District funding. The act also urged federal funding to address the city's HIV/AIDS crisis. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 and House and Senate bills included language retaining the use of District funds for a needle exchange program but prohibiting federal funds. The Obama Administration urged the House to remove the prohibition on federal funds for needle exchange programs to prevent HIV/AIDS spread among drug users. P.L. 113-6 maintained the ban on federal funds for needle exchange programs. The District of Columbia faced controversy over the use of federal funds for a needle exchange program and the medical marijuana initiative. A provision in the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY1999 prohibited the counting of ballots for a voter-approved initiative allowing medical marijuana use. A lawsuit challenged Congress's power to block the initiative, with a ruling in 1999 stating that Congress could not stifle political speech, including ballot initiatives. The ruling in 1999 stated that Congress could not stifle political speech, including the ballot initiative for medical marijuana. Congress passed resolutions to prevent the implementation of the initiative in FY2000 and FY2002, which was challenged in court in 2001. The Marijuana Policy Project and the Medical Marijuana Initiative Committee filed suit in U.S. District Court to put a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot. A judge ruled that the congressional ban on using public funds for the initiative was unconstitutional, but the decision was appealed by the Justice Department. The Justice Department appealed a ruling on a medical marijuana initiative. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the decision without comment. The Supreme Court later ruled that Congress can regulate interstate drug marketing. District funds can now be used for regulating medical marijuana since 2010. Since 2010, District funds have been used to regulate the medical use of marijuana. Legislation was approved by the District of Columbia Council, allowing up to five facilities to dispense medical marijuana to authorized patients. Despite attempts by Congress to block implementation, the first dispensary started operations in 2012. Federal bills continued to prohibit the use of federal funds for laws legalizing or reducing penalties for controlled substances, including medical marijuana. Since 1979, Congress has restricted the use of public funds for abortion services for District of Columbia residents. This prohibition has been a recurring issue debated during annual deliberations on District of Columbia appropriations, with District officials viewing it as congressional intrusion into local matters. Since 1979, Congress has restricted the use of public funds for abortion services for District of Columbia residents. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush vetoed the District's FY1990 appropriations act twice over the abortion issue, eventually signing a bill that limited the use of District revenues for abortion services to cases where the woman's life was endangered. Since 1979, Congress has restricted public funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia. In FY1994, the provision limiting District funding of abortion services was removed, allowing for public funding in cases of rape and incest. However, in FY1996 and subsequent years, funding was limited to cases where the woman's life was endangered, rape, or incest. In FY2010, Congress lifted the prohibition on District funds for abortion services but maintained restrictions on federal funds except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman's life. The restriction on federal funds for abortion services in the District of Columbia was reversed in FY2011 and FY2012, allowing funding only in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman's life. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget requested federal funds for abortion services in limited circumstances. The Senate bill supported restricting federal funds for abortion, while the House bill included language on the issue. The House bill, H.R. 6020, restricted federal and District funds for abortion services to cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the woman's life. P.L. 113-6 allowed the District to use its own funds for abortion in the same circumstances. In the 112th Congress, bills were introduced to ban or restrict abortion services in the District of Columbia. The House Judiciary Committee ordered reported H.R. 3803, the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act on June 17, 2012. The bill aimed to ban abortions in the District after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for cases endangering the woman's life. It included fines and imprisonment for violators, allowed civil actions against those performing late-term abortions, and required reporting of specific information by physicians. The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act aimed to ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, with exceptions for cases endangering the woman's life. The bill included fines and imprisonment for violators, allowed civil actions against those performing late-term abortions, and required reporting of specific information by physicians. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 authorized funding for the Opportunity Scholarship program, a school voucher program for the District of Columbia. The Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia received funding through the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act. The program was reauthorized with $60 million annually for FY2012 through FY2016, divided evenly among DCPS, public charter schools, and the Opportunity Scholarship program. The reauthorized Opportunity Scholarship program in the District of Columbia received $59.8 million in funding for elementary and secondary education, with $20 million allocated to DCPS, $20 million to public charter schools, and $13.5 million to the Opportunity Scholarship program. The District appropriated $59.8 million for elementary and secondary education, divided evenly among public schools, public charter schools, and school vouchers."
