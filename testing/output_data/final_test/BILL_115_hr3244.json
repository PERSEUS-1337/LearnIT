Chapter 14 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require each agency to conduct an annual employee survey to assess leadership, employee satisfaction with policies, work environment, rewards, professional development, and contribution to organizational mission. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management will issue regulations for agency surveys to allow comparison across agencies, with a 60-day notice requirement to relevant committees. The Director must submit regulations to committees the day after a proposed rule is published. This applies to regulations enacted after this paragraph. Changes to survey questions must be made public on the agency's website 60 days before finalization. The Director must publicly disclose any proposed changes to survey questions on the agency's website. Additionally, they must provide the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with the proposed question changes, justifications, and an analysis of the impact on survey result comparability. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management must ensure survey data confidentiality and include responses by occupation. Agencies must report incentives offered for survey participation. The results of agency surveys must be made public unless it poses a national security risk. The term 'agency' refers to Executive agencies. The requirements of the survey apply to any annual survey initiated after the enactment of the Act. The survey requirements under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 are considered authorized and meet the criteria of section 1403(a) of title 5, United States Code. Technical and conforming amendments are also included. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136; 5 U.S.C. 7101 note) is repealed, with amendments to the table of sections in chapter 14 of title 5, United States Code. Chapter 14 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to focus on Agency Chief Human Capital Officers and Employee Surveys. Additionally, a GAO study on annual survey incentives is mandated. The Comptroller General of the United States will study incentives offered by agencies to employees for participating in required surveys, evaluating their impact on responses and response rates, and providing recommendations if necessary."
