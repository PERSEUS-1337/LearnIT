    "content": "The \"School Bus Safety Act\" defines key terms such as \"bus,\" \"school bus,\" \"school-chartered bus,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Act aims to ensure safety regulations for buses used to transport students to and from school or school-related events. The \"School Bus Safety Act\" establishes proficiency standards for school bus drivers. The Secretary must set proficiency standards for school bus drivers with a commercial driver's license within a year of this Act. States can use their own standards if they are as rigorous. Drivers must demonstrate proficiency according to the new standards. The Secretary will set proficiency standards for school bus drivers, who must demonstrate their proficiency to the employer or regulatory agency at specified intervals. SEC. 4. CRIMINAL HISTORY INVESTIGATIONS OF SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. Requirement for Investigations: A local educational agency must conduct a background check on any person before employing them as a school bus driver, following guidelines from the National Child Protection Act. Prior to establishing proper procedures, agencies can request the FBI to conduct a fingerprint-based criminal history check. The local educational agency must conduct a fingerprint-based criminal history check on individuals before hiring them as school bus drivers, following guidelines from the National Child Protection Act. The Division must comply with requests for such checks. The term \"local educational agency\" is defined in section 1471(12) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. SEC. 5 amends the Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems Act to ensure operational tests advance technologies that alert school bus drivers of hazards. SEC. 6 addresses seat belts in school buses. The Secretary must prescribe regulations for installing seat belts in newly manufactured school buses within a year. A program will be conducted to promote seat belt usage in school buses, including encouraging laws mandating their use. The Secretary will develop educational materials on seat belt usage in school buses and recognize districts with high seat belt usage. The Secretary will ensure that states use a portion of highway safety aid to conduct traffic engineering activities to improve school bus safety, with a minimum annual amount of $1,000,000. Additionally, the Secretary will assess the feasibility of safety and access requirements for school buses. The Secretary will begin a rulemaking process within 6 months to determine the feasibility of reducing flammability in school bus interiors, informing purchasers about safety standards for used buses, and setting standards for wheelchairs used in school bus transportation. Final Rule: The Secretary will promulgate a final rule within 2 years to establish feasible and practicable requirements or standards for wheelchairs used in school bus transportation. SEC. 9. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY. The Secretary will improve training materials on school bus safety and enhance their distribution to schools and law enforcement agencies. $100,000 annually from funds for highway safety research will be allocated for this purpose. SEC. 10. STUDY AND REPORT ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY. The Secretary will conduct a study to determine the extent of public transit vehicles involved in school bus operations and the criteria for considering a public transit vehicle as a school bus under Federal law. The study will also compare school bus operations conducted directly by schools or school districts with those carried out by contract in terms of crash injury data. The Secretary will conduct a study on public transit vehicles involved in school bus operations, including crash injury data, driver and carrier requirements, passenger transportation requirements, bus construction standards, operating and capital costs, and other relevant factors. A report on the study results must be submitted to specified committees within one year of the Act's enactment. The committees involved in the study on public transit vehicles for school bus operations are the Committee on Environment and Public Works, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives. SEC. 11. The Secretary of Transportation must establish minimum reporting criteria for highway safety programs on traffic-related deaths and injuries by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking by December 31, 1994, and a final rule by December 31, 1995 after public comment. SEC. 12. Appropriations are authorized as necessary to implement this Act."
