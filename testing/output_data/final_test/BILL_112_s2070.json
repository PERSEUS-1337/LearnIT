    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Natural Gas Energy and Alternatives Rewards Act\" or the \"NGEAR Act\". The purpose of the Act is outlined in Section 2. The purpose of the Act is to establish clean energy policies that provide market certainty, promote clean energy technologies, contain incentives for ongoing energy demands, support job growth, and reduce petroleum use and emissions. The Act also includes an extension of alternative fuels excise tax credits. The Act extends alternative fuels excise tax credits by amending the Internal Revenue Code to apply to fuel sold or used after December 31, 2016. The Act extends alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit and modifies the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include an Alternative Fuels Bus Program. The section defines alternative fuel as natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, hydrogen, or fuel cell. An alternatively fueled bus includes school buses, multifunction school activity buses, and public transportation vehicles that operate on alternative fuel. The Natural Gas Energy and Alternatives Rebates Program (NGEAR Program) subsidizes the purchase of alternatively fueled buses by eligible entities providing transportation for school students or mass transit services to the public. Eligible entities can receive rebates for purchasing alternatively fueled buses until December. Eligible entities can receive a rebate from the Department of Transportation for purchasing alternatively fueled buses until December 31, 2016. The rebate amount is the lesser of 30 percent of the purchase price or $15,000. Entities must submit an application with relevant sales invoices to the Secretary of Transportation to receive the rebate."
