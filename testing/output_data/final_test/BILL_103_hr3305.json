    "content": "The \"Consular Review Act of 1993\" establishes a Board of Visa Appeals under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary of State establishes a Board of Visa Appeals within the Department of State composed of 5 members, with no more than 2 being consular officers. The Board has the authority to review discretionary decisions of consular officers regarding immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, as well as waiver applications under section 212. The Board of Visa Appeals, established by the Secretary of State, can overrule or remand decisions made by consular officers if shown to be contrary to the evidence. Proceedings before the Board must follow regulations set by the Secretary of State, ensuring notice and review process availability to the alien, attorney, and interested parties. The Board of Visa Appeals can review consular officers' decisions, with a written record available to the Board and the alien upon request. The consular officer must provide the record within 30 days of the request. The appellant must be given notice of the Board proceedings and can be represented at no cost. The Board of Visa Appeals can review decisions upon request from interested parties such as the alien, petitioner of immigrant or nonimmigrant visa petitions, or postsecondary educational institutions. The appellant may choose counsel at no expense and must request a review within 60 days of notice of denial, revocation, or cancellation. The Board of Visa Appeals can review decisions upon request from interested parties such as the alien, petitioner of immigrant or nonimmigrant visa petitions, or postsecondary educational institutions, recognized international agencies, or treaty investors/traders in the United States. A review may not be requested more than once in any 24-month period, and this section does not restrict any right to further administrative or judicial review. The Secretary of State will charge a fee for a review by the Board of Visa Appeals, effective 120 days after the enactment of the Act. Proposed regulations must be issued within 30 days, and Board members appointed within 120 days of the Act. Technical amendments are made to the Immigration and Nationality Act, allowing interested parties to inspect records of proceedings. Amendments include changes to sections 222(f) and 104(a)(1) of the Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include a new section, Sec. 225, establishing the Board of Visa Appeals."
