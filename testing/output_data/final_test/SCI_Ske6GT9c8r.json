    "content": "We introduce a large dataset for Cyrillic Handwritten Text Recognition and Text in the Wild Recognition, along with a method for recognizing Cyrillic text. This approach has reduced document processing time for a mathematical competition in Ukraine by 12 days and saved 0.5 tons of paper. Text recognition is crucial for transferring information in various forms such as handwritten or printed text, business documents, notes, bills, historical documents, advertisements, and logos. While text recognition for English is well studied, there is a lack of research for Cyrillic languages. In our research, we focus on developing a single model for Handwritten Text Recognition and Text Recognition in the Wild for Cyrillic languages. Due to the lack of publicly available datasets, we have created a synthetic dataset and annotated datasets to address the insufficient data for training deep networks. Our approach involves generating Synthetic Cyrillic text recognition dataset by adapting an idea proposed by Jaderberg et al. The dataset for Text in the Wild recognition of Cyrillic words was created by sampling words from the UberText Corpus and annotating photos from the Internet. It consists of 881309 samples of 180994 different words and 505 samples from 151 photos, totaling 454 different words. The dataset includes word rectangles and their locations in images, although this information is not utilized in the research. The handwritten dataset used in the research consists of 82061 samples and 37007 words collected from a mathematical competition in Ukraine. It was divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. A model pretrained on Synthetic Cyrillic text and finetuned on a mixture of Synthetic and Handwritten Cyrillic text was developed. The architecture included Conv blocks with CRelu and Relu, followed by Conv blocks with Instance Normalisation and Leaky Relu. The word error rate and character error rate are reported in Table 1. This method was used to develop a new system for processing responses. The new system developed for processing responses in a math competition in Ukraine reduces form size, processing time, and paper usage significantly. It will save 12 days of scanning time and 0.5 tons of paper per round, benefiting the competition with 500,000 participants."
