The Act focuses on amending the 1986 Code, specifically extending, modifying, and expanding the credit for electricity produced from renewable resources and waste products. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" amends section 45(d) by permanently extending and modifying the credit for electricity produced from renewable resources and waste products. Key changes include removing specific dates and ownership requirements. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" permanently extends and modifies the credit for electricity produced from renewable resources and waste products. Amendments include increasing the credit rate to 1.9 cents and providing full credit rate for facilities placed in service after the date of enactment. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" amends the credit period for facilities placed in service before the enactment date. It also expands qualified resources to include incremental geothermal and hydropower production. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" expands qualified resources to include incremental geothermal production, defined as the excess electricity produced from a geothermal facility over a specified period. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" includes provisions for incremental hydropower production, which involves reducing the amount calculated based on the average percentage decrease in annual kilowatt hour production over a 7-year period. The Act also eliminates the highest and lowest kilowatt hour production years within the same period. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" defines incremental hydropower production as the percentage of electricity produced from efficiency improvements or capacity additions in a hydropower facility. This is determined by establishing a percentage of average annual hydropower production attributable to these improvements. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" defines incremental hydropower production as the percentage of electricity produced from efficiency improvements or capacity additions in a hydropower facility, certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The \"Renewable Energy Incentives Act\" defines incremental geothermal production as the electricity produced from incremental geothermal facilities owned by the taxpayer before the enactment date, with a 10-year period starting from that date. This term excludes property used for determining the energy credit under section 48. The term 'qualified facility' refers to non-Federal hydroelectric facilities owned by the taxpayer using incremental hydropower for electricity production. The 10-year period for these facilities starts from the date of enactment. Credit eligibility for lessees and operators is extended to all facilities described in specific paragraphs. The tax credit eligibility for lessees and operators of qualified facilities is extended to those described in specific paragraphs, including co-production facilities. The tax credit eligibility for co-production facilities allows for an increase in taxable year earnings by .25 cents, enabling production of various energy resources in addition to electricity on a continuous basis. Eligible taxable years are defined as those in which gross amounts meet specific criteria. The tax credit eligibility for co-production facilities allows for an increase in earnings by .25 cents in eligible taxable years where gross receipts meet specific criteria, including facilities located within qualified Indian lands. The tax credit eligibility for co-production facilities on qualified Indian lands allows for an increase in earnings by .25 cents in eligible taxable years with specific criteria met. Section 45(e) is amended to include a new paragraph regarding the treatment of persons unable to use the entire credit. This allows for the transfer or use of credits for qualified facilities owned by certain individuals. The credit allowance is independent of the tax-exempt status of the person. Eligible persons include organizations under specific sections, public utilities exempt from income tax, and certain governmental entities. The credit allowance can be transferred by eligible persons to others not described in the same category. The transfer of credit allowance can only be revoked with the Secretary's consent. Regulations will be prescribed to ensure the credit is assigned once and not reassigned. Proceeds from the transfer of credit are treated as arising from an essential government function.

Additionally, facilities not complying with pollution laws are not considered qualified facilities during non-compliance periods. The amendments made by this section apply to electricity and energy produced and sold after the enactment date of this Act, in taxable years ending after that date."
