Congress notes that childhood cancer remains a significant issue in the United States, with 13,500 children diagnosed each year. While some childhood cancers have high cure rates, many types still have low survival rates. Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease in children under 14, with over 360,000 survivors facing long-term health effects such as secondary malignancies and developmental impairments. Collection of biospecimens and clinical data on children with cancer in the United States is crucial to improve treatments and cures, as currently, this data is only collected for less than half of affected children. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE CHILDREN'S CANCER BIOREPOSITORIES. Section 417E of the Public Health Service Act is amended to allow the Secretary to make awards for building Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories to collect biospecimens and information for children with cancer. The funds received can be used for specific purposes. The Secretary can use funds to establish a database for biospecimens and data on children with cancer in the US, evaluate access requests, and distribute the information to researchers and healthcare professionals. The Secretary can use funds to establish a database for biospecimens and data on children with cancer in the US, evaluate access requests, and distribute the information to researchers and healthcare professionals. Eligible entities can apply for awards to access this data, with considerations given to their infrastructure for timely data capture. No child, adolescent, or young adult with cancer is required to contribute specimens or share data. The Secretary may award funds to entities for collecting biospecimens and data from children with cancer, ensuring privacy and consent procedures are followed. The Secretary ensures that a Biorepository has searchable data for researchers and healthcare professionals, standard data format requirements, and guidelines for development and maintenance. The development and maintenance of biorepositories authorized under this section, including oversight, are defined by terms such as 'award', 'biospecimen', and 'clinical and demographic information'. The Secretary shall ensure that clinical and demographic information, including patient's gender, race, ethnicity, disease extent, metastases site, primary tumor location, histologic diagnosis, tumor marker data, treatment outcome, specimen quality, and other required information, is collected in coordination with section 399E-1. The Secretary will report to Congress on the biospecimens and clinical data collected through the Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories, including barriers to collection and access for researchers and healthcare professionals. The Secretary will report to Congress on the biospecimens and clinical data collected through the Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories, including barriers to collection and access for researchers and healthcare professionals. Amendments are made to improve childhood cancer surveillance under the Public Health Service Act. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will award grants to State cancer registries to enhance tracking of cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. The grants can be used for identifying, training sources for reporting cancer cases, implementing early inclusion of cases on registries, and purchasing infrastructure to support this. The Secretary will ensure that information collected through State cancer registries is coordinated with clinical and demographic information collected under section 417E. The Secretary will coordinate information from State cancer registries with clinical and demographic data to improve the development of new drugs and biologic products for childhood cancers. The Comptroller General of the United States will report to Congress on barriers to studying oncologic therapies in pediatric populations. The report will assess the feasibility of requiring studies for pediatric oncologic indications and provide recommendations to improve research, development, and access to new oncologic therapies for pediatric patients. The report will assess barriers to studying oncologic therapies in pediatric populations and the potential impact of altering exemptions for such therapies. Stakeholder input will be included in the report development."
