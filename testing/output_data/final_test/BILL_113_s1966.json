    "content": "The \"National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014\" includes provisions for projects in Forest Management Emphasis Areas, administrative review, revenue distribution, performance measures, and termination. The Act aims to define purposes and provide a framework for managing national forests. The National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014 aims to create a predictable wood supply from National Forest System land to preserve jobs, generate revenue for counties, and strengthen rural economies. It also seeks to reduce uncertainty and costs for the Forest Service in managing timber projects and promote timber harvest for forest management goals on non-reserved land. The National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014 aims to create a predictable wood supply from National Forest System land to preserve jobs, generate revenue for counties, and strengthen rural economies. It defines a \"covered project\" as one involving the management or sale of national forest material within a Forest Management Emphasis Area, which excludes certain National Forest System land. The National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014 focuses on ensuring a consistent wood supply from National Forest System land to support jobs, county revenue, and rural economies. It defines \"national forest material\" as trees or forest products, emphasizing sawtimber and pulpwood, derived from National Forest System land. The term \"National Forest System\" excludes national grasslands and land utilization projects under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture under the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. SEC. 4. PROJECTS IN FOREST MANAGEMENT EMPHASIS AREAS. The Secretary may conduct covered projects in Forest Management Emphasis Areas, allowing the use of specific timber designation methods to ensure accountability for material removal. Management Emphasis Area is accountable for carrying out covered projects primarily through timber sale contracts. If alternative contracting methods are used, the Secretary must provide a written record explaining the reasons. The Secretary is also required to identify, prioritize, and treat total acreage in covered projects. The Secretary shall identify, prioritize, and carry out projects in Forest Management Emphasis Areas that treat at least 7,500,000 acres mechanically over a 15-year period. Within 60 days of assigning acreage treatment requirements, the Secretary will assign these requirements to individual units of the national forest system. The Forest Management Emphasis Areas of each unit of the National Forest System have acreage treatment requirements. These requirements cannot apply to more than 25 percent of the acreage to be treated in any unit during a 15-year period. The Secretary must comply with environmental analysis and public review processes for covered projects in these areas. The Secretary must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act by completing an environmental assessment for covered projects in Forest Management Emphasis Areas. This assessment includes studying the direct environmental effects and providing public notice and comment opportunities. The Secretary must complete an environmental assessment for covered projects within 180 days, limited to 100 pages. Relevant documents can be included by reference. Compliance with the Endangered Species Act is required. The Secretary must use qualified professionals from the Forest Service to make determinations under the Endangered Species Act. During a forest plan revision, the Secretary cannot reduce timber harvest acres unless necessary to prevent jeopardy under the Act. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW; ARBITRATION. Administrative review of covered projects must follow the special process outlined in the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. A pilot program in the Department of Agriculture allows for arbitration instead of judicial review for decisions made in the special administrative review process. This program is the only way to challenge projects in a Forest Management Emphasis Area for a 15-year period. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 outlines the arbitration process for administrative review of covered projects. A demand for arbitration must be filed within 30 days of the special administrative review decision. The arbitration process for administrative review of covered projects under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 requires a proposal with modifications sought, and allows for intervention by parties submitting public comments within 30 days of the arbitration demand. Multiple objectors can also participate in the arbitration process. Multiple objectors or intervening parties meeting requirements can submit a joint proposal for arbitration. The United States District Court appoints an arbitrator for arbitration proceedings. The arbitrator cannot modify any proposals submitted. An arbitrator appointed by the United States District Court selects a proposal for arbitration based on criteria that best meet the purpose and needs of the covered project as described in the environmental assessment. The decision of an arbitrator regarding a selection under clause (i)(II) is not a major Federal action, is binding, and is not subject to judicial review. The arbitration process must be completed within 90 days of filing a demand for arbitration. SEC. 6. DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE. Payments to Counties: The Secretary shall provide annual payments to counties where a covered project is carried out, equal to 25 percent of the amounts received for that fiscal year. This payment is in addition to any other payments the county receives under specific Acts. The Secretary will use amounts received from covered projects to make deposits into specific funds for projects on National Forest System land. Any remaining amounts will be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury. SEC. 7. PERFORMANCE MEASURES; REPORTING. The Secretary will develop performance measures to evaluate the achievement of the Act's purposes and minimum acreage requirements. Annual reports will be submitted to the Senate and House committees, detailing evaluation results and information on covered projects subject to administrative review and arbitration. The Act's authority will terminate 15 years after its enactment."
