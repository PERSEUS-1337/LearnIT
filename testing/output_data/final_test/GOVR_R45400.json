    "content": "The Impact Aid program, administered by the U.S. Department of Education, compensates local educational agencies for financial burdens resulting from federal activities like federal ownership of lands and enrollment of children whose parents work on federal property. LEAs are unable to collect taxes from these individuals, so Impact Aid provides compensation to offset the loss of tax revenue. The Impact Aid program, part of the ESEA, compensates LEAs for loss of tax revenue due to federal activities. The ESSA reauthorized and revised the program in 2015, moving it to Title VII. Payments include federal property, support for federally connected children, payments for children with disabilities, construction, and facilities maintenance. Additionally, the DOD administers a smaller set of Impact Aid programs. The \"DOD Impact Aid\" programs provide supplemental aid to LEAs serving children with parents on active duty in the uniformed services and children with severe disabilities. The report discusses payments under the Impact Aid program, recent appropriations, and the Impact Aid programs administered by DOD. Tables in Appendix A show appropriations data in constant 2018 dollars, and Appendix B provides a glossary of acronyms. The Impact Aid provisions reflect changes made by the ESSA and annual National updates. The ESEA Title VII Impact Aid program has undergone changes through the ESSA, NDAA, and L-HHS-ED appropriations acts. The most significant changes have been to payments for federal property (Section 7002) and basic support payments (Section 7003(b). Payments under Section 7002 compensate LEAs for federal property ownership, with grants ranging from less than $100 to several million dollars. In general, the federal government must have acquired the property after 1938, with the assessed value representing at least 10% of all real property within an LEA's boundaries. Approximately 195 LEAs receive annual Section 7002 payments, used for operating expenses. In FY2018, $73.3 million was appropriated for Section 7002, with payments ranging from $175 to $5.0 million. Section 7003 compensates eligible LEAs for enrolling federally connected children. In FY2018, Section 7003 provided basic support payments (BSPs) to 1,071 LEAs serving over 809,000 federally connected students, with $1.3 billion appropriated (89.8% of total Impact Aid appropriations). Payments ranged from $44 to $52.9 million. Additional payments were authorized for LEAs with federally connected children eligible for services under IDEA. In FY2018, Section 7003 provided basic support payments to 1,071 LEAs serving federally connected students, with $1.3 billion appropriated. Section 7007 provided funds for construction and facilities upgrading to certain LEAs serving children on Indian lands or children of military parents, with $17.4 million appropriated. In FY2018, Section 7008 provided funds for emergency repairs and capital improvements to schools owned by ED but operated by LEAs for military dependent children. $4.8 million was allocated for Section 7008, representing 0.3% of total Impact Aid appropriations. The report analyzes ESEA Title VII, including program administration sections like 7005 and 7010-7014, with Section 7001 outlining the purpose of the Impact Aid program. The Impact Aid program provides financial assistance to LEAs facing financial burdens due to federal activities, including educating federally connected children to meet state academic standards. The program aims to support LEAs with minimal federal or state involvement, specifically assisting LEAs with real property acquisition burdens, children of military personnel, and those in low-rent housing. Section 7002 of the Impact Aid program provides formula grants to compensate LEAs for federal property ownership, assisting with capital expenditures for construction and addressing difficulties in raising local revenue for capital projects. LEAs are eligible for payments if they can show that the federal government acquired property in the LEA since 1938 with a minimum assessed value requirement. The federal property acquired by LEAs is compensated through Section 7002 payments, with about 195 LEAs receiving these payments annually for general operating expenses. The NDAA in 2013 amended the formula for payments, which was later changed by the NDAA in 2015. The NDAA in 2015 changed the repeal date for the amendments to January 2, 2018, making them permanent. The ESSA also adjusted eligibility provisions for specific LEAs, determining maximum payments based on real property tax rates and estimated taxable value of federal property. When full funding is not available, a hold harmless formula ensures historical funding levels for LEAs. The federal property payment program provides funding to eligible LEAs based on previous payments received or average payments from previous years. A special payment is made to the Highland Falls-Fort Montgomery Central School District in New York. New applicants receive a \"foundation payment\" calculated based on specific criteria. In subsequent fiscal years, LEA's foundation payment remains the same as the first year of eligibility. Any remaining funds are distributed to LEAs based on prorated shares of maximum payments. Section 7002 payments have two caps to limit total payments. Grants under Section 7002 have caps to limit total payments. If an LEA's payment is reduced due to these caps and insufficient appropriations, the reduced funds are redistributed to other eligible LEAs. Caps are applied differently to LEAs eligible in FY2009 and newly eligible LEAs. Payments are used for operating expenses. Newly eligible LEAs are limited by caps in their first year of eligibility. Section 7003(b) authorizes payments to LEAs with federally connected children to offset increased expenses. To qualify, an LEA must have at least 400 such children or 3% of ADA. Only about 6% of LEAs nationwide receive these payments, with two types of recipients: regular LEAs and those receiving regular BSPs. For FY2018, there are two groups of LEAs receiving Impact Aid basic support grants (BSPs): regular LEAs and heavily impacted LEAs. The heavily impacted LEAs receive increased payment amounts due to being substantially impacted by federally connected children. The formula for calculating grants for these two groups differs based on specific criteria. The formula for Section 7003(b) of Impact Aid involves LEAs providing counts of federally connected children, applying weights to reflect differences in tax revenues and educational costs, determining a cost factor for each LEA, calculating maximum grants by multiplying the weighted child count by the cost factor, and adjusting payments based on available appropriations. Hold harmless provisions prevent significant payment decreases. Table 2 outlines categories of federally connected children and their assigned weights, with children on Indian lands receiving the highest weight. Children who live on federal property and have parents employed on federal property, in the uniformed services, or as accredited foreign military officers are known as \"3(a)\" or \"a\" children. Those with lower weights include children with parents in the uniformed services not living on federal property, foreign military officers not living on federal property, living in low-rent public housing, or whose parents work on federal property but do not live there. According to ED, \"b\" children create a lesser burden on LEAs compared to \"a\" children. Statute-specified weights are applied to counts for each category of federally connected children, ranging from 1.25 for children living on Indian lands to 0.05 for children whose parents are employed on federal property or live on federal property but not both. Special rules may alter the weights for heavily impacted LEAs. The weights assigned to federally connected children vary based on their living situations. For heavily impacted LEAs, special rules may adjust these weights. In a hypothetical example, a school district with 615 federally connected children would have a weighted count of 400 for funding purposes. This weighted student count is multiplied by the LCR, which is determined by specific criteria. The Local Contribution Rate (LCR) varies among LEAs and is multiplied by the weighted student count to determine the maximum Basic Support Payment (BSP) an LEA can receive. Heavily impacted LEAs have a different LCR calculation. If appropriations are sufficient, all eligible LEAs would receive their maximum BSPs, requiring approximately $2.2 billion in FY2018. In FY2018, appropriations for Section 7003(b) payments are below the $2.2 billion needed to provide maximum Basic Support Payments (BSP) to eligible LEAs. A mechanism distributes funds based on the impact level of LEAs, with a Learning Opportunity Threshold (LOT) payment calculated using the percentage of federally connected children and Section 7003(b) payments in an LEA's total current expenditures. The total percentage cannot exceed 100% and is multiplied by the maximum BSP. In FY2018, appropriations for Section 7003(b) payments are insufficient to provide maximum Basic Support Payments (BSP) to eligible LEAs. The LOT payment is calculated based on the percentage of federally connected children and Section 7003(b) payments in an LEA's total current expenditures, capped at 100%. If appropriations are not enough to cover full LOT payments, LEAs receive a percentage of their maximum BSP. In FY2018, appropriations are insufficient to provide maximum BSPs to eligible LEAs. Payments would be ratably increased but not exceed an LEA's maximum BSP. Special rules apply to heavily impacted LEAs. ESSA added a three-year hold harmless provision to prevent large decreases in payment amounts. If an LEA's payment decreases by 20% or more from the previous year, they would receive a hold harmless amount. If an LEA's payment decreases by 20% or more from the previous year, they would receive a hold harmless amount equal to 90% of the previous year's payment. This amount decreases to 85% in the following year and 80% in the third year. If funds are insufficient, hold harmless payments would be ratably reduced for all eligible LEAs. Additional provisions apply to heavily impacted LEAs. The ESSA modified the eligibility criteria for heavily impacted LEAs, eliminating the distinction between new and continuing LEAs. Beginning in FY2017, a heavily impacted LEA must fall into one of five categories. The ESSA modified the eligibility criteria for heavily impacted LEAs, eliminating the distinction between new and continuing LEAs. Beginning in FY2017, a heavily impacted LEA must meet specific requirements related to federal funding, student enrollment, per-pupil expenditure, and tax rates. An LEA qualifies as heavily impacted if it has a significant percentage of federally connected students and received funding for military housing privatization. Additionally, it must meet specific eligibility requirements related to student enrollment and federal funding. An LEA qualifies as heavily impacted if it meets specific eligibility requirements related to student enrollment, federal funding, per-pupil expenditure, tax rate, and previous eligibility for a heavily impacted payment in FY2001. Heavily impacted LEAs that no longer meet eligibility requirements may still receive payments for a certain period. Additionally, they can benefit from a three-year hold harmless provision if they become ineligible for payments. Eligibility for heavily impacted LEA status must be maintained for two consecutive years. Heavily impacted LEAs must maintain eligibility for two consecutive years to retain their status. Calculations for these LEAs differ in weights for federally connected children, maximum BSP based on 80% of state or national APPE, and a 100% LOT percentage if funds allow. In FY2018, heavily impacted LEAs were estimated to receive about $280 million, or 23.7% of total funding for basic support grants under Section 7003(b). These LEAs are projected to receive over three times the amount per child compared to regular Impact Aid LEAs. Table 2 lists LEAs eligible for heavily impacted payments in FY2018. These funds are not limited to specified uses like other federal education programs. The funds allocated under Section 7003 can be used for both current and capital expenditures, not limited to federally connected children. Payments are also authorized for LEAs serving federally connected children eligible for services under IDEA. Payment amounts are based on the number of eligible children with parents in specific categories. The funds must be used in accordance with state and local requirements. The Section 7003(d) payments are allocated for federally connected children with disabilities, based on specific criteria such as living with military or foreign officers. LEAs receiving these payments must use them to meet the needs of these children and comply with state and local regulations. The Section 7003 payments must be used to provide free appropriate public education to children living on Indian lands. LEAs must ensure equal participation in programs, involve parents and tribes in decision-making, and share relevant information with them. Parents of children and Indian tribes must have the opportunity to present their views on the LEA's education program. LEAs claiming Indian children for Section 7003 payments must maintain records to show compliance. Waivers can be granted if tribes are satisfied with educational services. Section 7004 requires the Secretary of Education to provide technical assistance to LEAs, parents, and tribes. Section 7007 provides funds for construction and facility repair and renovation to certain LEAs, including those with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services. These funds are used to make formula and competitive grants, but since FY2006, the awards have been specified to be either formula or competition in a given year. 40% of the funds appropriated under this section are subject to statutory provisions. Section 7007 provides funds for construction and facility repair to certain LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services. 40% of the funds are used for construction payments by formula to eligible LEAs. These LEAs must meet specific criteria to qualify for grants, with funds divided equally between those serving children with a parent on active duty and those serving children living on Indian lands. Section 7007 provides funds for construction and facility repair to certain LEAs with high percentages of children living on Indian lands or children with a parent on active duty in the uniformed services. Grants are calculated based on the total number of weighted student units of military children and children living on Indian lands. 60% of the appropriations are used for school facility emergency and modernization grants, with emergency grants focused on health and safety improvements and modernization grants aimed at supporting contemporary educational programs. The Secretary prioritizes emergency grants over modernization grants for construction and facility upgrades to support a contemporary educational program. Emergency grants are awarded to LEAs with school facility emergencies posing health or safety hazards to students and staff. Only emergency grants have been awarded since 2002, with top priority given to LEAs meeting specific criteria and eligible for formula grants under Section 7007. If emergency grants funds are available after awarding grants based on specific criteria, the next priority is for LEAs meeting certain requirements, including receiving a basic support payment under Section 7003 and having a significant percentage of children living on Indian land or with parents in the military. Individual schools not in eligible LEAs may also apply if they meet specific criteria. Since 2002, competitive grants have been awarded to LEAs based on specific criteria, such as having children living on Indian land or with parents in the military. The top priority for modernization grants is for LEAs meeting eligibility requirements under ESEA Title VII and having facility needs due to the presence of the federal government. The federal government awards grants to LEAs based on specific criteria, such as having children living on Indian land or with parents in the military. The top priority for modernization grants is for LEAs meeting eligibility requirements under ESEA Title VII and having facility needs due to the presence of the federal government. If funds are still available, grants are awarded to LEAs that meet additional criteria related to bond indebtedness and assessed property value. Emergency and modernization grants are available to individual schools not located inside an LEA if they meet specific criteria, such as having a significant percentage of children living on Indian land or with parents in the military. The Secretary considers factors like the LEA's ability to respond to emergencies or pay for modernization projects when awarding grants. Emergency and modernization grants are limited to 50% of the total project cost and cannot exceed $4 million over a four-year period for qualifying LEAs. The Secretary considers factors like the LEA's ability to issue bonds or being a heavily impacted LEA when awarding grants. Additionally, the percentage of nontaxable property and federally connected children in the LEA are also taken into account. The Secretary considers factors like severity of emergency or modernization need, overcrowding, technology limitations, and age of facility when awarding grants to LEAs. Competitive grants since 2002 have mostly been awarded as emergency grants to LEAs serving students on Indian land. Funding distribution has been altered since FY2006 appropriations acts. The distribution of Section 7007 grants has been affected by annual appropriations acts. FY2017 required competitive grants, while FY2018 mandated formula grants. The Administration prefers competitive grants for larger amounts to districts in need, but this results in fewer grantees compared to formula grants. Section 7008 provides funds for emergency repairs and capital projects. Since 1983, the Department of Defense (DOD) has taken on maintenance and renovation responsibilities for facilities owned by the Department of Education (ED) on domestic military bases serving children of active-duty parents. ED has transferred titles of 48 facilities to DOD as Domestic Dependents Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESSs), with DOD responsible for 12 of the remaining 21 facilities. ED is in the process of transferring ownership of these facilities to other entities as required by statutory language. The Department of Defense (DOD) is responsible for 12 facilities on military bases, while the Department of Education (ED) is responsible for nine facilities operated by Local Education Agencies (LEAs) for children of active-duty parents. ED is in the final stages of transferring titles to DOD and must gain consent from LEAs to accept ownership of the facilities. Many of the facilities operated by LEAs are in poor condition, requiring funding for repairs. In the FY2017 budget request, ED estimated needing $71.6 million to upgrade and transfer the facilities to LEAs. Impact Aid allows some funds received by LEAs to be considered as local funds for equalizing educational expenditures. State school finance equalization programs aim to reduce disparities in educational revenue by compensating Local Education Agencies (LEAs) based on their ability to raise funds. Alaska, Kansas, and New Mexico have approved equalization programs. The Secretary evaluates these programs based on disparities in Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) between LEAs. The goal is to address differences between LEAs at the 95th and 5th percentiles of student attendance. The Secretary evaluates State school finance equalization programs by comparing the Average Per Pupil Expenditure (APPE) of Local Education Agencies (LEAs) to determine if the difference is 25% or less. This assessment considers both LEA expenditures and student enrollment. The regulations provide examples of this test, such as ranking LEAs by expenditures per pupil to calculate the spending disparity percentage. The Supreme Court ruled that the procedures used by the Department of Education to determine educational expenditure equalization across Local Education Agencies were appropriate. Two LEAs in New Mexico sued over the implementation of the equalization formula, arguing that only considering expenditures, not student enrollment, would have resulted in fewer LEAs being eliminated from consideration. This would have prevented New Mexico from qualifying as an equalized state. Title VII of the Impact Aid program includes sections related to program administration and function. Section 7005 outlines the process for LEAs to apply for payments. Section 7010 covers federal administration requirements, including child eligibility and timely payments. Section 7011 addresses administrative hearings and judicial review. Section 7012 includes provisions for forgiving overpayments under Title VII. Section 7013 provides definitions for the program. Section 7013 of Title VII provides definitions for the Impact Aid program, while Section 7014 authorizes appropriations for Title VII payments. Appropriations for Impact Aid are made through the annual L-HHS-ED appropriations act, including additional funding for LEAs serving children of parents on active duty in the uniformed services. Detailed information on Impact Aid funding from FY2010 to FY2019 is provided, with Table 5 detailing the most recent appropriations. Table 5 shows the recent appropriations for Impact Aid from FY2010 to FY2019, with an overall increase of 13.3% or $170 million. Payments for federally connected children (Section 7003(b)) increased by 14.3%, while payments for federal property (Section 7002) increased by 10.6%. Payments for children with disabilities, facilities maintenance, and construction each decreased slightly. Federally connected children accounted for over 90% of Impact Aid appropriations in FY2018, with BSPs alone making up 90.0% of the total. In FY2018 to FY2019, Impact Aid appropriations increased by 2.3%, with the majority going to BSPs and payments for federal property. The President's budget for FY2019 proposed a $585 million reduction in funding, including a $517 million cut to BSPs due to fiscal constraints. The Impact Aid program has been in place for over 60 years, allowing LEAs to adjust to the loss of property from their tax rolls. However, some LEAs receiving funds may not meet eligibility requirements, especially after consolidation. Unlike other federal education programs, Impact Aid is not forward funded, meaning funds are only available at the start of the fiscal year. ESEA Section 7014 authorizes appropriations for Impact Aid payments for FY2017 through FY2020. For FY2019, appropriations exceed authorized levels for federal property and BSPs. Other Impact Aid payments match authorized levels. The DOD Impact Aid programs, Supplemental Assistance and for LEAs serving military dependent children with severe disabilities, have appropriations matching authorized levels for FY2019. These programs are funded through the annual National Defense Authorization Act and receive lower authorizations compared to ED-administered Impact Aid programs. Funds are appropriated in the annual DOD appropriations acts under operation and maintenance for department-wide activities. The Supplemental Assistance program, also known as \"DOD Supplemental Impact Aid,\" provides funds to LEAs with a significant number of military students. Eligible LEAs receive funds if they would be unable to provide education equivalent to other schools without the additional funding. Around 120 districts benefit from this program according to the U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity. The DOD Education Activity provides funds to LEAs for children with severe disabilities whose parents are on active duty. The funds are reimbursable and can be used without restriction. LEAs must serve at least two severely disabled students with a parent in the military to receive funding. The DOD Education Activity provides reimbursable funds to LEAs for children with severe disabilities. The payment is based on the expenditures made by the LEA on behalf of the child that exceed the state's average per-pupil expenditure. The DOD Education Activity provides funds to LEAs for children with severe disabilities based on expenditures exceeding the state's average per-pupil expenditure. If funds are insufficient, payments to all eligible LEAs are reduced equally. Approximately 40 to 50 LEAs receive funds annually, with appropriations ranging from $30 million to $50 million in recent years.
