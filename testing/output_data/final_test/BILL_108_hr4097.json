    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise statement introducing the title and findings of a particular section. The \"Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act of 2004\" recognizes colorectal cancer as a significant health issue in the United States, with high mortality rates if not detected early. It highlights the importance of early diagnosis, as survival rates drastically decrease once the disease has metastasized. Regular colorectal cancer screening can lead to a significant reduction in deaths from the disease. However, many private insurance health plans do not cover the full range of screening tests, which can act as a barrier to care. Ensuring coverage for all colorectal cancer tests is crucial for increasing screening rates and saving lives. SEC. 2. COVERAGE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING under TITLE XXIX--MISCELLANEOUS HEALTH COVERAGE in the Public Health Service Act ensures coverage for all colorectal cancer screening tests. Coverage for colorectal cancer screening is mandated for individuals aged 50 and over, as well as those under 50 who are at high risk for the disease. Screening methods must align with specified criteria. Health insurance must cover colorectal cancer screening methods deemed appropriate by a physician treating the individual, as specified by the Secretary or relevant organizations with expertise in the field. Health insurance coverage for colorectal cancer screening methods must align with specified frequencies outlined in relevant regulations or determined by the Secretary based on new scientific knowledge and expert recommendations in the field. The group health plan must comply with notice requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. State laws providing greater protections for participants and beneficiaries in connection with group health insurance coverage are not preempted. Definitions and enforcement provisions of title XXVII apply to this section. ERISA amendments are made to Subpart B of part 7 of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. State laws offering more protection for participants in group health insurance are not overridden. SEC. 714. COVERAGE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING. Coverage for Colorectal Cancer Screening requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to cover screening for individuals aged 50 and over, as well as those under 50 who are at high risk for colorectal cancer. High risk is defined as per the Social Security Act. The screening methods covered must meet specified requirements. The health insurance issuer must cover colorectal cancer screening methods deemed appropriate by a physician treating the participant, as specified by the Secretary or recommended by expert organizations in the field. The health insurance issuer must cover colorectal cancer screening methods at a frequency specified by the Secretary or expert organizations in the field to ensure effectiveness. The requirements of this section regarding colorectal cancer screening are considered a material modification in the health plan, necessitating notice to plan participants. Technical amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act are also made. Section 732(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended by adding \"sections 711 and 714\". The table of contents in the Act is also updated to include a new item after section 713. Coverage for colorectal cancer screening is added to Part B of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act. The provisions of section 2901(a) apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. A health insurance issuer must comply with notice requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. A technical amendment is made to the Public Health Service Act. Effective dates are specified for group health plans. Effective Dates: Group health plans must comply with the amendments starting from plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2005. Individual health insurance coverage must adhere to the amendments from January 1, 2005 onwards. Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services will coordinate regulations to ensure consistency. The Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services must coordinate policies to enforce requirements consistently and avoid duplication of efforts."
