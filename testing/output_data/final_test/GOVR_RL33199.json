    "content": "Personal data security breaches are on the rise, with hackers targeting various types of computers to steal sensitive information like Social Security numbers and credit card details. These breaches can occur due to illegal hacking or careless business practices, leading to identity theft risks for individuals. An example of this was the 2006 incident where 26.5 million veterans' personal data was compromised due to a stolen laptop. Identity theft is a common type of fraud that has increased due to the internet. It involves acquiring someone's identity through theft or hacking and using it for financial gain or to avoid detection. This crime can include account takeover, opening new accounts, or using debit/credit cards extensively. Stage 3 of identity theft involves the discovery of the theft, which can take a long time to uncover, ranging from six months to several years. The crime is not limited to just one act but involves a variety of other crimes such as check and card fraud, financial crimes, telemarketing and internet scams, auto theft, counterfeiting, and forgery. Identity theft involves a variety of crimes such as telemarketing scams, auto theft, counterfeiting, and forgery. Investigating the different types of identity theft related crimes can be challenging, especially determining if the victim's identity has truly been stolen in cases like credit card fraud. If the offender works with an accomplice and steals additional identifying documents, the basic elements for stealing an individual's identity are present. The McAfee Avert Labs white paper from January 2007 highlights a significant increase in global identity theft trends, with personal data for millions of people disappearing each year. Despite this, the number of complaints remains low, indicating a lack of full acknowledgment of losses. The implementation of a California law in July 2003, requiring notice of security breaches to affected individuals, has led to increased awareness of these breaches. Thirty-five states have since enacted similar legislation to ensure companies disclose security breaches involving personal data. Legislation and state security freeze laws require disclosure of security breaches involving personal information. Identity theft victims spend significant time clearing their names and restoring credit ratings. The total number of lost or exposed personal records has surpassed 100 million, raising concerns about the significance of tracking data breaches. The threat of identity theft from data losses is being exaggerated, according to Fred H. Cate from Indiana University. Data loss represents the potential for identity theft, which is a long-term problem as personal information remains unchanged. Once exposed, names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth can be used for various fraudulent activities. The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 established the FTC to handle complaints and assist victims of identity theft. In 2007, credit card fraud was the most common form of identity theft reported, followed by phone, bank, and employment fraud. The FTC, Department of Justice, Secret Service, U.S. Postal Service, and Social Security Administration, along with state attorneys general and nonprofit organizations, are involved in data privacy investigations. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse maintains a chronology of data breaches, while US-CERT monitors cybersecurity trends and threats. US-CERT is monitoring trends in acquiring personally identifiable information by malicious users. Phishing accounted for 75% of reported security threats, with a significant increase in reports from FY2006 to FY2007. Other categories included investigations, incidents involving PII, malware, equipment theft/loss, policy violations, and suspicious network activity. In reports to Congress, GAO has highlighted information security as a high-risk issue for the government. Many agencies have significant weaknesses in information security controls, including access controls and configuration management controls. Organizations can reduce risks by detecting and responding to incidents promptly. The FBI reported the loss or theft of 160 laptop computers in February 2007. The FBI reported the loss or theft of 160 laptop computers in less than four years, with some containing sensitive information. Many federal agencies experienced data security breaches, highlighting inadequate security controls. In FY2006, various agencies including the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation, among others, reported incidents of potentially compromised data. The State Department faced numerous hacking attacks in FY2006, with 5,146 incidents reported to the Department of Homeland Security. This marked a significant increase from the previous year, with unauthorized access and malicious computer code being major concerns. The federal government's challenges include the sensitive information it holds, the mobile nature of its workforce, and the use of contractors. Around 140,000 federal workers had clearance to connect to government systems from home in a 2004 survey. The House Government Reform Committee summarized federal agencies' loss or compromise of personal information since January 2003. Every agency experienced breaches, with agencies not always aware of the extent of information lost or affected individuals. In response, the Office of Management and Budget issued new security guidelines in June 2006, requiring federal agencies to implement measures to protect sensitive personal information, including encryption. The President's Identity Theft Task Force, established in 2006, requires federal agencies to encrypt all data on laptops and handheld devices, implement two-factor authentication, and automatically sever remote connections after 30 minutes of inactivity. Recommendations include reducing the use of Social Security numbers and establishing national standards for data protection in the private sector. In June 2006, a research center was launched to study identity fraud. The Center for Identity Management and Information Protection aims to advance research on identity management, information sharing, and data protection. Congress considered legislation in the 109th Congress to address data security. In the 109th Congress, legislation was considered to address data security after high-profile breaches at financial firms and data brokers. Multiple measures were introduced in 2005 and 2006, but none were brought to the floor for a vote. For information on proposed data security legislation in the 110th Congress, refer to CRS Report RL33273, Data Security: Federal Legislative Approaches. Tables 1 through 5 summarize selected data security or identity theft breaches reported in the press since 2000, with more than half occurring at institutions of higher education. Security practices, particularly password protections, are noted to be lax in these breaches. In September 2006, Louisiana State University (LSU) entered into a unique agreement with Equifax Inc. to provide free credit report monitoring and identity theft insurance to students, faculty, and staff. Academic institutions are vulnerable to data breaches due to the abundance of sensitive information on their computer equipment. Other common targets for identity theft include financial institutions and government agencies. The AARP analyzed security breaches from 2005 to 2006, revealing the prevalence of such incidents. The analysis of security breaches from January 1, 2005 through May 26, 2006 by the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) found that hackers were responsible for a third of all breaches, with educational institutions being the most likely to report breaches. Physical theft of computers and improper display of sensitive information were also common causes of security breaches. The curr_chunk discusses various reports on data security, identity theft laws, information brokers, and federal laws related to identity theft. The reports cover topics such as federal and state laws, legislative approaches, state penalties, information security, and internet connections."
