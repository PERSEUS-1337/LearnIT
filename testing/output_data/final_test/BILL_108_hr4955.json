    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Children's Listbroker Privacy Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that commercial list brokers routinely sell detailed information on children, including names, addresses, ages, and other data for marketing purposes. This data is available on children as young as two years old, allowing marketers to target specific demographics. Marketing databases can be large, covering millions of children and include information on ethnicity, family income, hobbies, and interests. The annual spending on marketing to children is estimated at $12 billion. Several Federal statutes, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, restrict the collection and disclosure of information about children or students. However, Federal law does not significantly limit the commercial sale or resale of such data when collected outside the scope of these statutes. This creates an economic incentive to find new ways to collect and sell children's information, potentially circumventing existing laws. Marketers and list brokers use various means to gather data about children, including names and addresses. Restriction on sale or purchase of children's personal information. It is unlawful to sell or purchase personal information about a child without parental consent or certification. Certification is required for the sale of personal information about a child, stating the purpose of use and prohibiting marketing to or by the purchaser. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
