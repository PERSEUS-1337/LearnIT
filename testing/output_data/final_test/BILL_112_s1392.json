    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011\" and includes a legislative stay provision. The \"EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011\" mandates the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to propose regulations for various types of boilers and incinerator units, establishing control technology standards and identifying suitable materials for combustion. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 requires the Administrator to propose regulations for boilers and incinerator units to determine solid waste for emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. Regulations must be finalized within 15 months of enactment or a later date determined by the Administrator. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 mandates the replacement of certain rules related to emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act. These rules are to be treated as if they never took effect and new regulations must be proposed within a specified timeframe. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 requires the replacement of emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act. Certain provisions of the Act do not apply until the specified effective date of the new regulations. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 sets compliance dates for new emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 establishes compliance dates for new emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act, ensuring a minimum 5-year compliance period after the regulation's effective date. Compliance dates consider costs, health and environmental impacts, energy requirements, and feasibility of implementation. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 sets compliance dates for new emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act. The Act includes provisions for procuring, installing, and testing control equipment, considering equipment availability, suppliers, labor, and potential net employment impacts. The date of proposing a regulation for emission standards is crucial for defining new sources under the Clean Air Act. The EPA Regulatory Relief Act of 2011 establishes compliance dates for new emissions standards for boilers and incinerator units under the Clean Air Act. It does not restrict the provisions of paragraphs (3)(B) and (4) of section 112(i) of the Clean Air Act. SEC. 4. ENERGY RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION. SEC. 4. ENERGY RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION. In promulgating regulations under section 2(a) related to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Administrator shall adopt specific definitions and identify nonhazardous secondary material. The Administrator shall publish a list of nonhazardous secondary materials that are not solid waste when combusted in units designed for energy recovery. When combusted in energy recovery units, biomass forms such as agricultural and forest-derived biomass, biomass crops, bagasse, crop and tree residues, hulls, seeds, spent grains, cotton byproducts, corn and peanut residues, rice milling residues, cellulosic biofuels, and ethanol byproducts are included. Byproducts of ethanol fermentation processes, hogged fuel (wood pallets, sawdust, wood pellets), wood debris from forests and urban areas, resinated wood and other biomass-derived residuals, treated wood (creosote-treated, borate-treated, sap-stained), residuals from wastewater treatment with significant Btu value. Processed biomass derived from construction and demolition debris, animal manure, tall oil, turpentine derivatives, biogases from biomass, and paper recycling residuals are all considered as eligible biomass materials for energy production. The curr_chunk lists various materials eligible for energy production, including animal manure, paraffin, petroleum byproducts, tire-derived fuel, foundry sand, coal residuals, shredded cloth, latex paint water, nonchlorinated plastics, and recycled oil. The Administrator can add nonhazardous secondary materials to the list for energy production after public notice and comment, based on necessity or a petition. The Administrator can respond to petitions within 120 days and may decline to add materials to the list if regulation under the Clean Air Act would not adequately protect public health. SEC. 5. OTHER PROVISIONS. In promulgating rules under section 2(a), the Administrator must ensure emissions standards for existing and new sources can be met under actual operating conditions. Regulatory alternatives authorized under the Clean Air Act must be considered, with the imposition of the least burdensome option. The Administrator must impose the least burdensome option when promulgating rules under the Clean Air Act and Executive Order 13563."
