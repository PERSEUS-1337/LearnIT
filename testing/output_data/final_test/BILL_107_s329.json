Congress finds that the migration, immigration, and settlement of the population of the United States, broadly termed the \"peopling of America,\" is characterized by the movement of groups of people across boundaries and their interactions, with each group making unique contributions to American history, culture, art, and life. The diversity of the American population has contributed to the vitality of the United States in various aspects such as spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and economic. Embracing diversity has strengthened the national fabric and unified the country in its values, institutions, experiences, goals, and accomplishments. The National Park Service's thematic framework ensures the representation of the full diversity of American history and prehistory.

Despite the 70,000 listings on the National Register of Historic Places, sites related to the exploration and settlement of the United States by various cultures are underrepresented. The Act aims to promote understanding of the contributions of diverse groups in shaping the United States.
