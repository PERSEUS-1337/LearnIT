    "content": "The Act aims to establish a new flood control plan for the Passaic River basin in New Jersey, replacing the Passaic River Tunnel project. It also seeks to uphold existing restoration measures for the basin. The Act defines key terms related to flood control in the Passaic River basin, including hazard mitigation, oversight committee, preferred alternative, project, and qualified acquisition. The Act defines \"qualified acquisition\" as the purchase of flood-damaged property by the Secretary of the Army in cooperation with government entities after at least 2 floods, including the major 1984 flood in the Passaic River basin. SEC. 3. COMPONENTS OF PASSAIC RIVER BASIN FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary will acquire, demolish, and remove structures in the floodway of the Central Passaic River basin damaged in floods, with cost sharing between Federal and non-Federal entities. The floodway land will be stabilized and included in an ecological restoration program, potentially creating wetlands. After vacating the land, it will be held in perpetuity by a Federal or State agency and managed as open space. The Blue Acres Program of New Jersey will guide the process, with land acquisition credits remaining in effect. The Secretary will acquire, demolish, and remove additional structures in the 10-year floodplain of the Central Passaic River. The Secretary will acquire, demolish, and remove structures in the 10-year floodplain of the Central Passaic River, with funding shared between Federal, State, and property owners. Criteria for acquisition and floodproofing will be developed by the Oversight Committee. The Secretary will floodproof structures in the Central Passaic River basin's floodplain to the 50-year level in high-risk areas, with a cost-sharing of 55% Federal, 20% State, and 25% property owner. In the remaining floodplain up to the 100-year flood elevation, information on flood management techniques will be provided. Additionally, wetlands in the floodways of the Great Piece Meadows will be acquired to supplement existing wetlands. The Secretary will acquire strategic land to supplement wetlands and upland transition areas with significant wildlife or natural values. The wetlands and transition areas will be managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or a State agency to ensure ecological integrity as wildlife habitat and components of the Passaic River basin's hydrological cycle. The Secretary will acquire strategic land in New Jersey and New York to prevent flooding, with an emphasis on the Highlands Province. Cooperation with various agencies is required. Additionally, land will be acquired in specific areas like the High Mountain area in Wayne and the urban area of the Molly Ann's Brook project in North Haledon to prevent flooding. The Secretary will complete the Passaic River Restoration Project from Little Falls to Newark Bay, New Jersey, including acquisition of riparian land and parkland development. Urban spaces like Hilltop in Essex County will also be acquired. Streambank restoration for flood control in Passaic River Main Stem, New Jersey and New York, is also part of the project. The Water Resources Development Act of 1990 establishes the Joseph G. Minish Passaic River Waterfront Park and Historic Area in New Jersey. The EPA will assist in remedial actions for combined sewer overflows in the lower Passaic River Basin. An Oversight Committee with 14 members, including a representative from the Corps of Engineers, will oversee the implementation of the preferred alternative.

The Oversight Committee for the District Water Supply Commission includes representatives from environmental organizations and the Governor of New York appoints a representative for the State of New York. The committee supervises and makes recommendations on the preferred alternative, as well as provides guidance on appropriations. The Oversight Committee supervises flood management projects, focusing on nonstructural solutions that preserve river ecosystems. They hold regular meetings and will terminate once the preferred project is completed. The committee reports annually to the Governors of New Jersey and New York, as well as Congress, on project achievements and obstacles. The Oversight Committee supervises flood management projects in the Passaic River basin, focusing on nonstructural solutions.
