The Federal banking agencies must create consumer protection regulations within six months of the enactment of the Depository Institution Consumer Protection Act of 1997. These regulations apply to nondeposit product sales, solicitations, advertising, or offers by retail depository institutions or their affiliates, providing additional consumer protections as deemed necessary. The Federal banking agencies must consult with each other and the SEC to create regulations for nondeposit products, which include investment and insurance products not insured by deposits. Nondeposit products do not include loans, extensions of credit, or letters of credit by insured depository institutions. The regulations prescribed for nondeposit products exclude certain instruments or products as defined by the Federal banking agencies. Sales practices for nondeposit products must adhere to anticoercion rules prohibiting conditional credit extensions based on purchasing nondeposit products. Specific rules prohibit depository institutions and their affiliates from marketing nondeposit products to consumers while credit applications are pending, unless done separately by mail. Standards are set to ensure that nondeposit products sold to consumers are suitable based on disclosed financial information. Federal banking agencies consider the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers when prescribing standards for the sale of investments. Regulations include provisions for disclosures and advertising in connection with the sale of nondeposit products. Requirements for disclosures and advertising in the sale of nondeposit products include informing customers orally and in writing about the uninsured status, lack of guarantee, and investment risk associated with the products. \"Investment risk is associated with investment products, including possible loss of principal. Approval of credit by a retail depository institution cannot be conditioned on the purchase of a nondeposit product or an agreement not to obtain such a product from an unaffiliated entity.\" \"In prescribing requirements for disclosure of nondeposit products, adjustments must be made for various purchase methods. Retail institutions must obtain consumer acknowledgement of receiving required disclosures at the time of purchase.\" The rule of evidence for disclosures creates a presumption of delivery. Prohibition on misleading practices related to nondeposit products and investment risks must be followed. Regulations must separate banking and nonbanking activities. Regulations must ensure physical segregation of deposit and credit activities from nondeposit product activity, including clear delineation of transaction settings and prohibition of certain persons from selling nondeposit products. Regulations prohibit individuals accepting deposits from selling nondeposit products or offering investment advice on them. Referrals to nondeposit product sellers can only be made if the customer explicitly requests it. Regulations prohibit individuals accepting deposits from selling nondeposit products or offering investment advice on them. Referrals to nondeposit product sellers can only be made if the customer explicitly requests it, and the person accepting deposits must disclose that the product is not insured and not receive any compensation for the referral. Qualification requirements and training are also necessary for individuals selling nondeposit products on behalf of the institution. The regulations require individuals accepting deposits to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a broker or dealer, or meet equivalent qualification and training requirements determined by Federal banking agencies. In the case of insurance sales, qualification must be in accordance with regulations from Federal banking regulators or state law. The Federal banking regulators must establish a consumer enforcement mechanism to address non-frivolous complaints regarding violations of regulations. This mechanism should involve an impartial decision-maker, allow consumers to recover from violating institutions, and provide a written statement of the decision basis. No insured depository institution or affiliate can use the institution's name, title, or logo in connection with nondeposit products. Retail depository institutions are prohibited from disclosing consumer financial information to non-retail affiliates or subsidiaries. No affiliate of a company that is not an insured depository institution can disclose consumer information to an affiliate that is an insured depository institution unless the consumer has been informed and given the opportunity to opt out. The Fair Credit Reporting Act governs the sharing of information among affiliates, with some exceptions. The section does not limit the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission, self-regulatory organizations, State insurance commissioners, or Federal securities and State insurance laws. It also does not affect any regulations prescribed by these entities.
