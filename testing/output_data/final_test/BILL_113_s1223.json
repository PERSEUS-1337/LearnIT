    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma Research Resource Act of 2013\". It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that cavernous angioma affects 1,500,000 people in the US, is a blood vessel disease with lesions in the brain and spinal cord, requires costly imaging for detection, and may not show symptoms until later stages. Individuals with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research means treatment options are mainly brain and spinal surgery, but some patients are not eligible for surgery. A lack of knowledgeable physicians can lead to delays in diagnosis and care. The \"common Hispanic mutation\" is linked to the disease. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world, affecting thousands of individuals with ancestry in the state. Other states with high rates of the disease due to the common Hispanic mutation include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. There is a need to identify institutions capable of running clinical trials for this brain disorder to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include research activities for cavernous angioma under SEC. 409K. This brain disorder affects populations with Hispanic ancestry in states like New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Clinical trials are needed to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma. The Director of NIH will expand and intensify programs for cavernous angioma research through grants to public or nonprofit entities. Research will include basic, clinical, and translational studies on proteomic, pharmacological, and cell aspects of the disease. The NIH will fund research on cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) molecules, animal models for cavernous angioma, early detection and treatment of cavernous angioma, biological mechanisms for lesion genesis and bleeding, and novel interventions to prevent lesion development and bleeding. The NIH will fund research on genetic variation contributions to clinical presentation, biomarkers for phenotypic variation, improving quality of life for individuals with cavernous angioma, and clinical training programs. Additionally, they will facilitate research resources and clinical trial preparedness through coordination of a clinical and research coordinating center. The coordinating center will lead a multi-site clinical drug trial for cavernous angioma, providing a model for additional trial sites, facilitating research for a cure, and enhancing medical care nationwide. The center must have the infrastructure for hosting trials, translational projects, patient education, outreach, and awareness programs. The patient outreach and awareness initiatives include launching a national multimedia campaign, distributing education materials through physician offices, educating school nurses for early detection in high-risk areas, and coordinating regular patient programs. The curr_chunk involves coordinating patient and family-oriented educational conferences, developing electronic health teaching tools, establishing communication with other research institutions, and demonstrating clinical expertise. The curr_chunk focuses on identifying clinical centers with expertise in cavernous angioma management, a sufficient number of eligible patients, and a telehealth infrastructure to support remote communities for participation in a multi-site clinical drug trial. Participation centers with institutional infrastructure for clinical trials and collaborations internationally to enhance medical research for cavernous angioma. Eligible coordinating and participation centers must have clinical expertise in cavernous angioma management and a sufficient number of eligible patients, with a focus on unique subpopulations like Common Hispanic Mutation and CCM3 gene mutation carriers. They are also required to establish or expand training programs for medical and allied health clinicians and scientists. The Director of NIH may use existing research resources and encourage their use for developing therapies for individuals with cavernous angioma, as well as promoting their inclusion in clinical trials. The Director of NIH may establish a consortium to enhance research efforts on cavernous angioma by promoting communication and collaboration among partner agencies, organizations, and individuals. SEC. 4. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cavernous Angioma Surveillance and Research Programs are established under section 317U of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary may award grants to entities for data collection on cavernous angioma, providing technical assistance instead of cash. Additionally, a National Cavernous Angioma Epidemiology Program may award grants for this purpose. The Secretary may award grants to entities for epidemiological activities on cavernous angioma, including a national surveillance program coordinated with the National Institutes of Health. The Food and Drug Administration will support clinical trials for cavernous angioma by expediting investigational new drug applications and designating drugs as orphan drugs for rare subpopulations with specific gene mutations. Additionally, a report will be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress each January regarding the implementation of the Act and its amendments."
