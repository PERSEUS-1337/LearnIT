    "content": "President Obama's FY2012 budget request for Energy and Water Development was released in February 2011. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2011 in April 2011. The House approved a bill in June 2011 allocating $30.634 billion, lower than the President's request of $36.505 billion. The bill was passed by the House in July 2011. The Senate later funded the programs at $31.626 billion in September 2011. The House and Senate passed various bills in 2011 to fund government programs at the FY2011 level. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 included $32.010 billion for Energy and Water Development Programs, with emergency funding of $1.724 billion for the Corps passed separately. The Energy and Water Development bill (H.R. 3672, P.L. 112-77) passed in 2011 includes funding for various agencies and projects such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Tables provide budget totals for FY2005 to FY2012 and details for each title of the bill for FY2011-FY2012. The Energy and Water Development bill (H.R. 3672, P.L. 112-77) passed in 2011 includes funding for agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, and independent agencies. Tables provide budget totals for FY2005 to FY2012 and details for each title of the bill for FY2011-FY2012, including discussions on key issues in major programs. The Department of Energy's funding for subprograms in FY2011 was not detailed in P.L. 112-10, but the House report for the FY2012 bill, H.R. 2354, provided funding levels for FY2011. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, under the civil works program, plans, builds, operates, and maintains water resources facilities with significant economic and environmental impacts. The Army Corps of Engineers faces funding challenges due to recent changes, including reductions in funding and the drawdown of supplemental funding. The Corps received an increase in total funding for FY2011 compared to the President's request. Flooding events in 2011 strained financial resources. The FY2011 appropriation for the Corps was $5.055 billion before accounting for rescissions. The FY2011 appropriation for the Corps was $5.055 billion, $174 million more than the President's request. The FY2012 budget proposed reductions, with the House passing $4.763 billion for the Corps and recommending $1.029 billion for emergency flood-fighting activities. The Senate recommended $4.864 billion and $1.044 billion in emergency funding. The final enacted bill provided $5.002 billion, with an additional $1.724 billion in supplemental funding from P.L. 112-77. The Corps funding is often debated in Congress, with about 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. Projects can be added during congressional consideration, subject to earmark disclosure rules. In 2011, major flooding events led to increased flood-fighting efforts by the Corps. The Corps has increased flood-fighting activities and expenditures due to flooding events in 2011. Without additional appropriations, the Corps would fund these activities through transfers from ongoing projects. The House-passed bill included $1.029 billion in emergency funding for flood fighting activities, while the Senate Appropriations Committee provided $1.044 billion in additional funding for disaster relief. The Senate did not transfer prior appropriations for disaster relief funding, causing debate over a continuing resolution to fund the government. Congress passed a separate bill providing $1.724 billion in funding for the Corps with no offsets. The backlog of authorized Corps projects without funding ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion. Estimates of the backlog for Corps projects range from $11 billion to over $80 billion, raising policy questions about prioritization and funding. The Administration's FY2012 budget requested limited funding for new projects, with the House and final enacted bill providing no funding for new starts. Additionally, two congressionally authorized \"trust funds\" are available for funding. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund and the Inland Waterway Trust Fund are two congressionally authorized trust funds administered by the Corps, requiring annual appropriations. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund has a surplus balance, while the Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a shortfall. The Harbor Maintenance Tax was enacted in 1986 to recover operation and maintenance costs at U.S. harbors, with revenues deposited into the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for dredging activities. In 1990, Congress increased the HMT rate to 12.5 cents per $100 of cargo value to lower the federal deficit. The HMTF has a surplus due to increased collections from rising import volume. The maritime industry seeks to spend down the surplus for harbor dredging. Some harbor channels are not being maintained, causing issues for ships with deep drafts. Fishing vessels and recreational craft also face insufficient maintenance dredging. The Administration's FY2012 budget requested $789 million from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF), potentially reducing funding for other Energy and Water Development activities. Expenditures for construction and rehabilitation projects on inland waterways are cost-shared between the federal government and users through the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF), which currently has a balance of less than $100 million. The IWTF has a balance of less than $100 million, with funding for eligible work exceeding available funds. Congress provided additional federal funding in FY2009 and FY2010, as well as through the ARRA, to ensure solvency. FY2011 appropriations for inland waterway projects were limited to current-year fuel tax revenues. Without new revenue sources, the number of projects in FY2012 will be restricted. The Administration proposed replacing the fuel tax with a lock user fee. The Administration proposed replacing the current fuel tax with a lock user fee to increase user-generated revenues, but this was criticized by Congress and not enacted. User groups also proposed changes for inland waterway funding, including an increase in federal share for projects, but Congress has not acted on this proposal. The Corps is actively involved in preventing Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. The Corps is a lead agency in Asian carp monitoring and prevention efforts, with $27 million in funding for FY2012 to combat Asian carp. This includes $24 million for electronic barriers on the CSSC and $3 million for the GLMRIS study. Some groups want the study expedited for an additional cost. The final appropriations bill did not mention the Asian carp program. The Energy and Water bill typically includes funding for restoration of the Everglades in South Florida, including the Corps component of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Program. Recent reductions in state funding levels for Everglades restoration may lead to increased scrutiny of federal funding in the coming years. The FY2012 Obama Administration request for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work was $163 million, but the House-passed bill reduced funding by $32 million. The House-passed bill reduced funding for the Corps component of Everglades restoration by $32 million, citing inequitable funding compared to the larger Corps budget. However, the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include this reduction, and the final enacted bill funded the original request of $163 million. The Administration's FY2012 budget requested no funding for four of the nine Corps Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs), including Section 14, Section 103, Section 107, and Section 208. The Administration proposed reprogramming $23 million from certain programs to fund some CAPs, but the final bill provided over $43 million for the CAPs. The FY2012 request included reductions in various categories, leading to significantly less funding for projects compared to prior years. In FY2012, funding for projects saw reductions compared to prior years, with additional funds allocated for navigation and flood/storm damage reduction projects. The House and Senate provided extra funding for ongoing work in the O&M account, with specific allocations for navigation projects. The final bill included funding for various categories, with instructions for the Corps to report back to Congress within 45 days. The Energy and Water Development bill includes funding for the Central Utah Project (CUP) and the Bureau of Reclamation, totaling $1.051 billion, a decrease of $45 million from FY2011. The Obama Administration requested $33 million for the CUP Completion Account in FY2012, $1 million more than FY2011. The Bureau of Reclamation requested $1.018 billion, $44 million less than FY2011. The FY2012 request for the Bureau of Reclamation included a $52.8 million offset for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, resulting in a net discretionary authority of $965.6 million. The Water and Related Resources Account, Reclamation's largest account, covers various programs and projects. The Obama Administration requested $805.2 million for this account, a decrease of $106.5 million from FY2011. The House-passed bill recommended $822 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $885 million. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and other purposes. They oversee over 300 storage reservoirs in 17 states, serving 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. Reclamation is a major water supplier and hydroelectric power producer, also offering flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. The Bureau of Reclamation manages water projects in the West, providing water for irrigation and other purposes. They oversee storage reservoirs in 17 states, serving farmland and people. Reclamation offers flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. The CVP in California is one of Reclamation's largest water projects, facing challenges like water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. In previous appropriations bills, attempts were made to prevent Reclamation from implementing Biological Opinions (BiOps) that restrict CVP operations due to their impact on fish species. For example, in FY2011, the House included a provision prohibiting federal funds for BiOps implementation. Similar attempts were made in FY2010 but not enacted. Measures have been passed to mitigate these restrictions, such as authorizing water transfers among CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The San Joaquin River Restoration Fund, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, is funded through a reallocation of Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and other sources. Planned actions for FY2012 include interim flows release and environmental compliance for channel improvements. Funding for the San Joaquin River settlement has been controversial in the past. In FY2011 appropriations, the House-passed continuing resolution included a requirement that no funding be available for some components of the settlement agreement, but this provision was not enacted. Legislation (H.R. 1837) was introduced to repeal some portions of the settlement. For FY2012, Reclamation proposed $9 million for discretionary funds for restoration activities and $24 million in other receipts for expenditure. The House eliminated the requested funding for FY2012 and proposed rescinding unobligated mandatory funds, saving $66 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the Administration's request of $9 million for the WaterSMART Program, part of the Department of the Interior's focus on water conservation. The final enacted bill supported this recommendation, combining funding for various programs into one. Reclamation proposed $59 million for the program in FY2012, a decrease of $10 million from previous levels. In FY2012, Reclamation requested $59 million for the WaterSMART Program, with specific allocations for different components. The final enacted bill included $12 million for WaterSMART grants, $5 million for Basin Studies, $25 million for Title XVI Projects, and $5 million for Water Conservation Field Services. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, covering research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs. The Energy and Water Development bill funds DOE programs for various purposes including general science, environmental cleanup, nuclear weapons programs, fossil fuels, energy efficiency, and energy statistics. The FY2011 appropriations act allocated $25.6 billion, while the FY2012 budget requested $30.7 billion. The final bill appropriated $25.7 billion for DOE programs. President Obama emphasized energy efficiency and clean energy in his 2011 State of the Union address. In his 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama highlighted the importance of energy efficiency and clean energy, referring to it as our generation's Sputnik moment. He emphasized the need for increased research and development in areas such as biomedical research, information technology, and clean energy technology. The President proposed a Clean Energy Standard to stimulate the market for new clean energy technologies. The DOE requested $3,200.1 million for EERE programs in FY2012 to support these initiatives. For FY2012, DOE requested $3,200.1 million for EERE programs, marking a significant increase from previous years. Despite a reduction in funding in FY2011, the FY2012 request would have represented a 75.3% increase in EERE funding. This request sparked intense debate due to concerns about the budget deficit. The House Appropriations Committee bill recommended EERE funding at $1,308 million, with an additional $237.7 million requested for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability programs. The FY2012 request for Energy Reliability programs proposed a significant increase of $93.0 million, or 64.2%, compared to the FY2011 appropriation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1,304.6 million for EERE, which was $1,895.4 million less than the FY2012 request. Major program increases were proposed for Vehicles, Buildings, Industry, Solar Energy, and Biomass. The House Appropriations Committee recommended significant cuts for EERE programs, with major reductions proposed for Vehicles, Buildings, Industry, Solar Energy, and Biomass. Only Water Power saw an increase in funding. The total proposed cut was $491.0 million compared to the FY2011 appropriation, with significant cuts for key program areas. For FY2012, the House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about DOE's strategic direction, particularly focusing on EERE programs. They criticized the DOE's request for billions in additional clean energy research funding, stating it lacked justification. The committee vowed to closely monitor DOE's use of public funds to maintain America's innovation leadership. They also noted that DOE does not always adhere to congressional funding directives. The Department of Energy redirects funds from program budgets against congressional direction, lacking transparency and respect for directives. The House Appropriations Committee criticized the DOE's lack of justification for additional clean energy research funding in FY2012. The final House-passed bill allocated $1.308 billion for EERE, significantly less than the FY2011 appropriation and FY2012 request. The House bill proposed significant cuts to EERE programs, including Vehicle Technologies, Building Technologies, Solar Technologies, Industrial Technologies, and Biomass Technologies. It also included major reductions for Weatherization Grants and EDER programs. Six amendments were adopted during House floor action, with one cutting funding from the International Subprogram under Strategic Programs. The House bill proposed cuts to EERE programs, including Vehicle, Building, Solar, Industrial, and Biomass Technologies. Amendments were made to allocate funds for U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation, restrict funds for EERE activities in China, and adjust overall EERE funding by adding $9.8 million. The Burgess Amendment prohibited funds for DOE implementation of energy efficiency standards. The Burgess Amendment in the House-passed bill aims to halt energy efficiency standards for incandescent light bulbs scheduled to start on January 1, 2012. Proponents argue it prevents excessive government regulation and promotes consumer choice, while opponents fear it will hinder domestic industry investment in new technologies and lead to lost energy and cost savings. The Senate Appropriations Committee's bill would have allocated $1,795.6 million for EERE, $1,404.4 million less than the FY2012 request and $487.2 million more than the House bill. The Committee's bill proposed significant increases for Solar, Vehicle, Building, and Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Technologies, while cutting Water Technologies funding. It also included boosts for Weatherization Grants, State Energy Grants, and Program Management. The Committee directed DOE to establish efficiency standards for electronic devices like set-top boxes. The bill proposed efficiency standards for electronic devices, including TVs and set-top boxes. The Sunshot Initiative aims to reduce PV costs by 75% by 2020 and install 375 GW of PV power plant capacity by 2030. The Sunshot Initiative, in collaboration with DOE's Office of Science and ARPA-E, aims to improve technology and reduce costs for power electronics controls, BIPV, and balance of system equipment to regain world leadership in PV manufacturing and create jobs. DOE requested a $213.6 million increase for the Solar Energy Program in FY2012, with most of it allocated to the Sunshot Initiative. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $290.9 million cut for the Solar Energy Program, below the DOE's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee suggested $123.9 million more than the House approved and provided guidance on funding for the Solar Demonstration Zone Project, establishing a Center for Solar Energy Innovation, and supporting R&D on organic PV cells. The conference report allocated $290.0 million for the Solar Program, an increase of $26.5 million over the previous year. The report allocated $290.0 million for the Solar Program in FY2012, an increase of $26.5 million from the previous year. The Cellulosic Biofuels Reverse Auction was a key initiative under this program, aiming to lower production costs for cellulosic biofuels. Additionally, funding was requested for Integrated Biorefineries to convert biomass feedstock to advanced biofuels, biopower, and bioproducts. The DOE requested funding to continue and expand biorefinery projects with industry partners, focusing on scale-up and replication in FY2012. They also asked for $22.5 million for pilot-scale demonstrations of biomass cofiring with coal. The House recommended a $190.5 million cut for the Biomass Program in FY2012, citing concerns about the effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed Cellulosic Biofuels Reverse Auction. The proposed Cellulosic Biofuels Reverse Auction was deemed ineffective and fiscally unsustainable, leading to no funds being allocated for it. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $30 million more than the House approved, with $30 million designated for algae biofuels. The conference report allocated $200.0 million for the Biomass Program, an increase of $17.3 million from the previous year. Additionally, the DOE requested support for the Better Buildings Initiative to improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings by 20% by 2020. The DOE proposed a $260.2 million increase for the Buildings Program in FY2012 to improve energy efficiency in existing buildings by 20% by 2020. This includes tax incentives, financing support for private building owners, a competitive grant program, and funding for new construction and community partnerships. Additionally, there is a request for $24.4 million to extend the Innovation Hub and $35.0 million to accelerate equipment efficiency standards. In FY2012, DOE requested a $260.2 million increase for the Buildings Program. The House approved a $320.7 million cut, with no funds for the Race to the Green grant program. $24.4 million was recommended for the Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Energy Innovation Hub.

The Smart Grid subprogram would also see an increase of $13.5 million to support a new power electronics effort and study the impacts of electric vehicle charging on grid performance. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $98.2 million below the request, with $20.0 million allocated for Clean Energy Transmission and Reliability. The report recommended funding reductions for Clean Energy Transmission and Reliability and Smart Grid R&D compared to the requested amounts. The Committee directed DOE to report on Grid Modeling and grid cyber security measures. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended slightly more funding than the House approved. The report also encouraged the use of funds for regional transmission planning and renewables deployment. The conference report provided $139.5 million, a decrease from the FY2011 appropriation. The Obama Administration's FY2012 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $754 million, which was about $22 million above the FY2011 funding level approved by Congress. The House bill proposed a cut to $733.6 million, while the Senate recommended a cut to $583.8 million. The final conference agreement provided $768.7 million, excluding funding for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $93.4 million for FY2012, citing the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan as a reason for reevaluating U.S. nuclear policies. They directed the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to revise Federal statutes and develop a nuclear waste management strategy based on its recommendations. Funding was included for nuclear reactor and waste safety programs within the DOE nuclear energy budget. DOE was tasked with developing a strategy for managing spent nuclear fuel and other waste within six months of the Commission's final report. The Administration's FY2012 nuclear R&D budget request aligns with DOE's Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap, focusing on improving reactor reliability, affordability, sustainable fuel cycles, and minimizing proliferation risks. The Reactor Concepts program includes the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project and research on advanced reactors. The FY2012 nuclear R&D budget request includes funding for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project, aimed at developing advanced small modular reactors and enhancing the sustainability of existing commercial light water reactors. The total funding request was $125 million, with the enacted bill providing $115.5 million. The NGNP project, authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, aims to produce high-temperature heat for electricity generation and other industrial processes. The FY2012 budget for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project was reduced to $63.6 million from the requested $103 million. Secretary of Energy decided not to proceed with a demonstration plant but continue research. Potential obstacles include low natural gas prices and private-sector unwillingness to share costs. The Senate eliminated funding for NGNP due to lack of progress. $40 million was provided for fuel development and qualification activities. The Advanced Reactor Concepts program had a funding request of $21.9 million. The FY2012 funding request for the Advanced Reactor Concepts program was $21.9 million, the same as the FY2011 request. The program focuses on developing reactors for improved sustainability, safety, economics, security, and proliferation resistance. It includes fast reactors and reactors using various heat-transfer fluids. International collaboration continues under the Generation IV International Forum. The program request for the Advanced Reactor Concepts program in FY2012 was $21.4 million, slightly lower than the FY2011 request. The program aims to extend the life of existing commercial light water reactors beyond 60 years by studying aging reactor materials, safety margins, and improving plant efficiency. The House bill proposed $25 million for the program, while the Senate Appropriations Committee specified $10 million for research and development of the current fleet of reactors. The conferees allocated $25 million of Reactor Concepts funding for research on the safe operation of existing reactors. Rising costs of large nuclear reactors have led to interest in small modular reactors (SMRs) with capacities ranging from 40 to 350 megawatts. SMR proposals include technologies like high-temperature gas and light water used in current commercial reactors. The DOE requested $67 million for FY2012 to support licensing small modular LWRs, with the House bill including the full request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended zero funding, but the conferees provided the full request in anticipation of a five-year program totaling $452 million. The program aims to provide support for design certification, standards, and licensing for small modular LWRs, with at least half of the costs to be covered by industry partners. The DOE requested $67 million for FY2012 to support licensing small modular LWRs, with the House bill including the full request. An additional $28.7 million was requested for SMR advanced concepts R&D. The SMR advanced concepts program would research technologies for longer-term deployment, unlike the SMR licensing support program. Small modular reactors would go against the trend of larger reactors in nuclear power technology. The Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, with a funding request of $155 million for FY2012. The House bill recommended $132 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended an increase to $187.9 million. The Senate panel included $10 million for modeling and simulation of spent fuel storage safety. The Committee recommended $60 million for Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition, including $10 million for standardized storage, transportation, and disposal canisters, $3 million for spent fuel management partnerships, and $7 million for \"characterization of potential geologic repository media.\" The Senate panel recommended $59 million for developing advanced fuels to reduce nuclear accident consequences. The final bill provided $187.4 million for fuel cycle R&D, including $60 million for Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition and $59 million for advanced fuels. The program under the George W. Bush Administration focused on near-term development and deployment of spent fuel reprocessing technology. The UREX technology under the AFCI program aimed to recycle plutonium, uranium, and other radioactive materials into new nuclear fuel. The program was part of the Bush Administration's GNEP initiative to provide secure nuclear fuel services. Under the Obama Administration, the program shifted towards researching various nuclear fuel cycle approaches, including direct disposal and recycling options. The goal is to develop technology for informed decision-making on managing nuclear waste and used fuel. The justification for managing nuclear waste and used fuel includes research on spent fuel management options, development of advanced fuels for reactors, improvements in nuclear waste characteristics, modeling of fuel cycle options, and technology to increase nuclear fuel resources. The funding request for the program was $97.4 million, $46 million above the previous year. The funding request for the program was $97.4 million, $46 million above the FY2011 level. The final bill appropriated $74.9 million for the program, with research focused on new reactor materials, fuel cycle options, nuclear plant manufacturing methods, and sensors. The Energy Innovation Hub for Modeling and Simulation had a request of $24.3 million to create a computer model of an operating reactor for better understanding of nuclear technology.

Transformative Nuclear Concepts Research received $14.6 million for high-risk, high-reward projects in advanced nuclear technology. The National Science User Facility was granted $14.6 million to support university partnerships for experiments at unique facilities. Funding for the User Facility was previously under Idaho Facilities Management, which was approved by the House report. The Obama Administration proposed a new budget structure for the FY2012 Fossil Energy Research and Development program, emphasizing coal with a focus on carbon capture and storage technologies. The program aims to demonstrate advanced clean coal technologies on a commercial scale, capturing and storing carbon dioxide. This includes separate CO2 capture in pre-combustion and post-combustion systems, as well as long-term geologic storage of CO2. The Advanced Energy Systems sub-program aims to improve coal-based power systems' efficiency for CO2 capture. It focuses on enabling affordable CO2 capture, increasing plant availability, and maintaining environmental standards. The Cross-cutting Research activity bridges basic and applied research for innovative system development. The Administration proposed cutting Natural Gas, Unconventional Fossil Energy Technologies, and Cooperative R&D for FY2011, requesting $586.6 million for Fossil Energy R&D. The restructured Fossil Energy Research and Development Program eliminated spending on certain areas, with a requested budget of $476 million for FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $477 million for Fossil Energy R&D, expressing concern over the focus on CCS in the Administration's budget request. They recommended $338.8 million for the CCS and Power Systems program, allocating funds to Advanced Energy Systems, High Performance Materials, Coal-Biomass to Liquids, and Gasification Systems. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $445.5 million for Fossil Energy Research and Development, including funding for Coal and Coal-Biomass to Liquids, Gasification Systems, Cross Cutting Research, Natural Gas Technologies, and Program Direction. This is $7.5 million less than the budget request, with a reduction in program direction to FY2011 levels. They also rescinded $187 million in prior year funds. The committee recommended $291.4 million for CCS and Power Systems, $151.7 million for program direction, $16.8 million for Plant and Capital Equipment, $7.9 million for Fossil Energy Environmental Restoration, and $0.7 million for Special Recruitment Programs. The final bill appropriated $534 million for FER&D and rescinded $187 million, for a total of $347 million. $368.6 million was allotted to CCS programs, with $35.0 million transferred to fund coal R&D. $100 million was specified for Advanced Energy Systems within CCS, and \"not less than $25 million\" for solid oxide fuel cell systems RD&D. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), established in 1975, consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas filled to capacity with 727 million barrels of crude oil. The federal government has not purchased oil for the SPR since 1994, instead acquiring oil through royalty-in-kind (RIK) from federal offshore leases. Acquisition methods include direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. In 2008, Congress ordered the suspension of RIK fill for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, due to declining oil prices, the SPR resumed fill, purchasing nearly 10.7 million barrels in 2009 to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. By May 2009, RIK fill resumed at an average of 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels to be delivered by January 2010, bringing the SPR to capacity. The Secretary of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program, with oil and gas properties reverting to in-value status as contracts expire. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels, but the Administration proposed suspending the expansion in FY2011. Instead, $71 million was redirected for non-expansion operations and maintenance, citing projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The Administration reduced funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in FY2011 to $138.9 million, down from $243.8 million in FY2010. They proposed a sale of $500 million in petroleum from the SPR, with the House Committee recommending that the quantity sold be replaced during FY2012. The SPR's projection for import replacement capacity is set to increase to 90 days by 2025. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $192.7 million for FY2012, with the final bill appropriating that amount. The bill also included a rescission of $500 million instead of the proposed sale of reserves. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and requested $5.416 billion for FY2012. The DOE requested $5.416 billion for the Office of Science in FY2012, with the final appropriation being $4.889 billion. The goal is to double the funding of the Office of Science, with a 49% increase from the FY2006 baseline in the FY2012 request. The FY2012 request for the Office of Science was $5.416 billion, with the final appropriation being $4.889 billion. The largest program, basic energy sciences, requested $1.985 billion, including funding for existing and new Innovation Hubs. The House bill proposed $1.668 billion for basic energy sciences, with directions to rank and terminate low-performing projects. The Senate recommended $1.694 billion, with similar funding for the hubs. The final conference report allocated $1.694 billion for basic energy sciences. The conference report allocated $1.694 billion for basic energy sciences, including funding for Innovation Hubs. For high-energy physics, the final appropriation was $792 million. DOE is reconsidering options for the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment. The National Science Foundation ceased funding for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. The House cautioned against DOE taking over DUSEL construction. The Senate recommended no funding for LBNE construction. The Senate committee recommended no funding for LBNE construction, but the conference report provided $21 million for R&D and engineering design for LBNE. Concerns were raised about the project's readiness for construction, and DOE was directed to submit a refined total cost estimate. Scientific interest in LBNE may increase due to recent findings on neutrinos. The request for biological and environmental research was $718 million, with $103 million allocated for foundational genomics research, triple the FY2010 level. The House bill would have provided $547 million for these activities. The Senate committee recommended $622 million for climate and environmental sciences, with $295 million for climate research. The final appropriation was $612 million. For nuclear physics, the request was $605 million, including $66 million for construction at CEBAF. The House bill would have provided $552 million. The House bill and Senate committee recommended funding for various scientific research projects, including $550 million for the Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). Additionally, $442 million was allocated for advanced scientific computing research, and $400 million for fusion energy sciences, with a proposed U.S. contribution of $105 million to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in France. The DOE stated in February 2011 that the costs associated with schedule delays for ITER are manageable within the existing cost range. Damage to component test facilities in Japan from the Fukushima earthquake may cause additional delays. The House and Senate committees recommended funding for fusion energy sciences, expressing concern about ITER's impact on domestic fusion science funding. The final appropriation for fusion energy sciences was $402 million, with a directive for DOE to submit a 10-year plan considering fusion priorities. The conference report directed DOE to submit a 10-year plan for fusion priorities under various budget scenarios. ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, supports energy technology research projects. Its FY2012 request was $550 million, triple the FY2011 appropriation. The Administration proposed $100 million in mandatory funding from a Wireless Innovation Fund, with the House committee recommending the same amount. The House committee recommended $179.6 million for spectrum auctions, while the Senate committee recommended $250 million. The final appropriation was $275 million. President Obama's FY2012 budget did not include funding for DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM), leading to the closure of the office and halting of activities at the Yucca Mountain site. The Obama Administration determined that developing the Yucca Mountain repository is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. The DOE FY2011 budget justification states that Yucca Mountain repository is not a viable option for nuclear waste disposal. The House Appropriations Committee opposes the closure of the Yucca Mountain program. DOE filed a license application for Yucca Mountain in 2008 but withdrew it in 2010. The FY2012 House bill allocated $25 million for DOE and $10 million for NRC for the Yucca Mountain program. The Senate provided no funding for OCRWM but allocated funds for nuclear waste policy and research in the DOE budget. The conferees largely adopted the Senate position on the DOE nuclear energy R&D budget, providing no funds for nuclear waste disposal but including waste R&D funding in the nuclear R&D budget. An NRC licensing panel rejected DOE's withdrawal motion in June 2010, citing NWPA requirements. The full NRC Commission deadlocked on the issue in September 2011, leaving the licensing panel's decision in place and halting the licensing process due to budgetary limitations. NRC was appropriated $10 million in FY2011 for nuclear waste licensing, with the FY2012 House bill aiming to prohibit NRC funds from halting the licensing process without DOE's approval. The final bill did not provide funding to continue Yucca Mountain licensing activities. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended options for nuclear waste disposal and research programs, but did not evaluate specific sites like Yucca Mountain. The Commission recommended a \"consent-based\" approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, urging the development of consolidated waste storage and disposal facilities to begin as soon as possible. A new waste management organization should be established to develop the repository, transportation, and storage systems, with \"assured access\" to the Nuclear Waste Fund. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead all future waste management activities. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead all future waste management activities, with substantial funding requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. Utilities have won court cases upholding DOE's obligation to remove waste from reactor sites by 2020, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion. DOE's loan guarantee program for energy technology deployment, authorized by Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, did not receive additional funding for FY2012. Two major loan guarantee programs are currently conducted by the DOE Loan Programs Office for innovative clean energy technology loan guarantees. Loan guarantees are provided for new or significantly improved technologies that avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The Section 1705 program, established under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provides loan guarantees for renewable energy, electric transmission, and advanced biofuels projects. Unlike the Section 1703 program, it is not limited to innovative technologies and covers already-commercialized technologies. The program allows DOE to provide loan guarantees for up to 80% of construction costs for eligible energy projects, with the federal government repaying all covered loans in case of default. The federal government offers loan guarantees under Section 1703 and 1705 programs for various energy projects. DOE has committed $10.65 billion for nuclear power, nuclear fuel, and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703. Final loan guarantees totaling $16.13 billion have been issued for 28 projects under Section 1705. DOE's rules for the program were finalized on October 4, 2007, after facing criticism for limiting guarantees to 90% of a project's debt. The industry argued that EPACT05 allows coverage of all project debt, as long as it does not exceed 80% of total construction costs. The DOE agreed to guarantee up to 100% of debt for loans issued by the Federal Financing Bank under Title XVII. Subsidy costs for guaranteed loans are calculated upfront to cover future government costs, but the Congressional Budget Office predicts these costs may be underestimated by at least 1%. The DOE guarantees up to 100% of debt for loans under Title XVII, with subsidy costs calculated upfront. Appropriations bills adjust loan guarantee authorizations by 1%. ARRA allocated $6 billion for Section 1705 loan guarantees, eliminating the need for project sponsors to cover subsidy costs. Loan guarantee amounts under ARRA depend on subsidy costs, with $2 billion transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. The DOE's loan guarantee program under Title XVII allocated $6 billion for Section 1705 loan guarantees, with $2 billion transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program. $1.9 billion of the $2.5 billion available for subsidy costs had been obligated by the end of FY2011. Solyndra Inc. received the first loan guarantee in September 2009, but filed for bankruptcy in August 2011, prompting criticism of the program's management. The Senate-passed omnibus energy legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to eliminate FCRA's applicability to DOE's loan guarantees under EPACT05, giving DOE unlimited loan guarantee authority. However, this provision was dropped from the final legislation. The FY2007 continuing resolution set an initial cap of $4 billion on loan guarantees, which was increased to $38.5 billion in the FY2008 omnibus funding act, with specific allocations for nuclear power and uranium enrichment plants. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-8) increased DOE's total loan guarantee authority under Section 1703 to $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. The time limits on the loan guarantee authority were eliminated. The FY2011 Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-10) reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $8.3 billion but added new authority for a total of $9.5 billion. The Section 1703 non-nuclear loan guarantee ceiling is $11.5 billion, while nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provided $170 million for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program, with additional loan guarantee authority of up to $1.183 billion. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provides authority and subsidy cost appropriation for projects under Section 1705. The Act includes a $8.3 billion ceiling for non-nuclear technologies, $2 billion for unspecified projects, $18.5 billion for nuclear power plants, $4 billion for uranium enrichment plants, and $1.183 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects under Section 1703. The FY2011 Continuing Appropriations Act provides funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees under Sections 1703 and 1705. A total of $170 million is allocated for subsidy costs, with an additional $2.5 billion appropriated for Section 1705 subsidy costs. The Department of Energy requested an extra $200 million in FY2012 for innovative projects under Section 1703, aiming to support $1-2 billion in loan guarantees. The FY2012 House bill did not include the proposed increase in nuclear loan guarantees, and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no increase in nuclear loan guarantees. The final bill did not provide additional funding for subsidy costs or increase existing loan guarantee ceilings. The Continuing Resolution appropriated $7.5 billion for the DOE to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans through the ATVM Loan Program for automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to invest in plant capacity for fuel-efficient vehicles. Five ATVM loans totaling $8.4 billion have been issued, with additional commitments. Funding for new loans in FY2012 was not requested, only for administrative expenses. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to maintain US nuclear weapons expertise. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, ensures the preservation of US nuclear weapons expertise and the safety of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within the Department of Energy (DOE). The Stockpile Stewardship Program, managed by NNSA, includes a \"stockpile management\" program to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground testing. This program aims to extend the effective life of weapons while ensuring consistency with basic design parameters. The Stockpile Stewardship Program supports activities at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2012 request includes data for FY2013-FY2016. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress has shown interest in the program. Despite post-Cold War reductions, Congress has long desired changes to the nuclear weapons complex, including fewer personnel, lower costs, increased security, and a smaller footprint. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan in January 2007. The House Appropriations Committee in FY2008 demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, a detailed nuclear stockpile description, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort, calling for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, which aimed to reduce the weapons program footprint, close or transfer structures, reduce weapons workers, dismantle weapons more rapidly, and modernize the complex. The Complex Transformation plan aims to reduce the number of weapons workers by 20%-30%, dismantle weapons more rapidly, and build new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility at Y-12 National Security Complex, Weapons Surveillance Facility at Pantex Plant, and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The House Appropriations Committee requires completion of certain steps before considering funding for new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. The committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and several other programs in the FY2009 report. The Senate Appropriations Committee also recommended eliminating RRW funds in its FY2009 report. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided no RRW funds, and neither the FY2010 nor FY2011 budgets requested RRW funds. The Administration proposed to cancel RRW development in the FY2010 budget document. The FY2010 budget proposed canceling the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) development due to inconsistency with nuclear disarmament commitments. The FY2011 budget requested $7,008.8 million for Weapons Activities, with the Department of Defense outlining plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal in the Nuclear Posture Review Report. The President provided a classified report to Congress on maintaining delivery platforms and a reliable U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile. The Administration plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The FY2011 enacted figure for Weapons Activities was $6,896.4 million, and for FY2012, the Administration requested $7,589.4 million. NNSA issued a new strategic plan in May 2011 and a detailed stockpile stewardship and management plan in April 2011. The Administration requested $7,589.4 million for Weapons Activities, with the final appropriation being $7,234.0 million. This program involves work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Specific items under DSW include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for existing warheads. The FY2012 budget for ballistic missile programs included $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP, shifting from a feasibility study to a full LEP. The B61 LEP aims to extend the service life of B61 mods 3, 4, and 7 nuclear bombs for 30 years, with production starting in FY2017. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $278.6 million for the B61 LEP, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $180.0 million. The committee allocated $180.0 million for the B61 LEP and $257.0 million for the W76 LEP. The B61 LEP is described as the most ambitious refurbishment of a weapon system to date, incorporating new technologies for safety and security. The committee emphasized the importance of maintaining long-term weapon reliability. The final appropriation was $257.0 million for the W76 LEP and $223.6 million for the B61 LEP, with a portion withheld pending a design study. Routine maintenance and assessment for all weapon types in the stockpile are also part of the program. The FY2012 budget for Stockpile Systems was $487.6 million, with $175.0 million allocated for surveillance and $99.5 million for W78 Stockpile Systems. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $472.1 million for the program, reducing funds for the W78 LEP due to delays in the study. The final appropriation directed NNSA to use $175.0 million for surveillance and $99.5 million for W78 Stockpile Systems. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile of warheads for national security. Warhead numbers have decreased since the Cold War. Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) involves storing, dismantling, and disposing of warheads. Funding for WDD was $95.8 million in FY2010, $57.9 million in FY2011, and $56.8 million in FY2012. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended and provided $56.8 million for WDD in FY2012. Several components of WDD have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories in recent years. The main activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The PDCF converts plutonium pits into plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for commercial nuclear reactors. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes from PDCF and MFFF into solids for off-site disposal, with its account moved to the Fissile category for FY2010. The WSB account was moved to the Fissile Materials Disposition Program within Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation for FY2010. Stockpile Services, which includes various support categories, provides the foundation for production capability within the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2010 actual appropriation was $851.4 million, FY2011 enacted figure was $933.0 million, and the FY2012 request was $928.6 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in Production Support funding for weapons production, citing insensitivity to stockpile reductions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $839.0 million, with $64.0 million allocated for stockpile surveillance. The final appropriation provided $854.5 million, with $64.0 million designated for surveillance efforts. These efforts are described as multi-year, multi-functional initiatives providing specialized scientific knowledge and technical support to the directed stockpile. The Science Campaign aims to enhance warhead assessment capabilities, readiness for nuclear tests, and maintain scientific infrastructure. It funds experimental facilities like the National Ignition Facility. The FY2012 request included five campaigns, with a focus on developing scientific capabilities for assessing nuclear explosives without underground testing. The FY2012 budget request for the Science Campaign included a significant increase in funding for the Advanced Certification program, which aims to improve weapons certification processes and enhance scientific understanding related to nuclear weapons. The program integrates advancements from stockpile stewardship to address weapon failure modes, modernize safety measures, and anticipate technological developments. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $312.1 million for the Science Campaign, with the largest reduction of $75.5 million to Advanced Certification. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $347.1 million for the campaign, specifying that no funds would be used for scaled experiments using plutonium pit-like designs. The committee recommended $40.0 million for Advanced Certification in the Science Campaign, which provides tools to ensure the safety and reliability of the US nuclear weapons stockpile. The FY2010 actual appropriation was $149.7 million, FY2011 enacted figure was $140.9 million, and FY2012 request was $143.1 million, all of which were met. The Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign is focused on creating high temperatures and pressures in the laboratory to support weapons-related research. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is a key component of this campaign, serving as the world's largest laser for high-energy density physics experiments. These experiments are crucial for validating theoretical models used to certify the nuclear stockpile without testing. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser used for high-energy density physics experiments. Despite initial controversy and technical issues, NIF has made significant progress since its dedication in May 2009. In 2011, NIF conducted 283 shots of all types, with a budget of $477.6 million. Concerns were raised about achieving ignition by the end of FY2012, but NIF's contribution to stockpile stewardship was acknowledged. The House recommended $471.2 million for FY2012, while the Senate supported the requested $476.3 million. The appropriation provided the requested amount for the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) Campaign, which develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons. Some doubt simulation's ability to certify the safety of warheads and advocate a return to testing. The FY2012 request was $628.9 million. The FY2011 enacted figure was $611.0 million, with the FY2012 request at $628.9 million. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $616.0 million, citing concerns about the new exascale computing initiative. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $625.0 million and allocated $36.0 million for the exascale initiative within ASC Campaign funds. The final appropriation was $620.0 million. The FY2012 request for nuclear weapons stockpile was $142.5 million, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending $63.6 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million, and the final appropriation was $128.6 million. This program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites. The Committee recommended $2,011.3 million, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2,170.5 million, and the final appropriation was $2,009.2 million for the RTBF program, which has six subprograms including Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, Material Recycle and Recovery, and Construction. The Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory is a costly and controversial project. It aims to replace the outdated CMR building, which houses research into plutonium and supports pit production. The House Appropriations Committee has raised concerns about the project's lack of a coherent mission. The CMRR facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory lacks a coherent mission, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The current authorization for the facility only lasts until 2010 and does not provide adequate safety measures. Deep spending cuts may result in delays, requiring continued operations in the existing CMR facility. The House Appropriations Committee highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the stockpile's nature and size, making it impossible to determine the capacity needed for facilities like CMRR and the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR facility to address previous funding shortfalls. Various reports and commissions supported the need for CMRR to replace the decrepit existing facility and sustain a safe nuclear arsenal. The NPR concluded that the United States needed to build facilities to maintain a safe nuclear arsenal over the long-term. Critics argue that the CMRR facility is expensive, risky, and lacks clarity on its purpose and design. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $200.0 million for FY2012, a $100.0 million reduction from the request, citing concerns about cost growth. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $240.0 million for the construction of the CMRR facility and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF) at the Y-12 National Security Complex. They expressed concerns about cost growth and urged the adoption of cost reduction strategies to make construction more affordable. The Committee noted that new cost estimates for the facilities were two to three times higher than previous estimates and directed the NNSA to submit a plan by February 1, 2012, identifying the consequences of delaying project implementation. The conference report stated that no construction activities are funded for the CMRR-Nuclear Facility in fiscal year 2012. Weapons Activities include various programs such as Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear weapons. The FY2012 request was $251.3 million, with a recommended amount of $243.3 million by the House Appropriations Committee. The recommendation aims to recoup savings from the federal employee pay freeze and modernization of federal aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended providing $243.3 million for the Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response program, which responds to and mitigates nuclear incidents globally. The Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program focuses on restoring the physical infrastructure of the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2012 appropriation for both programs met the requested amount. The FY2010 actual appropriation for Site Stewardship was $63.3 million, increasing to $104.6 million in FY2011. The FY2012 request was $104.0 million, with concerns raised about deferred maintenance costs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended providing the requested amount to address the backlog. Site Stewardship aims to ensure environmental compliance and operational efficiency in the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2010 actual appropriation for Site Stewardship was $63.3 million, increasing to $104.6 million in FY2011. For FY2012, the request was $104.0 million, but the House Appropriations Committee recommended $78.7 million. The Committee eliminated funds for the Energy Modernization and Investment Program and found the Site Stewardship mission to be \"unfocused.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $90.0 million and noted support for NNSA's efforts to consolidate and dispose of nuclear material. The final appropriation was $78.7 million for Safeguards and Security. The Protective Forces and Cyber Security programs receive funding for physical security systems, personnel security, and cybersecurity measures to protect NNSA personnel, facilities, and nuclear weapons from various threats, including terrorism. The FY2010 actual appropriation was $769.8 million, decreasing to $698.0 million in FY2012. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $690.9 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $701.8 million. The Cyber Security program focuses on implementing information management security safeguards throughout the NNSA enterprise. The FY2010 actual appropriation for Cyber Security was $123.3 million. The FY2010 actual appropriation for Cyber Security was $123.3 million. Legacy contractor pensions at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories had defined-benefit plans through the University of California. Employees hired while UC was the sole contractor had a choice between the UC pension plan and another plan. The committee recommended funding for legacy national laboratory employee pensions through a simplified and transparent solution. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $147.0 million for this new budget line item in FY2012, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not provide any funds. The final appropriation was $168.2 million, with funds requested within Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities for improved transparency. Additionally, NNSA requested $20.0 million for the National Security Applications program in FY2012. The agency requested $20.0 million for the National Security Applications program in FY2012, which makes strategic investments in national security science, technology, and engineering capabilities. The House Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the program due to a lack of clear requirements and criteria for investments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million to support NNSA's efforts in counterterrorism capabilities. The appropriation for FY2012 was $10.0 million, with rescissions totaling $90.3 million. The National Nuclear Security Administration's nonproliferation and national security programs received $2,303.3 million in funding for FY2012, slightly lower than the requested $2,519.5 million. The FY2012 request for Nonproliferation and Verification R&D program was $417.6 million, but the final bill appropriated $356.2 million. The request for Nonproliferation and International Security programs was $161.8 million, and the final bill appropriated the requested amount. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) was funded at $572.0 million in FY2011. The Fissile Materials Disposition program, funded at $572.0 million in FY2011, aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program faced controversy due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium, but received $701.9 million in FY2010 for this purpose. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. The program includes construction of three projects at Savannah River, SC, but controversy surrounds the necessity of the pit disassembly project. The FY2012 budget request was $892.2 million, with differing appropriations from the House and Senate, resulting in $685.4 million for the program with no funding for the pit disassembly project. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors worldwide from using highly enriched uranium, dispose of excess nuclear materials, and protect against theft. The FY2011 appropriation was $436.0 million, FY2012 request was $508.3 million, and the final bill allocated $500.0 million. The development of nuclear weapons has led to a legacy of waste and contamination. The Manhattan Project's legacy of wastes and contamination led to the establishment of the Office of Environmental Management in 1989 by the DOE. This office is responsible for cleaning up former nuclear weapons production facilities, managing radioactive and hazardous wastes, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, decontamination of buildings, and safeguarding facilities during cleanup. Additionally, the office oversees the cleanup of civilian nuclear energy research facilities. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of nuclear weapons production and nuclear energy research facilities, which is the largest environmental liability in the United States. Congress is concerned about the long-term financial liability and the need for billions of dollars in annual appropriations for cleanup. DOE has identified over 100 facilities in 30 states for cleanup. DOE has identified over 100 facilities in 30 states for cleanup, covering approximately 2 million acres of land. Cleanup remedies are in place at most facilities, with long-term stewardship by the Office of Legacy Management and other offices within DOE. Some smaller facilities have been transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under FUSRAP, funded within the civil works budget. Once cleanup is completed, sites are transferred back to DOE for long-term stewardship. Much work remains at larger, more complex facilities. DOE expects cleanup to continue for several years or even decades at larger and more complex facilities, with estimated costs ranging between $185 billion and $218 billion. The Office of Environmental Management administers 18 facilities in 11 states where cleanup actions are not yet complete, with periodic revisions of cost estimates due to changing project baselines and assumptions. Final decisions are pending at some facilities to determine necessary remediation actions. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup at 18 facilities in 11 states, with costs estimated between $185 billion and $218 billion. Decisions are pending at some facilities for remediation actions, waste disposal methods, and cleanup scheduling, impacting costs and time frames. Funding comes from three appropriations accounts: Defense Environmental Cleanup, Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup, and Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund account funds cleanup of facilities that enriched uranium for national defense and civilian purposes. P.L. 112-74 provided $5.73 billion in FY2012 for these accounts, a decrease from the President's request but an increase from FY2011. The House approved $5.64 billion, the Senate recommended $5.65 billion, and no funding was provided for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in P.L. 112-74. The federal payment for the Office of Environmental Management's program funding does not become available until Congress appropriates it from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. Issues highlighted in the FY2012 appropriations debate include challenges in waste processing at Hanford site, disposal capabilities at the Savannah River site, and cleanup progress at non-defense sites. The FY2012 appropriations debate focused on funding for DOE's Office of Environmental Management, including the use of proceeds from federal uranium inventories, internal reorganization, and cleanup milestones. Discussions highlighted challenges at Hanford and Savannah River sites, as well as progress at non-defense sites. DOE's attainment of cleanup milestones is crucial for measuring progress at facilities. These milestones establish time frames for specific actions and are legally binding agreements with EPA and states. Meeting deadlines depends on funding, technical feasibility, and regulatory issues. Funding alone does not guarantee meeting cleanup deadlines. DOE's ability to meet cleanup deadlines depends on funding availability. The President's FY2012 budget request for the Office of Environmental Management aims to complete all cleanup milestones within the fiscal year. However, a $398.5 million reduction in funding may impact progress at nuclear weapons production facilities with high-level radioactive waste storage tanks. The high-level radioactive wastes stored in tanks need to be removed and treated for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. Challenges in finding a repository could delay disposal, impacting cleanup time frames and costs. DOE facilities managing these wastes include Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory. The Department of Energy manages high-level radioactive wastes at sites in Washington, South Carolina, and Idaho. There are concerns about the construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford, which would process the wastes for permanent disposal. Funding for the plant was reduced in P.L. 112-74. The Department of Energy allocated $740.0 million for the Hanford tank waste plant, $100 million less than requested but $1.3 million more than the previous year. Cleanup at Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory is expected to continue for decades, with completion estimated as late as 2062, 2040, and 2044 respectively. Funding for long-term stewardship post-cleanup is uncertain. The DOE uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, Kentucky; Piketon, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee are funded for cleanup through the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Special assessments from nuclear utilities and federal government payments finance the fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, is funded for cleanup of DOE uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, Kentucky; Piketon, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Congress authorized federal payments to the fund, with contributions from both the federal government and nuclear utilities. The authority to collect utility assessments and federal payments expired in 2007, but Congress has continued funding through annual appropriations without separate legislation. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, established in 1992, faces a shortfall in funding for cleanup of DOE facilities. The fund had $4.5 billion available in FY2011, but an estimated $11.8 billion shortfall was projected for long-term cleanup needs. The President's FY2012 budget proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources in the fund. The proposal aims to cap assessments at $200 million for the first fiscal year, with annual adjustments for inflation thereafter. The federal government's authority to resume collection of assessments is contingent on Congress enacting reauthorizing legislation. Funding for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund in FY2012 was $472.9 million, below the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. The House proposed $449.0 million, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $429.0 million. The President's proposal did not continue the federal payment into the Uranium D&D Enrichment Fund in FY2012, as P.L. 112-74 did not include the House provision that would have limited the availability of receipts from the transfer or sale of excess funds. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 still requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs even if the remaining balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is expended, potentially necessitating federal monies in the future for facility cleanup. The conferees on H.R. 2055 expressed concerns about DOE's contracting mechanism for transferring excess uranium for cleanup services, citing legal violations and potential market destabilization. The President's proposal to use $200 million in uranium receipts for cleanup in FY2012 was not limited by P.L. 112-74. The conferees on H.R. 2055 raised concerns about DOE's transfer of excess uranium for cleanup, citing potential market destabilization. Section 312 of P.L. 112-74 imposed requirements on DOE, including limiting determinations to a two-year period and notifying Congress before any uranium transfer. DOE must submit a revised uranium inventory management plan by June 30, 2012. The DOE is required to submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2011, evaluating the economic feasibility of re-enriching federal depleted uranium inventories. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to authorize a pilot re-enrichment program, with proceeds intended for cleanup of federal uranium enrichment facilities. The bills would authorize a pilot program to re-enrich federal depleted uranium and direct proceeds into the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup purposes. The DOE's plan to reorganize the Office of Environmental Management and the debate over the availability of funding for cleanup activities were key topics in the FY2012 appropriations discussions. The House provision in H.R. 2354 that would have restricted funding availability in FY2012 was not included in the final bill. The House provision in H.R. 2354 aimed to restrict funding for DOE's reorganization plan, particularly concerning the Office of Environmental Management. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on environmental cleanup priorities under a management structure focused on nuclear security. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about DOE's reorganization plan, specifically regarding the Office of Legacy Management and Office of the Chief of Nuclear Safety. They questioned how the new structure would impact day-to-day operations, project management, and whether it would detract from the nuclear security mission. The committee also raised issues about the lack of advance notice, stakeholder reactions, and the potential impact on the missions of other DOE offices. The Senate Appropriations Committee raised concerns about DOE's reorganization plan, particularly regarding the Office of Legacy Management and Office of the Chief of Nuclear Safety. They questioned the impact on day-to-day operations, project management, and nuclear security mission. The Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term stewardship of DOE facilities, including those transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers under the FUSRAP program. The Office of Legacy Management, funded within DOE's Other Defense Activities Account, received $169.6 million in FY2012. Funding needs are expected to increase as more facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term stewardship. DOE projects the number of facilities administered by the Office of Legacy Management to rise from 91 in FY2011 to 129 in FY2020 over the next 10 years. Estimating funding needs for long-term stewardship of cleanup sites is challenging due to lengthy time horizons involved. Actions may be necessary for decades to maintain cleanup remedies and monitor contaminant levels. Long-term stewardship may be required indefinitely at sites with radioactive waste containment. Financial liability estimation is difficult due to various factors. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations, such as Bonneville Power Administration, play a role in this process. Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by federal agencies. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates. They aim to cover expenses and repay debt. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) are responsible for covering expenses, repaying debt, and federal investments in generating facilities. The FY2012 budget request for PMAs was $108 million, a $10 million decrease from FY2011. SWPA and WAPA require discretionary funding in addition to their receipts, while SEPA's receipts are expected to offset operating costs in FY2011. Additional funding is requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance. In FY2012, the House and Senate agreed on $23 million collections from Colorado River basins as an offset toward discretionary appropriations. BPA is a self-funded agency under P.L. 93-454, receiving no appropriations but funding activities through borrowing authority. ARRA increased BPA's borrowing authority to $7.7 billion and provided WAPA with borrowing authority for building new transmission lines for renewable energy delivery. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) now has the authority to borrow from the United States Treasury on a permanent basis, up to $3.25 billion, for constructing new electric power transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. WAPA has already spent $333 million on these projects through FY2010. Other independent agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.038 billion for FY2012, similar to the previous year's funding level. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested $1.038 billion for FY2012, the same as the previous year's funding level. The final bill provided the full request without the additional $10 million approved by the House. NRC's major activities include safety regulation, licensing of commercial nuclear reactors, and oversight of nuclear materials users. The budget included $279.5 million for new reactor activities, a $12.5 million increase from FY2010, to handle new nuclear power plant license applications due to increased interest in new reactor construction. The NRC's FY2012 budget did not include funds for licensing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, as the Obama Administration wanted to cancel the project. The House bill proposed $20 million for NRC to continue the licensing process, but no funding was included in the Senate Appropriations Committee bill or the final bill. The final bill included a provision prohibiting the NRC Chairman from terminating any program without a majority vote by the NRC Commission. The FY2012 budget request for NRC's activities related to operating reactors was $521.3 million, $20.5 million below the FY2010 level. The Fukushima accident increased concerns about the safety of U.S. nuclear power plants. The NRC established a task force to review its regulatory system after the Fukushima accident. The Senate directed NRC to contract with NAS for a study on lessons learned, including spent fuel storage safety. The final bill required nuclear power plants to re-evaluate their ability to handle seismic, flooding, and other external hazards. The final bill included $15 million for university education programs related to NRC's mission, including $5 million for nuclear science and engineering research. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended a requirement that 90% of NRC's budget be offset by fees on licensees. The offsets in the FY2012 request would result in a net appropriation of $128.6 million, a decrease from FY2011. The final bill for FY2011 approved a net appropriation of $147.6 million, aligning with the Administration's budget request."
