    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honoring the Choctaw and Comanche Code Talkers Act\". During World War I, members of the Choctaw Nation, despite not being granted citizenship, enlisted in the armed forces to fight for the United States. They served in the American Expeditionary Force in France as part of the 142nd Infantry Company of the 36th Division. During World War I, a commander of the United States recruited 18 Choctaw Indians to assist in transmitting field telephone communications using their Native language, which the Germans could not understand due to its unique nature. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers were strategically placed in different command positions to facilitate wide communication. The use of Choctaw code talkers was crucial in protecting supplies, securing positions, and preparing for assaults in 1918. Officers noted that using Choctaw Indians to transmit information in their native language saved lives and resources, proving highly successful. During World War I, Choctaw soldiers were successful in transmitting codes, leading to the development of the Choctaw code talkers. The Germans were unable to break the code, marking the first use of a Native American language in modern warfare. In 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting Congress to declare war. The United States military code was deciphered by the Japanese, highlighting the importance of the Choctaw code talkers. During World War II, the United States Army utilized Comanche code talkers to transmit messages in their native language, preventing the enemy from intercepting and deciphering them. The Comanche soldiers were part of the 4th Signal Company of the 4th Infantry Division and had to devise a military code due to the lack of a written Comanche language for many military terms. During World War II, Comanche code talkers used their language to provide secure communications, protect movements, and prevent enemy interception. They coded and decoded messages, thwarting enemy communication theft, especially during the Allied landings at Normandy in June 1944. The Comanche code talkers played a crucial role in the Allied war effort during World War II, particularly during the Normandy landings in June 1944. Their efforts saved many lives, and their actions demonstrate the commitment of Native American tribes to the defense of the United States. Only one of the Comanche code talkers is still alive today.
