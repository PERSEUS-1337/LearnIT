    "content": "The Act may be cited as the Consumer Utilities Turnback (CUT) Trust Fund Act of 2001. The Act, known as the Consumer Utilities Turnback (CUT) Trust Fund Act of 2001, aims to transfer windfall profits from domestic electricity production to provide rebates for consumers. Congress found that electricity prices in California have risen significantly due to increased net income for producers and approved rate hikes by the Public Utilities Commission. Rising natural gas prices are expected to further increase electricity costs for consumers. The Consumer Utilities Turnback (CUT) Trust Fund Act of 2001 aims to transfer windfall profits from domestic electricity production to provide rebates for consumers. This includes the imposition of a tax under Chapter 45 on domestic electricity production. An excise tax is imposed on windfall profits from the sale of electricity produced in the US at a rate of 100 percent. Windfall profit is defined as profit exceeding a reasonable amount determined by State public utility commissions. The tax is paid by the producer. The tax imposed on windfall profits from electricity sales in the US is paid by the producer, who is defined as the holder of the economic interest in the electricity. Any tax imposed is treated as a tax under subtitle A for administrative purposes. Taxpayers must keep records and provide information as required by the Secretary. Regulations will be prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary for this section. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting a new item after the chapter 44. Chapter 45 introduces a windfall profit adjustment on electricity production. It establishes the Consumer Utilities Turnback Trust Fund to allocate revenues from this adjustment to individual and business consumers. This amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 creates a new section, SEC. 9511, for this purpose. The Consumer Utilities Turnback Trust Fund is established in the Treasury to receive net revenues from taxes imposed on electricity production. Net revenues are the excess of taxes received over the decrease in other taxes due to this imposition. The Consumer Utilities Turnback Trust Fund allows for rebates to electricity consumers as directed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, upon petition from a State Governor. Funds must be used within the same fiscal year. The amendments made by this Act, including the Consumer Utilities Turnback Trust Fund, will be effective for sales after December 31, 2000."
