    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that the Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study in 1995 highlighted physical changes to the Great Lakes affecting habitats and fish spawning. The decline of native fishes in the Great Lakes is attributed to overexploitation, habitat impairment, and nonindigenous species. Development projects have altered nearshore environments, riverine tributaries, and wetlands crucial for fish species. Monitoring contaminants and their effects is crucial for conservation efforts. Significant habitats are essential for self-sustaining fish and wildlife populations. Actions should focus on identifying and protecting habitats for fish and wildlife, rehabilitating degraded habitats, and working towards restoring a healthy fish community in the Great Lakes under the guidance of the Strategic Plan for Management of the Great Lakes Fisheries. Restoring a healthy fish community in the Great Lakes faces institutional impediments due to differences in mandate, priorities, and management styles. Uncoordinated management of water quality, fisheries, shipping, and human developments has led to unintended consequences. Responsible resource use and biological conservation should be integrated through partnerships. Setting specific management goals and increasing involvement with the Binational Program are crucial for coordination efforts. Managers should increase involvement with the Binational Program, Remedial Action Plans, Lake-Wide Management Plans, and the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program planning process to coordinate efforts for restoring a healthy fish community in the Great Lakes. SEC. 3. REFERENCE. Any amendments or repeals in this Act refer to the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 1990. SEC. 4. PURPOSES. SEC. 4. PURPOSES. Amends Section 1003 to develop and implement proposals for the restoration of fish and wildlife resources in the Great Lakes Basin. Amends definitions in SEC. 5. Section 1004 (16 U.S.C. 941b) is amended to redefine the term 'restoration' as rehabilitating and maintaining the structure, function, diversity, and dynamics of a biological system, including reestablishing self-sustaining populations of fish and wildlife. The term 'Report' refers to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service report titled \"Great Lakes Fishery Resources Restoration Study\" submitted on September 13, 1995. The term 'Committee' pertains to the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Proposal Review Committee, and 'non-Federal source' includes various entities such as State government, local governments, Indian Tribes, and private entities. SEC. 6. IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSALS. Amends Section 1005 (16 U.S.C. 941c) to focus on the identification, review, and implementation of proposals. The Director, in consultation with the Committee, ensures that proposals from the Study or annual requests to State and Tribal entities are developed and implemented. State Directors and Indian Tribes submit fish and wildlife restoration proposals based on the Study or other sources, consistent with the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and the Convention on Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission retains authority for sea lamprey management in the Great Lakes Basin, with the ability to request water resource projects from the Secretary of the Army. The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Proposal Review Committee is established to review proposals related to the management of Great Lakes fish and wildlife. It consists of representatives from State Directors and federally recognized Indian Tribes with authority in the Basin, appointed by State Directors and Tribal Chairs. The Committee's functions include an annual review of proposals. The Committee annually reviews proposals for Great Lakes fish and wildlife management, recommends priorities to the Director, and the Secretary selects and funds implementation of proposals, with 25% cost-sharing from non-Federal sources. The Director considers timely and appropriate financial contributions from non-Federal sources, including in-kind contributions like real or personal property and services. Valuations of in-kind contributions are final and not subject to judicial review. Federal funds received by a State or local entity cannot be included in the non-Federal share. The curr_chunk states that Federal funds received by a State or local government cannot be considered as a contribution by a non-Federal source for the purposes of this section. SEC. 7 amends Section 1007 to focus on the maintenance of offices. SEC. 7 amends Section 1007 by maintaining the Great Lakes Coordination Office in East Lansing, Michigan, and the Upper/Lower Great Lakes Fishery Resources Offices for coordinating and supporting fishery activities in the Great Lakes Basin. Subsection (c) is removed. SEC. 8. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\nThe Director must submit a biennial report to Congress detailing actions taken to implement section 1005, results of proposals under section 1005, and progress towards goals in section 1006.\n\nSEC. 9. AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nSection 1009 authorizes appropriations. Authorization of appropriations for the Great Lakes Coordination Office, Upper Great Lakes Fishery Resources Office, and Lower Great Lakes Fishery Resources Office is set at $1,500,000 for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. Additionally, $3,500,000 is allocated for fish and wildlife restoration proposals for fiscal years 1996 through 2002. Title II of Public Law 101-646 is repealed."
