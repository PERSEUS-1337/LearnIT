They should inform the subscriber of the procedures for filing a complaint and provide any evidence related to unauthorized changes.

State Right-of-Action allows States to take legal action against telecommunications carriers or resellers for unauthorized changes in telephone service providers, as outlined in the Communications Act of 1934. The State may take legal action against unauthorized changes in telephone service providers, seeking to enjoin such actions, recover monetary losses, or receive damages. Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions related to this matter. If violations are willful or knowing, the court may increase the award up to three times the original amount.

Venue for such actions can be where the defendant is found, is an inhabitant, transacts business, or where the violation occurred. Investigatory powers allow the attorney general of a State to bring civil actions under this subsection. The attorney general of a State, or designated official, can conduct investigations, administer oaths, compel witnesses, and produce evidence.
