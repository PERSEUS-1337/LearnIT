    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Building Better Health Centers Act of 2003\". Congress finds that lack of access to basic health services is a significant issue in the US, with millions of Americans unable to access primary care providers or health insurance. Health centers play a crucial role in addressing this problem by providing essential healthcare services in underserved communities. Health centers in the United States serve nearly 14 million Americans annually, including minorities, farmworkers, and homeless individuals. Studies show they offer high-quality, cost-effective care at an average cost of $1.25 per day. Expanding access to health centers is a proposed solution to the country's healthcare access problem, with many existing facilities in need of renovation. In a recent survey of health centers in 11 States, 2/3 identified a need to improve, expand, or replace their current facility, with an estimated $1.2 billion in unmet capital needs. Increasing access to health centers requires building new facilities in communities lacking access. Health centers struggle to fund capital improvements or new facilities, relying on private donations that may not be sufficient without a middle- and upper-class donor base. Health centers face financial challenges due to uninsured patients and low reimbursements, making it difficult to support loan payments. Lenders are hesitant to work with nonprofits lacking positive operating margins. While the Federal Government provides grants for operational expenses, there is no funding for capital needs like facility construction or modernization. To support health centers in providing care to the underserved, the Federal Government should help meet their capital needs for building modernization, expansion, or replacement. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. This section adds a new provision for Health Care Facility Grants and Loan Guarantees under the Public Health Service Act. The term 'eligible health center' refers to health centers receiving grants or subgrants under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to these centers for facility costs such as modernization, expansion, and construction. The Federal government can provide grants to eligible health centers for constructing new facilities, acquiring equipment, and supporting operations. The Federal share of the grant cannot exceed 90% of the total project cost, unless certain exceptions apply. The Secretary may guarantee loans for eligible health centers for capital projects if the project cost is over $750,000 or with a waiver. The program guarantees at least 90% of the loan amount from non-Federal lenders for capital needs projects. The Secretary has the authority to guarantee loans for health centers for capital projects, including acquiring, modernizing, expanding, or replacing facilities, constructing new facilities, purchasing or leasing equipment, and refinancing loans. Loan guarantees are not considered federal subsidies. The Secretary assumes authority for the loan guarantee program as outlined in section 330. The term 'facilities' in this subsection refers to buildings used by health centers to provide services permitted under section 330 and for other purposes that further the objectives of the health center. 'Non-Federal lender' is defined as any entity authorized to make loans, excluding federal agencies. The Secretary shall evaluate programs authorized under this section within 3 years of enactment, with recommendations for improvement. Funding for this section shall not exceed 5% of funds appropriated under section 330(s). Additionally, funds from the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 may be used for this purpose. The funds from fiscal years 1997 and 1998 under the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts can now be used for loan guarantees for medical facility construction. Additionally, authorization of appropriations under the Public Health Service Act is amended to include section 330L."
