    "content": "ERISA provides for three types of single-employer plan terminations: standard, distress, and involuntary. A standard termination occurs when a plan administrator decides to terminate a plan with sufficient assets to meet benefit liabilities. The administrator must give notice to affected parties, report plan information to the PBGC, and inform participants of their benefits. The PBGC's role in a standard termination is to confirm requirements have been met. After plan approval, assets are distributed to participants through annuities or other means. Missing participants' distributions may be held by PBGC until found. Plan administrator certifies asset distribution for termination. A distress termination occurs when a plan administrator seeks to terminate a plan with insufficient assets to cover all benefits owed. Certain criteria must be met, such as filing for bankruptcy or demonstrating the need to pay debts while staying in business. Written notice must be given to all affected parties, including the PBGC, at least 60 days before termination. The plan administrator must provide written notice to all affected parties, including the PBGC, 60-90 days before the proposed termination date. Additional information, including certification by an enrolled actuary, must be submitted to the PBGC. The PBGC determines if distress termination criteria are met and if the plan's assets are sufficient to pay guaranteed benefits. The PBGC determines if a plan's assets are sufficient to pay benefit liabilities, which may exceed guaranteed benefits. If assets are sufficient, the plan administrator must carry out termination procedures. If assets only cover guaranteed benefits, the administrator must distribute assets, certify to the PBGC, and take necessary actions to terminate the plan. If the plan's assets are not sufficient to pay guaranteed benefits, the PBGC must initiate involuntary termination proceedings. The plan administrator must notify the PBGC if assets are insufficient during distribution. An involuntary termination occurs when the PBGC decides a plan should be terminated due to lack of assets. Missing participants' benefits may be transferred to the PBGC or purchased as annuities. If the plan does not meet funding requirements, faces a tax deficiency notice, cannot pay benefits, or has unfunded benefits after a substantial owner's distribution, it may be terminated. A trustee, possibly the PBGC, can be appointed to manage the plan until termination is ordered by a court. The trustee is responsible for the plan's administration. The trustee is responsible for managing the plan's assets and administration. The PBGC can file a petition with the court to terminate the plan to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. The court may stay any pending proceedings involving plan property. In proceedings involving plan property, the court may appoint a trustee to terminate the plan if the PBGC agrees. The plan sponsor's liability ends after participants receive their share, and they may recapture remaining assets as a \"reversion,\" subject to an excise tax. In distress and involuntary terminations, the plan sponsor and its controlled group are jointly liable to the PBGC for benefit liabilities exceeding plan assets. The PBGC can recover these amounts, paying some to participants as additional benefits and keeping the rest to cover losses. The employer must pay the liability on the termination date, with arrangements possible for payments exceeding 30% of the collective net worth. The PBGC may also claim a lien for up to 30% of the net worth. The PBGC can claim a lien for up to 30% of the sponsor and controlled group's net worth in case of an underfunded pension plan. The lien has the same priority as a federal tax lien and can be enforced in U.S. district court. If a company sells or transfers a business to evade liability, they can still be held liable for unfunded pension plan liabilities. The PBGC has broad authority to investigate and may assess penalties for non-compliance, limited to $1,000 per violation. Failure to provide required notice or material information may result in a penalty of up to $1,000 per day. Plan participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, and sponsors can file suit in U.S. district court for violations of termination provisions. Employee organizations and the PBGC also have the right to intervene in any legal action."
