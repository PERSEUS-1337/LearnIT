    "content": "ENERGY INFORMATION FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. Requirement of Benchmarking and Disclosure for Leasing Buildings Without Energy Star Labels under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to include energy efficiency improvements like lighting, windows, and HVAC systems, as well as benchmarking the space under a recognized online platform. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 now requires benchmarking and disclosure for leasing buildings without Energy Star labels, including improvements in energy efficiency and benchmarking on a recognized online platform, unless privacy laws prevent access to utility data. Federal agencies leasing space must provide energy consumption information to building owners. The Department of Energy will conduct a study on the impact of state and local benchmarking and disclosure policies for commercial and multifamily buildings, as well as utilities providing aggregated information. The Department of Energy will conduct a study on best practice policy approaches for building energy efficiency, considering compliance rates, costs, and benefits for building owners, utilities, and tenants. The study will focus on systems providing aggregated energy consumption information to multitenant building owners, the impact of public utility commissions and State privacy laws, exceptions to compliance in existing laws for building owners unable to access whole building energy information, and the treatment of buildings with multiple uses, no baseline information, or high energy intensities. The study will cover various aspects such as energy intensities in different sectors, implementation practices, safety of benchmarking tools against cyber-attacks, and international experiences with building benchmarking laws. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress at the end of the study. The Secretary, in coordination with relevant agencies, will assess and maintain existing databases or create new ones to store public energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. The Secretary will assess and maintain databases for energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings, including data on benchmarking, energy ratings, and voluntary disclosures by owners. Competitive awards may be given for effective research outcomes. The Secretary will seek input from stakeholders and submit progress reports to Congress every 2 years. $2,500,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for implementing energy consumption programs in multitenant buildings."
