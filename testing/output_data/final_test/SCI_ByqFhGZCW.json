Attackers can create adversarial examples if they know the classifier's parameters, while defenders can strengthen the classifier by retraining with these examples. The ongoing battle between attacks and defenses raises questions about equilibrium in this dynamic scenario. This paper introduces a neural-network based attack class to approximate a broader range of attacks. Researchers have discovered that state-of-the-art object classifiers can be easily deceived by small, imperceptible changes in input data. This vulnerability has been attributed to various factors such as linearity, low flexibility, and decision boundary characteristics. The ongoing battle between learning-based attacks and defenses, compared to gradient-based approaches, is demonstrated using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. This vulnerability poses a significant risk, especially in critical scenarios like autonomous vehicles. In critical scenarios like autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art object classifiers can be easily deceived by small changes in input data. Various methods of generating adversarial examples have been proposed, with defense methods such as adversarial training, defensive distillation, and training with an ensemble of adversarial examples. Whitebox attacks, where the model and classifier parameters are known to the attacker, require a more robust defense than just relying on parameter secrecy. The text discusses the vulnerability of classifiers to adversarial attacks, highlighting the importance of robust defense mechanisms. Adversarial training is proposed as a method to strengthen classifiers against attacks, but it is noted that repeated adversarial sample generation and training can still leave the classifier vulnerable. The main question posed is whether a classifier can be made robust against all types of attacks. The text discusses the vulnerability of classifiers to adversarial attacks and questions if a classifier can be robust to all types of attacks. It mentions the challenge of optimization-based attacks and the use of learning-based attacks for analytical study. The text discusses learning-based attacks on neural networks, which can generate adversarial examples in real-time with single feedforward passes. It introduces a continuous game formulation for analyzing attack-defense dynamics, where an attacker perturbs input samples to maximize classification task risk under certain constraints. The text discusses the dynamics of attack-defense in adversarial examples, where attackers perturb input samples to maximize risk, and defenders adjust parameters to minimize risk. The effectiveness of an attack or defense depends on the opponent's strategy in a two-player game scenario. The text proposes a new continuous optimization method to find minimax and maximin solutions in constant-sum games. It shows that the minimax solution from this method is different and more robust than conventional methods. The paper also discusses the difficulty of defending against multiple attack types and presents minimax defense as the best worst-case defense method. The text proposes a sensitivity-penalized optimization method to find continuous minimax solutions for defending against multiple attack types. The proposed method is demonstrated with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, showing its effectiveness in making classifiers robust to adversarial attacks. Several methods of generating adversarial samples and defense strategies were proposed in static scenarios. While some researchers suggested using detectors to reject adversarial examples, the minimax approach presented in the paper can also be used to train detectors. The idea of using neural networks to create adversarial samples has been explored in other papers, demonstrating the possibility of generating strong adversarial samples through a learning approach. The paper discusses defense learning neural networks to counter misclassification in the feature space. It introduces a method that retrains the whole classifier as a defense strategy, considering the dynamics of learning-based defense and attack. The optimization algorithm proposed in the paper aims to find an equilibrium in the game, similar to the unrolling method but simpler. The paper proposes a simpler optimization algorithm with gradient-norm regularization for privacy preservation. It explores the cat-and-mouse game between attackers and classifiers, demonstrating the use of adversarial training as defense against attacks like FGSM and IFGSM. The paper discusses the FGSM and IFGSM attacks on classifiers, proposing a sensitivity-penalized optimization method for finding equilibrium more efficiently. The attacks generate perturbed examples to fool the classifier, with the IFGSM attack iteratively refining the adversarial example. The use of true labels in the attacks is debated, but the paper uses them for simplicity. IFGSM attacks are effective at fooling classifiers, as shown in Table 1 with perfect misclassification on a convolutional neural network trained with clean MNIST images. Adversarial training, using a 1:1 mixture of clean and adversarial samples, can weaken these attacks. Table 2 displays the results of adversarial training for different attacks, showing the impact of defense mechanisms on test error rates. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of IFGSM attacks on classifiers, achieving perfect misclassification on a neural network trained with clean MNIST images. Adversarial training significantly reduces these attacks, with error rates below 1% for adversarial test examples. The defense mechanisms successfully avert FGSM and IFGSM attacks, achieving error rates comparable to the no-attack scenario. The impact of repeated adversarial sample generation and classifier retraining is a subject of interest for further experimentation. The attacker uses FGSM1 and Adv FGSM1 to attack the classifier, leading to a sequence of models. Initially, near-perfect attacks and defense are achieved, but as iterations increase, the attacker weakens. An optimization approach is suggested for a more efficient cat-and-mouse simulation. The text discusses training the classifier with adversarial examples and updating it with a single gradient-descent step to regenerate adversarial examples. The defender should minimize a cost function to choose parameters that minimize the impact of attacks. The cost function minimizes risk and penalizes abrupt changes in input to make the classifier insensitive to perturbations, preventing attackers from exploiting large gradients. The formulation allows for easy implementation using gradient descent updates, and defense parameters can be found using automatic differentiation for robustness against attacks. The defense parameters u can be found to be robust against gradient-based attacks. Training using gradient descent for MNIST results in a decrease in test error. Adversarially trained classifiers show robustness to certain attacks but susceptibility to others, displaying a cat-and-mouse nature. After 80 rounds, the classifier Adv FGSM80 becomes robust to FGSM80 and moderately robust to other attacks. The classifier Sens FGSM from direct minimization of FORMULA7 is the most robust overall. The Sens FGSM classifier is the most robust overall compared to Adv FGSM80 and LWA FGSM. However, it is still vulnerable to attacks like FGSM80. The question of making a classifier robust to various attacks is discussed further in the next section. In this section, different types of attacks on classifiers are discussed, including FGSM, Adv FGSM, Sens FGSM, and LWA FGSM. The attacker-defender dynamics are formulated as a game, with minimax and maximin solutions considered. Algorithms are presented for generalizing the approach. The optimization-based attack max DISPLAYFORM0 is discussed, with the potential for attackers to be more general than specific attack classes like FGSM. The optimization-based attack max DISPLAYFORM0 can generate strong adversarial examples with unrestricted patterns Z. These examples are non-generalizable, requiring re-computation for each new test sample. To simplify the problem, a class of manageable perturbations {z(\u00b7; v) | \u2200v \u2208 V } is used, approximating the full class of patterns Z. The AttNet is a generalizable approximation to optimization-based attacks, requiring only single feedforward passes in the test phase. It uses a three-layer fully-connected network with 300 hidden units per layer and feeds the label y along with the features x. The l \u221e -norm constraint is imposed on z(x) \u2212 x \u2264 \u03b7. The empirical risk of a classifier-attacker pair is defined as f(u, v), where the input x is transformed by the attack network z(x; v) before being fed to the classifier g(z(x; v); u). The AttNet is a learning-based attack network that transforms input data using a three-layer fully-connected network. It maximizes the risk for a fixed classifier, outperforming FGSM attacks on adversarially-trained classifiers. AttNet is particularly effective against defenders hardened against gradient-based attacks, showing the difference between learning-based and gradient-based attacks. The AttNet is a learning-based attack network that outperforms FGSM attacks on adversarially-trained classifiers. It can successfully attack hardened networks, unlike FGSM. The dynamics of the classifier-attacker pair involve optimizing parameters to minimize risk, with the minimax defense being the best worst-case solution. The minimax defense is a conservative defense strategy that may result in lower risk than predicted. Finding the global minimizer and maximizer functions is challenging in practice, leading to the use of gradient descent for optimization. Incremental updates are made to the maximizer function due to its difficulty in exact determination. The formulation is related to unrolled optimization proposed for training GANs. The algorithm minimizes risk and prevents attackers from exploiting sensitivity. It is independent of adversarial examples and can be used for other minimax problems. The maximin solution is considered, where the minimizer function is defined. The maximin solution, defined by DISPLAYFORM0, is the best worst-case solution for the attacker. It is a conservative attack and provides a lower bound compared to the minimax scenario. If the defender is not optimal or does not know the attack method, the actual risk can be higher than predicted. The minimax and maximin defenses and attacks have inherent properties. The lemma explains that the most effective defense against the optimal attack is minimax, and the most effective attack against the optimal defense is maximin. The risk of the best worst-case attack is lower than that of the best worst-case defense. These properties help understand the dependence of defense and attack, providing a range of possible risk values. The text discusses minimax and maximin solutions in optimization, comparing them to the alternating descent/ascent method. It highlights how these different approaches converge to different values when applied to a common problem, as shown in FIG2. Minimax and Alt converge to different values, leading to different classifiers. Minimax defense is more robust than Alt defense against AttNet attacks at \u03b7 = 0.3 and 0.4. Minimax is moderately robust against FGSM attacks, while Sens FGSM is very vulnerable. This suggests a difference in solutions found by the algorithms and highlights vulnerability to specific attack classes. The study found that Minimax defense outperforms Alt defense against AttNet attacks and is moderately robust against FGSM attacks. Adversarial examples generated by various attacks exhibit diverse patterns. The framework has limitations, and the need for a robust classifier against a large class of attacks is emphasized. The minimax defense found in the study is not robust to all possible worst attacks, but it is possible to build a defense against multiple specific types of attacks. The minimax defense against a mixture of fixed-type and learning-based attacks can be found by solving a complex problem. Due to the computational demand, this remains a future work. The study also discusses the bigger picture of the game between adversarial players. The study discusses the adversarial game between players in the context of privacy preservation against inference attacks. The leader-follower setting is used, where the defender perturbs data to protect privacy, and the attacker tries to extract sensitive information. The roles are reversed in the attack on privacy problem, with the classifier as the attacker and the data perturbator as the defender. The privacy mechanism is public knowledge, and the classifier attacks perturbed data. The risk for the defender is the accuracy of inferring sensitive information. Solving the minimax risk problem gives the best defense against inference attacks. Adversarial and privacy attacks can be addressed using similar frameworks and optimization algorithms. In this paper, a continuous game formulation of adversarial attacks and defenses using neural networks is presented. The minimax defense against this attack class is well-defined and achievable, outperforming adversarially-trained classifiers. Demonstrations are done with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The MNIST classifier architecture is similar to Tensorflow model 2, trained with specific hyperparameters. The attack network has three hidden fully-connected layers of 300 units, trained with hyperparameters such as batch size = 128, dropout rate = 0.5, and optimizer = AdamOptimizer. The sensitivity-penalty coefficient of \u03b3 = 1 was used. The CIFAR-10 dataset was preprocessed by removing the mean, normalizing pixel values, clipping values to \u00b12 standard deviations, and rescaling to [\u22121, 1]. The classifier achieved \u223c 78% accuracy with test data using a simplified architecture. The attack network has three hidden fully-connected layers of 300 units, trained with hyperparameters like batch size = 128, dropout rate = 0.5, and optimizer = AdamOptimizer. The sensitivity-penalty coefficient of \u03b3 = 1 was used. Experiments were repeated with the MNIST dataset using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Error rates of different attacks on adversarially-trained classifiers for CIFAR-10 are shown in Table 8 and Table 9. The sensitivity penalty is a result of minimizing error rates of FGSM vs learning-based attack network on various adversarially-trained classifiers for CIFAR-10. FGSM fails to attack 'hardened' networks, but AttNet can still successfully attack them."
