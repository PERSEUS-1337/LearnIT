    "content": "Over the last few years, tensions between the United States and its European allies on Middle East issues have been evident, including Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Iran. Differences in combating terrorism are growing wider, and approaches to challenges posed by Syria may be a key focus on the transatlantic agenda. European perspectives on the region are shaped by common elements unique to Europe's history and geostrategic position. Some U.S. officials are concerned about recent disputes with European capitals on Middle East issues. Disputes between Washington and European capitals on Middle East issues could impact U.S. policies, transatlantic relations, and counterterrorism efforts. International cooperation is crucial for U.S. counterterrorism strategy, with provisions in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aiming to enhance collaboration. Despite efforts to mend transatlantic relations, policy differences are likely to persist. Analysts highlight common interests in combating terrorism, preventing WMD proliferation, and promoting Middle East peace. Experts assert that U.S. and European policies share common goals in combating terrorism, preventing WMD proliferation, and promoting Middle East peace. However, differences in priorities lead to varying tactics in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and other regional challenges. The Bush Administration emphasizes tackling terrorism and weapons proliferation for U.S. national security, while Europe sees the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a key source of regional instability. The employment of different tactics by the U.S. and Europe in pursuing their foreign policy agendas in the Middle East is influenced by various factors such as their histories, economic ties, threat perceptions, and views on the use of force. European views are shaped by their historical experiences in the region, including religious crusades and colonialism, leading to tensions with the U.S. over their roles and approaches in the Middle East. Europeans caution against overconfidence in winning Arab \"hearts and minds\" through force due to wariness and guilt from their colonialist past. They support Palestinian freedom and Israeli security but believe peace with Palestinians is essential. Europeans prefer diplomatic conflict resolution in the Middle East, viewing it as part of their neighborhood. Promoting political and economic stability is crucial for addressing regional problems. Europeans emphasize the importance of promoting political and economic stability in the region to prevent spillover into Europe. They point to incidents of terrorism and waves of migrants fleeing instability. The Muslim population in Europe is significant, rooted in past immigration policies, while the U.S. Muslim population is smaller. Islam plays a vital role in European politics, influencing their stance on U.S. policies. Many analysts suggest that the politically well-organized Jewish community in the United States influences stronger U.S. support for Israel, while Europe's economic ties with the Middle East are a key reason for differing U.S.-European approaches. EU is the primary trading partner of the region, with exports almost three times larger than the U.S. Some argue that European countries are motivated by protecting commercial ties with the Middle East. European countries prioritize protecting their commercial ties with the Middle East, which influences their approach to security concerns. Some experts believe that diverging threat perceptions between the U.S. and Europe have been evident since the end of the Cold War. Some European leaders are aware of possible links between terrorist groups and weapons proliferators in the Middle East, but the average citizen is not as concerned. The March 11, 2004, terrorist bombings in Madrid heightened European perceptions of the threat of Islamist terrorism to Europe. Europeans are more prone to emphasize multilateral solutions based on international rule of law due to their history, which includes abiding by rules and working cooperatively in institutions like the United Nations and the European Union. Many Europeans, especially Germans, avoid using force to manage conflicts and prefer \"soft power\" tools like diplomatic pressure. Europeans prioritize multilateral solutions based on international rule of law and prefer \"soft power\" tools like diplomatic pressure. Some European officials reject the notion of military weakness, citing their involvement in past military campaigns. Tensions with the Bush Administration are exacerbated by perceptions of unilateralism and disinterest in Europe. Many European governments were critical of the Bush Administration's stance on international treaties and missile defense before September 11. The terrorist attacks temporarily eased tensions, but disagreements resurfaced in early 2002. European leaders were alarmed by Bush's \"axis of evil\" characterization of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, as well as other U.S. actions like rejecting the International Criminal Court and imposing steel tariffs. Europe's history and preference for multilateral solutions clashed with Washington's perceived unilateralism and division of the world into good and evil. Some Europeans welcome Bush Administration's efforts to improve US-European relations, but tensions remain. EU's desire for a larger global role has also strained US-European ties. The EU's efforts to develop a Common Foreign and Security Policy have led to tensions with the US. While the EU has had success in consensus on the Middle East peace process and dealing with Iran, disagreements on Iraq have caused divisions among key EU members. The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy has led to tensions with the US, particularly regarding the use of force against Iraq. European countries, led by France and Germany, opposed using force to disarm Iraq, citing skepticism of U.S. arguments and the belief that the threat posed by Iraq was not imminent. Key policy gaps exist between the U.S. and Europe on various challenges in the Middle East. Many European countries, including France and Germany, opposed using force against Iraq due to concerns about the consequences of war and the belief that Saddam Hussein was contained. They feared that toppling Saddam could lead to further fragmentation and instability in Iraq, as well as inflame their own domestic Arab populations. European officials also noted the double standard in using force against Iraq while overlooking Israeli actions, which could antagonize Muslims. Many Europeans opposed war in Iraq without explicit U.N. authorization, fearing it could further antagonize Muslims and destroy the international system of rules created after World War II. Even countries like London, Madrid, and Rome preferred a second U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force. The Bush Administration's approach to Iraq has raised concerns among Europeans. The Bush Administration's actions in Iraq have raised concerns among Europeans about the use of force and the potential consequences. Some worry that it could set a precedent for other states like Russia or China to take similar measures under the guise of national security. However, the administration argues that the war in Iraq has actually deterred countries like Libya from pursuing weapons of mass destruction. French and German officials deny that their diplomatic approach to Iraq was driven by economic interests, citing years of sanctions that minimized such concerns. The Bush Administration's actions in Iraq have caused concerns among Europeans about the use of force and its consequences. Some fear it could set a precedent for other countries like Russia or China. French and German officials deny that their diplomatic approach to Iraq was influenced by economic interests. U.S.-European tensions over Iraq have lessened but still exist, with frustrations over minimal military or financial assistance from some European countries. The role of the United Nations in rebuilding Iraq was a major point of contention during the U.S.-led occupation. In contrast to Washington's initial preference for a limited U.N. role in Iraq, the U.S. sought increased international participation in stabilizing the country after facing insurgency attacks. France and Germany, along with other European nations, were hesitant to contribute troops or aid due to the restricted U.N. involvement. The Administration secured a Security Council resolution in October 2003 calling for international assistance in rebuilding Iraq. The Security Council resolution in June 2004 endorsed the transfer of Iraqi sovereignty and gave the United Nations a key role in supporting Iraq's political transition. Despite initial resistance from France and Germany, the return of sovereignty was welcomed, but additional European military and financial contributions remained limited. France and Germany objected to the perceived U.S. decision-making monopoly. Some European countries objected to the U.S. decision-making monopoly on Iraq policy and were hesitant to support a NATO role in Iraq. However, at the June 2004 NATO summit, European allies agreed to help train Iraqi security forces. In December 2004, NATO decided to increase training personnel in Baghdad, but six European allies refused to participate in the mission. NATO gained commitments from all 26 allies to contribute to training Iraqi security forces, either in or outside of Iraq, or through financial contributions to NATO trust funds. This will enable training for about 1,500 Iraqi officers per year. NATO opened a Joint Staff College outside of Baghdad in September 2005 for management and leadership training for Iraqi military officials. The January 2005 Iraqi elections aimed to improve U.S.-European relations, but France and Germany have not provided significant additional assistance in rebuilding Iraq. France eventually agreed to contribute financially and provide one military officer for training Iraqi security forces under NATO. Germany is training Iraqi forces outside of Iraq, citing financial constraints and public pressure to withdraw troops due to ongoing violence. Several European countries are reducing their troop presence in Iraq due to tight defense budgets and public pressure. Spain, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands, and Bulgaria have all withdrawn or reduced their forces. The United Kingdom and Italy may also consider troop reductions in the future. The Bush Administration is trying to maintain international commitments in Iraq. The Bush Administration is working to uphold international commitments in Iraq by proposing allies shift troops to training and reconstruction missions as Iraqi forces take on more security responsibilities. European countries, along with Albania and Macedonia, are contributing troops or police to Iraq, with some contingents being very small. The EU has launched a mission to train Iraqi police, administrators, and judges, primarily outside of Iraq due to security concerns. The EU will establish a liaison office in Baghdad and may consider future training in Iraq if security conditions improve. EU leaders are contributing financially to Iraq's reconstruction, pledging $1.25 billion at the Madrid donors conference in 2003. Some EU members, such as Belgium and Sweden, are offering bilateral reconstruction assistance. Germany has contributed $155 million for humanitarian aid since the Iraq war began in 2003, while France has also provided support. Since the outbreak of the Iraq war in March 2003, France has provided about $11 million in humanitarian aid. The EU has allocated over $600 million for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Iraq since 2003, with an additional $240 million proposed for 2006. The EU has also contributed $96 million for Iraqi elections and the referendum on a new constitution in 2005. Plans are in place for a trade agreement with Iraq in 2006 and the establishment of a permanent EU delegation office in Baghdad. Several European countries, including France and Germany, are assisting in reducing Iraq's foreign debt. Several European countries, including France and Germany, have agreed to help reduce Iraq's foreign debt. France accepted a compromise to write off 80% of Iraq's debt in November 2004. European opposition to the war with Iraq was partly due to frustrations with U.S. policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. EU members have managed to forge a more common position on this issue. The EU has a common position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, seen as sympathetic to Palestinians by some. However, others believe it is balanced due to differences among members. European officials prioritize resolving the conflict for stability in the Middle East and to combat terrorism. The EU's security strategy highlights resolving the conflict as a top priority. European officials prioritize resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a top EU priority. They believe the United States has an unbalanced, excessively pro-Israeli policy, alienating the broader Muslim world. European leaders urge the U.S. to do more to restart negotiations, hoping Yasser Arafat's death in 2004 will create a new opportunity for peace. Some U.S. observers suggest Europe's pro-Palestinian stance is driven by underlying anti-Semitism. In January 2004, two Jewish leaders accused the European Commission of fueling anti-Semitism due to its handling of reports. They criticized the release of an opinion poll showing 59% of Europeans viewed Israel as a threat to world peace. The leaders also objected to the shelving of a 2002 study on anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, which pointed to disenfranchised Muslim youth as the main perpetrators. EU officials defended their actions, stating the report was withheld due to poor quality. The EU released a draft report on anti-Semitism in December 2003 after it was leaked to the press. In March 2004, a new study was published, identifying perpetrators as young white Europeans and Muslim youth. Some Jewish leaders criticized the study for downplaying the role of Muslim perpetrators in anti-Semitic attacks in Europe. Europeans emphasize that these incidents do not represent a widespread resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe. Many European governments have tightened hate crime laws and condemned anti-Semitic acts, which are not state-sponsored. EU officials pledged to combat anti-Semitism vigorously in 2004. Criticism of Israel is not equated to anti-Semitism, with European leaders criticizing Ariel Sharon's policies towards Palestinians. European officials have historically favored a parallel approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing the need for a viable Palestinian state to ensure Israel's security. The EU is the largest donor of foreign assistance to the Palestinians, providing nearly $600 million annually for humanitarian and development aid. The EU and its member states provide around $600 million annually to the Palestinians for stability, economic development, and reform. EU aid to the Palestinians between 2002 and 2005 was approximately $300 million per year, with measures in place to prevent funding terrorism. In contrast, the United States believes in a sequential approach, insisting on a clear Palestinian commitment to peace before serious negotiations can take place. Different U.S. administrations have varied in their approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Europeans believing that the September 11 attacks reinforced U.S. support for Israeli positions. The Bush Administration's stance on Palestinians hardened post-9/11, leading to criticism from Europeans who feel the U.S. is too influenced by Israel for political reasons. Despite challenges, there is optimism that common ground exists between U.S. and European policies on the conflict. EU leaders have shown encouragement in this regard. EU leaders have been encouraged by President Bush's support for a Palestinian state, welcomed the evolution of the diplomatic \"Quartet\" and its \"roadmap\" to a negotiated settlement, and largely agreed with the U.S. assessment that the Palestinian Authority must be reformed. They did not support Washington's call to replace Yasser Arafat as the head of the PA, viewing him as the democratically-elected leader. In 2003, the EU supported the creation of a new prime minister position in Palestine and backed stronger Palestinian institutions to combat corruption. They welcomed the U.S. Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) to promote development in the region. The Bush Administration proposed a U.S.-Middle East free trade area by 2013, similar to the EU's plans for a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone by 2010. The EU supported the creation of a new prime minister position in Palestine and backed stronger Palestinian institutions to combat corruption in 2003. European officials were encouraged by initial U.S. steps to revive the peace process after the war with Iraq. The Bush Administration released the Quartet's roadmap in April 2003, with President Bush visiting the region in June 2003. President Bush set up a U.S. diplomatic team in Jerusalem to monitor the roadmap's implementation and designated Condoleezza Rice as his personal representative on Israeli-Palestinian affairs. Many Europeans are frustrated by the lack of progress on the roadmap for Israeli-Palestinian peace, criticizing the Bush Administration for not pressuring Israel enough to make concessions. Critics argue that the Administration remains focused on ending Palestinian terrorism before taking serious steps towards peace, with the U.S. monitoring team in Jerusalem failing to provide necessary public scrutiny. The lack of progress on the Israeli-Palestinian roadmap has frustrated many Europeans, who criticize the Bush Administration for not pressuring Israel enough. The U.S. monitoring team in Jerusalem failed to provide the necessary public scrutiny, leading to concerns that Israel's disengagement from Gaza could create a de facto Palestinian state on less territory than envisioned in the roadmap process. The EU opposes changes to pre-1967 borders and supports negotiations for final status issues, including the return of Palestinian refugees. European governments influenced the G8 Summit to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in efforts to promote reforms in the region. The Europeans criticized the Greater Middle East Initiative for not addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, expressing concerns that the US might use it as an alternative to the peace process. President Bush promised to create a democratic Palestinian state, but critics argue that progress has been slow. Many Europeans criticize the slow progress in seizing the opportunity after Arafat's death for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. US officials prefer an incremental approach, emphasizing Palestinian efforts to democratize, reform, and combat terrorism. The election of Mahmoud Abbas in January 2005 was welcomed as a step towards ending terrorism. Abbas needs time to establish legitimacy before engaging in final status negotiations with Israel. European leaders urge the US to play a more active role in resolving the conflict. European officials urge the United States to play a more active role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by pressuring Israel towards peace. They welcome US actions, such as Secretary of State Rice's trip to the region and the appointment of a coordinator for Palestinian security reforms. The EU also appreciates US support for a Quartet special envoy overseeing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. European policymakers highlight Secretary Rice's direct involvement in brokering a deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Secretary Rice's involvement in brokering a deal between Israel and the Palestinians on security controls for Gaza border crossings in November 2005 has positively impacted European perceptions of the United States. The agreement aims to end Gaza's isolation, promote economic development, and ensure Israeli security. The EU is assisting with monitoring the Rafah border crossing, deploying about 70 monitors to provide training to Palestinian police and customs officers. Additionally, the EU plans to establish a Palestinian police training mission and monitor the upcoming Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006. The EU is allowing limited contact with Hamas candidates for the Palestinian elections, despite Hamas being on the EU's terrorist list. The Bush Administration has called for all Palestinian factions to renounce violence but has not supported Israel's call to exclude Hamas from the elections. EU missions, like the one at Rafah, aim to show the Union as a responsible political player in the region. Some in the EU believe that U.S. leadership is essential for long-term peace, but they are disappointed with the level of U.S. engagement. The Bush Administration's low-key approach to promoting peace in the Middle East is contrasted with the EU's engagement with Iran. While both sides share similar goals regarding Iran, their policies have often differed sharply, with the US favoring isolation and containment while the EU leans towards engagement. Frictions between the US and EU over Iran peaked in 1996 with the passage of the US Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. Frictions between the US and EU over Iran peaked in 1996 with the passage of the US Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA), which imposed sanctions on foreign firms investing in Iran's energy sector. Tensions eased as US policy shifted towards engagement after the election of moderate Mohammad Khatemi as Iran's president. However, differences resurfaced in 2002 when President Bush included Iran in the \"axis of evil\" due to alleged arms shipments and undeclared nuclear facilities. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. In 2002, President Bush expressed support for Iranians seeking political reform, signaling a shift in U.S. policy towards Iran. Suspicions arose about Iran's involvement in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's ousting. European leaders remained hopeful for reform within Khatemi's government. European leaders remained optimistic about reform within Khatemi's government, highlighting Iran's positive role in campaigns against the Taliban and efforts to combat drug smuggling. They viewed alleged arms shipments and support for terrorist groups as remnants of a hardline Islamic foreign policy. The EU believed in its \"conditional engagement\" policy to support reformers, launching negotiations on a trade agreement in December 2002. In December 2002, the EU initiated negotiations on a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran, along with a linked political accord focusing on human rights, non-proliferation, and counterterrorism. The EU insisted on equal progress on both fronts, rejecting U.S. criticism of prioritizing commercial interests over security concerns. However, EU-Iranian trade pact negotiations were suspended in 2003 due to Iran's slow political reforms and human rights violations, as well as concerns about Iran's nuclear program compliance. Heightened EU concerns over Iran's nuclear program and lack of compliance with IAEA safeguards led to a stalemate on the trade pact. Despite initial hopes for a deal in 2003, Iran's failure to meet inspection requirements and decision to resume uranium production strained relations. EU members have since taken a tougher stance, supporting resolutions with the US criticizing Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA. The EU and US have taken a tougher stance on Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA, with the EU's new WMD policy calling for political and economic pressure on potential proliferators. Despite some willingness to compromise, Washington remains cautious about Iran's intentions and advocates for IAEA resolutions. In September 2004, Washington pushed for an IAEA resolution with a deadline for Iran to suspend enrichment activities. The US wanted a trigger mechanism to automatically refer Iran to the UN Security Council if it didn't comply, but backed down due to lack of support. European governments brokered a deal with Iran in November 2004 to halt activities that could lead to nuclear weapons in exchange for civilian nuclear technology and incentives. Iran agreed to temporarily suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for civilian nuclear technology and incentives. Negotiations with the EU3 in December 2004 aimed at a long-term agreement on nuclear, economic, and security cooperation. The EU also resumed trade negotiations with Iran in January 2005. The US was skeptical of the EU3 approach, believing Iran was using negotiations to buy time for a covert nuclear weapons program. Europeans urged greater US engagement with Iran. European countries pushed for increased U.S. involvement in negotiations with Iran to enhance their ability to deliver on potential rewards, such as supporting Iran's membership in the WTO. The Bush Administration eventually offered economic incentives to Iran in exchange for cooperation on nuclear issues, including access to airplane parts and support for WTO accession talks. In return, the EU3 promised to pursue punitive measures if negotiations failed. The EU3's negotiations with Iran stalled in August 2005 after Iran resumed uranium conversion. The EU3, along with the United States, have been working on an IAEA resolution to refer Iran to the U.N. Security Council, facing opposition from many IAEA members. In September 2005, the US and EU3 convinced a majority of IAEA board members to find Iran in non-compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refer it to the U.N. Security Council. However, due to lack of support, they did not set a timeline for the referral. Instead, they supported a Russian proposal for enriching Iranian uranium in Russia, which Iran rejected, insisting on enrichment within its borders. The EU3 offered to hold exploratory meetings with Iran to restart negotiations on its nuclear program. Iran must suspend uranium conversion work for formal negotiations to resume. Washington suggests curbing trade with Iran if talks fail. President Ahmadinejad's controversial statements may complicate negotiations. European countries are working to strengthen resolve for U.N. sanctions on Iran, while also considering military options. European policies towards Syria lean towards engagement rather than isolation, with historic relationships and trade partnerships. EU-Syrian relations are hindered by concerns about Syria's commitment to reforms and human rights protection. In October 2004, Syria and the EU negotiated an Association Agreement focusing on trade, foreign aid, human rights, and counterterrorism efforts. The Agreement has not been ratified by the EU. In contrast, U.S.-Syrian relations have been strained with political and economic sanctions imposed by Washington. The EU and some European governments have hardened their views on Syria due to concerns over its military presence in Lebanon and involvement in Lebanese politics. France, in particular, has been vocal about Syria's dominance in Lebanon, viewing it as a destabilizing influence and calling for political reform. In early September 2004, France and the United States co-sponsored a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces in Lebanon and an end to foreign influence in Lebanon's political system. The EU endorsed this resolution in December 2004, which also called for disbanding armed groups in Lebanon, including Hizballah with ties to Syria. The assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in February 2005 led to U.S.-European efforts to pressure Syria to withdraw its military and intelligence personnel from Lebanon. Washington, Paris, and the EU pushed for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon following suspicions of Syrian involvement in the assassination. The EU, along with Paris, urged Syria to withdraw from Lebanon following suspicions of Syrian involvement in the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Syria announced its withdrawal of military and intelligence personnel from Lebanon in March 2005, with the United Nations verifying the absence of significant Syrian presence. Concerns remain about Syria's cooperation with the U.N. investigation and its influence in Lebanon. The United Nations Security Council passed resolutions urging Syria to cooperate fully with the investigation into the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The resolutions did not include economic sanctions to maintain international unity. The United Nations Security Council extended the probe into political killings in Lebanon, with some suspecting Syrian involvement. There are concerns about the sustainability of U.S.-European cooperation on Syria, with the U.S. potentially pushing for punitive measures sooner. The EU is hesitant to designate Hizballah as a terrorist group, citing its social services and support for violence against Israel. Since September 11, 2001, U.S. and European officials have worked together closely to combat terrorism, with many European governments cooperating with U.S. law enforcement in tracking suspects and freezing assets. The EU has also strengthened laws against terrorism and improved border control mechanisms. Additionally, the EU has increased efforts to enhance police and judicial cooperation within member states and with the United States to combat terrorism and other cross-border crimes. The March 11, 2004, terrorist bombings in Madrid and the attacks on London's mass transport system in July 2005 have prompted increased EU efforts to combat terrorism and focus on Islamist recruitment and radicalization in Europe. Differences in U.S. and European approaches to counterterrorism have become more evident, with most EU members viewing terrorism primarily as a law enforcement and political issue rather than a military problem. Many European officials are uncomfortable with equating the war in Iraq with the war on terrorism. The Bush Administration's tendency to equate the war in Iraq with the war on terrorism has raised concerns among Europeans. Past experiences with domestic terrorists in European countries have led many to believe that using force only alienates \"hearts and minds.\" Europeans are worried about losing the battle for Muslim support due to U.S. actions like the war in Iraq, support for Israel, and human rights violations at Guantanamo Bay. The Abu Ghraib prison scandal has damaged U.S. credibility in the Middle East and Europe. The 9/11 Commission and European officials expressed concerns about U.S. prisoner abuse and alleged CIA prisons in Eastern Europe. Many Europeans believe addressing political, social, and economic disparities is crucial in combating terrorism. European leaders were initially skeptical of the U.S.-proposed Broader Middle East initiative. European leaders were initially skeptical of the U.S.-proposed Broader Middle East initiative, concerned about imposing Western values and potential backlash from introducing democracy in Arab countries. Some suggest a more nuanced, country-by-country approach to work with reformers and combat terrorism. The compromise reached emphasizes regional partnerships. The Broader Middle East initiative focuses on regional partnerships for political reform and development within Middle Eastern societies. The 9/11 Commission sees it as a potential dialogue starter between the Muslim world and the West. However, skeptics question its effectiveness in promoting U.S.-European cooperation in the region, as both sides may continue to use their own policy instruments. Provisions in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 aim to enhance Middle East development, reform, and international collaboration against terrorism. U.S.-EU friction also arises from differences in defining what constitutes terrorism. The EU faces friction with the U.S. over defining terrorism, particularly in naming organizations to the terrorist list. Differences exist in categorizing groups as revolutionary or terrorist, and in distinguishing between political and military wings of organizations like Hamas. Disagreements persist on adding related charities or individuals raising money for Hamas to the list. EU member states remain divided on these issues. The EU member states are divided on how to treat Hizballah despite pressure to include it on the common terrorist list. Concerns exist about potential negative impacts on U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism due to European opposition to U.S. policies in the Middle East. However, some analysts believe that law enforcement cooperation serves both European and U.S. interests, and efforts against terrorism continue despite disagreements over Iraq. The EU and the United States signed treaties on extradition and legal assistance to enhance cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Concerns persist about U.S. actions in Iraq affecting Arab countries' willingness to combat terrorism. The Bush Administration sees the Middle East as a critical source of terrorism and WMD threats that must be addressed for national security. Previous counterterrorist policies are criticized as inadequate. The Bush Administration criticizes the previous Clinton Administration's counterterrorist policies as weak, believing they contributed to Al Qaeda's sense of impunity. They view WMD possession by regimes as a significant threat and emphasize the importance of removing Saddam Hussein for peace in the region. The Administration is concerned about Al Qaeda acquiring WMD capabilities and feels Europe is not adequately addressing this threat. The Bush Administration aims to promote stability in the region by eliminating Arafat, hoping to deter terrorist networks and encourage Iran and Syria to abandon WMD acquisition and support for anti-Israeli groups. They prioritize resolving differences with Iran diplomatically and support efforts to curb Iranian nuclear ambitions. The Administration advocates for a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and emphasizes the need to end terrorism for a lasting peace in the Middle East. The Bush Administration sees Arafat's death as a chance for Palestinians to pursue democratic reforms and a negotiated settlement to the conflict. They aim to promote peace and stability in the Middle East by advocating for more democratically accountable governments, despite European skepticism. Some believe European governments have been slow to address the democratic deficit in the region due to fears of impacting relations with Arab states and commercial interests. The Broader Middle East Initiative has pushed European governments to confront the need for political, economic, and social reform in the region. The Bush Administration asserts that reforms in the Middle East should not be tied to progress on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They blame France, Germany, and others for damaging the credibility of multilateral institutions like the United Nations and NATO. President Bush stated that strong nations must support anti-proliferation efforts. Critics claim that France weakened the UN by blocking a resolution on Iraq, promoting its own international power image. France's self-image as a leading international power is tied to its permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Some European countries want to keep the US engaged in multilateral institutions to constrain its power. US officials accuse France, Germany, and Belgium of causing strains within NATO by blocking the deployment of military assets to Turkey in 2003. The Bush Administration supports EU efforts to develop a common foreign and security policy, hoping for a more effective partnership. Some U.S. strategists are concerned about the EU's stance on Iraq, fearing it aims to become a counterweight to the United States. This could lead to decreased U.S. influence in Europe and widen the transatlantic gap. European officials reject the idea of balancing Washington and are alarmed by attempts to keep Europe weak and divided. Congress supported U.S. efforts to contain Iraq. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the behavior of European allies like France and Germany in NATO and the United Nations. Sanctions were proposed against French imports and ending U.S. military contracts with certain French-owned corporations. H.Amdt. 55 called for prohibiting the use of Iraq reconstruction funds to purchase goods or services from France and Germany, but it was deleted from the final bill. Many Members are also concerned about possible next steps in the Middle East. Many Members of Congress are concerned about the Middle East peace process, particularly Palestinian terrorism. They support Israel and caution against negotiations until violence stops. Resolutions commending the 2005 Palestinian elections were passed by both the House and Senate. Mahmoud Abbas was welcomed as the new President of the PA, with calls for reform and an end to terrorism. Some Members demand accountability before providing financial assistance. In January 2005, the Bush Administration proposed $350 million in aid for Palestinian democracy and security programs. The FY2005 Supplemental Appropriations Act provided $275 million, with $50 million for Israel and $5 million for PA accounting evaluation. The FY2006 foreign operations appropriations act passed in November 2005 provides $150 million for the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Congress also continues to monitor Iran warily, imposing economic sanctions since 1979 to curb support for terrorism and WMD aspirations. In August 2001, Congress renewed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another five years to curb Iranian support for terrorism and WMD aspirations. Congress also allocated funds for democracy promotion activities in Iran in FY2004, FY2005, and FY2006. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.R. 282 to strengthen ILSA and provide aid to pro-democracy groups in Iran, with a companion bill introduced by Senator Rick Santorum. The United States maintains economic sanctions on Syria as well. In November 2003, Congress passed H.R. 1828 calling for sanctions on Syria until it stops supporting terrorism, ends its occupation of Lebanon, and halts WMD development. President Bush signed the bill as P.L. 108-175. The Bush Administration initially had concerns about the sanctions undermining the Middle East peace process and Syrian cooperation in the war against terrorism. However, the Administration dropped its objections in October 2003 due to escalating tensions between Israel and Syria. President Bush imposed sanctions in May 2004 banning U.S. exports to Syria and prohibiting Syrian aircraft from flying to or from the United States. Members of Congress expressed concerns over the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri and called for Syria to withdraw its military forces from Lebanon. Some Members are displeased with Syrian actions hindering the U.N. investigation into Hariri's death. Many Members remain concerned with the absence of Hizballah on the EU's common terrorist list. A resolution urging the EU to add Hizballah to its terrorist list was passed. The U.S.-European relationship has faced ups and downs historically, with concerns about the fraying of the partnership under the Bush Administration. Despite disagreements, the relationship is based on common values and shared interests, especially in facing challenges in the Middle East. The transatlantic relationship is seen as crucial, with few other prospective partners for the United States and its European allies. The Bush Administration's actions have strained the U.S.-European partnership, with disagreements over the Middle East and trade policies. Europeans feel the U.S. brought Iraq disputes into NATO without considering the alliance's security implications. Critics question bridging policy gaps due to Europe's limited military capabilities. U.S. policies on Iraq also exposed divisions within the EU as it seeks to strengthen its foreign and security policy. This has been a key reason for the divisive transatlantic quarrel over Iraq. The transatlantic quarrel over Iraq was divisive due to internal EU clashes, indicative of a broader power struggle among member states and candidates over the future of the Union's foreign policy. Despite common statements on Iraq disarmament, differences on the use of force were evident. The EU rift was exposed by some members and aspirants publicly calling for unity with the United States on Iraq, without prior consultation. French President Jacques Chirac criticized EU candidates for not consulting with Brussels or Athens before making statements on Iraq, attributing his outburst to fears of dwindling French influence over EU foreign policy development. Many new EU member states still see the United States as the ultimate guarantor of European security. Since the end of major combat operations in Iraq, European and EU officials have been seeking to mend fences, both within the EU and between Europe and the United States. The internal EU rift over Iraq may have reinvigorated EU efforts to build CFSP to avoid similar disputes in the future. In May 2003, EU foreign ministers tasked the EU's High Representative for CFSP, Javier Solana, with developing an EU security strategy to identify common EU security interests and joint policy responses. The new EU security strategy was officially approved in December 2003. At the June 2003 EU summit in Greece, EU leaders highlighted the EU as a reliable partner recognizing threats like terrorism, WMD, and failed states. The US welcomed the EU's new WMD doctrine and both sides pledged closer cooperation to combat the spread of WMD at the June 2004 US-EU summit in Ireland. At the June 2004 U.S.-EU summit in Ireland, both sides emphasized the importance of the U.S.-EU partnership and efforts to mend transatlantic relations. Despite progress in improving the relationship, skeptics believe that wounds from the Iraq dispute still linger, with diverging policies on various issues. The discussions between President Bush and European leaders have helped narrow differences on managing Iran and Syria, but the lasting impact of the Iraq dispute remains uncertain. The future of the transatlantic relationship post-Iraq dispute will depend on cooperation in rebuilding Iraq and a renewed commitment to Middle East peace negotiations. Concerns arise over NATO and EU unity if recriminations persist. Washington's confidence in NATO wavers due to lack of support from France, Germany, and Belgium during the conflict with Iraq. The conflict with Iraq led to concerns about NATO and EU unity, with some suggesting that the crisis emboldened France to pursue a European defense arm independent of NATO. This initiative was scaled back in December 2003, but experts believe it may drive the transatlantic alliance apart. EU leaders also agreed to enhance military planning capabilities, despite setting up a planning cell at NATO for transparency and cooperation. President Bush's visit to the EU in February 2005 helped alleviate European anxieties about U.S. intentions towards European integration. Concerns about U.S. policy choices related to Iran and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continue to impact the broader U.S.-European relationship. If future U.S. policy choices on Iran, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, or Syria divide EU member states and hinder CFSP development, it could strain the transatlantic relationship. Disputes over the Middle East may affect U.S.-EU trade relations and complicate efforts to resolve trade disputes or sustain cooperation in multilateral negotiations."
