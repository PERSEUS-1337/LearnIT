    "content": "Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko established an authoritarian regime in 1994, reversing progress towards democracy and a free market economy. The regime's Soviet-era policies have strained relations with the United States, which views Belarus as an obstacle to a \"whole and free\" Europe. Lukashenko's crackdown on opposition led to sanctions from the EU and US, while Russia has capitalized on the situation to increase its influence. Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, in power since 1994, controls all aspects of the country's political and economic landscape. He maintains a tight grip on power by removing or transferring officials, controlling the media, and keeping the business elite dependent on him. Lukashenko's regime is known for its authoritarian tactics and crackdown on opposition, leading to sanctions from the EU and US. Russia has taken advantage of the situation to increase its influence in Belarus. Belarusian President Lukashenko is known for his political unpredictability and repression of opposition groups. The regime has harassed, arrested, and beaten opposition figures, closed independent media, and NGOs. Lukashenko has convinced some Belarusians of his leadership providing stability in living standards and public order. In Belarus, the regime restricts independent media, NGOs, trade unions, and religious groups. A law in 2012 increased government control over the Internet. The 2010 presidential elections did not meet international standards, with the government favoring Lukashenko and state-owned media providing positive coverage. The vote count lacked transparency. The 2010 presidential elections in Belarus were criticized for lacking transparency, with observers noting significant irregularities in the vote count. Lukashenko was reelected with nearly 80% of the vote, while his main opponent, Andrei Sannikau, received less than 3%. Following election-night protests against electoral fraud, the government responded with arrests and beatings of opposition candidates and activists. Lukashenko released some political prisoners in 2011 and 2012, including Sannikau and his campaign aide, after they requested pardons and apologized for their actions. Belarus held parliamentary elections in September 2012, with supporters of the regime winning all 110 seats. Two opposition parties boycotted the vote, citing unfairness. Observers found the elections did not meet international standards due to issues like imprisonment of political leaders. Belarus's unreformed economy appeared to be doing well until the global economic crisis, buoyed by exports. About a dozen persons remain political prisoners in Belarus. Belarus's economy has been supported by exports to Russia and cheap Russian crude oil refining. State subsidies keep industrial production growing and official unemployment low. Lukashenko's policies have maintained a stable standard of living for many Belarusians, especially older and rural residents. State control dominates the economy. State control dominates Belarus's economy, particularly affecting older and rural residents. Workers are employed at state-owned enterprises on one-year contracts, subject to government approval for renewal. The global economic crisis led to a slowdown in economic growth, with GDP increasing by 10% in 2008 but slowing to 0.2% in 2009. Belarus received financial aid from Russia, the IMF, and the World Bank to stabilize its economy. However, dwindling foreign exchange reserves caused another economic crisis in 2011. The economic crisis in Belarus in 2011 was caused by dwindling foreign exchange reserves due to government overspending before the 2010 election. The IMF refused a loan due to the lack of economic reforms. Belarus allowed its currency to float freely, leading to a 50% devaluation. This, along with loans from Russia and asset sales, stabilized the external position temporarily. The devaluation negatively impacted living standards, causing hyperinflation and a sharp increase in consumer prices. Real GDP growth slowed to 2% in 2012. In 2012, Belarus's real GDP growth slowed to 2% after a 5.3% decrease in 2011. Experts predict another crisis in 2013 with potential devaluation of the Belarusian ruble. The country's external debt has risen significantly from $589 million in 2005 to $12 billion in January 2013. Belarus seeks high-interest loans from the Eurobond market and internal debt market due to the lack of IMF support. Belarus has close ties with Russia and is a member of the Eurasian Economic Community. Russian policy towards Belarus focuses on gaining control of key economic assets and limiting subsidies. Gazprom supplied Belarus with natural gas at discounted prices post-Soviet Union collapse. Belarus plays a crucial role in Russia's natural gas and oil exports to Europe. Gazprom pressured Belarus to sell half of Beltransgaz and other energy firms in 2006. Belarus agreed to sell Gazprom a 50% stake in key energy firms to avoid a quadrupling of gas prices and supply cut-offs. Lukashenko diversified energy supplies from countries like Venezuela and Kazakhstan due to reduced Russian subsidies. Belarus's close military cooperation with Russia and its strategic position between NATO and Russia have led to Russia subsidizing energy supplies to Belarus. Belarus is a member of the Russian-dominated CSTO and has integrated air defenses with Russia. Joint military exercises are conducted by Belarusian and Russian ground forces, with a small number of Russian troops stationed in Belarus. Despite being a loyal ally, Lukashenko has shown some independence from Moscow's foreign policy. Lukashenko has shown independence from Moscow's foreign policy by not recognizing Georgian breakaway regions as independent countries and providing asylum to former Kyrgyzstan President Bakiyev. Tensions with Moscow increased due to attacks in Russian media, but an agreement on oil export duties was signed before the 2010 presidential election. Belarus agreed to further integrate its economy with Russia's in a regional \"Single Economic Space.\" Russia has gained control of key Belarusian economic assets and provided a $3 billion stabilization loan through the Eurasian Economic Community. Belarus agreed to sell its remaining portion of Beltransgaz to Gazprom, receiving a reduction in gas prices and oil supplies from Russia. Belarus received a $1 billion loan from Russian Sberbank and the Eurasian Development Bank, putting up 35% of Belaruskali as collateral. Russia has economic leverage over Belarus and threatened to cut oil supplies in 2013 due to export duty evasion. Russian control of Belarusian assets like Belaruskali and refineries is likely. Belarus's cooperation with NATO is limited, with Lukashenko claiming NATO poses a military threat, despite being a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace. Belarus cooperates with NATO on the Northern Distribution Network, supplying troops in Afghanistan. Despite being a member of NATO's Partnership for Peace, Lukashenko claims NATO poses a military threat. The EU responds to Lukashenko's repressive actions with targeted sanctions, but refrains from imposing sanctions on Belarus as a whole. Lukashenko, under pressure from Russia, releases political prisoners to secure international loans while maintaining the regime's undemocratic nature. The EU responds to Belarusian regime's repressive actions with targeted sanctions, suspending them temporarily in 2008-2010. However, after fraudulent elections in December 2010, sanctions were re-implemented, including visa bans and asset freezes on top leaders. Sanctions would only be lifted upon the release of political detainees. The EU plans to provide urgent support to those detained on political grounds in Belarus and their families, while also aiming to strengthen aid to civil society, particularly targeting NGOs and students. They look forward to opening talks for visa facilitation with Belarus and express support for waiving or reducing visa fees for Belarusians. The EU remains committed to dialogue with Belarusian authorities but conditions deepening relations on progress towards respect for human rights. The EU conditions deepening relations with Belarus on progress towards democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Despite some political prisoners being released in 2011, others remained captive, facing ill-treatment and torture. The EU imposed sanctions on 243 individuals and froze assets of 32 firms linked to the regime. In addition to Lukashenko, the EU froze assets of 32 firms associated with the regime. Lukashenko has pressured the EU to avoid harsh sanctions, hinting at potential retaliation by Belarusian border guards. Belarus announced it will use Russian ports for exports instead of Baltic States' ports. Belarus announced it will use Russian ports for exports instead of Baltic States' ports, impacting Lithuania and Latvia's economies. Lukashenko barred opposition figures from EU conferences in retaliation for visa sanctions. Despite the lack of a visa facilitation agreement with the EU, Belarusians received the most \"Schengen\" visas per capita in 2011. Poland and Lithuania have been generous in providing visas to Belarusians for buying consumer goods. The EU allocated 19.3 million Euro for aid to civil society and media in Belarus between 2011 and 2013. The US recognized independent Belarus in 1991 but relations deteriorated due to Lukashenko's authoritarianism. US aid to Belarus has been limited, with criticism of human rights violations and relations with rogue regimes like Iran and Venezuela. US aid to Belarus has been meager, with $13.864 million provided in FY2011 and $11 million in FY2012. The Administration requested $11 million for FY2013, mainly for strengthening democratic parties, civil society, and media. Aid also supports exchange and education programs for Belarusian students, anti-trafficking efforts, and small businesses. Implementation of US programs has been challenging due to the Lukashenko regime's harassment of NGOs. The Belarusian government's restrictions on foreign aid to NGOs and imprisonment of unregistered NGO members have hindered U.S. aid delivery. The reduction of U.S. diplomats in Belarus has made program monitoring difficult. The U.S. and EU have imposed sanctions, including a visa ban on Lukashenko and top officials, freezing assets of state-owned Belneftekhim, a major exporter for Belarus. The US tightened financial sanctions against Belneftekhim, a conglomerate under Belarusian regime control. The impact was limited as the company has few assets in the US and the EU did not impose sanctions. Belarus interpreted the move as a tightening of sanctions, leading to diplomatic tensions with the US. Belarus recalled its ambassador and reduced diplomats in Washington. After Belarus reduced its diplomats in Washington to five, the United States complied with the request. In an attempt to improve relations, the US suspended sanctions on two Belneftekhim entities as a reward for releasing political prisoners. However, relations suffered a setback after Belarus's 2008 parliamentary elections were deemed unfair by the State Department. Belarus's 2008 parliamentary elections were criticized by the State Department for not meeting international standards. Despite the lack of democratic reform progress, the US extended the suspension of sanctions on two Belneftekhim entities. In December 2010, Belarus agreed to eliminate its supply of highly enriched uranium in exchange for US aid, leading to improved relations. Belarus agreed to eliminate its highly enriched uranium (HEU) in exchange for US aid, including assistance for security upgrades at the Belarus Joint Institute for Power and Nuclear Research. The US also offered support for Belarus's desire to build a new civilian nuclear power plant. The agreement aimed to improve bilateral relations, but the positive impact was overshadowed by the 2010 presidential election debacle. The US emphasized the importance of democracy and human rights in Belarus for enhancing relations. The White House strongly condemns Belarus for undermining democracy, using force against activists, and detaining protestors. The US rejects the legitimacy of the presidential election results and imposes sanctions on certain Belarusian companies. The US re-imposed sanctions on key Belarusian subsidiaries, expanded visa bans on officials responsible for election fraud, increased asset freezes, and pledged support for civil society and media. The US will review its policy based on Belarus taking specific actions. In response to US sanctions, Belarus suspended the elimination of highly enriched uranium. Belarusian parliamentary elections in September 2012 were criticized for not meeting international standards. The United States has imposed sanctions on Belarus for undemocratic actions, including sanctions on firms for non-proliferation violations. The US is also concerned about human trafficking in Belarus. According to the State Department's 2012 Trafficking in Persons report, Belarus is a country of origin and transit for women and children trafficked for sexual exploitation, listed as a \"Tier 2\" Watch List country. There is debate on the effectiveness of sanctions against Belarus, with some crediting them for liberating opposition leaders from prison, while others criticize them as largely symbolic and allowing the regime to continue lucrative business in the EU. Some experts warn that isolating Belarus with sanctions may benefit Russia's influence in the region, advocating for greater engagement instead. In the 112th Congress, Members strongly condemned human rights abuses in Belarus, leading to the passage of the Belarus Democracy and Human Rights Act of 2011. The Belarus Democracy Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate and House, signed into law by President Obama on January 3 (P.L. 112-82). The law condemns the fraudulent 2010 presidential election in Belarus and supports broadcasting to the country. It includes provisions for U.S. sanctions against Belarus and opposes multilateral financial aid to the country. The Belarus Democracy Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-82) expresses Congress's opposition to multilateral financial aid to Belarus until specific democratic and human rights criteria are met. It also calls for coordination with European countries on similar measures, requires reporting on weapons sales and personal wealth of Belarusian leaders, expands reporting to include weapons technology and training, and urges the suspension of the 2014 International World Ice Hockey event. The Ice Hockey Federation will suspend the 2014 International World Ice Hockey championship in Minsk until Belarus releases all political prisoners. This move would be a blow to Lukashenko, who is a hockey fan. The Senate approved S.Res. 105 condemning the 2010 presidential vote and calling for the championship not to be held in Belarus without the release of political prisoners."
