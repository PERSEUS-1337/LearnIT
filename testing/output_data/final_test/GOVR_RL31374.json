Prescription drug spending has more than doubled since 1981, but only slightly increased as a share of personal health expenditures from 1960 to 2005. Long-term care, including nursing home and home health care, now makes up a larger portion of health care expenses. In 2005, 85% of personal health expenditures were third-party payments, with private health insurance being the largest payer at 36% and the federal government at 34%. The health care system shifted from out-of-pocket to private insurance financing over the last four decades. Funding for personal health care changed from 1960 to 2005, with all health care ultimately funded by individuals through various means. In 2005, personal health care expenditures were funded by private insurance, the federal government, and out-of-pocket payments. Hospital care and physician services were mainly financed by private insurance and the federal government, while non-durable medical goods were mostly paid out-of-pocket. Nursing home and home health care were primarily funded by the federal government. The federal government primarily funds nursing home and home health care services, while dental services and prescription drugs are mainly covered by private insurance and out-of-pocket payments. State and local funds play a small role in financing these services, with the largest contribution in nursing home and home health care, as well as hospital care."
