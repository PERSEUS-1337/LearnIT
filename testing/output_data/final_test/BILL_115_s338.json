    "content": "The \"Scientific Integrity Act\" is defined as a Federal agency in the United States Code. Congress expresses a sense of importance on scientific integrity. Congress emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity in informing public policy decisions, ensuring trust in the scientific process, and keeping science free from external influences. Publicly funded science must adhere to policies and procedures to maintain public trust. SEC. 4. PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS. Federal agencies funding scientific research must promote open data exchange and prevent data suppression or distortion. Section 1009(a) of the America COMPETES Act is amended to develop principles for open data exchange and prevention of data suppression in scientific research funded by Federal agencies. The America COMPETES Act is amended to establish principles for open data exchange and prevention of data suppression in federally funded scientific research. These principles aim to encourage sharing of research data and findings, comply with existing laws like the Bayh-Dole Act, and consider the policies of scientific journals where federal scientists publish their findings. Scientific integrity policies are established under SEC. 6 of the America COMPETES Act to promote open data exchange and prevent data suppression in federally funded scientific research. The Scientific Integrity Act amends Section 1009 of the America COMPETES Act to require Federal agencies funding scientific research to develop and enforce policies for releasing data and findings to other agencies, policymakers, and the public. These policies must be submitted to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Congress, and be consistent with established principles. The Scientific Integrity Act mandates Federal agencies to establish policies that are consistent with established principles, specifically designed for the agency, applied uniformly, and widely communicated. These policies must ensure that scientific conclusions and personnel actions are not influenced by political considerations, and that selection and retention of science and technology positions are based on merit. The Federal agency's science and technology positions are based on expertise, credentials, experience, and integrity. Scientists must adhere to ethical standards in research and dissemination of findings. Procedures are in place to ensure scientific integrity, including review of public materials and addressing issues in the scientific process. The Federal agency ensures scientific integrity by addressing compromised scientific processes, making findings publicly available, ensuring accurate technical content, and implementing whistleblower procedures. The Federal agency's scientific integrity policy applies to employees and contractors involved in federally funded research, with procedures in place to protect whistleblowers and ensure the integrity of scientific information used in decision-making. The policy must be made public on the agency's website and disseminated to all involved parties. The scientific integrity policy for Federal agencies must be disseminated to new employees and contractors, with mandatory training for those involved in scientific research. Existing policies may be deemed sufficient if approved by the agency head. The scientific integrity policy for Federal agencies must be disseminated to new employees and contractors, with mandatory training for those involved in scientific research. If existing policies are deemed sufficient by the agency head, a written determination must be made and submitted to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Congress. SEC. 7. NAPA REVIEW. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will collaborate with the National Academy of Public Administration to assess the effectiveness of scientific integrity policies in promoting data exchange and preventing distortion. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will collaborate with the National Academy of Public Administration to assess and recommend improvements to scientific integrity policies."
