    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1999\" establishes a Medicare prospective payment system for psychiatric facilities. The Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1999 establishes a prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric services under the Social Security Act. This system determines the amount of payment for operating and capital-related costs of psychiatric facilities during a specified transition period. The Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1999 establishes a prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric services under the Social Security Act. The payment amount for operating and capital-related costs of psychiatric facilities is determined based on the TEFRA and PPS percentages of the per diem rates. The Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1999 establishes a prospective payment system for inpatient psychiatric services under the Social Security Act. Payment for operating and capital-related costs of psychiatric facilities is determined based on the applicable Federal per diem rate for the facility for the fiscal year in which services occur. For new facilities without a base fiscal year, payment is made using the Federal per diem rate. Facility-specific per diem rates are determined by the Secretary on a per diem basis for each psychiatric facility. The Secretary determines allowable operating and capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services on a per diem basis. The amount is updated for each cost reporting period by a market basket percentage increase. The Secretary determines allowable operating and capital-related costs of inpatient hospital services on a per diem basis, updated for each cost reporting period by a market basket percentage increase. The amount is standardized for each facility by adjusting for variations among them. The Secretary determines allowable costs of inpatient hospital services on a per diem basis, adjusted for facility variations in wage levels and case mix. Weighted average per diem rates are computed separately for urban and rural areas based on standardized amounts. The Secretary computes weighted average per diem rates separately for psychiatric facilities in urban and rural areas, including hospitals and units. The Secretary establishes separate average per diem rates for psychiatric facilities owned by government agencies and for other psychiatric facilities, weighted by the number of days of inpatient hospital services provided. The Secretary computes Federal per diem rates for psychiatric facilities based on weighted average rates, updated annually by the market basket percentage increase. The Federal per diem rates for psychiatric facilities are determined based on a weighted average rate, adjusted for variations in facility wage levels, case mix, and proportion of low-income patients served. Other adjustments are also made in computing these rates. The Secretary may adjust Federal per diem rates for outlier cases, indirect costs of medical education, and other factors deemed appropriate. Adjustments must maintain budget neutrality to ensure aggregate payments remain consistent. The Secretary is also tasked with establishing a patient classification system. The Secretary shall establish classes of patients in psychiatric facilities based on factors deemed appropriate and assign weighting factors to reflect resource usage. Data collection and utilization monitoring are also required. The Secretary may require psychiatric facilities to submit necessary data for implementing the system. Monitoring changes in inpatient hospital services utilization and reporting to Congress with recommendations for addressing unwarranted changes is mandated. The Secretary will reduce payment amounts for inpatient hospital services by a uniform percentage to offset increases in payments under this subsection in fiscal years 1999-2002. Reductions in payment amounts for inpatient hospital services will be made to offset increases attributable to the market basket percentage increase. These reductions will not impact payment amounts for cost reporting periods starting after fiscal year 2002. Definitions for terms like 'base fiscal year' and 'PPS percentage' are provided for clarity. The term 'psychiatric facility' includes psychiatric hospitals and units. The 'TEFRA percentage' refers to specific cost reporting periods. The TEFRA percentage for cost reporting periods varies from 75% to 25% between 2000 and 2003. Additionally, there are limitations on reductions under the Balanced Budget Act for Section 1886(b) of the Social Security Act. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 ensures that psychiatric facilities receive at least 95% of the payment for operating costs of inpatient hospital services for specific cost reporting periods. The amendments made by the Act apply retroactively to the enactment date."
