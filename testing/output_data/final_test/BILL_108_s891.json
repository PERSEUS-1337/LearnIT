    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prescription Drug Equity for Seniors Act of 2003\". Congress finds that manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price discrimination practices that force older Americans to pay significantly more for prescription drugs than their most favored customers. On average, older Americans who purchase their own prescription drugs pay twice as much as the most favored customers, and in some cases, over 15 times more. This discriminatory pricing sustains major drug manufacturers' annual profits of $20 billion but causes financial hardship and negatively impacts the health and well-being of older Americans. The financial hardship and health impact on older Americans due to price discrimination by prescription drug manufacturers is highlighted. Medicare beneficiaries are disadvantaged in obtaining prescription drugs at favorable prices compared to other federally funded health care programs. The policy set forth in this Act aims to address this disparity. Implementation of the policy in this Act will reduce prescription drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries by over 40%, improving health and lowering costs for older Americans. Providing prescription drugs to Medicare beneficiaries under hospice care will extend these benefits to vulnerable individuals. The Act aims to protect Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory drug pricing and provide them with reduced prescription drug prices.
