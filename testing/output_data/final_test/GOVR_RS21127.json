    "content": "Insider trading involves trading securities based on material nonpublic information to make a profit or avoid a loss. Federal statutes and SEC regulations prohibit insider trading, with the Securities Act of 1933 requiring registration of securities before public offering. The Securities Act of 1933 requires registration of securities before public offering, with the registration statement consisting of a prospectus for purchasers and Part II for inspection. Section 7 sets forth required information, while Section 10(a) specifies prospectus details. Additional regulations provide more details on the registration process. The Securities Act of 1933 requires registration of securities before public offering, with exemptions for certain transactions and securities. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 focuses on disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. Publicly traded companies with a certain number of shareholders must register with the SEC under the 1934 Act and file periodic reports. These reports must contain all material information necessary for investors to make informed decisions. Failure to disclose material information is actionable. Section 18(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act provide private rights of action for investors harmed by material misstatements or omissions in SEC filings. Rule 10b-5 prohibits fraud in statements filed with the SEC. Section 16 of the 1934 Act penalizes insiders for using inside information for short-swing profits. The 1934 Act imposes sanctions on insiders who use inside information for short-swing profits. Insiders, defined as those owning more than 10% of equity securities or being directors/officers, must report to the SEC when becoming beneficial owners. Reports must be filed within 10 days of ownership change or security transaction. Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act allows for the recovery of profits made from short-swing trading by insiders. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are commonly used in cases of insider trading violations and securities fraud. These laws prohibit the use of any means of interstate commerce or national securities exchange for fraudulent activities. Rule 10b-5, a general SEC rule, prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. This rule is often used in securities fraud cases. The Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 prohibits fraud, making untrue statements, or engaging in deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. The legislation aims to deter insider trading and maintain fair securities markets. The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 expanded civil penalties for insider trading, allowing the Commission to seek penalties up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided. President Reagan signed the Act after debates in Congress, aiming to hold officers and directors accountable for preventing insider trading. The STOCK Act, signed into law in 2012, prohibits insider trading for Members of Congress and federal officials. It also includes financial disclosure requirements. Civil and criminal penalties apply for insider trading violations, with potential penalties up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided. Other provisions like Section 10(b) may result in significant penalties for willful violations. SEC Rule 10b-5, implementing Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, is a key SEC rule frequently used in insider trading lawsuits. Rule 10b5-1 prohibits trading based on material nonpublic information, with penalties including fines up to $5 million and imprisonment for individuals, and fines up to $25 million for businesses. The regulation defines \"on the basis of\" to have a knowledge requirement for insider trading cases. Various affirmative defenses are allowed, such as entering into a binding contract or adopting a written trading plan before becoming aware of the material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-2 sets out duties of trust or confidence in insider trading cases based on the misappropriation of inside information. The misappropriation theory of insider trading expands on the classical theory by holding liable individuals who are not corporate insiders but receive inside information in confidence and breach a fiduciary duty to the source of the information for personal gain in the securities market. Rule 10b5-2 provides examples of \"duties of trust or confidence\" in such cases. Regulation FD prohibits insider trading by requiring public disclosure of material nonpublic information to the public when disclosed to certain individuals, such as securities market professionals. This rule aims to prevent selective disclosure and ensure fair market practices. The Strong v. Repide case illustrates the common law rule of fiduciary duty prohibiting company insiders from profiting from exclusive knowledge about the company. The court found that while a corporate director may not always have a fiduciary duty to disclose information affecting share value to shareholders, such a duty can exist in special cases, as it did in this instance. The Court found that a duty to disclose information affecting share value can exist in special cases, as it did in this instance. The SEC held that insider trading is prohibited under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, even if the person is not within the corporation but has privileged information about it. The SEC found that a broker's conduct violated SEC Rule 10b-5 by trading on inside information received from a director of Curtiss-Wright corporation about a dividend cut before it was made public. The broker was not a corporate insider but still committed fraud by deceiving purchasers. The SEC found that a broker violated SEC Rule 10b-5 by trading on inside information received from a director of Curtiss-Wright corporation about a dividend cut before it was made public. The broker argued that the obligation to disclose material information exists only in a special relationship with a company, but the SEC emphasized the importance of not taking advantage of privileged information for personal gain. The SEC rejected the broker's argument that material information disclosure is only required in face-to-face dealings, stating that such protection should also apply to transactions on exchanges. This case established that Rule 10b-5 extends to others, like broker-dealers, who receive insider information from a corporate source. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit supported the SEC's ruling in Cady Roberts by stating that anyone with inside information must either disclose it to the public or refrain from trading the stock. The U.S. Supreme Court later modified this rule in 1980, indicating that a duty to disclose is necessary for fraud to be actionable under Rule 10b-5. The Second Circuit held in Chiarella v. United States that a violation of Rule 10b-5 occurred when an employee of a financial printer failed to inform sellers of inside information about imminent takeover bids, leading to his conviction. The employee profited $30,000 by purchasing stock in target companies based on confidential information. The Supreme Court later reversed this decision, emphasizing the necessity of a duty to disclose for fraud to be actionable under Rule 10b-5. The Supreme Court reversed a decision in Chiarella v. United States, stating that an employee without a duty to disclose inside information about imminent takeover bids is not liable under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The case of Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission further clarified that individuals outside a corporation with inside information are not always liable for trading on it. The officer of a broker-dealer provided information to investors about fraudulent practices in an insurance company, leading to a drop in stock price and SEC investigations. Despite being censured by the SEC, the Supreme Court ruled that no violation of Section 10(b) had occurred in this case. Two elements are necessary to find a violation of Section 10(b) by a corporate insider, according to the Court. The Supreme Court ruled that no violation of Section 10(b) had occurred in the case of the broker-dealer officer providing information about fraudulent practices in an insurance company. The Court stated that for a corporate insider to violate Section 10(b), there must be a breach of fiduciary duty involving manipulation or deception. In this case, the insider did not trade on inside information or make secret profits, and therefore did not have a duty to disclose or abstain from trading. In Carpenter v. United States, R. Foster Winans, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, was charged with violating securities laws by using information obtained from corporate executives for his column. The column had the potential to impact stock prices, but the Court did not find him guilty under the misappropriation theory of securities fraud. Winans breached confidentiality by sharing advance information about his columns with Kidder Peabody employees, leading to profitable stock trades. The SEC investigation followed, and indictments were made after Winans and his roommate revealed the scheme. The Second Circuit found that Winans knowingly breached confidentiality by misappropriating prepublication information, violating securities laws and committing fraud. The Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit's decision, but did not elaborate on the violations. In a later case, United States v. O'Hagan, the Supreme Court legitimized the misappropriation theory. In United States v. O'Hagan, the Supreme Court upheld the misappropriation theory of securities fraud, convicting James O'Hagan for insider trading related to Grand Metropolitan PLC's acquisition of Pillsbury Company. O'Hagan made a profit of over $4 million by purchasing call options and stock in Pillsbury after learning of the impending acquisition. The SEC indicted O'Hagan on 57 counts, including securities fraud under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, leading to his conviction on all counts. The Supreme Court upheld the misappropriation theory of securities fraud in United States v. O'Hagan, convicting James O'Hagan for insider trading. The Court found that O'Hagan's fiduciary status and willful intent to violate that status were sufficient to find him guilty of misappropriating confidential information. The Second Circuit overturned high-profile insider trading convictions in United States v. Newman, stating that the government failed to prove personal benefits received by insiders providing information to analysts Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. The Second Circuit overturned insider trading convictions in United States v. Newman, ruling that the government must prove insiders received personal benefits for conviction. The Supreme Court declined to review the case, leading to the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Salman, which stated a close family relationship between insider and tippee is sufficient for conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court in Salman v. United States upheld the conviction of Bassam Yacoub Salman for insider trading based on tips from his brother-in-law, stating that a trader can be guilty even without receiving a tangible benefit if they are friends or relatives. This resolved a difference of opinion between U.S. Courts. In Salman v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of Bassam Yacoub Salman for insider trading based on tips from his brother-in-law, resolving a difference of opinion between U.S. Courts. The Court found that close family and friendship relationships among Salman and others involved in the case established a breach of the tipper's duty, as per the Dirks decision. In Salman v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that disclosing confidential information to a trading relative breaches fiduciary duty. Trading on this information also breaches trust and confidence. No bills on insider trading introduced in the 115th Congress, but three bills were proposed in the 114th Congress to prevent securities trading allowed under the Newman decision. Three bills were proposed in the 114th Congress to prevent securities trading allowed under the Newman decision. H.R. 1173 and H.R. 1625 aimed to amend Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act and introduce a new provision, Section 16A, to hold individuals liable for insider trading violations. H.R. 1625, 114th Congress, aimed to add a new Section 16A to the Securities Exchange Act to prohibit trading securities with material nonpublic information or wrongful use of information. It also prohibited communicating such information if it led to securities transactions. The wrongfulness standard was based on theft, breach of fiduciary duty, or violation of federal laws protecting computer data. The bill aimed to prohibit securities transactions based on nonpublic information or wrongful use of information, without requiring specific knowledge of how the information was obtained. It also authorized the SEC to provide exemptions from these prohibitions if consistent with the section's purposes. The proposed legislation aimed to prevent securities transactions using nonpublic information, with exemptions allowed by the SEC. The Supreme Court's Salman decision addressed some goals of the legislation but may not fully prohibit trading with inside information. The proposed legislation aims to prevent trading securities with inside information, with exemptions allowed by the SEC. The bills prohibit trading by anyone with inside information, not just relatives or friends."
