    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 44984 of the Education Code is amended to provide industrial accident and illness leaves of absence for certificated employees. The governing board of a school district must establish rules and regulations for these leaves, including a minimum of 60 days of allowable leave per fiscal year for the same accident. Industrial accident or illness leave for certificated employees under Section 44984 of the Education Code does not accumulate from year to year. The leave starts on the first day of absence and ensures that the employee receives a portion of their salary, along with temporary disability indemnity, up to their full salary. The calculation of \"full salary\" is based on the employee's average weekly earnings as defined in the Labor Code. Industrial accident or illness leave for certificated employees does not accumulate from year to year. The employee is entitled to benefits upon termination of the leave, including the option to use accumulated sick leave to supplement temporary disability indemnity for a full salary payment. The governing board of a district may provide additional leave for industrial accident or illness. During paid leave, the employee can endorse temporary disability indemnity checks to the district. If no rules are in place, employees are entitled to industrial accident or illness leave without limitations on the number of days. The governing board of a school district must provide rules for industrial accident or illness leaves of absence for classified service employees, with a minimum of 60 working days per fiscal year for the same accident. Leave cannot be carried over from year to year and starts on the first day of absence. Industrial accident or illness leave will start on the first day of absence and will be reduced by one day for each authorized absence. Payment for lost wages, when combined with workers' compensation, cannot exceed the normal wage for the day. If the 60-day leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee is entitled to only the remaining days from the previous year. (c) Industrial accident or illness leave is to be used instead of entitlement under Section 45191. Once this leave is exhausted, other sick leave can be used. If receiving workers' compensation, the employee can use accumulated sick leave, compensating time, vacation, or other available leave to ensure a full day's wage. \n(d) The governing board may provide additional paid or unpaid leave as needed, allowing the employee to return to their position without loss of status or benefits. Once paid leave is used up, the employee can request additional leave. During a paid leave of absence, the employee must endorse wage loss benefit checks received under workers' compensation laws. The district will issue appropriate warrants for payment of wages and deduct contributions. Leave entitlement can only be reduced as per this section. When all leaves of absence are exhausted and the employee is unable to return to work, they will be placed on a reemployment list for 39 months. During this period, they will have priority for vacant positions in their previous class, except in cases of lack of work or funds. The governing board of a district may require employees to serve a specified period before benefits are available, not exceeding three years. Employees are entitled to industrial and accident leave without limitation if no rules are in place. An employee on a reemployment list who is medically cleared but refuses an assignment will be dismissed. The governing board of a community college district must establish rules for industrial accident and illness leaves of absence for academic employees, especially for districts created or reorganized after January 1, 1976. The rules for industrial accident and illness leave for academic employees in a community college district must include provisions such as a minimum of 60 days of leave per fiscal year, no accumulation of leave from year to year, immediate commencement of leave upon absence, and payment of salary up to full amount when absent due to industrial accident or illness. The phrase \"full salary\" for industrial accident or illness leave is calculated based on the employee's average weekly earnings. Leave is reduced by one day for each day of absence, regardless of disability indemnity. Unused leave for the same illness or injury is carried over into the next fiscal year. Upon termination of industrial accident or illness leave, the employee is entitled to benefits as specified in Sections 87780, 87781, and 87786. The employee may use accumulated sick leave in addition to temporary disability indemnity to receive full salary. The governing board of a district can provide additional leave for industrial accident or illness as needed. During a paid leave of absence, the employee can transfer temporary disability indemnity checks to the district for salary payment. The district will issue salary warrants deducting retirement contributions and indemnity received by the employee. Without specific rules, employees are entitled to industrial accident or illness leave without limitations on days. The governing board of a community college district must provide industrial accident or illness leaves of absence for classified service employees, with specific provisions such as a minimum of 60 working days per fiscal year for the same accident, non-accumulative leave, and commencement on the first day of absence. Industrial accident or illness leave of absence will start on the first day of absence and will be reduced by one day for each authorized absence. Payment for lost wages, when combined with workers' compensation, should not exceed the normal wage for the day. If the 60-day leave overlaps into the next fiscal year, the employee is entitled to the remaining days from the current fiscal year. (c) Industrial accident or illness leave is used instead of Section 88191 entitlement. After exhausting this leave, other sick leave can be used. If receiving workers' compensation, only enough sick leave should be used to provide a full day's wage. The governing board may provide additional leave without loss of status or benefits. Leave of absence, paid or unpaid, does not break employee service. During a paid leave of absence, the employee must endorse wage loss benefit checks received under workers' compensation laws to the district. The district will issue appropriate warrants for payment of wages and deduct retirement and other contributions. Entitlement to leave can only be reduced in accordance with this section. When all leaves of absence are exhausted and the employee is unable to return to work, they will be placed on a reemployment list for 39 months. They will have priority for vacant positions in their previous class, except in cases of lack of work or funds. The governing board of a district may require employees to serve a specified period of time, not exceeding three years, before receiving benefits. Employees are entitled to industrial and accident or illness leave without limitation if rules are not adopted. An employee on a reemployment list who is medically cleared but refuses an assignment will be dismissed. The merit system applies to districts as if part of Article 3."
