    "content": "During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump proposed ethics measures, including extending \"cooling off\" periods on lobbying after government service, a five-year ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress, and a lifetime ban on senior executive branch officials lobbying for foreign governments. President Trump's Executive Order 13770, issued on January 28, 2017, implemented an ethics pledge for executive branch appointees and revoked President Obama's similar executive order. President Trump's executive order, similar to Obama's and Clinton's, focuses on regulating public and executive branch interactions through ethics pledges. The report compares the ethics pledges on lobbying, government ethics, and the \"revolving door\" among the three administrations. Options for change are also evaluated. The right of citizens to petition the government is a fundamental aspect of the citizen-government dynamic. Interactions between private citizens and the executive branch can take various forms, including traditional petitioning and the \"revolving door\" phenomenon where individuals move between government and private sector roles. The revolving door between government and the private sector raises concerns about undue influence and neutrality of government employees. Proponents argue that it can attract high-quality candidates, while critics fear industry-friendly decisions at the expense of the public interest. Studies suggest regulators may take aggressive actions against industry. Studies have shown that regulators may engage in aggressive actions against industry and do not necessarily favor industry, regardless of job prospects. Interactions between the public and private sectors can increase knowledge in both sectors, regulated through law, executive orders, and Administration policy. Administration policy typically focuses on disclosure and restrictions for government employees rather than outright bans on certain activities. For example, the Obama Administration issued guidelines in 2009 for executive branch employees' contact with lobbyists regarding ARRA funds. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (Title III, the Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act [RLA]) was the first lobbying law that applied to individuals attempting to influence legislation for pay. Lobbying laws, ethics laws, and revolving door laws regulate the relationship between governmental and nongovernmental actors. The Obama Administration issued guidelines in 2009 for executive branch employees' contact with lobbyists regarding ARRA funds. The RLA, which regulated lobbying efforts towards Congress, was replaced by the LDA in 1995. Under the LDA, individuals must register and disclose lobbying activities if they are employed by a client for compensation and their lobbying activities amount to 20% or more of their time over a six-month period. The LDA also refined thresholds and definitions of lobbying activities. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 established standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees, required financial disclosure by high-ranking government officials, and aimed to preserve the accountability and integrity of public officials and federal institutions. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 set ethical standards for executive branch employees, mandated financial disclosure, and established the Office of Government Ethics. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 expanded post-employment restrictions, limited outside income, increased financial disclosure, and restricted gifts and travel for government officials. Laws like 18 U.S.C. \u00a7207 regulate the movement of federal employees between government and private sectors. Laws like 18 U.S.C. \u00a7207 impose post-employment restrictions on executive branch personnel, including bans on \"switching sides\" on specific matters they worked on while in government, cooling-off periods for senior officials, and limitations on representational activities. Executive orders are directives or actions by the President that may have the force and effect of law. They are generally directed to government officials and agencies. Executive orders are directives by the President that govern actions by government officials and agencies. They have been used for major historical events and minor administrative policy changes. Since the 1960s, Presidents have issued executive orders to outline ethical requirements for executive branch employees. President John F. Kennedy's ethics executive order in 1961 coincided with increased congressional interest in ethics. Since the 1960s, Presidents have issued executive orders outlining ethical requirements for executive branch employees. President Kennedy's 1961 executive order included provisions later reflected in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Subsequent Presidents also issued ethics executive orders, but none required a pledge from appointees. Since the Ethics in Government Act of 1989, three Presidents have issued ethics executive orders. Since the Ethics in Government Act of 1989, three Presidents have issued ethics executive orders with an \"ethics pledge\" for appointees to sign. Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump have issued these orders. Additionally, Presidents can direct executive branch action through memorandums or guidance, often issued through the Office of Management and Budget. This guidance has been used to regulate contact between lobbyists and executive branch employees. During the Obama Administration, Treasury Department and OMB guidance provided instructions to federal employees on interactions with lobbyists regarding the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The guidance aimed to prevent lobbyist influence on fund disbursement, ensure funding decisions were based on investment criteria, and offer certification to Congress on each decision. During the Obama Administration, guidance was provided to federal employees on interactions with lobbyists regarding the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Investment decisions were based on criteria to prevent lobbyist influence, with all communications documented. Three Presidents have issued ethics pledges for Administration appointees since the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. President Clinton, Obama, and Trump each issued executive orders creating ethics pledges. President Clinton's pledge, Executive Order 12834, aimed to curb influence peddling. President Clinton's ethics pledge aimed to curb influence peddling by former government officials, including bans on lobbying and representing foreign agents. President Obama later issued Executive Order 13490, creating an ethics pledge for executive branch appointments, including a ban on gifts from lobbyists. President Clinton revoked his executive order on December 28, 2000. In 2009, Executive Order 13490 established ethics rules for government officials, including bans on gifts from lobbyists and lobbying the Administration after leaving government service. The order also allowed for waivers, established rules of procedure, and authorized enforcement by the Attorney General. The Obama White House emphasized the importance of following ethics and lobbying rules to serve the interests of the American people. President Trump issued Executive Order 13770, \"Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Appointees,\" which prohibits gifts from lobbyists, closes the revolving door between government and private sector, and requires government hiring based on qualifications. Appointees are required to sign a pledge abiding by these rules. President Trump's ethics pledge, outlined in Executive Order 13770, prohibits gifts from lobbyists, restricts the revolving door between government and the private sector, and mandates government hiring based on qualifications. Appointees must sign a pledge adhering to these rules, which include bans on certain activities for a specified period after leaving government service. The pledge also includes definitions of terms, a waiver process, and details on administration and enforcement. President Clinton's, President Obama's, and President Trump's ethics pledges have differences in provisions such as lobbyist gift bans and lobbying bans. Each pledge also outlines the Administration's stance on the relationship between government employees and lobbyists. A comparison of the three pledges can be found in the Appendix. The ethics pledges of Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump differ in restrictions for appointees entering and exiting government service, particularly in the areas of the \"revolving door,\" lobbying definitions, and representation of foreign principals. Each pledge imposes additional restrictions on appointees, with specific limitations for lobbyists. Both Obama and Trump's pledges include a two-year ban for appointees entering government service. President Clinton's ethics pledge included restrictions on appointees entering and exiting government service, with a lifetime ban on representing foreign principals and a five-year ban on lobbying executive agencies they had a personal connection to. President Clinton's ethics pledge included a lifetime ban on representing foreign principals and a five-year ban on lobbying executive agencies with personal connections. President Obama and President Trump extended cooling-off periods for executive branch officials and imposed bans on lobbying certain officials. Trump's pledge also included a five-year ban on lobbying any agency served in and a restriction on activities for foreign governments. The ethics pledges of Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump included bans on becoming lobbyists after leaving the Administration. Additional restrictions on lobbyists were also included, with differences in defining lobbying behavior. President Clinton's pledge had a lifetime ban on representing foreign principals, while Obama and Trump extended cooling-off periods and imposed bans on lobbying certain officials. Trump also included a five-year ban on lobbying any agency served in and restrictions on activities for foreign governments. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) prohibits individuals from lobbying for financial compensation if their lobbying activities make up less than 20% of the services provided to a client over a 3-month period. The LDA defines lobbying contacts as any communication made on behalf of a client to government officials regarding federal legislation, regulations, programs, or policies. The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) defines lobbying activity as communication with government officials to influence official action. This includes contacts, preparation, planning, research, and coordination with others. Former appointees are restricted from making such contacts. President Trump's ethics pledge expands the definition of lobbying, prohibiting former appointees from engaging in lobbying activities with covered officials. The ban allows exemptions for certain communication or appearances related to legal proceedings or agency processes. The distinction between lobbying contacts and activities is nuanced, with contacts involving oral or written communication with officials. President Trump's ethics pledge expands the definition of lobbying, prohibiting former appointees from engaging in lobbying activities with covered officials. Lobbying activities include both direct contacts with officials and support for those contacts by individuals who do not directly communicate with officials. This broader definition may encompass individuals who assist registered lobbyists in preparing for communications with officials, even if they do not personally contact officials themselves. The definition of lobbying has expanded under President Trump's ethics pledge to include individuals who support registered lobbyists but do not directly contact covered officials. This broader definition now includes \"shadow lobbyists,\" who engage in lobbying activities without meeting all the requirements for registration as a lobbyist. President Trump's ethics pledge has expanded the definition of lobbying to include individuals who support registered lobbyists but do not directly contact covered officials. This broader definition now covers \"shadow lobbyists\" who engage in lobbying activities without meeting all the requirements for registration. Post-government employment restrictions under the ethics pledge could also apply to those providing strategic consulting to lobbying firms or supporting registered lobbyists. President Trump's ethics pledge, like President Clinton's, includes restrictions on former appointees representing foreign principals, specifically prohibiting activities requiring registration under FARA. Congress could potentially codify these provisions into law, including revolving door restrictions and amending the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The options for future relationships between lobbyists and governmental decisionmakers include codifying additional restrictions from past ethics pledges by Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump. Congress could choose to make revolving door restrictions permanent, incorporate individual provisions like a lobbying gift ban, or add specific definitions, waivers, or disclosure concepts to federal law. Codifying ethics pledges or individual sections could make changes permanent, including extending \"cooling-off\" periods, banning certain positions for compensation, and restricting nongovernmental positions. Revolving door restrictions range from lifetime bans to one-year restrictions for senior officials. One option to consider is extending the cooling-off period for former appointees to two years or more, matching language in ethics pledges. This could potentially increase the talent pool available inside and outside the government. Alternatively, Congress could reduce or eliminate the cooling-off period and enact a blanket restriction on certain types of outside employment for the length of an Administration. Postemployment restrictions on executive branch appointees appointed by the President may prevent them from accepting certain outside employment until the end of the President's term or the next election. This policy aims to encourage appointees to serve the full term before seeking outside employment. However, there are potential disadvantages to such restrictions, as appointees could still take unpaid positions with private entities that may lead to future compensated roles. If Congress wants to prevent former appointees from becoming registered lobbyists, they could amend existing laws like the LDA. To prevent former executive branch appointees from becoming registered lobbyists, Congress could amend the LDA or FARA to include provisions similar to executive branch lobbying restrictions. Lobbyists are required to file disclosure reports under the LDA and FARA, with additional reporting requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007. Congress may consider expanding disclosure requirements to include program-specific disbursement information. Alternatively, Congress may find the current lobbying registration and disclosure provisions sufficient without the need for further amendments. The text discusses potential actions to prevent former executive branch appointees from becoming registered lobbyists, including amending existing laws or issuing executive orders. It also mentions comparing ethics pledges signed by Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump. The text discusses ethics pledges signed by Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump, focusing on covered employees, administration, enforcement, and other provisions."
