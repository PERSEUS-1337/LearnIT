    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium Act\". Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic disease leading to blindness and paralysis, affecting an estimated 11,000 patients in the United States. Women are disproportionately affected, with a large proportion of African-American patients. The average age at diagnosis is 41 years, but it can range from children as young as 2 to adults as old as 89. NMO is believed to be autoimmune in nature, with over 90 percent of patients experiencing recurrent disease and accumulating neurologic disability. Orphan diseases like NMO, with low incidence rates, often lack attention and research funding. No single institution has enough patients to conduct comprehensive research on NMO. There is a lack of studies analyzing all aspects of NMO to identify risk factors and biomarkers. Understanding NMO can help in studying other autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis and lupus. The sense of Congress is to establish a multicenter research effort to study the causes of NMO and identify biomarkers. Collaboration among academic medical centers is encouraged to investigate environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors related to NMO. Additionally, the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium is to be established. Establishment of the National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium under section 409K of the Public Health Service Act encourages collaboration among academic medical centers to study the causes of NMO and identify biomarkers. The National Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium (NNO Consortium) will be established by the Secretary of NIH within a year of the enactment of this section. It aims to provide grants for research on the causes, risk factors, and biomarkers of NMO. The NNO Consortium will assemble a panel of experts to provide ongoing guidance for research on NMO, including developing a common study design and standard protocols for collecting medical history, neurological examination, biospecimens, and radiological data. The NNO Consortium will designate a central laboratory for collecting and analyzing radiological data, with provisions for consensus review of cases and an integrated data collection network. Eligible consortia must demonstrate the capability to enroll in research studies. The NNO Consortium has the capability to enroll a minimum of 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from its designated catchment area, which does not overlap with other consortiums. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress summarizing funded research and listing grant-receiving consortia. The NNO Consortium can enroll 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from a specific catchment area. The Secretary will submit an annual report to Congress on funded research and grant-receiving consortia. Authorization of $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2014-2018 is provided for this purpose. The NNO Consortium can enroll 25 individuals with NMO diagnosis from a specific catchment area. The term 'consortium' is defined as a partnership of universities, health care organizations, or government agencies serving a designated catchment area."
