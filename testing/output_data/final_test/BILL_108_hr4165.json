    "content": "Incentives for biodiesel include a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing for a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined as the biodiesel mixture credit, which is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified mixture and the gallons of the mixture used by the taxpayer in the taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 38 is determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate for qualified mixtures of biodiesel V or biodiesel NV sold by the taxpayer for use as fuel. The biodiesel fuels credit is based on the sale or use of biodiesel V or biodiesel NV in the production of a qualified biodiesel mixture for off-highway use in a taxpayer's trade or business. The biodiesel fuels credit applies only if the biodiesel V used is for off-highway use and not required to be registered for highway use. Certification from the biodiesel V producer is necessary for the credit. The section defines biodiesel V as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from virgin vegetable oils for diesel engines, including oils from various sources. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the biodiesel mixture credit. The text discusses the registration requirements for biodiesel V and biodiesel NV, which must meet EPA and ASTM D6751 standards for use in diesel engines. Additionally, it mentions that biodiesel mixture not used as fuel may be subject to tax if certain conditions are met. If biodiesel V or biodiesel NV is separated from a qualified biodiesel mixture or used in a way other than as fuel, a tax is imposed based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons. All applicable laws and penalties apply. \"Tax penalties apply to any tax imposed under subparagraph (A) as if imposed by section 4081. Rules similar to section 52 apply for estates and trusts. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year.\" The biodiesel fuels credit can be elected for a taxable year by filing the return on time. The credit is treated as part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. No carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit is allowed before January 1, 2004. No portion of the unused business credit attributable to the biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A can be carried back to a taxable year before January 1, 2004. Amendments are made to sections 196(c) and 6501(m) of the Code to include the biodiesel fuels credit. The amendments made by this subsection regarding biodiesel used as fuel apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2003."
