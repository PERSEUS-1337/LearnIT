The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act amends Section 903 of the Social Security Act to provide for unemployment compensation modernization incentive payments to States from the Federal unemployment account. The maximum incentive payment for each State is determined based on a ratio and a set amount. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act amends Section 903 of the Social Security Act to provide incentive payments to States for modernizing unemployment compensation. Payments are transferred based on State law meeting specific requirements, including using a base period for eligibility determination. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act incentivizes States to modernize unemployment compensation by providing payments based on meeting specific requirements for eligibility determination, including using a base period that includes the most recent calendar quarter. The Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act encourages States to update unemployment benefits by using a base period that includes the most recent quarter. Part-time work may be excluded from eligibility if it does not make up the majority of an individual's base period. Separation from employment for compelling family reasons, such as domestic violence, is not grounds for disqualification from regular unemployment compensation. Weekly unemployment compensation is payable to individuals who are unemployed as determined by the State unemployment compensation law. This includes situations where the individual's safety or that of their immediate family is at risk, the illness or disability of a family member, or the need to accompany a spouse due to a change in their employment location. Individuals eligible for extended unemployment compensation must have exhausted their regular benefits under State law and be enrolled in a State-approved training program or a job training program authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. The program aims to prepare individuals for high-demand occupations after being separated from employment due to a declining occupation or permanent reduction of operations. The amount of compensation is based on the individual's average weekly benefit amount from the most recent benefit year. The total amount of unemployment compensation payable to an individual is at least 26 times their average weekly benefit amount, including dependents' allowances. Dependents' allowances are provided to individuals with dependents at a minimum of $15 per dependent per week, with a total allowance not less than $50 per week or 50% of the individual's weekly benefit. The State must submit an application for an incentive payment to improve its unemployment compensation program, including compliance with specific requirements. The Secretary of Labor will review the application and notify the State agency of their findings. The Secretary of Labor certifies State law provisions meeting requirements for incentive payments to be transferred to the State account promptly. State laws taking effect within 12 months of certification are considered in effect. No certification of compliance with certain requirements may be made for states not eligible under federal law. Applications submitted before or after specified dates will not be considered. Incentive payments transferred to a state account can be used as specified. The State can use transferred funds for cash benefits to individuals for unemployment, dependents' allowances, and administration expenses. Funds can also be used for the administration of unemployment compensation laws and public employment offices. The Secretary of the Treasury reserves $7,000,000,000 for incentive payments from the Federal unemployment account. The Secretary of the Treasury reserves $7,000,000,000 for incentive payments from the Federal unemployment account. Any unclaimed amount will become unrestricted for use after fiscal year 2011. Terms like 'benefit year', 'base period', and 'week' are defined under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. \"Special Transfer in Fiscal Year 2009 for Administration\" The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer funds to each State's Unemployment Trust Fund within 30 days of enactment. The amount transferred will be determined based on a ratio calculated by the Secretary of Labor. States can only use the funds for expenses related to administering their State laws. The Secretary of Labor may prescribe regulations to carry out the amendment, focusing on improving outreach, benefit operations, and reemployment services for unemployment claimants."
