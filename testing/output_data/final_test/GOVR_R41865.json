The legislative process involves resolving differences between House and Senate versions of a bill through a conference committee. Conferees from each chamber must agree on a common version, which is then issued as a report containing the agreed-upon text and a joint explanatory statement. The joint explanatory statement in the conference report discusses differences between House and Senate passed language, reasons for provisions chosen, and additional information on legislation purpose. If passed by both chambers in identical form, the legislation is sent to the President for approval, veto, or no action. Conference committee reports are available in the same formats as regular committee reports and can be found in the Congressional Record. If the President signs a bill into law, a signing statement may be issued. If no action is taken, legislation becomes public law after 10 days unless final adjournment of Congress has occurred, in which case it does not become law (pocket veto). If the President vetoes the legislation, Congress may override the veto with a two-thirds majority in the House. If the President vetoes the legislation, Congress may override the veto with a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The legislation then becomes law without the President's signature.
