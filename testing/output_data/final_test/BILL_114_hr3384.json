    "content": "The \"Quiet Communities Act of 2015\" may be cited as such. The Act includes findings. Congress finds that approximately 28 million Americans suffer from hearing loss, with 10 million cases attributed to noise exposure. Noise from various sources like aircraft and traffic can lead to sleep loss, psychological and physiological damage, and work disruption. Chronic noise exposure is linked to cardiovascular disorders, learning deficits in children, stress, and reduced quality of life. Excessive noise can also result in decreased worker productivity. The Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control to regulate noise emissions and promote noise education and research. However, funding for the office was terminated in 1982, leaving the EPA responsible for enforcing noise regulations without adequate resources. The Noise Control Act of 1972 prohibited State and local governments from regulating noise sources, leading to dormant noise abatement programs across the country. With population growth and increased air and vehicular traffic, noise pollution is expected to worsen in the future. The Environmental Protection Agency should take a leading role in combating noise pollution for the health and welfare of citizens. The Noise Control Act of 1972 led to dormant noise abatement programs. The Environmental Protection Agency should reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and Control to combat future noise pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency will reestablish an Office of Noise Abatement and Control with duties including promoting state and local noise control programs, conducting national noise research, and assessing noise environmental impacts. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will develop and disseminate information on noise effects and control methods, provide educational materials and training programs, and establish regional technical assistance centers to support state and local noise control programs. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control will assess the effectiveness of the Noise Control Act of 1972, focusing on local and State noise abatement approaches. A study on airport noise will be conducted by the Administrator using funds to contract independent scientists with expertise in noise measurements and abatement techniques. The Federal Aviation Administration will conduct a study on noise measurement methodologies and the impact of aircraft noise on communities. A report with recommendations on mitigating noise effects will be submitted to Congress within 24 months. SEC. 4 amends the Noise Control Act to include training programs on noise abatement equipment and implementing noise abatement plans. SEC. 5 authorizes $21,000,000 for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control for fiscal years 2016 through 2020."
