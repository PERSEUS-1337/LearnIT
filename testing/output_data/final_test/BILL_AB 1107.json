    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 17550.15 of the Business and Professions Code requires sellers of travel to deposit all received funds into a trust account and prohibits encumbering or withdrawing from the account except for specific circumstances. In partial or full payment to the carrier or provider of travel services for transportation purchased by the passenger, payment can be made by wire transfer directly to an account of the Airlines Reporting Corporation, or by check paid to the Airlines Reporting Corporation. Upon delivery of all tickets or vouchers necessary for the passenger to obtain transportation or services purchased, the seller of travel may withdraw compensation due for the sale. Tickets or vouchers are considered delivered if personally delivered, sent via a third-party delivery service, or mailed with prepaid postage. Upon full payment to the provider of transportation or travel services, the seller of travel can withdraw the commission due for the sale and make refunds to the passenger. The seller of travel is responsible for making refunds to the passenger and serving as trustee of the trust accounts required by the article. The trustee can designate an officer or employee to manage the trust account under their supervision and control. The seller of travel must maintain trust accounts at a federally insured bank, savings and loan association, or credit union. They must also provide an irrevocable agreement allowing authorities to examine and obtain copies of all business records related to the trust account. The seller of travel must maintain business records for at least three years. The Attorney General can recover examination costs and expenses in court, including attorney's fees. Sellers of travel have a fiduciary responsibility for sums received for transportation. Certain funds are held in trust for passengers. All sums received by the seller of travel for transportation or travel services are held in trust for passengers, even if not deposited in a trust account. Passengers have a claim on the trust for payments made for services not provided, with distribution based on the amount paid if funds cannot be identified. The seller of travel is exempt from the direct deposit requirement if payment is made by credit card and the seller does not handle the credit card charge. Transportation charges are processed by the carrier, while service charges are processed by the service provider. In lieu of the trust account requirement, a bond may be maintained by the seller of travel as specified in Section 17550.11. The seller must file a copy of the bond with the Attorney General before advertising transportation or services. Section 17550.44 of the Business and Professions Code is amended. Section 17550.44 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to require the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation to bill and collect annual assessments from participants for the operations fund and the restitution fund. Late fees apply for overdue payments. The annual assessment for the operations fund, determined by January 15 each year, should not exceed $35 per year per business location in the state. If the balance in the restitution fund is less than $1,600,000 by January 15, an assessment of up to $200 per business location in the state will be made to bring the fund to the expected balance. Assessments will be pro rata based on the number of locations for each participant. If the balance in the restitution fund is less than $900,000 on May 1 or October 15, the corporation will make emergency assessments of up to $150 per year per business location in the state to bring the fund back to $1,600,000. Assessments will be pro rata based on the number of locations for each participant. The board of directors will establish rules for emergency assessments, which will be pro rata based on the number of locations for each participant. The board of directors of the Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation may make emergency assessments of participants, up to $65 per year per location, if the operations fund is insufficient to cover costs. The Travel Consumer Restitution Corporation can transfer interest earned on the Restitution Fund to the Operations Fund, as long as the Restitution Fund balance does not fall below $1,200,000. Assessments must be paid within 45 days of billing, with a late fee of $5 per day up to $500. The Fund must report each assessment levy to the Attorney General within 10 business days."
