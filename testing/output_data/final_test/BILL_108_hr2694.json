    "content": "The \"Profiting from Access to Computer Technology (PACT) Act\" or the \"Child PACT Act\" aims to protect and transfer surplus educationally useful Federal equipment efficiently. Transfer of Equipment to GSA: Federal agencies must identify and transfer educationally useful equipment to the Administrator of General Services for conveyance to educational recipients. Hard drives must be erased according to Department of Defense standards before transfer. Each Federal agency must report educationally useful equipment in advance to the Administrator of General Services for direct transfer to educational recipients. Preference is given to recipients in designated communities. Non-classroom-usable equipment can be refurbished by nonprofit refurbishers. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for the refurbishment of non-classroom-usable Federal equipment before transfer to educational recipients at the lowest cost. The Administrator of General Services notifies educational recipients of available equipment, with assistance from regional Federal Executive Boards. The Code of Federal Regulations facilitates the transfer of Federal equipment to eligible recipients under this Act. SEC. 4. AGENCY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.\n\nFederal agencies with computer expertise employees should encourage them to help connect classrooms to the Nation's information infrastructure, assist teachers in using computers for teaching, and provide maintenance and technical support for educational equipment. \n\nSEC. 5. RULEMAKING.\n\nThe Administrator of General Services will establish rules and procedures for implementing this Act.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\nThis Act supersedes Executive Order No. 12999 of April 17, 1996.\n\nSEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not create any enforceable rights against the United States, its agencies, officers, or employees. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"Federal agency\" refers to an Executive department or agency, \"educational recipient\" means a school or educational organization, \"school\" includes prekindergarten, elementary, secondary schools, and local educational agencies, and \"community-based educational organization\" is a nonprofit entity engaged in educational projects.
