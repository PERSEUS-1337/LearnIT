    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2009\" defines terms like \"Fund\" as the Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund, \"marine renewable energy\" as energy from waves, tides, currents, and ocean temperature differentials, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy. It also focuses on marine renewable energy research and development. The Secretary is required to establish a marine renewable energy research and development program focused on developing new technologies, reducing costs, increasing reliability, integrating into the national grid, promoting cross-pollination with offshore wind, and assessing environmental impacts. The Secretary must establish a marine renewable energy research and development program to address environmental impacts, apply advanced systems engineering, develop open standards, transfer intellectual property to industry stakeholders, and incentivize compliance with standards. This program will be separate from any wind and hydropower programs. The Secretary will establish a marine-based energy device verification program to support the development and installation of marine renewable energy projects in partnership with various research institutions and laboratories. The program aims to increase marine renewable energy experience and gather operating and maintenance data through partnerships with universities, businesses, and organizations. Objectives include verifying performance, reliability, and cost of new designs and providing stakeholders with a chance to test marine renewable energy technology. The program aims to evaluate marine renewable energy technology in new areas, document and communicate project experiences, and resolve environmental issues through robust characterization, impact prediction, monitoring, adaptive management, and informing engineering design for improved environmental performance. Congress recognizes that the use of marine renewable energy technologies can reduce contributions to global warming. The \"Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund\" is established in the Treasury of the United States to promote new renewable energy technologies that reduce global warming gases and improve domestic energy production. The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer funds from the Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund to assist eligible entities in complying with regulatory permit requirements for marine renewable energy projects. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds from the Adaptive Management and Environmental Fund to assist eligible entities with regulatory permit requirements for marine renewable energy projects. A portion of the Fund is allocated for administrative expenses, and transfers to the Fund are made monthly based on Treasury estimates. To be eligible for a grant under this subsection, an entity must provide a regulatory permit with conditions for project removal if it has an adverse impact on the environment. The results of any assessment or demonstration conducted under this subsection must be publicly available, except for protected information. Entities receiving a grant must track and certify the use of funds for authorized purposes. The Secretary will oversee and audit grant funds usage by eligible entities, conducting annual audits and declaring entities ineligible for inappropriate use. If technologies and activities are no longer viable, a report will be submitted to Congress. The program authorized under this subsection and the Fund will cease to exist once technologies and activities reach maturity. The Secretary may use Fund amounts to assist State resource agencies with processing permits for marine renewables projects. Authorization of Appropriations: $250,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2010 to 2021 to carry out the applicable regulatory processes without affecting environmental requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
