    "content": "South Sudan, the world's newest country, emerged in 2011 after a long civil war with Sudan. The conflict left over 2.5 million people dead and 4.5 million displaced, hindering development. Despite abundant natural resources, high-level corruption and ongoing humanitarian needs have slowed progress. In 2013, South Sudan was the largest recipient of aid, but political tensions among leaders have continued to pose challenges. In December 2013, political tensions in South Sudan led to violence between President Salva Kiir and former vice president Riek Machar, triggering armed clashes and targeted ethnic killings. The conflict escalated with attacks on the Nuer ethnic group in Juba, followed by retaliatory violence. Machar declared a rebellion, leading to mass displacement. The conflict in South Sudan between President Salva Kiir and former vice president Riek Machar led to mass displacement and ongoing fighting for over 20 months. Despite attempts at peace negotiations by regional mediators, the warring parties repeatedly violated ceasefire agreements. After facing international pressure and sanctions threats, Kiir and Machar finally reached an agreement in August 2015, with Kiir signing the deal later than Machar and expressing reservations about its terms. After months of conflict, a peace agreement was signed in South Sudan, but progress was slow. Clashes decreased, but violations of the ceasefire continued. A new Transitional Government of National Unity was formed in April 2016, with Riek Machar returning as First Vice President. Efforts to demilitarize the capital failed, and ceasefire monitors struggled to confirm compliance with security arrangements. The unity government's formation in South Sudan did not end the conflict, with ongoing clashes and violence in various regions. Local communities have accused government forces of land grabs, looting, and extrajudicial killings, leading to mass displacement. President Kiir's decree in 2015 dividing the country's states has also contributed to tensions. President Kiir's decree in 2015 dividing South Sudan's states into 28 has intensified local tensions over land and resources. The unity government has made little progress on the peace deal, leading to clashes between opposition and government forces in Juba. Incidents of intense fighting and gunfire in the city have raised mistrust and escalated tensions. On July 8, a clash between forces of Kiir and Machar resulted in casualties. Fighting broke out in Juba on July 10, spreading quickly across the city. A U.N. official was wounded in one incident, while two U.S. embassy vehicles came under heavy fire but no one was injured. Questions have been raised about the safety of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Juba. Violence erupted in Juba on July 10 and 11, with intense fighting near the U.N. base resulting in civilian casualties, injuries to U.N. staff, and the death of two Chinese peacekeepers. Government restrictions hindered U.N. peacekeepers' patrols, while the opposition forces were overpowered by the army's use of heavy weaponry. Kiir and Machar eventually called for a ceasefire on July 11. Government forces in Juba reportedly used attack helicopters, tanks, and heavy weapons during the fighting. Opposition forces, including Machar, fled the city, with reports of serious abuses against civilians, including killings, disappearances, looting, and sexual violence. The Nuer ethnic group was targeted, with a journalist summarily executed and U.S. citizens assaulted during the violence. Several U.S. citizens were physically assaulted and women were raped by government forces in Juba. The attack was well-coordinated and specifically targeted Americans. The lack of response from U.N. peacekeepers nearby raised questions about the government's control. President Kiir established a commission of inquiry, but progress in holding responsible parties accountable has been slow. There has been little progress in bringing charges against those responsible for rapes and assaults in South Sudan, classified as a Level 3 humanitarian emergency. Over 50,000 people have been killed, with 2.7 million displaced since December 2013. More than 160,000 people have fled to Uganda since July, with a majority being women. The conflict in Uganda since July has led to a surge in humanitarian needs, with almost 90% of the displaced being women and children. Armed actors have caused threats such as killings, rape, looting, and child abductions. Displacement has disrupted farming, grazing, and trade, leading to collapsed markets and lost livelihoods. Food prices have skyrocketed, with inflation reaching almost 730% in August 2016. Aid agencies face challenges in pre-positioning supplies due to repeated looting, necessitating costly air deliveries of food. The conflict in Uganda has led to a surge in humanitarian needs, with almost 90% of the displaced being women and children. Armed actors have caused threats such as killings, rape, looting, and child abductions, disrupting farming, grazing, and trade. Food prices have skyrocketed, with inflation reaching almost 730% in August 2016. The looting of the World Food Program's main warehouse in Juba resulted in the loss of 4,500 metric tons of food, affecting over 4.8 million people facing life-threatening hunger. The operational environment for aid agencies is deteriorating due to ongoing insecurity. The operational environment for aid agencies is deteriorating in South Sudan, with the U.N. warning of a potential catastrophic situation as the dry season approaches. Some households in Northern Bahr el Ghazal are already in \"catastrophe\" due to severe food insecurity, driving thousands into neighboring Darfur as refugees. The conflict also hinders humanitarian access to Sudanese refugees in South Sudan. Tensions among South Sudanese leaders and ethnic groups stem from historical conflicts, including infighting during the civil war. In the 1990s, commanders nearly derailed the southern bid for self-determination. The SPLM/SPLA leaders competed for power along ethnic lines, leading to atrocities. Khartoum fueled SPLM splits by financing breakaway factions. The major factions reconciled in the early 2000s, paving the way for the 2010 elections and the southern referendum. South Sudan seceded in July 2011, but tensions with Sudan remain, and parts of the CPA are yet to be fully implemented. In 2012, South Sudan suspended oil production due to disputes with Sudan, leading to economic shocks and clashes. SPLM leaders put aside differences after the civil war but faced ethnic tensions and rivalries. Interethnic violence increased amid capacity constraints and political maneuvering for the 2015 elections. Political maneuvering before the 2015 elections exacerbated tensions in South Sudan. A new constitution was delayed after independence, leading to a power struggle within the ruling party. President Kiir's 2013 cabinet reshuffle deepened divisions, sparking violence in December of that year. The initial clashes in Juba between Dinka and Nuer soldiers escalated into a wider conflict across the country, with the military splitting along ethnic lines. The fighting in South Sudan occurred primarily in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile as the two sides vied for territory. Several senior SPLM political figures were arrested for plotting a coup attempt, which was later found to have no evidence. The detained politicians formed a third block at peace talks and participated in reconciliation talks hosted by Tanzania's ruling party. Under the August 2015 peace deal, they were allotted cabinet positions. The August 2015 peace deal in South Sudan allocated cabinet positions to senior SPLM political figures. U.N. officials warn that targeted attacks on civilians and U.N. personnel during the conflict may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. UNMISS reports gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law, with civilians being directly targeted along ethnic lines. The intensity and severity of abuses have escalated, including the destruction of villages and food stocks in 2015. In 2015, a new pattern of violence emerged in South Sudan, with entire villages and food stocks destroyed to deprive civilians of livelihood. UNICEF estimated 16,000 children recruited as child soldiers during the war, with concerns of a new spike in recruitment, particularly by the government. Over 650 children were recruited in 2016, some killed in targeted attacks. Conflict-related sexual violence, including ethnically targeted rape, has been prevalent. All parties to the conflict have engaged in targeted violence, as reported by the U.N. Panel of Experts. The UN documented 217 cases of sexual violence in Juba in July 2016, with little accountability for serious abuses during the conflict. The African Union established a Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan to investigate human rights violations and make recommendations. The African Union Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan, led by former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, released its final report in October 2015. The report found systematic human rights violations, including killings, torture, and rape by government security forces targeting Nuer soldiers and civilians in Juba. Atrocities by both sides, hate speech, incitement to violence, and gang rape were also documented. The AUCISS report highlighted widespread violence, including gang rape, in Unity and Upper Nile states in mid-2015. The U.N. Secretary-General condemned government forces for human rights violations, such as burning villages and killing civilians. The government offensive in southern Unity displaced hundreds of thousands. The government offensive in South Sudan's Unity State displaced hundreds of thousands in Nuer areas, leading to suspension of relief operations. U.N. officials were denied access by the army, with the offensive aimed at rendering communal life unviable and clearing the population to deprive the opposition of support. Press and political freedoms have deteriorated, with security officials accused of harassing and intimidating the press. Security officials in South Sudan have been accused of harassing and intimidating the press since independence. Government interference in media has increased, with reports of influencing content, seizing print runs, and shutting down outlets. Political space has tightened in Juba, with violent suppression of protests, detention of opposition leaders, and widespread fear leading to self-censorship. Political opponents, journalists, and human rights workers have faced torture, beatings, and harassment by government forces. The military exercises significant control over political affairs and public life. The military in South Sudan, specifically the SPLA, wields significant influence over political affairs and public life. Government appointments are often given to SPLM loyalists or potential rivals without consideration for merit, leading to corruption and misuse of public funds. The civil conflict has created a war economy benefiting military elites while formal economic activity has stalled. The U.N. Human Rights Council established a Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan in 2016 to address alleged abuses and the shrinking democratic space. The international community is actively involved in diplomatic, humanitarian, and peacekeeping efforts to protect civilians and end the conflict, with regional mediation led by IGAD. The region, under IGAD's leadership, mediates between warring parties with support from the AU, U.N. Security Council, and international partners. The U.N. Security Council backs the region's efforts for a political solution, including sanctions and additional peacekeepers. The U.S. is the largest humanitarian donor, providing $1.9 billion in emergency relief. The humanitarian response in South Sudan faces funding shortfalls, access challenges, bureaucratic restrictions, threats against aid agency personnel, and rising criminality in Juba. Government delays in Flight Safety Assurances for U.N. humanitarian flights to non-government-aligned areas are a significant problem. South Sudan has the highest reported number of major attacks on humanitarians, with over 60 relief workers killed since the conflict began. Violence against aid workers may be intended to deter assistance. The U.N. Secretary-General expressed concern about violence and restrictions on aid workers in South Sudan, suggesting a deliberate environment of impunity and intimidation. Threats against humanitarian personnel are increasing, with government officials intensifying hostility towards international bodies. Donors and NGOs are worried about a new NGO law imposing restrictions. NGOs are concerned about a new NGO law in South Sudan that imposes regulations, including restrictions on international staff percentages. Civil society groups have been ordered to shut down for engaging in \"political\" work, leading to harassment and threats. Journalists, civil society, and humanitarians may self-censor reporting due to growing threats and government restrictions. The U.N. Security Council emphasizes the importance of the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan for peace and reconciliation. The United States leads efforts to deploy additional U.N. peacekeepers to Juba, with 4,000 troops authorized in Resolution 2304 to form a Regional Protection Force. The South Sudan government initially opposed the proposed expansion of the UN peacekeeping mission, viewing the Regional Protection Force (RPF) as a threat to its sovereignty. After protests and attacks on UNMISS staff, the government reluctantly granted consent but seeks to condition its acceptance on approval of the RPF's composition and armament. They object to the participation of neighboring countries in the force. Some experts question the effectiveness of the proposed Regional Protection Force (RPF) in South Sudan without a clear political strategy to address the root causes of the conflict. Criticism of UNMISS for failing to protect civilians in previous incidents raises doubts about the RPF's prospects. The Security Council's response to threats against the region is also under scrutiny. Some analysts criticize the Security Council for not adequately responding to threats against UNMISS and its operations. Concerns have been raised that the RPF's involvement in local conflicts could lead to perceptions of bias. The U.N. Secretary-General appointed a team to investigate attacks on civilians near U.N. bases in Juba, including the Terrain incident. Mixed messages from the international community on the peace agreement and the legitimacy of the TGNU are causing confusion. The status of the peace agreement and the legitimacy of the TGNU are in question due to Kiir's replacement of opposition members. The U.N. Panel of Experts believes the TGNU has collapsed, while Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the government is committed to implementing the peace deal despite the changes. Kerry's remarks have been seen as approval of Deng's appointment as First Vice President. The legitimacy of the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU) is in question due to Kiir's replacement of opposition members. U.S. Special Envoy Donald Booth stated that it is not for the U.S. to dictate South Sudan's leaders. The Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission (JMEC) has not determined Deng's legitimacy, raising concerns about Machar's replacement violating the peace deal. IGAD is divided on Deng's appointment, with some welcoming his pledge to step down upon Machar's return. Deng is representing the government at the U.N. Session. President Kiir's replacement of Machar and other SPLM-IO officials is a key question in international engagement with the South Sudan government. Without support from opposition commanders or key political leaders, First Vice President Taban Deng may struggle to represent the opposition credibly. Anti-government sentiment has grown since the fighting in Juba in July, with reports of government forces targeting Nuer civilians. Recent statements by government officials suggest that SPLM-iO forces must be integrated into the army or \"eliminated,\" which could worsen the situation. Donors may question investing in the government's recovery efforts due to ongoing conflict and rumors of upcoming offensives. Without donor engagement, South Sudan's crisis may deteriorate further, as warned by the International Monetary Fund. The government's ability to pay salaries for its army and provide financial incentives for allied militia or defections from the opposition are key priorities. The U.N. Security Council set the framework for targeted sanctions in South Sudan in March 2015. The U.N. Security Council established targeted sanctions in South Sudan in March 2015 with Resolution 2206 (2015). The Sanctions Committee approved sanctions for six individuals in July 2015, but Russia and Angola blocked designations for two more individuals in September 2015. The U.N. Panel of Experts is investigating the chain of command for operations targeting civilians in South Sudan. President Kiir and senior military individuals are accused of waging an aggressive war. Malong is identified as overseeing operations in Wau and directing fighting in Juba. The Security Council threatened an arms embargo in Resolution 2304, but its prospects are unclear amidst negotiations for the RPF's deployment. In response to government restrictions on U.N. movements in South Sudan, U.S. Representative Samantha Power warned of a potential U.N. arms embargo if progress was not made by the end of the month. The U.N. Panel of Experts has recommended an arms embargo due to the supply of arms prolonging the conflict. The supply of arms and ammunition to warring sides in South Sudan has prolonged and escalated the conflict, leading to violations of international humanitarian law. The Panel of Experts recommended an arms embargo, citing the acquisition of air and riverine capacity by the SPLA and significant financial implications for the country's budget. The influx of weapons contributes to instability and the continuation of the conflict, with escalating threats to UNMISS and U.N. agencies. The Panel of Experts recommended an arms embargo in South Sudan to deter the acquisition of weapons by warring sides, which has escalated the conflict and posed threats to UNMISS and U.N. agencies. The European Union and the United Kingdom support this measure, along with other Council members and the U.N. Secretary-General. The Panel of Experts recommended an arms embargo in South Sudan to deter the acquisition of weapons by warring sides, which has escalated the conflict. East African officials have threatened punitive measures against the warring parties, with some suggesting that sanctions by South Sudan's neighbors could be effective. Uganda's intervention in the conflict, seen as aligned with President Kiir, has been controversial and viewed as hindering regional mediation efforts. Recent reporting by the U.N. Panel of Experts suggests that Uganda continues to facilitate the transfer of defense equipment to the government in Juba. The Panel named Uganda as reportedly facilitating the transfer of ammunition and possibly fighter jets into South Sudan for the government. The United States is the country's largest bilateral foreign aid donor and plays a key role in U.N. Security Council deliberations on South Sudan. Obama Administration officials have made repeated public reference to Uganda's influence in pushing President Kiir to sign the 2015 peace accord. The Obama Administration has expressed a sense of responsibility for South Sudan and has imposed targeted sanctions on military leaders involved in fueling the conflict. Congressional engagement has been driven by human rights concerns, with some Members of Congress engaging directly with South Sudanese leaders. The bilateral relationship has been strained due to the conflict and allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. Multiple congressional hearings have been held on South Sudan since the crisis began. The Obama Administration has imposed targeted sanctions on military leaders in South Sudan. Some Members of Congress have called for an immediate arms embargo. U.S. officials have criticized South Sudan's leaders for neglecting their responsibility to protect citizens and failing to make compromises. National Security Advisor Susan Rice has been particularly critical. In July 2015, National Security Advisor Susan Rice criticized President Kiir and Riek Machar for committing crimes against civilians in South Sudan. The government has failed to protect its citizens and the Obama Administration supports sanctions on those undermining the peace process. The Enough Project calls for international action to stop corruption and impose sanctions on responsible leaders. The Enough Project's Sentry initiative released a report in September 2016 documenting corruption by South Sudanese leaders, including President Kiir. The United States has invested over $11 billion in South Sudan since 2005, with unprecedented support in sub-Saharan Africa. President Kiir's spokesman rejected the report as \"rubbish\" and threatened to sue the Enough Project. The United States has provided significant foreign aid to South Sudan, totaling almost $1.9 billion in humanitarian aid since 2013. In FY2016, non-emergency aid to South Sudan was over $160 million, with a request for $225 million in FY2017 for essential services, conflict mitigation, stability, and reforms. The U.S. is a major contributor to UNMISS and ceasefire monitoring efforts in the region. The U.S. provides significant funding to South Sudan, with almost $400 million allocated for UNMISS in FY2016. Security assistance is suspended, but a waiver allows for support in disarmament and defense sector reform. Special Envoy Donald Booth suggests a more inclusive political process and proposes an \"all-parties conference\" for peace agreement reconstruction. The U.S. embassy in Juba, led by Ambassador Mary Catherine (Molly) Phee, is currently operating with limited staff under an \"ordered departure\" of non-emergency personnel. On July 12, the U.S. military deployed 47 personnel to Juba to protect U.S. citizens and property, with additional personnel pre-positioned in Uganda for possible evacuation. Three U.S. military aircraft were hit with heavy machine gun fire while evacuating U.S. citizens from Bor, highlighting the risks of evacuation efforts in South Sudan. The embassy in Juba has undergone a second ordered departure since the conflict began, with additional military personnel deployed in December 2013. The State Department advises against travel to the country due to security concerns. South Sudan faces significant development and humanitarian challenges, with high rates of population growth and maternal mortality, low literacy rates, limited infrastructure, and heavy dependence on oil for income. South Sudan, heavily reliant on oil income, faces a forecasted decline in production by 2035. The government is burdened with debt from military spending, worsened by low global oil prices. Inflation, food costs, and currency shortages contribute to severe food insecurity. Despite a peace agreement in 2015, ongoing violence leads to displacement and volatile security conditions. Humanitarian needs are escalating in 2016 amid worsening access constraints. Relations between the government and UNMISS are strained. The conflict in South Sudan, which started with a political dispute, cannot be resolved by reconciling rival political leaders. The manipulation of ethnic grievances and atrocities against civilians will have long-term effects on social cohesion. Surveys show high levels of PTSD and trauma exposure. Despite a commitment to peace agreements, there is little evidence of progress from the government. The government of President Salva Kiir is not willing to share power with the opposition despite the peace agreement. The crackdown on civil society raises concerns about governance under the transitional arrangements. President Kiir's decree to reconstitute administrative divisions has caused opposition and IGAD opposition. The division of states is seen as a driver of conflict, especially in the Equatoria region, leading to fears of further fragmentation. The AU Commission of Inquiry and U.N. reports highlight war crimes and crimes against humanity in South Sudan, with little accountability for perpetrators. The lack of formal judicial proceedings deepens political and ethnic divides, warning that failure to address human rights violations will lead to re-occurrence. The 2015 peace deal in South Sudan included the creation of a hybrid court by the African Union to address abuses committed during the conflict. The court, independent from the national judiciary, would hold government officials accountable for crimes against civilians based on ethnicity or political affiliation. Senior leaders indicted or convicted by the court would be barred from participating in the transitional government. The court was supposed to be operational by November 2016. The African Union planned to establish a hybrid court in South Sudan by November 2016 to address human rights violations and hold government officials accountable. However, the court has not been operational yet, and the lack of progress in implementing the 2015 peace agreement is attributed to flaws in the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The international community's focus on ending violence between north and south Sudan neglected democracy and structural transformation, leading to criticism for failing to address accountability and reconciliation. Despite efforts to promote healing and combat impunity in South Sudan, little measurable progress has been made. Challenges for international engagement in the country are numerous, with uncertainty surrounding peace talks after fighting in Juba. The government in Juba is resistant to expanded foreign intervention, potentially endangering peacekeepers and aid workers. South Sudan is at risk of becoming a failed state, with some experts suggesting it never fully transitioned to a stable state after independence. Former U.S. Special Envoy Princeton Lyman has proposed putting South Sudan \"on the brink of collapse.\" U.S. Special Envoy Princeton Lyman suggests putting South Sudan \"on life support\" with an executive mandate for the U.N. and AU to administer the country until it has functional institutions. This proposal is met with uncertainty among African leaders, with concerns about post-colonial precedents. The lack of political inclusion, government accountability, and corruption are seen as root causes of the conflict. The Kiir government is sensitive to threats to its sovereignty, making major political restructuring challenging. President Kiir's government in Juba faces challenges due to perceived threats to its sovereignty, hindering major political restructuring. International observers question the legitimacy of his rule, but regional peers have not challenged his authority. Foreign donors are cautious about criticizing Kiir's practices to avoid jeopardizing aid delivery during a humanitarian crisis. Global powers like Russia oppose diplomatic isolation tactics, such as sanctions, against problematic regimes like South Sudan. Without robust international leadership or consensus on addressing South Sudan's crisis, the situation may worsen due to the country's structural problems and legacies of conflict. This presents ongoing policy challenges for U.S. officials in the executive branch and Congress."
