    "content": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a cross-border capital flow where a resident of one country gains a lasting interest and influence in a business enterprise in another country. The U.S. defines direct investment as owning at least 10% of a business. In 2013, global FDI stock exceeded $25 trillion, with the U.S. holding the largest share at $4.9 trillion. FDI inflows rose by 9% to nearly $1.5 trillion in 2013, but were still below pre-2008 levels. Global FDI inflows reached $1.26 trillion in 2014, with emerging market economies playing an increasing role. \"South-South\" investment flows are growing, and the U.S. position as the leading recipient of direct investment has been overtaken in some years. In 2014, U.S. dropped to third largest recipient of inward direct investment after China and Hong Kong. U.S. direct investment abroad totaled $4.7 trillion in 2013, with Europe and Latin America as top recipients. Meanwhile, direct investment in the U.S. totaled $2.8 trillion, with Europe and Asia-Pacific as top sources of inward FDI. U.S. firms invest abroad to serve foreign markets. Investment abroad serves foreign local markets, replaces U.S. exports, gains access to resources and markets. Foreign companies invest in the U.S. for skills, resources, and consumer market access. In 2011, foreign firms in the U.S. employed 6.3 million workers, exported $343 billion, and imported $677 billion. Globalization has led to diverse international supply chains. The pace of globalization has created international supply chains where goods move across borders, with U.S. parent companies exporting $738 billion in 2012, accounting for 47% of total U.S. exports. U.S. parent companies also accounted for 41% of U.S. imports, totaling $949 billion. Intra-firm trade between parent companies and their affiliates is significant. Intra-firm trade between U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates accounts for a significant portion of U.S. exports and imports. U.S. IIAs, such as bilateral investment treaties and investment chapters in free trade agreements, establish binding rules on investment protections. Investment chapters in U.S. FTAs are similar to provisions in U.S. BITs but are more comprehensive, covering a wide range of trade issues. Barriers faced by investors in foreign countries include discriminatory restrictions on foreign equity participation, establishment forms, local content requirements, technology transfer requirements, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings. Companies may also encounter barriers like economic and political instability in foreign markets. The United States' investment policy aims to support an open investment climate while addressing national security concerns. This includes pursuing reciprocal investment agreements with foreign countries to facilitate investment flows and enhance investor protections. Additionally, the U.S. conducts activities to facilitate investment abroad. The United States facilitates U.S. investment abroad through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees national security implications of foreign investment. President Obama reaffirmed the U.S.' \"open investment policy\" in 2011. The United States maintains an \"open investment policy\" to treat all investors fairly under the law. The Department of Commerce's SelectUSA program coordinates federal efforts to attract and retain investment in the country. Congress plays a role in setting trade policy objectives, ratifying BITs, and passing legislation for free trade agreements with investment chapters. The U.S. is currently negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) which include investment provisions. The U.S. maintains an open investment policy and engages in BIT negotiations with various countries. Congress sets investment negotiating objectives through Trade Promotion Authority. Legislation has been introduced to reauthorize investment provisions. The recently introduced legislation reauthorizing TPA includes investment negotiating objectives and provisions affecting investment. It advocates for a future multilateral appellate mechanism to review awards from investment arbitration tribunals. WTO agreements address investment issues, such as TRIMS Agreement disciplines on restrictive investment measures inconsistent with national treatment obligations. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and other international agreements indirectly address investment through provisions related to trade in services. Efforts have been made through international organizations to develop investment rules, but investment flows are mainly governed by bilateral and regional agreements. Around 3,200 international investment agreements have been concluded worldwide. Around 3,200 international investment agreements have been concluded worldwide, with approximately 2,500 currently in force. The first modern Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) was between West Germany and Pakistan in 1959. European countries began negotiating BITs in the mid-1960s to protect global investments and facilitate new ones in former colonies. Asian nations signed BITs in the 1970s, with Japan signing its first in 1977 with Egypt. The United States initiated its BIT program in 1977, followed by Central and Eastern European countries in the late 1980s and 1990s, and Latin American countries in the 1990s. In the 1990s, BITs grew rapidly as developing countries embraced reforms to attract foreign investment. The United States has BITs with 40 countries and 14 FTAs with 20 countries, known for their comprehensive standards. The U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Trade Representative lead the U.S. BIT program with a focus on developing countries. The U.S. has FTAs with six top trading partners and is currently negotiating the TPP and T-TIP mega-regional FTAs. The United States is involved in BIT negotiations with China, India, Mauritius, and Pakistan, as well as discussions with the East African Community. The USTR and State Department negotiate investment agreements based on a Model BIT text revised in 2012. The United States revised its Model BIT in 2004 and 2012 to address concerns about broad protections for foreign investors under NAFTA. Changes were made to give BIT parties more control over the arbitral process and limit access to ISDS. Post-NAFTA U.S. investment provisions in BITs and FTAs incorporated these changes. The 2002 Trade Promotion Authority emphasized equal rights for foreign and U.S. investors in trade agreements. Subsequent revisions in 2004 and 2012 provided more detailed guidance on investment treaty chapters, including procedural matters and transparency in arbitral proceedings. Questions remain about further revisions, such as the development of an appellate mechanism. The 2012 Model BIT expanded the definition of investment to include intangible assets like intellectual property rights. It defines investment as every asset owned or controlled by an investor with characteristics like capital commitment, profit expectation, or risk assumption. This includes forms like enterprises, equity participation, debt instruments, and futures. The 2012 Model BIT broadened the definition of investment to include intangible assets such as intellectual property rights. It covers various forms of investments, including enterprises, equity participation, debt instruments, and futures. U.S. IIAs are reciprocal agreements that provide non-discriminatory treatment and a minimum standard of treatment for investments. The 2012 Model BIT expanded investment definitions to include intangible assets like intellectual property rights. It ensures fair and equitable treatment, compensation for expropriation, timely fund transfers, limits on performance requirements, and Investor-State Dispute Settlement rights. The 2015 bicameral TPA reauthorization legislation introduced in the 114th Congress includes provisions for environmental, labor, transparency, and anti-bribery requirements, as well as exceptions for national security and prudential interests. The 2012 Model BIT and other U.S. IIAs prohibit expropriation of covered investments except for public purposes, non-discriminatory manner, prompt compensation, and due process of law. The 2012 Model BIT addresses concerns about indirect expropriation by outlining factors for tribunals to consider, similar to the U.S. Supreme Court's Penn Central decision on regulatory takings. The 2012 Model BIT outlines factors for tribunals to consider regarding indirect expropriation, stating that non-discriminatory regulatory measures generally do not result in indirect expropriation. US IIAs emphasize that regulatory actions for public welfare objectives do not constitute indirect expropriations. US IIAs do not grant foreign investors greater substantive rights than U.S. investors. The availability of ISDS may provide foreign investors with additional procedural rights. Under a U.S. investment agreement, a U.S. business investing in a foreign country would have recourse to ISDS to resolve disputes with the host country's government. ISDS provisions enable an investor to bring a claim for breach of an investment agreement before an international arbitration panel. Its use is actively debated in international negotiations like the TPP and T-TIP. ISDS provides a peaceful and effective mechanism for resolving disputes between investors and host countries, historically addressing unlawful behavior targeting foreign investors. It allows investors to seek redress through international arbitration panels, as debated in international negotiations like the TPP and T-TIP. The inclusion of ISDS in U.S. investment treaties aims to provide a stable dispute settlement mechanism for investors. ISDS has roots dating back to the 1900s, with arbitration institutions in London, Stockholm, and Paris. It became a standard element in international investment agreements by the 1990s. Investors can choose the forum and procedural rules for arbitration under a U.S. IIA. Most disputes are resolved under the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Investment disputes are settled under the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, which established the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). ICSID provides arbitral services and rules for investment disputes to its 147 members. The ICSID Additional Facility was created in 1978 for disputes involving non-members. An alternative to ICSID is international arbitration under UNCITRAL rules. The UNCITRAL rules for international arbitration do not provide an institution to administer the process, with all aspects of dispute resolution being developed ad hoc. Other arbitration rules are provided by organizations such as the International Chamber of Commerce, the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The selection and disqualification of arbitrators may vary depending on the specific arbitration rules being used, such as ICSID or UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, NAFTA, or agreements based on the U.S. Model BIT. Both NAFTA and U.S. FTAs based on the Model BIT require a tribunal of three arbitrators unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The tribunal in international arbitration is composed of three arbitrators: one appointed by the claimant, one by the respondent state, and a presiding arbitrator agreed upon by both parties. If there is a disagreement in appointing an arbitrator, the Secretary General of ICSID steps in. Arbitrators must have high moral character and recognized competence in law, commerce, industry, or finance under the ICSID Convention. Disqualification procedures for arbitrators vary depending on the arbitration rules in place. Arbitrators may be challenged for lack of independent judgment or impartiality under various arbitration rules. They must disclose any relationships with disputing parties to avoid disqualification. For instance, in Blue Bank v. Venezuela, an arbitrator was disqualified due to a conflict of interest with the claimant's law firm. Arbitrators can be disqualified for various reasons, including prior relationships with disputing parties or biases against the law in dispute. In a case involving a challenge during a NAFTA arbitration, an arbitrator was removed for giving a speech that raised concerns about impartiality. Arbitrator challenged for bias in a speech on U.S. law. ICSID upheld challenge, arbitrator resigned. U.S. IIAs require dispute resolution attempts before arbitration initiation. Cooling down period allows time for resolution. Investors under U.S. IIAs must provide 90-days' notice before arbitration, consent to IIA rules, and waive rights to pursue claims domestically. Claims have a three-year limitation period from the date of breach. Investors under U.S. IIAs must provide 90-days' notice before arbitration, consent to IIA rules, and waive rights to pursue claims domestically. Claims have a three-year limitation period from the date of breach. In ISDS, parties have discretion in choosing arbitration facilities and procedural rules. Investor eligibility under investment agreements includes the requirement of substantial business activities in the host country to qualify for benefits. The KORUS FTA allows denial of benefits if the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory or if persons of a non-Party own or control the enterprise. The threshold for \"substantial business activities\" is not defined in Chapter 11 of the KORUS FTA. In the TPP, the United States is seeking a \"denial of benefits\" provision to prevent \"the use of shell companies\" in ISDS. NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT do not require exhaustion of local remedies for ISDS claims. This may be due to concerns about inadequate judicial systems or corruption in partner countries. Under NAFTA, investors must exhaust judicial remedies before claiming a violation of the minimum standard of treatment obligation based on \"denial of justice.\" Under NAFTA and the 2012 Model BIT, investors are not required to exhaust local remedies before pursuing ISDS claims. This is seen as an element of a \"denial of justice\" claim rather than a jurisdictional prerequisite. \"Forum shopping\" involves investors seeking compensation in local courts or ISDS tribunals and switching forums if unsatisfied with the outcome. U.S. IIAs prohibit investors from seeking local remedies after agreeing to arbitration. The ISDS provisions in U.S. IIAs limit the remedies that an arbitration tribunal may award, including only monetary damages and/or restitution of property. Punitive damages are not allowed, and the respondent state can choose to pay monetary damages instead of restitution. Investors can seek local remedies for monetary compensation before bringing a dispute to an international investment arbitration tribunal. Model BIT prohibits punitive damages in arbitration panels. The Constitution dictates how federal statutes can be amended, requiring Congress to follow Article I processes. ISDS provisions in BITs and FTAs cannot override federal law. While the US has not lost an IIA claim, if it were to happen, the tribunal cannot change US laws. However, substantial arbitration awards can still be issued, as seen in Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Ecuador. The tribunal in Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Ecuador ordered Ecuador to pay over $1.7 billion in damages for violating an investment agreement by expropriating Occidental's property. Some believe such large monetary damages could influence lawmakers and regulators, but others argue that the federal government faces potential damages under its own legal system. The level of transparency in ISDS proceedings depends on the underlying IIA and rules agreed upon by parties. U.S. IIAs are known for providing a high level of transparency, with access to documents subject to redaction of confidential information. Transparency provisions are a U.S. trade negotiating objective and are included in the 2012 Model BIT and other U.S. IIAs. The ICSID Arbitration Rules have less robust transparency provisions compared to recent U.S. IIAs. ICSID awards are only made public with consent, and if not, only excerpts of the legal reasoning are published. UNCITRAL amended its Arbitration Rules in 2013 to include Rules on Transparency. UNCITRAL amended its Arbitration Rules in 2013 to include Rules on Transparency for treaty-based investor-state arbitration. The Rules apply to arbitrations under treaties governed by UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules entered into after April 1, 2014, unless agreed otherwise by the Parties. States can sign the Mauritius Convention on Transparency to apply the Rules to IIAs entered into before April 1, 2014, if both parties have signed the Convention. The United States has supported ISDS transparency reforms and signed the Mauritius Convention on Transparency in 2015. U.S. IIAs are considered some of the most transparent agreements, allowing for monitoring of ISDS proceedings by respondent governments and the public. The United States supports transparency in ISDS proceedings, with key documents and tribunal decisions publicly available. Stakeholders have concerns about transparency levels in ISDS cases, but the U.S. aims for \"full transparency\" in the TPP, allowing public access to pleadings, briefs, transcripts, decisions, and awards. Interested parties, similar to amicus briefs in the U.S. Supreme Court, may present their views to ISDS arbitration tribunals. The rules for third-party submissions in arbitration vary depending on the governing rules. NAFTA allows parties to make submissions on interpretation, while the Model BIT permits non-disputing states to provide oral and written submissions. The U.S. Model BIT allows the tribunal to consider amicus curiae submissions. The KORUS FTA gives more discretion to the tribunal. The KORUS FTA provides more discretion to the tribunal regarding amicus curiae submissions, allowing non-disputing parties to file written submissions. Factors considered include the submission's assistance in determining factual or legal issues, relevance to the dispute, and the third party's significant interest in the proceeding. The tribunal must ensure the submission does not disrupt the proceeding. The ICSID Arbitration Rules allow for amicus curiae submissions, with the tribunal having discretion to permit them after consulting with the disputing parties. The parties do not have veto power over third-party submissions, and permission does not grant access to closed hearings or documents. The UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency, similar to the ICSID rules, allow third-party submissions but require them to be made public. Third parties must apply to the tribunal, which consults with disputing parties before considering the submission's relevance to the dispute. Investment arbitration tribunals in ISDS cases do not set legally binding precedent like U.S. federal courts do with the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. Tribunals may explain their reasoning if they depart from previous decisions, but some argue that cases should be evaluated on their own merits without being tied to precedent. U.S. IIAs currently lack a mechanism for this. Currently, U.S. IIAs lack a mechanism for appealing decisions of investment arbitration tribunals. Suggestions have been made to establish an international appellate system for ISDS arbitral decisions to bring coherence to inconsistent tribunal decisions and provide greater certainty for investors and host countries. However, concrete progress towards establishing such a body has not been made. Some observers have raised concerns about the potential delays and costs of including an appeals process in establishing a global appellate body for investment disputes. Questions have also been raised about the ability of such a body to reconcile inconsistent decisions from various investment treaties. The 2012 U.S. Model BIT mentions the possibility of an appellate mechanism in the future, emphasizing transparency in any agreed-upon process. The creation of an appellate mechanism was first mentioned in the context of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). The 2015 TPA bill includes the creation of an appellate mechanism for investment disputes. Some U.S. IIAs allow for state-to-state dispute settlement in cases of non-compliance with awards or disagreements over interpretation. For example, the 2012 Model BIT allows non-disputing state parties to bring cases against non-compliant states. Settlement proceedings in ISDS cases can be used when state parties disagree over IIA provisions. The United States has not paid compensation to investors in ISDS cases but has incurred significant costs defending them. Settlement agreements have been reached with investors' home countries in some cases. ISDS is a common feature in international investment agreements. The inclusion of ISDS provisions in international investment agreements has been common since 1968. The number of investment disputes has increased since the mid-1990s, coinciding with the growth of FDI. In 2014, there were 42 known ISDS cases globally, totaling 608 cases since the early 1960s. Despite the prominence of ISDS, about 90% of BITs reportedly operate without any claims filed. Investors from capital-exporting countries most frequently file ISDS claims. In 2014, the main users of ISDS were investors from the United States, several European countries, and Canada, collectively representing over 80% of all claims filed. Developing and transition countries were the most frequent respondents in ISDS claims, with Spain being the most frequent respondent in 2014. Disputes under ISDS have shifted from direct expropriation to foreign investment regulation and indirect expropriation. In 2014, ISDS cases mainly involved disputes related to cancellations or violations of contracts, revocations or denial of licenses, with the services sector accounting for 61% of cases. The primary industries and manufacturing sectors were also frequently involved. The primary sectors in ISDS cases during 2003-2013 were oil, mining, and electricity generation. Overall, in 2014, there were 356 concluded ISDS cases, with 37% decided in favor of the host country, 25% in favor of the investor, and 28% settled. In 2014, ISDS cases mainly involved disputes related to cancellations or violations of contracts, revocations or denial of licenses, with the services sector accounting for 61% of cases. The primary industries and manufacturing sectors were also frequently involved. Internationally, the amounts sought in claims by investors historically have varied from about $8 million to $2.5 billion. One record high dispute involved an aggregate amount of $1.77 billion sought by three claimants against Russia, resulting in an award of $50 billion. The United States has faced \"17 ISDS cases, 13 of which were brought to conclusion\" under 50 agreements including ISDS. The United States has faced \"17 ISDS cases, 13 of which were concluded,\" mostly under NAFTA. Additional cases were filed under other agreements, but none were decided against the United States. Some cases, like those involving pharmaceutical industry and intellectual property rights, have influenced U.S. investment negotiations and trade policy debates. Some businesses seek compensation for alleged deprivation of their property through fair hearings in neutral bodies, while others argue that such cases infringe on a state's right to regulate public welfare. Observers caution against drawing conclusions from specific ISDS cases, as tribunals have not yet issued awards on jurisdiction or merits."
