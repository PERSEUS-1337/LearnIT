    "content": "Instability in Central America, specifically in the \"Northern Triangle\" nations of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, poses a significant challenge for U.S. policy. These countries face issues such as insecurity, weak political and judicial systems, poverty, and high unemployment rates. The Northern Triangle governments' inability to effectively address these challenges has led to consequences for the United States, including the region being used by transnational criminal organizations for drug trafficking. Additionally, the area serves as a source of mixed migration flows of asylum seekers and economic migrants to the United States. In FY2017, nearly 163,000 unauthorized migrants from the Northern Triangle were apprehended at the southwest border, with about 63% of them being from this region. The Obama Administration launched a new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to address the mixed migration flows of migrants from the Northern Triangle seeking humanitarian protection. Congress has appropriated $2.1 billion in aid for the region since FY2016. The Trump Administration has adjusted the Central America strategy, focusing on preventing illegal immigration, combating transnational crime, and promoting export opportunities for U.S. businesses. There have been threats to cut off U.S. assistance to the region, but Congress has not approved most proposed cuts. Funding priorities will depend on legislation from the 116th Congress. The report examines the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America during the 116th Congress, including objectives, funding, and relationship to the Alliance for Prosperity plan. It also analyzes preliminary results, funding levels, domestic challenges, conditions on assistance, and potential impacts of changes in U.S. policies on the region. Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, faces economic, governance, and security challenges. Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, faces economic, governance, and security challenges. The United States historically maintains close ties to the region and provides assistance to counter perceived threats, such as illicit narcotics and irregular migration. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to improve living conditions in the region. Under President George W. Bush, policies focused on economic growth through trade agreements and aid packages. Towards the end of his administration, there was a shift to address rising crime and violence in Central America. The George W. Bush Administration initiated the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 to address violence in Mexico and Central America. The aid package, rebranded as CARSI in FY2010 by the Obama Administration, provided nearly $1.2 billion between FY2008 and FY2015 for equipment, training, and technical assistance to combat narcotics trafficking and strengthen law enforcement in the region. Despite localized gains, U.S. initiatives were deemed insufficient by the beginning of President Obama's second term. The Obama Administration's initiatives in Central America did not lead to sustained improvements, prompting the development of a new strategy in 2014. The updated strategy, released in 2017, maintains the same objectives. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims for a more comprehensive approach than previous initiatives. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims for an economically integrated region that is democratic, provides economic opportunities, and ensures a safe environment for its citizens. The strategy emphasizes the importance of prosperity, security, and governance as mutually reinforcing objectives, with a focus on interagency coordination. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on promoting prosperity, strengthening governance, and improving security in the region through coordinated efforts with U.S. agencies and other donors. The strategy aims to address the economic challenges faced by Central American countries and support complementary reforms. Central America has a history of extreme inequality due to land ownership and economic power being concentrated in the hands of a small elite group. Market-oriented economic policies in the 1980s and 1990s did not improve living conditions for many residents. The region is currently experiencing a demographic transition with a growing working-age population, but struggles to create enough jobs for them. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to address the region's economic challenges by promoting prosperity and regional integration. Actions include facilitating increased trade, strengthening regional organizations, improving customs and border management, and connecting electric grids to reduce high electricity costs. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on addressing economic challenges by reducing high electricity costs through strengthening the power market, enhancing sustainable energy financing, and promoting investment in energy infrastructure. Additionally, efforts are made to develop uniform procurement processes, transmission rights, and regulations to facilitate investment in renewable power generation projects. Other activities aim to reduce poverty by supporting food security programs in countries like Honduras. The program aims to diversify crops, increase household incomes, and improve agricultural productivity in Central America. USAID supports education programs in Nicaragua and partnerships between academia and the private sector in El Salvador. The strategy also focuses on building resiliency to external shocks. The Central America strategy aims to build resiliency to external shocks like drought and coffee fungus outbreaks. USAID is working in Guatemala to reduce vulnerability to climate change by increasing access to climate information, strengthening government capacity, and promoting resilient agricultural practices. The region has struggled with establishing strong democratic institutions due to a history of conflict and authoritarian rule. Costa Rica and Belize were exceptions, establishing civilian democratic regimes in the 1980s and 1990s after years of repression and civil conflicts. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to strengthen governance by professionalizing civil services, depoliticizing government institutions, and ensuring continuity across administrations. Central American governments face challenges with weak institutions, corruption, and declining support for democracy. USAID is supporting civil society efforts in El Salvador to address these issues. In El Salvador, USAID supports civil society for civil service reforms and merit-based systems. The strategy aims to improve Central American governments' revenue-raising capacities and responsible resource management. The Department of the Treasury assists Guatemala's Ministry of Finance in enhancing treasury operations and developing an investment policy for efficient and transparent use of financial resources. USAID trains Guatemalan civil society on transparency laws to hold the government accountable. Activities also focus on upholding democratic values and human rights in the region. The USAID and State Department support human rights and democracy in Central America. They provide assistance to independent media, civil society organizations, and human rights defenders facing threats. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on improving governance through justice sector reforms to decrease impunity. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs offers training and technical assistance to justice sector actors. INL provides technical assistance to justice sector actors in Central America, including prosecutors and judges, focusing on case management and forensic capabilities. They also fund operations of organizations like CICIG and MACCIH to support the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases in Guatemala and Honduras. Central America faces high levels of violence and crime, with Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras having some of the highest homicide rates in the world. Common crime is widespread in Central America due to factors like poverty, fragmented families, and lack of job opportunities, making youth vulnerable to gang recruitment. The region is a key drug-trafficking corridor between South America and the United States, leading to conflicts between criminal organizations. Security forces lack resources and training to combat these threats, resulting in high levels of crime. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to improve security in the region by professionalizing civilian police forces and implementing activities to vet police officers, enhance training, and engage with civil society. Additionally, U.S. assistance funds regional efforts for intelligence-led policing and crime prevention. The USAID and INL have adopted a \"place-based\" approach to integrate prevention and law enforcement interventions in violent Central American communities. USAID programs focus on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts, while INL programs aim to reduce gang affiliation, increase job prospects for inmates, and develop community-based police precincts. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America aims to transition Central American militaries out of internal law enforcement roles, strengthen regional defense cooperation, and enhance respect for human rights. U.S. support includes training on intelligence, defense acquisition, and search and rescue planning, as well as efforts to reduce the influence of organized crime and gangs. The U.S. government is assisting Panama's national border service with tactical mobility vehicles and aircraft to protect its borders. U.S. aid under the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America totals $2.1 billion, with the majority allocated to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Congress has imposed strict conditions on aid to these countries. The Trump Administration requested $436 million for aid to the Northern Triangle countries in FY2019, with delays in the budget process causing slow arrival of assistance. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees proposed $515.5 million for Central America in their respective FY2019 appropriations measures. The Senate committee bill (S. 3108) proposed $515.5 million for the Central America strategy, while the House committee bill (H.R. 6385) proposed $595 million. However, neither bill received floor consideration, and funding for FY2019 will depend on appropriations legislation enacted by the 116th Congress. Higher levels of assistance have allowed the U.S. government to scale up programs focused on prosperity, governance, and security under the Central America strategy. The funding for various accounts, including Development Assistance, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Economic Support Fund, and Foreign Military Financing, was appropriated by Congress for long-term projects in democracy promotion, economic reform, agriculture, education, and environmental protection. Congress has appropriated funds for the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America to the State Department and USAID, with some exceptions for other agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, Treasury, and more. Assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras has strict conditions. Since FY2016, Congress has imposed strict conditions on assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to improve the effectiveness of U.S. aid efforts. For instance, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 required that 25% of the aid to these countries could not be used until certain criteria were met, such as informing citizens about the dangers of illegal migration and cooperating with U.S. agencies on border security. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 imposed strict conditions on aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to address illegal migration. The Act required certifications from the State Department and cooperation with oversight entities to combat corruption and improve transparency in the region. The curr_chunk discusses reforms, policies, and programs aimed at improving transparency and strengthening public institutions in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. This includes increasing the capacity and independence of the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General, consulting with local communities and civil society organizations in the design and implementation of activities, countering criminal activities, investigating and prosecuting government personnel for human rights violations, cooperating with anti-corruption commissions and regional human rights entities, and supporting various initiatives. The curr_chunk discusses supporting programs to reduce poverty, expand education, create jobs, and promote economic growth in areas with high migrant numbers. It also includes implementing a plan for a professional civilian police force, protecting the rights of political opposition parties and civil society activists, increasing government revenues through tax reforms, and resolving commercial disputes with US entities. The State Department issued certifications. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America is often confused with the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The $22 billion initiative aims to create incentives for people to stay in their own countries by stimulating the productive sector and implementing strategic actions. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on promoting economic development through various measures such as creating special economic zones, modernizing infrastructure, and supporting small and medium enterprises. It also aims to improve human capital by enhancing education and healthcare access, as well as strengthening social protection systems. Additionally, the strategy includes initiatives to enhance public safety and access to justice through violence prevention programs and professionalizing the police force. The Northern Triangle governments allocated significant funds for the Alliance for Prosperity in 2016, 2017, and 2018, with a portion coming from loans from international financial institutions. About 39% of the funds have been dedicated to stimulating economic growth and development. About 39% of the funds budgeted for the Alliance for Prosperity have been allocated to stimulating the productive sector, 38% to developing human capital, 17% to improving public security and access to justice, and 7% to strengthening institutions and promoting transparency. Some analysts suggest focusing more on reducing the informal economy and targeting funds to communities in need. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and the Alliance for Prosperity have similar objectives but prioritize different activities, with the Alliance representing the agendas of the Northern Triangle governments. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on strengthening civil society groups and has different priorities than the Alliance for Prosperity, which emphasizes large-scale infrastructure projects. Delays in funding allocation have hindered the full impact assessment of the Central America strategy. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, funded by Congress in FY2016, has been in implementation for over a year. The State Department and USAID have developed 42 performance indicators to track progress, but their recent report to Congress lacked detailed achievements. Activities funded by the strategy build upon successful U.S. assistance efforts, such as USAID's crime prevention programs which have shown significant reductions in robberies, extortion attempts, and murders. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, funded by Congress in FY2016, has shown positive results. USAID's crime prevention programs have led to significant reductions in robberies, extortion attempts, and murders. Security conditions in the Northern Triangle have improved, with decreases in homicide rates in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. USAID's rural development efforts have also been successful, with farmers in Guatemala increasing their sales by 51% from 2015 to 2016. Despite some mixed results, U.S. programs are believed to contribute to nationwide improvements in the long term. The percentage of individuals reporting they were victims of crime increased in all three Northern Triangle nations between 2014 and 2017, despite steady economic growth. Attorneys general in the region have taken on high-profile corruption cases, facing opposition from political and economic elites. Freedom House has documented erosions in political rights and civil liberties in the Northern Triangle nations since 2014. Congress may examine policy issues related to potential changes in the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, including funding levels, Central American governments' political will for reforms, conditions on assistance, and implications of changes in U.S. immigration, trade, and drug control policies. U.S. policymakers are reassessing the strategy, as mandated by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 required a review of the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. The updated strategy emphasizes addressing transnational criminal activity and promoting private sector investment in the region. The Trump Administration has placed less emphasis on good governance, focusing instead on joint efforts to improve prosperity and security in Central America. The Trump Administration, in 2017 and 2018, prioritized prosperity and security in Central America but neglected governance challenges. It supported questionable election results in Honduras and offered little diplomatic backing to anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala. Additionally, there were cuts in foreign aid programs with a shift towards security assistance. The Trump Administration reduced foreign aid to Central America by $240 million in FY2018 and $191 million in FY2019, shifting the balance towards security programs. This approach mirrors past unsuccessful policies noted by former Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson. Over the past five years, the Central America Regional Security Initiative has shown that focusing on improving government services, economic opportunities, and governance is crucial for sustainable security. A comprehensive strategy addressing these concerns is needed to reduce irregular migration and illicit trafficking. Steep cutbacks in assistance could undermine US commitment and worsen conditions in Central America. Members of Congress may seek to maintain elevated appropriations levels for Central America or distribute cuts evenly across economic, governance, and security programs. A multiyear foreign assistance authorization could guide aid levels and priorities to reassure partners in the region of long-term commitment. Analysts believe external support is necessary for Central America, but significant improvements depend on internal reforms by Central American leaders. Studies have shown that aid effectiveness in Central America is influenced by domestic political institutions. Costa Rica's success in improving the well-being of its citizens compared to its neighbors is attributed to the political will of its leaders, who prioritized democracy, education, and health investments. This contrasts with other Central American nations that did not consistently make similar choices. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America assumes that regional governments will demonstrate leadership and contribute to development. Central American governments need international support to address challenges, as past U.S. aid efforts were not always matched by domestic reforms. Recent years have seen varying levels of commitment to internal reform, with the Northern Triangle countries collaborating on the Alliance for Prosperity. El Salvador has started a security plan, while Guatemala has implemented reforms. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have taken steps to improve security and transparency, but tax collection remains stagnant. Elected officials in the Northern Triangle have hindered anti-corruption efforts. Congress could support reform efforts through aid conditions and vocal support. Congress could offer support to individuals and institutions committed to anti-corruption efforts in the Northern Triangle through vocal and financial means, as seen in resolutions and funding allocations. Alternatively, Congress could also highlight individuals in the region who oppose reform efforts. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of State to produce a list of corrupt officials in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras by February 2019. Congress may enact legislation for new economic sanctions to pressure corrupt individuals. President Trump signed the Nicaragua Human Rights and Anticorruption Act in December 2018. The Human Rights and Anticorruption Act of 2018 directs the President to impose sanctions on individuals involved in corruption, undermining democracy, or human rights violations in Nicaragua. Some Members of Congress also called for sanctions on Central American officials under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Aid restrictions for Central America aim to strengthen political will and ensure effective use of U.S. assistance. Some argue that recent appropriations measures have included too many conditions and withheld too much aid, giving the U.S. leverage with partner governments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 required withholding 75% of assistance for the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until certain conditions were met. U.S. officials suggest focusing on key priorities due to limited capacities of the Northern Triangle governments and argue that resources would be better used overseeing implementation of the Central America strategy. Some argue that recent appropriations measures have included too many conditions and withheld too much aid, giving the U.S. leverage with partner governments. Congress could prevent unintended consequences by waiving withholding requirements for aid that directly addresses conditions such as police reform and tax collection agencies. In FY2016, delays in aid delivery to Central America were caused by withholding requirements and certification delays. U.S. agencies hesitated to commit resources until final certification was issued, leading to delays in aid distribution until 2017. In FY2016, aid delivery to Central America was delayed due to withholding requirements and certification delays. Similar delays have occurred with aid appropriated in FY2017 and FY2018. Some argue that the State Department has been too quick to issue certifications, citing an example with Honduras in 2017. Human rights groups and Members of Congress criticized the certification process for aid delivery to Central America, citing concerns about excessive force by security forces and the ineffectiveness of aid conditionality. Suggestions were made for Congress to set specific criteria for Northern Triangle governments to meet before receiving assistance. Central America's close ties to the United States through migration and remittances make changes in U.S. policies impactful in the region. In 2016, over 3.2 million Central Americans were living in the U.S., with remittances exceeding $20 billion in 2017, equivalent to a significant portion of GDP in countries like Nicaragua and Guatemala. In 2017, remittances from Central Americans in the U.S. totaled $20 billion, equivalent to a significant portion of GDP in countries like Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Many Central Americans in the U.S. are unauthorized and at risk of deportation. In FY2018, nearly 96,000 Central Americans were removed by ICE, with the Trump Administration's policies potentially increasing removals. Temporary Protected Status has been terminated for thousands of Nicaraguans and Hondurans living in the U.S. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has been terminated for thousands of Nicaraguans and Hondurans living in the U.S., with potential expiration dates for Salvadorans as well. Central American officials are concerned about increased deportations leading to social tensions and instability in the region. Deportees may bring new skills and resources back to their countries but could also displace local workers. Increased deportations from the U.S. could worsen poverty in Central America as many households rely on remittances. Deportations in the past have contributed to gang violence in the region, raising concerns about security challenges. While most at risk of deportation have no gang ties, deported youth may be vulnerable to recruitment. Congress could help by providing more assistance for reintegration efforts to reduce the likelihood of repeat migration. The United States provides financial assistance to Central American nations for migrant reintegration and support. Central American countries have strong commercial ties with the U.S., with merchandise trade totaling over $49 billion in 2017. Access to the U.S. market is economically crucial for these nations, with exports to the U.S. accounting for a significant portion of their GDP. Central American nations closely monitor U.S. trade policy. President Trump's withdrawal from the TPP relieved some in the region. The TPP would have impacted Central American apparel producers. If the U.S. enters a similar trade agreement in the future, Congress could consider granting trade preferences to Central American nations. In October 2017, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stated the Trump Administration's intention to modernize trade agreements in Latin America. Central American leaders doubt renegotiation of CAFTA-DR and U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement will be a priority due to U.S. trade deficits. Potential changes like imposing tariffs could harm Central American economies, with the IDB estimating a 20% tariff increase could lead to a 2.2-4.4% GDP decline in the region. The drug trade in Central America is heavily impacted by its location between cocaine producers in South America and consumers in the United States. In 2016, 90% of cocaine trafficked to the US transited through Central America, along with other illicit drugs. Criminal groups in the region profit immensely from trafficking, with estimates of $700 million per year in Honduras alone. This has led to increased violence as rival organizations fight for control, fueling corruption and impunity in the region. The drug trade in Central America fuels corruption and violence as criminal organizations finance political campaigns, distort markets, and bribe officials. The US has pledged to reduce drug demand through initiatives like the M\u00e9rida Initiative, with expenditures on demand reduction increasing from $9.2 billion to $11.3 billion between FY2009 and FY2016. The Trump Administration has reiterated the US responsibility to address illegal drug demand. The budget for demand reduction increased from $9.2 billion to $11.3 billion between FY2009 and FY2016. Data on U.S. expenditures for demand reduction in FY2017 and FY2018 is not available. The number of cocaine users aged 12 or older decreased from 1.9 million in 2008 to 1.4 million in 2011 but rose to nearly 2.2 million in 2017. Legislative measures to enhance drug reduction programs in the U.S. would complement efforts under the Central America strategy. The 116th Congress could continue addressing substance abuse with initiatives like the Support for Patients and Communities Act (P.L. 115-271). The 116th Congress may reassess U.S. drug control policy, including efforts in Central America and domestic demand reduction. Nearly $2.1 billion in foreign aid has been allocated since FY2016 for Central America's prosperity and security. However, challenges persist, with risks of backsliding due to elite resistance to anti-corruption efforts and reduced diplomatic pressure and aid from the Trump Administration. Success in the region remains a long-term and challenging endeavor. Central American nations need to strengthen institutions, improve tax bases, and create opportunities for youth to succeed in the long term. International donors must provide extensive support to prevent poor conditions and instability, which could impact the United States through migration flows."
