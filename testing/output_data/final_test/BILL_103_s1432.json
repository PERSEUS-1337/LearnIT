    "content": "The Act titled \"Maritime Competitiveness Act of 1993\" is also known as the \"Maritime Competitiveness Act of 1993\". It includes findings related to maritime competitiveness. The Congress finds that the United States has a long-standing policy to maintain a strong maritime industry with a fleet of modern US-flag vessels for domestic and foreign commerce, as well as vessels under US registry for naval auxiliary purposes in times of war or national emergency. The United States maritime industry is in decline, jeopardizing the longstanding national policy to maintain a strong fleet of modern US-flag vessels. There is a growing call for reform to revitalize the industry, as without it, the remaining US-flag carriers may shift operations to foreign-flag vessels, leading to further decline in the nation's shipbuilding industry. A focused review of the United States maritime industry and its challenges is needed to establish a foundation for reform. The Merchant Marine Act, 1936 is amended to establish the National Commission on Maritime Industry Competitiveness. This commission aims to ensure a strong and competitive United States maritime industry. The National Commission on Maritime Industry Competitiveness will conduct an investigation and study of the US maritime industry to identify obstacles to its strength and competitiveness. Based on the findings, policy recommendations will be made to achieve a strong and competitive maritime industry, revitalize the US-flag vessel fleet, and support the US shipbuilding industry. The National Commission on Maritime Industry Competitiveness aims to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry to meet military and civilian needs, and preserve seafaring and shipbuilding jobs for US citizens. The National Commission on Maritime Industry Competitiveness aims to revitalize the US shipbuilding industry to meet military and civilian needs, and preserve seafaring and shipbuilding jobs for US citizens. Specific matters to be addressed are outlined in SEC. 1403. The Commission will investigate the current condition of the US maritime industry, its ability to support national defense, the availability of skilled mariners and shipyard workers, and obstacles to industry competitiveness. The Federal Government may consider legislative or administrative actions to improve the US maritime industry, including support for US-flag vessel operations, taxes and fees on maritime enterprises, regulatory requirements for vessels, and incentives for investment in US-flag vessel operations and shipbuilding. International maritime policy is being evaluated to determine if it supports the success of the US maritime industry in global markets. This includes examining negotiating policies, preference for multilateral negotiations, foreign investment in US shipping and shipbuilding, and the impact of subsidies from foreign governments on their vessel operators and shipbuilders.
