The \"Start Healthy Act of 2012\" provides Medicaid coverage for uninsured newborns, including qualified newborns defined as children born in the United States. The \"Start Healthy Act of 2012\" provides Medicaid coverage for uninsured newborns under 1 year of age born in the United States, who are not eligible for creditable coverage under specific conditions. The \"Start Healthy Act of 2012\" allows Medicaid coverage for uninsured newborns under 1 year old in the US who are not eligible for minimum essential coverage. A child believed to be a qualified newborn at birth is deemed eligible for medical assistance under the plan. The \"Start Healthy Act of 2012\" allows Medicaid coverage for uninsured newborns under 1 year old in the US who are not eligible for minimum essential coverage. A child deemed eligible for medical assistance at birth remains eligible until the age of one, unless the State determines otherwise based on coverage enrollment. The State cannot terminate medical assistance for a child eligible for coverage but not enrolled until they are enrolled. Eligibility for medical assistance must be redetermined within 180 days of the child's birth, with an application if necessary. The State may not discontinue a qualified newborn's medical assistance eligibility if the required redetermination application is not received and the State believes the child is still eligible. Failure to timely determine eligibility may result in a reduced federal medical assistance percentage. The State must not terminate a newborn's medical assistance eligibility if a timely determination is not made, with a 100 percent matching rate for temporary coverage of certain newborns in one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia. The text chunk discusses amendments to the Medicaid Act regarding payment for medical assistance and technical amendments related to clinical trials. The Medicaid Act amendments include the exclusion of compensation for participation in clinical trials for rare diseases. The effective date for these changes applies to individuals born six months after the enactment of the Act. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by recent amendments without being considered non-compliant solely for not meeting them before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session following the Act's enactment. If a state has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session."
