The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) is a Federal program supporting the integration of local emergency management, law enforcement, and health systems for coordinated responses to various mass casualty events. Congress emphasizes the need for preparedness in response to natural disasters and man-made incidents. The MMRS program was established after the 1995 sarin nerve gas attack in Tokyo and the bombing in Oklahoma City. It aims to enhance local medical response systems before disasters, providing increased operational capacity, improved training, stockpiled pharmaceuticals, and specialized equipment. It supports other Federal programs like the Hospital Preparedness Program and the Cities Readiness Initiative. The MMRS program, part of homeland security infrastructure, funds local jurisdictions in 43 States, covering 70% of the US population. It is crucial due to recent influenza outbreaks, terrorist threats, and severe weather emergencies. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program, part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, provides funding to local jurisdictions in 43 states to respond to various emergencies, including influenza outbreaks, terrorist threats, and severe weather events. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program (referred to as the `Program') supports State and local jurisdictions in preparing for all-hazards response capabilities to manage public health incidents from disasters, terrorism, and epidemics. The Assistant Secretary, Office of Health Affairs, develops guidance for the Program in coordination with the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Personnel costs are not applicable to the Program. The Program, under the Metropolitan Medical Response System, is not subject to an administrative cap on personnel hiring. The Secretary, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, can enter into contracts with local jurisdictions for mass casualty incident preparation and response. The Administrator consults with the Assistant Secretary, Office of Health Affairs, in developing guidance for these contracts. The contract under this subsection can support the integration of emergency management, health, and medical systems for a coordinated response to mass casualty incidents caused by any hazard. This includes strengthening medical surge capacity, mass prophylaxis capabilities, chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive detection, response, and decontamination capabilities, as well as developing mass triage and pre-incident planning. The contract under this subsection supports the development and maintenance of mass triage and pre-hospital treatment plans, planning, information sharing, medical supplies management, training, integration and coordination of public health and medical care providers for patient movement. The contract under this subsection supports the development and maintenance of mass triage and pre-hospital treatment plans, planning, information sharing, medical supplies management, training, integration, and coordination of public health and medical care providers for patient movement. Eligibility for a contract under this subsection is granted to jurisdictions that received funds through the Program for fiscal year 2009, with additional provisions for states without any jurisdiction receiving funds. For fiscal year 2009, jurisdictions that did not receive funds through the Program or only received funds through another State are eligible for a contract under this subsection. No jurisdiction eligible for a contract under this provision can receive one for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. For fiscal year 2009, jurisdictions not funded through the Program or only via another State can get a contract under this subsection. Additional jurisdictions may be eligible for contracts under this provision for fiscal years 2010-2014. Eligibility for contracts under this provision is contingent on the availability of appropriations beyond what is necessary to ensure that each eligible jurisdiction receives at least the same funding as in fiscal year 2009 and to provide contracts to other eligible jurisdictions. The Administrator will define performance objectives for jurisdictions to receive funds under contracts after fiscal year 2010, contingent on meeting performance measures determined by the Secretary. The Program encourages local jurisdictions to develop mutual aid agreements with neighboring jurisdictions to support timely deployment of personnel and equipment across boundaries. The Program encourages local jurisdictions to develop mutual aid agreements with neighboring jurisdictions to support timely deployment of personnel and equipment across boundaries. Performance measures will be issued for each local jurisdiction entering a contract to evaluate their effectiveness. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program will be reviewed by key agencies to assess its goals, objectives, and performance metrics. $75,000,000 is authorized for the Program annually from 2010 to 2014. The Metropolitan Medical Response System Program will be reviewed to assess its success, areas for improvement, how it complements other preparedness programs, incorporation in state and local homeland security plans, eligibility for financial assistance, allocation of assistance based on risk, and resource requirements. A report is due within 1 year. The Administrator and Assistant Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 1 year on the review of the Metropolitan Medical Response System Program. The Administrator of FEMA will consult with the Secretary of HHS in implementation. The National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group consists of 10 local government agency managers representing a population-based cross-section. The National Metropolitan Medical Response System Working Group consists of 10 local government agency managers from different regions appointed by FEMA and the Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs.
