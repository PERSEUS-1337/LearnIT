    "content": "Migration from Central America to the United States, specifically from the Northern Triangle countries, has significantly increased over the past decade. The number of individuals from the Northern Triangle living in the U.S. grew from 2.2 million to almost 3 million from 2006 to 2016, a 37% increase. This was more than twice the increase for the total foreign-born population. Despite total apprehensions of illegal border crossers being at a 45-year low in FY2017, the number of families from the Northern Triangle apprehended also increased. Despite total apprehensions of illegal border crossers being at a 45-year low in FY2017, the number of families from the Northern Triangle apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border has increased in recent years. The majority of apprehended migrants are families and unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle, with an increasing number requesting asylum, contributing to a backlog of asylum cases in U.S. immigration courts. News reports of migrant \"caravans\" from the Northern Triangle traveling toward the U.S. border have sparked intense interest and questions from Congress. The increase in Central American migrants apprehended at the Southwest border is occurring within historically low levels of total alien apprehensions. Apprehensions of migrants of all nationalities have fluctuated over the years, with a peak in FY1986 and FY2000, and then declining to a low in FY2017. In FY2018, apprehensions increased to 397,000. In FY2018, Southwest border apprehensions increased to 397,000, comparable to the 10-year average. A shift in migrant demographics shows an increase in nationals from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, making up 52% of apprehensions by FY2018. Additionally, the majority of apprehended migrants are now families and unaccompanied children, a change from the past when single adult males dominated. The predominant national origins of migrant families changed from Mexico to the Northern Triangle countries. Factors such as weak institutions, corrupt officials, economic challenges, and high crime rates contribute to insecurity and drive people to emigrate from the Northern Triangle. The Northern Triangle countries face challenges such as autocratic rule, corruption, and low tax collection rates, leading to underfunded institutions and programs. These issues, along with transnational criminal activities, contribute to high crime rates and poverty, prompting people to leave the region. Central American countries have high crime rates due to drug traffickers, gangs, and criminal groups, leading to migration intentions among victims. Guatemala and El Salvador are prone to natural disasters, affecting the agriculture sector and livelihoods. According to the 2018 Global Hunger Index, Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third in hunger levels in Central America and the Caribbean. Intense and erratic weather patterns in recent years are strongly linked to food insecurity and migration in the region. Economic opportunity motivates Northern Triangle families and unaccompanied children to migrate to the United States. Despite challenging labor market conditions, economic prospects for industrial sectors employing low-skilled workers in the United States have improved. Educational opportunities and family reunification are key motives for migration, especially among Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran populations. The impact of U.S. immigration policies on migration remains unclear, with debates on whether specific policies have motivated families and children to migrate. Some argue that the asylum policy allowing asylum seekers to remain in the U.S. while awaiting decisions has encouraged migration. The backlog of over 700,000 asylum cases in immigration courts has led to long wait times for asylum seekers in the United States. Some argue that revised humanitarian relief policies for unaccompanied children have also contributed to recent family and child migration. Migrants from the Northern Triangle use various means to reach the Mexico-U.S. border. Central American migrants travel to the Mexico-U.S. border using various methods, including walking, hitchhiking, and riding on trains and buses. They often form groups to share resources and protection. Caravans have been happening for years, but gained attention recently when a group of 1,000 migrants headed to the U.S. About 400 made it to the border. Nonprofit groups organize processions to highlight the struggles of migrants, especially families fleeing violence and poverty. Mobile phones help with navigation and communication. The United States is working with Central American governments to promote economic prosperity, improve security, and strengthen governance in the region. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion to support the strategy from FY2016-FY2018, doubling annual aid levels. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras allocated $7.7 billion to their Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle from 2016-2018. The Trump Administration committed $5.8 billion in public and private investment to support institutional reforms and development in the Northern Triangle. The funds include foreign assistance from prior years and potential loans, loan guarantees, and private sector resources. It is too early to assess the full impact of recent U.S. efforts in Central America. Despite U.S. support, the Northern Triangle countries have seen some progress in economic stability and security, with homicide rates declining. However, poverty-reduction programs have been lacking, leading to little improvement in living conditions. Many residents still feel insecure, with crime rates increasing between 2014 and 2017. The Organization of American States-backed Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Guatemala and Honduras has made progress in high-level corruption cases, facing pushback from elites. Mexico has assisted the US in managing Central American migrant flows and received over $100 million in funding. Mexico returned almost 524,000 migrants from the Northern Triangle countries from 2015 to 2018 and provided temporary work visas at its southern border. Mexico has provided temporary visas for those who want to work in its southern border states and access to asylum for Central American migrants. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has sheltered some U.S.-bound migrants but urged investment in southern Mexico and Central America to prevent future unauthorized migration. The Mexican government has faced pressure from the United States to contain recent caravans of migrants, while humanitarian groups have urged assistance for the migrants. In fall 2018, Mexican citizens, aid groups, and government entities provided migrants with food, shelter, and emergency aid. The UNHCR reported that 3,300 members of migrant caravans applied for asylum in Mexico, while over 3,000 accepted voluntary repatriation. With U.S. ports limiting asylum screenings, border cities may need to shelter migrants for months. Mexico's refugee agency, supported by UNHCR, was overwhelmed processing applications. The U.S. and Mexico were negotiating an agreement called \"Remain in Mexico\" for asylum seekers. The U.S. implemented a new policy to return some non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico while their immigration court decisions are pending. Mexico responded by offering humanitarian visas, work permits, and the ability to apply for asylum in Mexico. The first asylum seeker was returned to Mexico under this new policy. The U.S. implemented a new policy to return some non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico while their immigration court decisions are pending. Mexican officials stated they will not accept minors or individuals over age 60 awaiting asylum claims. Concerns over costs and safety could challenge the policy's sustainability. Various organizations provide humanitarian assistance to migrants traveling from the Northern Triangle, including UNHCR, offering comprehensive support throughout their journey. The flow of people from the Northern Triangle is characterized as mixed migration, involving different groups such as economic migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers, trafficked persons, and unaccompanied children. While refugees have certain rights under international law, migrants lack similar protections. UNHCR emphasizes that all groups in mixed migration should have access to humanitarian assistance, protection, and due process, even if they do not qualify as refugees. Those fleeing face dangers not only in their home countries but also during their journey north, where they may be recruited into criminal gangs. In Mexico, UNHCR provides support to vulnerable migrants, including women, children, the elderly, and those with disabilities. They work with local and federal governments, civil society, and partners to offer shelter, cash assistance, and safety mechanisms. However, Mexico's Commission for the Aid of Refugees lacks capacity to process claims. International humanitarian efforts are mobilized along caravan routes in Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tijuana to provide assistance. International humanitarian efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean aim to align with the Comprehensive Regional Protection and Solutions Framework to defend the rights of migrants and refugees. The U.N. and other experts urge donors to provide timely funding to support host governments and local communities assisting arrivals. Multiple federal agencies are involved in immigration processing at ports of entry and along U.S. borders shared with Mexico and Canada. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) includes Customs and Border Protection (CBP) responsible for preventing unauthorized entry at the Southwest border. U.S. Border Patrol secures borders at ports of entry, apprehending foreign nationals without valid documents. CBP's Office of Field Operations conducts immigration inspections at ports of entry. ICE is responsible for enforcing immigration laws and removing unauthorized aliens in the U.S. USCIS handles immigration petitions, asylum claims, and other related services. The Department of Justice (DOJ) oversees immigration courts where immigration judges determine the removal or relief eligibility of aliens. The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for migrants with credible fear who are referred for a hearing. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is responsible for the care and placement of unaccompanied alien children (UAC). ICE handles custody transfer or repatriation, while aliens apprehended for illegal entry and reentry may face civil and criminal penalties, including prosecution in federal criminal courts by the Department of Justice (DOJ). All apprehended aliens, including children, are placed into immigration removal proceedings. ICE represents the government in removal proceedings before an immigration judge. CBP may refer aliens for criminal prosecution based on enforcement priorities. Aliens can request asylum at a port of entry or when apprehended by CBP. Requests for asylum at the border include an interview to assess credibility. During the Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy in May and June 2018, all adults caught entering illegally, including asylum seekers, were prosecuted. President Trump ended the policy with an executive order on June 20, 2018, following public backlash over family separations. Children accompanying prosecuted adults were classified as UAC and housed in ORR shelters. Adults were transferred to ICE custody after serving any criminal sentence. During the Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, adults caught entering illegally were prosecuted and transferred to ICE custody after serving any criminal sentence. They were eventually reunited with their children, either in family detention or upon release into the United States. Some parents were deported before reuniting with their children, and a few remain separated. The Immigration and Nationality Act allows aliens in the U.S. to apply for asylum, regardless of their immigration status, with asylum granted by a USCIS officer or DOJ immigration judge. To be granted asylum in the U.S., an alien must prove inability to return home due to past persecution or fear of future persecution based on protected grounds. Certain aliens, like those posing security risks, are ineligible. Special provisions apply to those in expedited removal, requiring a credible fear determination by a USCIS asylum officer. In June 2018, the Attorney General issued a decision stating that claims of domestic or gang violence by non-governmental actors do not generally qualify for asylum based on membership in a particular social group. USCIS issued a policy memorandum to guide asylum officers on determining asylum eligibility and credible fear of persecution. In December 2018, a federal district court judge permanently enjoined the U.S. government from continuing some new credible fear policies for asylum claims. Other components of the former Attorney General's decision and USCIS memorandum remain in effect. CBP officers use TECS and the Automated Targeting System to screen travelers at the border. Automated Targeting System (ATS) compares traveler and cargo information against law enforcement databases, including the Terrorist Screening Database. ATS-P focuses on identifying potential terrorists and criminals, used by CBP personnel at borders and ports of entry. Active duty and National Guard personnel have conducted various missions on the Southwest border. The National Guard and active duty personnel have been deployed to the Southwest border to provide surveillance, engineering, administrative, and logistical support to border agents. This deployment was requested by CBP for transportation, logistics, engineering, medical support, housing, and planning assistance. The Trump Administration authorized military personnel to perform military protective activities as needed. The Secretary of Defense authorized military personnel to perform protective activities to ensure the safety of Federal personnel, including the use of force if necessary. However, they are not allowed to conduct traditional civilian law enforcement activities like arrest and search without further direction from the President. Governor's troops could be given arrest authority, but there is no arrest authority under Posse Comitatus. The Secretary of Defense authorized military personnel for protective activities, including use of force but not arrest authority under Posse Comitatus. Detention is limited to minutes, not hours, to stop violence. No violation of Posse Comitatus, only assistance approved by Acting Secretary of Defense. Acting Secretary of Defense approved continued DOD assistance to DHS at the southwestern border, transitioning to mobile surveillance and detection. Posse Comitatus Act limits military use in law enforcement. Constitutional or statutory authority needed to deploy federal troops for law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act limits military involvement in law enforcement, requiring constitutional or statutory authority for federal troops to enforce immigration or customs laws directly. Case law indicates violations occur when military personnel are used by civilian law enforcement, or when military power is used in a regulatory or compulsory manner. The Act does not apply to the National Guard unless activated for federal service. The President could potentially invoke the Insurrection Act for direct military enforcement in response to unlawful migrant border crossings, although it has never been tested in court. The executive branch has asserted constitutional exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act for preserving public order and carrying out governmental operations within territorial limits. President Trump has considered declaring a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act to secure funding for a physical barrier at the southern border with Mexico, citing exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act for protecting federal property and restoring public order during civil disturbances or disasters. The President is considering declaring a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act to fund a physical barrier at the southern border with Mexico using DOD funds. This could allow the use of military construction funds or reprogramming of civil works funds. The emergency military construction authority in 10 U.S.C. \u00a72808 may be invoked, allowing for necessary military construction projects to support the armed forces during a national emergency. Section 2808 limits emergency military construction funds to unobligated appropriations. Presidents have used this for construction at foreign military bases. Using this authority for border barriers is untested and likely to face legal challenges. Three key questions could hinder its use: whether border conditions justify invoking Section 2808, if the construction project addresses a national emergency requiring armed forces, and if the project is necessary. The construction of a border wall may qualify as a \"military construction project\" under Section 2808, which allows for emergency military construction funds to be used for projects necessary to support the armed forces. The definition of \"military construction project\" includes any construction related to a military installation or defense access road. The question of whether Section 2808 extends to a border wall construction is untested and may face legal challenges. The issue of constructing a border wall under Section 2808 is untested and may face legal challenges. The location of barriers and proximity to military bases could impact the necessity of a wall for supporting the armed forces. The Secretary of the Army has the authority to defer non-essential civil works projects in a national emergency requiring the use of the Armed Forces. The Secretary of the Army can use funds allocated to projects for essential national defense projects under the NEA. It is uncertain if a border wall would qualify as an authorized project. Courts may defer to executive claims of military necessity. The President's authority to use military personnel for border security operations depends on whether they are active duty troops under Title 10 or National Guard troops under Title 32. Section 502 of Title 32 allows the Secretary of the Army and Air Force to call National Guard units for full-time duty, including \"homeland defense activities.\" The President's authority to use military personnel for border security operations depends on whether they are active duty troops under Title 10 or National Guard troops under Title 32. Section 502 of Title 32 allows the Secretary of the Army and Air Force to call National Guard units for full-time duty, including \"homeland defense activities.\" Such activities involve military protection of the territory or domestic population of the United States, infrastructure critical to national security, and support for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in counterdrug, counterterrorism, and counter-transnational crime efforts. These authorities permit the military to provide support for border security and immigration control operations. Military personnel can assist federal law enforcement agencies in various operations, including counterterrorism, counterdrug, immigration, and customs enforcement. They may engage in activities such as constructing roads, fences, and installing lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries. However, direct participation in search, seizure, arrest, or similar activities is not permitted unless authorized by law. Additional authority may be derived from Section 1059 of the National Defense Act. Section 1059 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to spend up to $75 million of 2016 DOD funds to provide assistance to CBP for securing the southern land border of the United States. This includes deploying Armed Forces members, aerial surveillance systems, ground-based surveillance systems, and intelligence analysis support. Congress provided the President with discretion to reduce foreign assistance to Central America in FY2018, with a ceiling of $615 million for the Central America strategy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 requires the State Department to withhold 75% of assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras until certain conditions are met. The President can modify assistance to these countries for FY2019. The President's ability to adjust assistance to the Northern Triangle countries for FY2019 depends on future appropriations legislation. A presidential proclamation issued on November 9, 2018, suspends entry of aliens crossing the Southwest border. The proclamation will expire 90 days after issuance or upon reaching a bilateral agreement with Mexico. Additionally, an interim rule bars aliens entering in violation of the proclamation from asylum eligibility. The proclamation issued on November 9, 2018, suspends entry of aliens crossing the Southwest border and bars them from asylum eligibility. The changes to the asylum process are being challenged in federal court and are not currently in effect.
