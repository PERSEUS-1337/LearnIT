    "content": "Article V of the U.S. Constitution outlines two ways to amend the Constitution: through Congress with a two-thirds vote or through a convention called by two-thirds of the states. Supporters have tried to call conventions in the past for various issues, and recently there has been a resurgence in support for the convention option. Various advocacy groups are now pushing for conventions to consider different amendments. The report provides information on current developments in Congress, states, and the advocacy community regarding the Article V Convention alternative. 175 applications for the convention have been introduced in 40 states during their 2017 sessions. In 2017, 175 applications for an Article V Convention were introduced in 40 states. Three states have applied for a convention to consider a balanced budget, while four states have joined the Convention of States Project. One state has applied for the Compact for America's Compact for a Balanced Budget. Four states have rescinded previous applications. The Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force claims 28 applications for a balanced federal budget amendment. The Convention of States project focuses on amendments restricting the authority of the U.S. government. In the 2017, 175 applications for an Article V Convention were introduced in 40 states. Various organizations like Convention of States project, Wolf PAC, Compact for America, U.S. Term Limits, Citizen Initiatives, and Single Subject Amendment PAC have listed applications from multiple states for different constitutional amendments. Over 700 proposals for an Article V Convention have been filed since 1789. Since 1789, over 700 proposals for an Article V Convention have been filed, with most proposed since 1900. Two campaigns in the second half of the 20th century approached the constitutional threshold of applications from two-thirds of the states, focusing on apportionment in state legislatures and a balanced federal budget amendment. However, momentum was lost after the death of a key advocate and faced growing opposition. The Article V Convention alternative faced opposition and stalled in the budget amendment campaign. Between 1988 and 2010, 17 state legislatures rescinded their calls for a convention. Interest in the convention revived in the 21st century, with advocacy groups pushing for amendments like a balanced budget requirement. Progressive movements also began to show interest in the convention. The Article V Convention's appeal grew as progressive movements like Occupy Wall Street advocated for overturning parts of the Citizens United decision and changing corporate personhood. The option is attractive due to its original intent, grassroots origins, and ability to propose amendments directly to states. State legislatures have taken action, with 15 states reversing their decisions since 2010. Since 2010, 15 states have reversed earlier rescissions of convention applications, while five states have rescinded their applications since 2016. Questions have been raised about the standard for a valid Article V Convention application, particularly regarding the permissible scope of state applications. Observers debate whether Article V allows for a general convention, one focused on a single issue like a balanced budget amendment, or a specific amendment with included text. Some observers argue that only \"general\" convention applications are valid, while others believe state applications must address the same issue to count towards the two-thirds threshold. Scholars generally agree that applications proposing a specifically worded amendment do not meet the constitutional standard. However, Congress has received applications for an Article V Convention that include a specific amendment, a practice most common in the 1980s for a balanced budget amendment. Organizations like \"Compact for America,\" \"Single Subject Amendment,\" and \"Restoring Freedom\" currently propose conventions to consider specific amendments. The debate over the validity of state applications for an Article V Convention revolves around the issue of timeliness and whether they should have a limited \"shelf life.\" Some argue for a seven-year validity period, while others suggest two to four years. Supporters of the convention generally assert that state applications are valid indefinitely, rejecting any authority for Congress to set a deadline. The debate over the validity of state applications for an Article V Convention revolves around whether states can rescind their applications. Some argue that states can withdraw their applications before the two-thirds threshold is met, while others believe that an application carries the same weight as ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment and cannot be revoked. The debate over the validity of state applications for an Article V Convention centers on whether states can rescind their applications. Supporters argue that applications are as valid as ratification of a proposed constitutional amendment and cannot be revoked. Some states have added self-canceling clauses to their applications in the past. Advocates claim that all state applications are equally valid, regardless of their specific goals or text. Friends of the Article V Convention (FOAVC) argues that all state applications for an Article V Convention are equally valid and cannot be rescinded. They believe that Congress had a constitutional obligation to call a convention once two-thirds of the states had submitted applications. FOAVC claims that 49 out of 50 states have submitted petitions since 1789, and Congress should have called a convention by 1911. The requirement for an Article V Convention is that two-thirds of states (34) must submit applications, but opinions differ on when Congress is obligated to call the convention. Friends of the Article V Convention (FOAVC) argues that all state applications for an Article V Convention are equally valid and cannot be rescinded. They believe Congress has a constitutional obligation to call a convention once two-thirds of the states have submitted applications. FOAVC claims that 49 out of 50 states have submitted petitions since 1789, and Congress should have called a convention by 1911. Various groups suggest the 34-state threshold for a convention has not been met yet. The Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force claims the most active applications with 28. There is debate over the lack of an official list of state applications for an Article V Convention. State applications are not centrally collected, but scattered through the Center for Legislative Archives. FOAVC criticizes Congress for not tracking and keeping a centralized list of applications. Since 2013, Article V Convention activists have pushed for an official congressional count of state applications. The House of Representatives established new procedures in the 114th Congress to track state actions regarding an Article V Convention. The chair of the House Judiciary Committee was directed to make new memorials from states publicly available, along with any prior memorials at their discretion. The Clerk of the House of Representatives was also directed to designate these memorials for public access. The House of Representatives directed the Clerk to make state memorials publicly available in electronic form. H.R. 1742, the \"Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017,\" would require the National Archives to compile all state applications for an Article V Convention. The Archivist of the United States would transmit copies to the Judiciary Committees for public availability if the legislation is enacted. This compilation could meet the demands of the convention advocacy community. The Article V Convention option is promoted by various advocacy organizations with different approaches and agendas. Some established policy advocacy groups, such as the John Birch Society, the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, Eagle Forum, and Common Cause, have criticized or expressed disapproval of the convention. No public policy organizations specifically focus on opposing the Article V Convention alternative. ArticleV.org and the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) Task Force are two groups advocating for an Article V convention. ArticleV.org originated from the Occupy Wall Street movement and focuses on educating Americans on the need for a convention. They do not support a specific amendment but offer a range of alternatives. The BBA Task Force specifically advocates for a Federal Balanced Budget Amendment. The BBA Task Force, established in 2010, includes earlier unrescinded \"legacy\" applications for a balanced budget amendment convention. It actively campaigns for additional state applications and claims 28 applications, the largest number among convention advocacy groups. Citizen Initiatives promotes the use of the Article V Convention for \"single subject\" amendments on public issues. At the time of this writing, Citizen Initiatives lists one state application for a convention to consider the Countermand Amendment, which would authorize the states to override federal legislation, executive orders, or court orders whenever the legislatures of 60% (30) of the states agree to such a veto. A different approach to the Article V Convention question was advanced in 2013 by the Compact for America (CFA), a domestic nonprofit \"501(c)(4)\" corporation, promoting a Compact for a Balanced Budget Amendment as an interstate compact to streamline the state-initiated amendment process under Article V. The Compact for America proposes a streamlined process for convening a convention, presenting, approving, and proposing amendments, and ratifying them within 12 months. It aims to speed up the Article V Convention process by anticipating and prescribing procedures. The Compact for America proposes a streamlined process for convening an Article V Convention, with participating states agreeing to observe the Compact's provisions governing the convention's composition and rules of procedure. The compact includes a self-termination provision, limiting itself to a seven-year lifespan if it fails to gain membership by the requisite 38 states. The Compact for America proposes a streamlined process for convening an Article V Convention, with participating states agreeing to observe the Compact's provisions governing the convention's composition and rules of procedure. CFA provides model legislation for a concurrent resolution that could be used by Congress to call the convention. H.Con.Res. 73, incorporating the Compact for a Balanced Budget, was introduced in the 115th Congress. The Convention of States project by Citizens for Self-Governance calls for an Article V convention to propose amendments imposing fiscal restraints on the federal government and limiting its power and jurisdiction. The Convention of States project, established in 2014, advocates for a general-purpose convention to propose amendments limiting the authority of the federal government. Proposed amendments include a balanced budget, redefining clauses in the Constitution, limiting international treaties' application, imposing term limits, setting an upper limit on federal taxation, and requiring a super-majority vote to replace existing taxes. The Convention of States project, founded in 2014, advocates for a general-purpose convention to propose amendments limiting federal government authority. It emphasizes grassroots organization and planning for political operations in at least 40 states. Currently, 12 state legislatures have applied for a convention based on this model. Friends of the Article V Convention (FOAVC), a nonpartisan group since 2007, supports the Article V Convention process without campaigning for specific amendments. RestoringFreedom.org, a nonprofit corporation chartered in Texas in 2009, also supports this initiative. The Single Subject Amendment, proposed by the nonprofit corporation Single Subject Amendment, calls for states to apply for an Article V Convention to require approval from a majority of state legislatures before any increase in the national debt. This organization also advocates for limiting bills in Congress to a single subject to ensure accountability. The Single Subject Amendment, proposed by the nonprofit corporation Single Subject Amendment, advocates for a relevant amendment to limit bills in Congress to a single subject for accountability and transparency. It supports H.J.Res. 25 introduced in the 115th Congress, requiring each bill to have only one clearly expressed subject in the title. U.S. Term Limits also supports term limits for elected officials. U.S. Term Limits advocates for term limits for elected officials at all levels of government, including Congress. It supports term limit amendments, with three terms for Representatives and two for Senators. The organization also aims to propose a term limits amendment through an Article V Convention. Wolf PAC, another organization, seeks to reverse the \"corporate personhood\" aspects of the Citizens United decision through an Article V Convention. California has passed the Wolf PAC convention application. The Wolf PAC convention application passed by California's legislature declares that \"money does not constitute free speech and may be legislatively limited\" and that corporations \"should not be categorized as persons for purposes related to elections and ballot measures.\" Wolf PAC's plans include extensive use of social media and online grassroots organizing. Five states have applied for a convention to consider Wolf PAC's proposals. The Article V Convention issue continues to receive attention in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, new procedures were established for receiving and publishing state memorials related to the Article V Convention issue. This includes applications for a convention and rescissions of previous applications. The House of Representatives introduced proposed legislation for an official compilation of all Article V Convention applications received from the states. The House of Representatives established procedures for retaining and making public state memorials regarding an Article V Convention. This includes applications and rescissions, with memorials organized by state and year of receipt. This action aims to provide an official count of state applications moving forward. The Clerk's website records state applications for an Article V Convention since February 2015. Currently, 134 applications from 46 states have been recorded, addressing various policy concerns such as a balanced federal budget, revenue sharing, abortion restrictions, and amendments to restrict federal government authority. The Clerk's website has recorded 21 rescissions from 20 states regarding applications for an Article V Convention. Two proposals related to the Article V Convention movement have been introduced in the 115th Congress, including H.R. 1742, the Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017 introduced by Representative Luke Messer. H.R. 1742, the Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017, would require the Archivist of the United States to compile and transmit to Congress a list of all applications for an Article V Convention. The compilation would be organized by year and state, with a five-year schedule for submission review. The bill also includes recommendations for state application procedures and provides funding for the initiative. H.R. 1742, the Article V Records Transparency Act of 2017, would require the Archivist of the United States to compile and transmit to Congress a list of all applications for an Article V Convention. The bill aims to provide direct funding for the compilation program to the National Historical Publications and Records Commission at the National Archives. If enacted, it would address the need for a comprehensive list of state convention applications. The Compact for America's Compact for a Balanced Budget, as outlined in H.Con.Res. 73, calls for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment. It affirms Congress's role in calling the convention and states that member states would commit to ratifying the amendment if approved. The House Judiciary Committee referred H.Con.Res. 73 to its subcommittees on July 26 and August 17, 2017. Chairman Bob Goodlatte held a hearing on a balanced budget amendment, where the Article V Convention process was mentioned by Representative Steve Stivers and witness Nick Dranias. Nick Dranias, president of the Compact for America, testified on their efforts to promote a Balanced Budget Amendment through an Article V Convention. H.J.Res. 34, introduced in the 114th Congress, proposed an amendment allowing states to apply for a convention to consider a specific amendment. This measure aimed to clarify the eligibility of such amendments for consideration in an Article V Convention. The \"Madison Amendment\" proposal aims to prevent a \"runaway convention\" by limiting consideration to a specific amendment. Introduced by Representative Paul A. Gosar in the 114th Congress, it would have effectuated the Compact for a Balanced Budget. No further action was taken beyond referral to the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. Various states have introduced measures for alternative Article V Convention proposals. As of August 1, 2017, 175 applications for an Article V Convention had been introduced in 40 states during their 2017 sessions. Three states applied for a balanced budget amendment, four joined the Convention of States Project, and one applied for the Compact for America's Balanced Budget Compact. Wisconsin recently completed action on an application for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment, bringing the total to 28. Organizations supporting and opposing the convention have been active in building support. In March 2017, the Arizona legislature passed a measure inviting states to plan for an Article V Convention to consider a balanced federal budget amendment. Official delegations from 19 states and unofficial groups from three other states met in Phoenix in September 2017 to discuss planning issues and set non-binding rules for the convention. The Convention of States also held a \"simulated\" convention in Virginia in September 2016. In September 2017, unofficial delegates from all 50 states met in Williamsburg, Virginia to adopt amendments in policy areas such as a balanced federal budget, term limits for Congress, limiting federal overreach, and empowering states to abrogate federal laws. The BBA Task Force collaborated with other organizations to conduct state legislator education programs for potential BBA Task Force applications. U.S. Term Limits, a policy advocacy group, initiated a campaign for an Article V Convention to consider an amendment limiting U.S. Representatives to six two-year terms and U.S. Senators to two six-year terms, totaling 12 years of service. The Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force sponsored a meeting in July 2015 to discuss convention procedures, coinciding with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) meeting focused on state policy issues. ALEC emphasizes \"free markets, limited government, and constitutional division of powers.\" In January 2015, the Convention of States Caucus was founded for pro-convention state legislators to propose draft rules for an Article V Convention at the ALEC San Diego meeting. The issue of rules for a convention has been controversial, with some advocates claiming Congress has no role beyond calling the convention. The CFA's Compact for a Balanced Budget Commission was established to provide an organizational framework for the compact. The Compact for a Balanced Budget Commission was established to provide an organizational framework for the compact and its member states. Opposition to the Article V Convention continues to be voiced by public policy advocacy organizations. The Heritage Foundation cautioned against a convention in 2011, citing lack of precedent, unknowns, and risks. However, a 2016 study appeared noncommittal on the subject, balancing concerns about a \"runaway convention\" with the need to focus on holding Congress and the President accountable. Eagle Forum, a conservative organization founded by Phyllis Schlafly, opposes an Article V Convention due to concerns about jeopardizing constitutional liberties. In 2017, a break-away group called \"PS Eagles\" also criticized the convention, citing hidden globalist agendas. The Center on Budget Policy and Priorities warned against a balanced budget amendment and an Article V Convention in January 2017. The Center on Budget Policy and Priorities opposes a balanced budget amendment and an Article V Convention, warning that states may not control the outcomes of a convention. The John Birch Society has also long opposed the convention and the Compact for America proposal. The John Birch Society and Common Cause have both expressed opposition to the Compact for America and an Article V Convention. Common Cause issued a statement by 230 public interest organizations warning of the dangers of a runaway convention. Common Cause strongly opposes an Article V convention, citing concerns about the potential for a runaway convention that could rewrite constitutional rights and protections for American citizens. The lack of oversight, potential for political manipulation, and the possibility of proposing changes that could limit or eliminate fundamental rights are key reasons for their opposition. The Article V Convention alternative for amending the Constitution has gained support from various activist organizations across the political spectrum. However, challenges such as competing advocacy groups and complex strategies may hinder the attainment of the necessary 34 convention applications. Some groups' strategies may weaken their arguments. A focused single-issue approach, like the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force advocating for a balanced federal budget requirement, has the most applications. Public support for this amendment has been consistent since 1994. Lack of coordination among advocacy groups is also noted. The lack of coordination among advocacy groups supporting the Article V Convention is causing confusion among legislators and hindering the overall success rate. The convention remains primarily an online phenomenon with limited traditional media coverage, and it does not have widespread attention or support from the general public. Despite an increase in state applications for a convention in the past two years, only the Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force has significant support with 28 applications. The Balanced Budget Amendment Task Force has 28 applications, while the Convention of States has 12 states. However, four states rescinded their applications in 2017. There are concerns about the validity of state applications submitted over 30 years ago and the constitutional status of states rescinding their earlier applications. Advocates may argue that state applications will continue at the same pace, but there are worries about potential setbacks similar to those faced by the BBA campaign in the 1980s. The Article V Convention device was intended to provide an alternative method of amendment, requiring broad national consensus and meeting exacting standards. The current campaign lacks widespread awareness and support, hindering its success in meeting the Constitution's requirements."
