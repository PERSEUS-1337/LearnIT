    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a concise summary of the section's title and its purpose. The \"Special Care Dentistry Act of 2010\" is aimed at addressing oral health issues affecting vulnerable populations, as highlighted in the United States Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. The Act recognizes the significant impact of oral diseases on overall health and well-being, especially among low-income elderly, individuals with disabilities, and minority groups. Associations between oral infections and other health problems are also acknowledged. Providing oral health benefits under Medicaid to aged, blind, or disabled individuals can prevent health problems like diabetes and heart disease, reducing emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Despite these populations making up 28% of Medicaid enrollees, they consume 72% of the budget, with little coverage for dental services. In 2003, only 6 states provided basic oral health services to adult aged, blind, and disabled Medicaid recipients. Lack of Medicaid coverage leads to high dental office overhead costs not covered by reimbursement rates. Additional Federal investment is needed for oral health services to reduce Medicaid and Medicare expenditures. Investments are needed for an oral health initiative to reduce disparities and improve the health status of vulnerable populations. Additional Federal funding is required to ensure vulnerable adults receive oral health benefits. The Medicaid program will now provide oral health services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals under a new section of the Social Security Act. Additional Federal funding is needed to ensure vulnerable adults receive these benefits. The Medicaid program will now provide oral health coverage for aged, blind, or disabled individuals through a separate State adult dental program. The services and fees must be equivalent to those provided to children, with age-appropriate services and intervals for check-ups. Aged, blind, or disabled individuals eligible for medical assistance under specific criteria are considered for coverage under the Medicaid program. The State must provide transportation for aged, blind, or disabled individuals to access oral health services as part of the Medicaid program. The definition of oral health services has been expanded under the Social Security Act. The term 'oral health services' under the Social Security Act includes relief of pain, restoration of teeth, periodontal treatment, preventive services, dental surgical services, denture care, house calls, sedation, and behavior management. Long term care facilities refer to nursing or assisted living facilities. The term 'house call' refers to delivering dental services in long term care facilities to overcome mobility impairments and transportation barriers. 'Behavior management' refers to necessary services. The term 'behavior management' refers to services needed for physical or behavioral impairment. Amendments to the Social Security Act include changing \"dental\" to \"oral health\" and making oral health services available in state plans. The Social Security Act amendments require states to provide oral health services to aged, blind, or disabled individuals, inform them of the availability of services, provide requested services, and arrange for corrective treatment when needed. The Social Security Act amendments mandate states to offer oral health services to aged, blind, or disabled individuals and report relevant information to the Secretary annually. This includes the number of individuals in these groups, the number receiving oral health services, and other related data. The Social Security Act amendments require states to provide oral health services to certain individuals and report data annually, including the number referred for treatment, preventive services needed and provided, surgical and restorative services, and other oral health services categorized by type. The amendments to the Social Security Act require nursing facilities to provide oral health services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals. Federal funding is also provided for covering these services. The Social Security Act amendments mandate nursing facilities to offer oral health services for aged, blind, or disabled individuals, with federal funding covering these services. Additionally, a new subsection ensures a 100 percent Federal medical assistance percentage for medical assistance for these individuals in States or the District of Columbia. The effective date for these changes is set for calendar quarters starting on or after October 1, 2010. The State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act must meet additional requirements imposed by recent amendments. Failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session will not be considered non-compliance with the Act. The session is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature."
