    "title": "AB 1829",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 655.1 of the Harbors and Navigation Code is amended to allow peace officers to request chemical testing of individuals operating mechanically propelled vessels under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The arrested person operating a vessel under the influence of alcohol or drugs must be advised of potential criminal charges, the right to refuse chemical testing, and that an officer can obtain a search warrant for a blood sample. They are not entitled to have an attorney present during the testing process. If lawfully arrested for operating a vessel under the influence, the person can choose between a blood or breath test. If unable to complete the chosen test, they must submit to the other. If both tests are unavailable, a different procedure applies. If lawfully arrested for operating a vessel under the influence, the person can choose between a blood, breath, or urine test. The officer must advise the person of this choice. A person arrested for operating a vessel under the influence can choose to submit to a blood or urine test if the arresting officer has reasonable cause to believe they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The person must be advised of this choice and can choose between blood or urine test. If a person arrested for operating a vessel under the influence is unable to complete a chosen chemical test, they must submit to and complete the other remaining test. A person who chooses to submit to a breath test must be advised that no breath sample will be retained for later analysis. They will have the option to provide a blood or urine sample at no cost, which will be retained for future analysis of alcohol content. The person will be advised that the blood or urine sample can be tested in any criminal prosecution, and failure to perform the test does not require the opposing party to do so or affect the admissibility of other evidence of drug or alcohol content in the blood. If a person is lawfully arrested for an offense under specific sections and needs medical treatment before a chemical test can be administered, they can choose from available tests at the medical facility. The arresting officer must inform them of the available tests and their choice is limited to those options. Any person who is unconscious or unable to refuse may be tested for drug or alcohol content in their blood, regardless of being informed of their rights. Individuals with hemophilia or heart conditions using anticoagulants are exempt from blood tests. A person arrested for operating a vessel in violation of specified sections can request a blood or breath test to determine alcohol or drug content. The test must be conducted according to the Vehicle Code. Peace officers can still gather evidence from the arrested person. If a blood or breath test is not available, the person must submit to another test to determine alcohol percentage in their blood. If both tests are unavailable, consent is given for a urine test. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
