SEC. 3. INTRODUCTION AND FAST-TRACK CONSIDERATION OF IMPLEMENTING BILL. When the President submits a bill to implement a trade agreement, it shall be introduced in the House and Senate. The bill must only contain provisions necessary for the trade agreement and cannot establish labor or environmental standards. In the Senate, a point of order applies to all legislative forms of implementation. The term \"implementing bill\" includes the bill, amendment, conference report, amendment between houses, and motion related to a bill implementing a trade agreement. A point of order applies to all legislative forms of implementation in the Senate. When the Senate is considering an implementing bill, a Senator can raise a point of order against any part that violates a restriction. The Presiding Officer may sustain the point of order against some or all provisions. When a point of order is raised against a part of an implementing bill, the Presiding Officer can deem that part stricken. If the point of order is raised against multiple provisions, only those provisions sustained by the Presiding Officer will be deemed stricken. The stricken matter cannot be offered as an amendment to the bill. Before the Presiding Officer rules on a point of order under this subsection, any Senator may move to waive the point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of order is raised. Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance with the rules and precedents of the Senate. After the Presiding Officer rules on a point of order under this subsection, any Senator may appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer on the point of order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which the Presiding Officer ruled. (C) Three-fifths majority required for waivers and appeals on points of order under this subsection. The requisite majority is three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn. Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 regarding Fast Track Procedures.

Additionally, amendments are made to include references to the Chile-NAFTA Accession Act in subsections (b)(1) and (c)(1)."
