The Act, titled \"Intelligent Technologies Initiative Act of 2015,\" defines key terms such as eligible entity, ITS (intelligent transportation systems), and multi-jurisdictional group. Eligible entities include State or local governments, tribal governments, transit agencies, and other political subdivisions. Multi-jurisdictional groups are combinations of various government entities implementing the Intelligent Technology Initiative. The Intelligent Technology Initiative Act of 2015 defines key terms and eligibility criteria for receiving grants. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Transportation. The Intelligent Technology Initiative Act of 2015 defines key terms and eligibility criteria for receiving grants, with the term \"Secretary\" referring to the Secretary of Transportation. SEC. 3. INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE. The Secretary will establish an Intelligent Technology Initiative to provide grants for large-scale deployment of ITS to improve safety, efficiency, and system performance. Criteria for selecting eligible entities will focus on reducing costs, delivering environmental benefits, and improving operational performance of transportation networks. The Secretary will establish an Intelligent Technology Initiative to provide grants for large-scale deployment of ITS to improve safety, efficiency, and system performance, including reducing traffic collisions, increasing safety, collecting real-time transportation information, monitoring assets for infrastructure management, and delivering economic benefits. Requests for applications must be submitted within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will request applications for participation in the Intelligent Technology Initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will request applications for participation in the Intelligent Technology Initiative within 6 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM. To apply for a grant under this Act, eligible entities must submit a deployment plan to the Secretary. The plan should outline the long-term operation and maintenance of intelligent transportation systems to enhance safety, efficiency, system performance, and return on investment. This includes real-time integrated traffic, transit, and multimodal transportation information, advanced traffic and incident management systems, collision avoidance systems, advanced technologies for transit and commercial vehicle operations, and synchronized traffic signals. The deployment plan for intelligent transportation systems should include preferential traffic signals, advanced infrastructure assessment technologies, and other technologies for system operations improvement. Objectives include reducing crashes, congestion, and costs, optimizing efficiency, and improving access to transportation services. Results should show safety, mobility, and environmental benefits projections. Partnerships with the private sector should also be included in the plan. The curr_chunk discusses partnerships with various entities, leveraging existing investments, and ensuring interoperability of technologies in intelligent transportation systems. Grant awards will be given to up to 6 eligible entities with funds available for up to 5 fiscal years, focusing on geographic diversity. The Secretary will award grants for up to 5 fiscal years, ensuring geographic diversity among recipients in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the United States. SEC. 5. USES OF FUNDS. A grant recipient can use funds to deploy, operate, and maintain various ITS and ITS-enabled operational strategies, including advanced traveler information systems, transportation system performance data collection, advanced safety systems, integration with the Smart Grid, electronic pricing systems, and advanced mobility technologies. Advanced mobility and access technologies, such as dynamic ridesharing and information systems, are supported to assist elderly and disabled Americans. SEC. 6. REPORTS. Each grant recipient must submit a report to the Secretary annually, detailing deployment and operational costs, benefits, savings, and meeting original expectations. This includes data on reducing traffic crashes, congestion, costs, improving transportation system performance, and the effectiveness of real-time information. The Secretary shall submit a report to Congress describing the effectiveness of grant recipients in meeting their deployment plan, including data on reducing traffic fatalities, congestion, emissions, and improving travel time reliability. The Secretary may provide grants to improve transportation reliability, reduce emissions, optimize system performance, and enhance access to transportation alternatives. Recipients failing to meet grant requirements may lose funding, with remaining funds redistributed to other eligible entities. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Funding of $200,000,000 is authorized annually from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2015 to 2020. The funds can be used without transferability restrictions and remain available until expended. Additionally, the Secretary is limited to awarding no more than 25 grants. The Secretary may not award more than 25% of the appropriated amount to a single grant recipient. Grant recipients can use up to 5% of the grant award for planning and reporting. The Secretary can allocate $3,000,000 each fiscal year for program reporting, evaluation, and administrative costs before awarding grant funds."
