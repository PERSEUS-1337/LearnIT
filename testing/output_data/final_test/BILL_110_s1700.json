    "content": "The International Nuclear Fuel for Peace and Nonproliferation Act of 2007 establishes an international regime for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful means. It includes findings, a sense of Congress, statements of policy, and a report. Additionally, it authorizes voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency and appropriations for an International Nuclear Fuel Bank. Congress finds that limiting the number of countries with nuclear weapons is crucial for global security, as more countries possessing such weapons increases the risk of their use and could lead to a global arms race. It is in the interest of all nations, including the United States, to minimize the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities pose a proliferation risk by producing nuclear material for peaceful or weapon purposes. It is crucial to limit the number of countries operating these facilities to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. The construction of uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities in additional countries is often driven by factors other than economic considerations, such as national pride and technological advancement. This poses a proliferation risk by increasing the number of countries with access to nuclear material, potentially leading to nuclear weapons proliferation. The acquisition of uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities by developing countries demonstrates independence from technological domination. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty allows peaceful nuclear energy development but prohibits the acquisition of nuclear weapons. The proliferation of national uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities increases the risk of new nuclear weapon states. To address this issue, there is a need for multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply, sharing of peaceful nuclear energy applications, an international fuel bank for supply disruptions, and possibly multilateral participation in enrichment and reprocessing facilities to reduce incentives for countries to develop their own. The revelations of a nuclear black-market in uranium enrichment technology have rekindled the debate on developing national facilities. Iran justifies its uranium enrichment capability as a response to unreliable international supply of nuclear fuel. Multiple initiatives have been proposed to address these concerns, including the US proposal. The United States has proposed the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and joined other countries in proposing a Multilateral Mechanism for Reliable Access to Nuclear Fuel to address concerns about nuclear fuel supply and nonproliferation. The creation of a multi-tiered system to assure the supply of nuclear reactor fuel at current market prices, under appropriate safeguards and conditions, is proposed by the Russian Federation as part of a Global Nuclear Power Infrastructure initiative. The Russian Federation proposes a multi-tiered system to ensure a stable supply of nuclear reactor fuel at market prices, with the condition that countries forgo uranium enrichment and spent-fuel reprocessing facilities to promote nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS. The Sense of Congress supports the expansion of a multilateral mechanism for reliable access to nuclear fuel, the international management of Russian uranium enrichment facilities, and the funding of an international nuclear fuel bank by the Nuclear Threat Institute. The Sense of Congress supports expanding a multilateral mechanism for reliable access to nuclear fuel, managing Russian uranium enrichment facilities internationally, and funding an international nuclear fuel bank by the Nuclear Threat Institute. Member states of the IAEA should collectively pledge at least $100,000,000 in matching funds to fulfill the NTI proposal. Governments, organizations, and experts should identify additional incentives for an international regime for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes at current market prices. This includes participation in non-weapons-relevant technology development and fuel leasing to discourage countries from developing national uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities. SEC. 103. STATEMENTS OF POLICY. The policy of the United States is to support an international regime for the assured supply of nuclear fuel for peaceful purposes under multilateral authority. Additionally, the US opposes non-nuclear weapon states developing nuclear weapons and encourages NPT states to interpret the right to develop nuclear energy as conditioned by the NPT's goal of preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. The United States supports an international regime for nuclear fuel supply and opposes non-nuclear weapon states developing nuclear weapons. It encourages NPT states to interpret the right to develop nuclear energy in line with preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. Additionally, measures are proposed to strengthen the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines for coordinated responses to violations, including termination of nuclear transfers. The President must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on US efforts to support an international nuclear fuel regime. The report will assess the feasibility of establishing an international fuel services center in the US. Additionally, voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency are encouraged. The President is authorized to make voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for an international nuclear fuel bank to provide low-enriched uranium in case of supply disruptions. Contributions require certification of pledged amounts by the IAEA. The international nuclear fuel bank will be established in a non-nuclear weapon state under IAEA oversight, provided the state meets certain criteria including full scope safeguards agreements and compliance with IAEA regulations. The non-nuclear weapon state must meet specific criteria, including full scope safeguards agreements and effective export controls, to establish an international nuclear fuel bank under IAEA oversight. The Secretary of State must not have determined that the state supports international terrorism for the establishment to proceed. The international nuclear fuel bank will provide nuclear reactor fuel to a country only if it is in full compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement and has an additional protocol for safeguards in force. If a country has been determined to be in noncompliance in the past, the IAEA Board of Governors must confirm that necessary actions have been taken to address concerns. The country must comply with its IAEA safeguards agreement, have effective export controls, no uranium enrichment or spent-fuel reprocessing facilities, and not be a state sponsor of terrorism to receive nuclear reactor fuel from the international nuclear fuel bank. The international nuclear fuel bank will provide nuclear reactor fuel to countries at market prices, with a waiver option for national security interests. The report to the House of Representatives and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations contains the basis of the determination. This section does not authorize voluntary contributions to support subsidization of nuclear reactor fuel prices. SEC. 202 authorizes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 for section 201, with funds available until September 30, 2010."
