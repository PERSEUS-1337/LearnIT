Congress finds that illegal drugs and alcohol contribute to thousands of deaths annually, spread communicable diseases like AIDS and Hepatitis C, and lead to social issues such as child abuse and domestic violence. There are approximately 19.5 million current drug users in the US, with 4 million being addicts, and 14.8 million Americans abusing alcohol. Additionally, there are nearly 27 million children of alcoholics in the US, with almost 11 million being under 18 years old. Health professionals play a crucial role in reducing or preventing alcohol and drug abuse. Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease with no cure, but treatments can effectively control it. Treatment for addiction is as successful as treatment for other chronic diseases. Drug treatment is cost-effective compared to incarceration. The economic costs of substance abuse and addiction are significant, with expenses for maintaining the child welfare system and treating fetal alcohol syndrome reaching billions of dollars. Many healthcare professionals lack training in recognizing and addressing substance abuse, leading to low confidence in diagnosing alcoholism and identifying drug use. Only a small percentage of doctors feel adequately prepared to intervene in substance abuse issues. According to a survey by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, most doctors lack confidence in diagnosing alcoholism and drug addiction, with a high percentage failing to properly recognize the problem. Less than 1 percent of doctors can diagnose alcoholism in older women correctly, often misdiagnosing it as depression. Training can significantly improve the screening of patients for substance abuse by medical professionals. A seminar conducted by Boston University Medical School showed that 91 percent of participants continued to use the techniques learned up to 5 years later. The economic costs of untreated addiction are substantial. The economic costs of untreated addiction are estimated to be $274.8 billion. Providing health care professionals with the tools to intervene and prevent substance abuse can lead to significant cost savings. A study at the University of Wisconsin found a $947 net savings per patient in health care, accident, and criminal justice costs for those screened and intervened for alcohol problems. The purpose of this Act is to improve health care professionals' ability to identify and assist patients with substance abuse and refer children and youth affected by substance abuse. The Act aims to train health care professionals to identify and assist patients with substance abuse issues and refer children and youth affected by substance abuse for treatment. SEC. 544 of the Public Health Service Act amends Part D of title V to include substance abuse education for generalist health professionals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is responsible for training generalist health professionals in recognizing and addressing substance abuse, assisting children of substance-abusing parents, supporting community-based prevention programs, and addressing non-therapeutic use of prescription medications.
