Calls for revisions in visa policy and changes in immigration law administration have been made to prevent further attacks. The Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice each have roles in administering laws on admitting aliens. DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs issues visas for foreign nationals wishing to enter the US. The Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Justice have roles in administering laws on admitting aliens. DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs issues visas for foreign nationals entering the US, while DHS's USCIS approves immigrant petitions and CBP inspects all people entering the country. DOJ's EOIR plays a significant policy role in immigration cases. This report discusses visa policy, options considered before the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and current visa administration procedures for aliens entering the US permanently or temporarily. The report discusses visa policy, legislative history, and current division of responsibilities between DHS and DOS for aliens entering the US. It outlines two classes of aliens issued visas: immigrants and nonimmigrants, with humanitarian admissions handled separately under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Illegal aliens include those who entered the US without inspection. Aliens entering the United States must meet specific criteria to live permanently, such as being a spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, a legal permanent resident, an employee with approval from the Department of Labor, or meeting other specialized provisions of law. Petitions for immigrant status are filed with USCIS by sponsoring relatives or employers. The USCIS handles the process of adjustment of status for prospective LPRs in the United States. If the LPR does not have legal residence in the US, the petition is sent to Consular Affairs in their home country. LPRs can adjust status from within the US instead of receiving visas abroad. Nonimmigrants are aliens admitted to the US temporarily for a specific reason. Nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States for a temporary period of time and an expressed reason. There are 24 major nonimmigrant visa categories, with 70 specific types currently issued. Nonimmigrant visas may be valid for several years and permit multiple entries, with about 6 million visas issued annually by the Department of State. Nonimmigrant visas are valid for several years and allow multiple entries. USCIS reported 33.7 million nonimmigrant entries in FY2000 and 27.9 million in FY2002. Most visitors enter the U.S. through the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which waives visa requirements for visitors from 27 countries. USCIS reported 17 million nonimmigrants entered through VWP in FY2001 and 13 million in FY2002. CBP inspectors at the port of entry conduct background checks for VWP aliens. All aliens undergo reviews by DOS consular officers and CBP inspectors upon entry to the U.S. Consular officers and CBP inspectors review visa applicants and entrants to the U.S. for eligibility based on various grounds such as health, criminal history, security concerns, and immigration violations. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) stores over 75 million visa application records, including photos and fingerprints of applicants since 2001. The system used by consular officers links with databases like CLASS, TIPOFF, and TEL to flag visa issuance problems. Suspect names are sent to the FBI for a name check program called Visa Condor. Consular officers also screen visa applicants for employment or study. Consular officers screen visa applicants for employment or study, including Visa Mantis for controlled technologies. Visa applicants must have affidavits of support to show they won't become public charges. Visa processing fees are largely covered by applicants, with immigrant fees at $335 and nonimmigrant fees at $100. The 107th Congress authorized Machine-Readable Visa (MRV) fees at $65, with a $10 surcharge for nonmachine-readable passports. These fees offset costs for consular services, with funding shifting from direct appropriations to MRV fees starting in FY2003. The budget for visa activities in the Bureau of Consular Affairs increased from $589 million in FY2003 to $789 million in FY2004, funded by various fee accounts. The Bureau of Consular Affairs receives funding from various fee accounts, not all of which are used for visa activities. The 107th Congress debated whether visa issuance functions should be in the Department of Homeland Security. The Administration's proposal aimed to consolidate homeland security functions into a new department, including the INS. The Administration proposed consolidating homeland security functions into a new department, including the INS. There was debate over whether visa issuance responsibilities should be moved to the proposed DHS, with concerns raised about lax screening of foreign nationals wanting to enter the United States. Reports of the \"Visa Express\" program in Saudi Arabia raised further concerns. Critics raised concerns about allowing travel agents to pre-screen nonimmigrants, citing the \"Visa Express\" program used by September 11 terrorists. They argued that visa issuance is crucial for homeland security and should be under a department solely focused on border security. Proponents of keeping visa issuances in Consular Affairs were also mentioned. Proponents of retaining visa issuances in Consular Affairs argue that consular officers have country-specific knowledge to make admissibility decisions, and transferring this responsibility to homeland security could lead to judicial appeals. They also highlight the importance of MRV fees as a funding stream and mention that issues in visa issuances have been addressed by strengthening provisions in relevant acts. Supporters of keeping immigrant adjudications in DOJ and visa issuances in DOS argue that the specialized expertise of each department enhances security through a \"dual check\" system. They believe that failures in intelligence gathering, not lax immigration enforcement, enabled terrorists to obtain visas. Opponents of transferring these responsibilities to DHS fear a potential imbalance in immigration law enforcement. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, introduced by Representative Dick Armey, aimed to balance immigration policies (such as admitting skilled immigrants and protecting refugees) with national security and public safety concerns. The proposed legislation would transfer INS functions to a new department under the Border Security and Transportation Division, with DHS setting visa policies and DOS handling implementation. House Committees approved language retaining DOS's role in visa issuances. The House Judiciary Committee approved language to transfer INS adjudication responsibilities to a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services under DOJ. The House Select Committee on Homeland Security also approved language on immigrant processing and visa issuances consistent with the House Judiciary Committee recommendations. H.R. 5005 clarified that the Secretary of DHS would issue regulations regarding visa issuances and assign staff to consular posts abroad. The House Judiciary Committee approved language to transfer INS adjudication responsibilities to a new Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services under DOJ. H.R. 5005 clarified that the Secretary of DHS would issue regulations regarding visa issuances and assign staff to consular posts abroad. It would have expanded the exclusion authority of the Secretary of State and clarified that decisions of consular officers are not reviewable. Only one immigration-related amendment was considered during the floor debate on H.R. 5005, which failed to move the consular visa function to DHS. Table 3 summarizes the department responsible for visa issuance activities under different bills. S. 2452 and H.R. 4660 did not transfer immigration adjudications and visa issuance functions. S.Amdt. 4471 differed on these issues from the Administration's proposal and H.R. 5005. The Senate amendment proposed transferring INS to a newly created DHS with two new bureaus. It would give the Secretary of DHS authority to issue visa policy regulations, which could be delegated to the Secretary of State. Additionally, it would establish an Under Secretary for Immigration Affairs in DHS to handle immigration and naturalization functions, as well as immigration enforcement and border functions. H.R. 5710 was a compromise bill to establish the Department of Homeland Security, transferring INS to two new bureaus within DHS. It allowed the Secretary of DHS to issue visa regulations and delegate authority to the Secretary of State. The bill also included provisions for staff to advise, review, and conduct investigations at consular posts abroad. Language similar to H.R. 5710 passed the Senate as S.Amdt. 4901 to H.R. 5005, and was signed by the President. The Homeland Security Act transferred INS to DHS and allowed the Secretary of DHS to issue visa regulations. The Act also included provisions for staff to advise, review, and conduct investigations at consular posts abroad. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to implement the division of responsibilities for visa issuances between DHS and DOS. The MOU between DOS and DHS outlines visa regulations and personnel assignments. The Secretary of State retains responsibility for certain visa decisions, including those of foreign policy nature, visa validity periods, and fees based on reciprocity. Homeland Security will be consulted on visa validity periods and have authority over certain persons or classes. The MOU between DOS and DHS outlines visa regulations and personnel assignments. The Secretary of State retains responsibility for visa decisions related to foreign policy, validity periods, and fees. Homeland Security will have authority over certain persons or classes for security reasons. The Secretary of State will also exercise visa denial grounds, including property confiscation from American citizens without compensation. Control over officers in the chain of command is emphasized, with State Department consular supervisors writing evaluations and providing direction to consular officers. The Homeland Security Act has led to greater responsibilities for immigration components of DHS abroad. Secretary Ridge established the Office of International Enforcement (OIE) to oversee DHS activities under the MOU with DOS. Under Secretary Hutchinson described the creation of OIE, which will manage visa guidance and assignments of DHS personnel to consular posts. OIE, reporting directly to the Secretary, will be led by Acting Director Renee J. Harris and handle various operational duties. Ms. Harris, former head of the Office of Internal Affairs in the former INS, is now committed to developing visa policy and handling operational duties related to the section 428 process for BTS within USCIS. The OIA oversees USCIS's overseas adjudications, including refugee processing, and other international immigration activities such as pre-inspections and investigations. DHS officers in Saudi Arabia review all visa applications prior to adjudication, providing expert advice and assistance as required by P.L. 107-296. DHS officers in Riyadh and Jeddah assist consular officers with training on fraudulent documents and identity fraud. They have access to various law enforcement databases for the review process, including NCIC, TECS, IBIS, NSEERS, SEVIS, IDENT, and APIS. CBP inspects aliens entering the US with a brief interview and document check. The US-VISIT system uses biometric identification to check travelers' identity and track their presence in the United States. Primary inspections are quick, but suspicious travelers are referred to secondary inspections for extensive questioning and document examination. Some believe that the Department of State retains too much power over visa issuances, contrary to the intended lead role of the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act designated DHS as the lead department for visa issuance, with DOS only administering the process. Some argue that consular officers prioritize tourism and trade over thorough vetting of visa applicants. Others support the MOU, stating it strikes a balance between DHS and DOS responsibilities. Proponents of DOS leading visa issuance believe consular officers have the necessary country-specific knowledge for decision-making. The DHS FY2005 budget request includes $14 million for the Office of International Affairs, with $10 million allocated for reviewing the visa issuance process. This budget also seeks $909 million for Consular Relations, an increase of $120 million from FY2004, with a proposed increase of 123 full-time equivalent employees to 4,106 FTEs. Funding for visa activities within the Bureau of Consular Affairs comes from various fees. Funding for visa activities in the Bureau of Consular Affairs comes from various fee accounts, with $185 million from direct appropriations and the rest from fees like Machine-Readable Visa fees, Diversity Lottery fees, FBI fingerprint fees, Affidavits of Support fees, and fees from the Enhanced Border Security Program. The FY2005 budget debate may raise concerns about adequate funding for visa processing and security procedures. The Office of International Affairs has 90 FTEs. Some question the capacity of the Office of International Affairs with 90 FTEs to handle visa security reviews and investigations. Concerns arise over the use of visa-related fees for activities other than visa processing and issuance. Past use of the Immigration Examinations Fee for investigations is also under scrutiny."
