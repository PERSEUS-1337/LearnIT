The term 'facility' refers to wastewater treatment units used by a publicly owned treatment works to meet water quality standards. A publicly owned treatment works is prohibited from performing a bypass unless it is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, injury, or property damage, and there is no feasible alternative. The treatment works can bypass regulations for essential maintenance during equipment downtime if effluent limitations are not exceeded and proper notice is given. However, if backup equipment could have prevented the bypass, the requirement is not met. Immediate notice requirements must be followed in case of a bypass. A publicly owned treatment works must provide immediate notice of any anticipated or unanticipated discharge to specified entities.
