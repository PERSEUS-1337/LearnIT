    "content": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of fluorinated compounds used in various commercial, industrial, and military applications, including fire-fighting foams and nonstick cookware. PFAS are persistent in the environment and can lead to adverse health effects at certain exposure levels. Detection of PFAS contamination in drinking water and the environment has increased due to improved analytical methods and monitoring. PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, have been found in soil, water sources, and public supplies, mainly linked to manufacturing and processing facility releases. Federal actions to address PFAS contamination have been primarily taken under the Toxic Substances Control Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has used these statutes to address potential risks of PFAS, while the Department of Defense and other federal agencies have also utilized CERCLA authorities to respond to PFAS releases. The federal government has taken various actions to address PFAS exposure, including involving the private sector in compliance and implementing voluntary measures. However, there are calls for quicker and broader action, such as issuing enforceable drinking water standards for PFAS and designating all PFAS as hazardous substances. Multiple bills in Congress aim to require agencies to take action or create new authorities regarding PFAS. The House-passed and Senate-passed versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2020 incorporate bills related to PFAS, with H.R. 2500 establishing liability for PFAS response costs and S. 1790 expanding DOD responsibilities for response actions. S. 1790 also directs EPA to issue drinking water standards for PFAS. This report focuses on federal authorities under which EPA and other agencies operate. This report focuses on federal authorities under which EPA and other agencies have taken actions to address potential risks of PFAS, a group of synthesized chemical compounds. EPA identifies over 1,200 PFAS manufactured in the United States, with varying types and quantities produced over time. PFAS are a group of compounds with similar chemical structures, consisting of carbon atoms attached to fluorine atoms. The variations in chain length and number of fluorinated carbon atoms result in potentially thousands of chemical compounds. Manufacturers have focused on producing PFAS with longer chains. Manufacturers have focused on producing PFAS with longer fluorinated carbon chains for various consumer uses like non-stick coatings and water resistance treatments. PFAS may be used as processing aids or constituents in fluoropolymer-based products, leading to varying PFAS content. Fluoropolymers containing specific PFAS types can break down into other PFAS under certain conditions. Some PFAS have been used in products like fire suppressants in Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) for extinguishing fuel fires. PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA were commonly produced before their phase-out. Manufacturers have shifted away from longer chain PFAS due to their potential toxicity and environmental persistence. Concerns persist about the toxicity and persistence of shorter chain PFAS compared to longer chain ones. Stakeholders worry about the disposal of existing stocks of longer chain PFAS, including AFFF stocks, as alternatives are sought. PFAS releases can lead to exposures through various pathways like manufacturing operations and intended uses. Exposures to PFAS can occur through manufacturing, product use, disposal, or accidental spills. Occupational exposures may happen in facilities manufacturing PFAS or using products containing these chemicals. General public exposures depend on environmental release pathways. Risks to human health and the environment vary based on specific PFAS properties and exposure conditions. Exposure to PFAS can vary depending on the characteristics of the chemical, such as structure, toxicity, and persistence. The breakdown rate of a chemical determines how long it remains in the environment or in a human or animal. PFAS can have different levels of persistence and toxicity, affecting the potential health risks associated with exposure. Evaluating the risks of PFAS presents challenges due to their variability in exposure pathways and factors. Regulating all PFAS as a singular category would be difficult in setting a standard concentration level. Studies focus on certain PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, with less research on shorter chain perfluoroalkyls. Studies have focused on the risks of polyfluoroalkyls, particularly in drinking water and contaminated food sources. Uncertainties remain about health effects from various PFAS exposure pathways like dermal contact or inhalation. Guidelines from ATSDR, EPA, and the National Research Council help assess these risks, addressing challenges like data quality and quantity. Federal actions to address potential risks from PFAS have primarily been taken under the authorities of TSCA, SDWA, and CERCLA, focusing on PFOS and PFOA due to their past uses and prevalence in the environment. Congress has also authorized specific federal actions in separate legislation. EPA has taken actions under TSCA to gather and assess information on PFAS risks, requiring manufacturers to submit more data if needed. If risks are deemed \"unreasonable,\" EPA can establish regulatory controls, but no such finding has been made for PFAS yet. Following voluntary industry phase-outs in the US for PFOS, PFOA, and related substances, EPA issued SNURs under TSCA requiring notification before reintroduction. TSCA also mandates notification for new PFAS production. EPA has used TSCA data on PFAS to inform actions under SDWA and CERCLA. Evaluations under SDWA for PFOA and PFOS have been ongoing for over a decade to determine MCL for drinking water. EPA has not made any unreasonable risk findings for PFAS yet. The EPA has identified PFAS as emerging contaminants for potential regulation under SDWA. Health advisories were issued in 2009 and 2016 for short-term and lifetime exposures to PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. These advisories are not enforceable standards, but EPA has emergency powers to address health endangerment from contaminants in drinking water. Orders have been issued at sites where PFAS releases threatened water sources. DOD oversees most federal facilities with PFAS contamination. The EPA has identified PFAS as emerging contaminants for potential regulation under SDWA. DOD administers federal facilities with PFAS contamination and has been responding to releases of PFOA and PFOS from AFFF use. EPA has also responded to releases of PFOA and PFOS under the Superfund program at non-federal sites. In February 2019, EPA issued a PFAS Action Plan to address PFAS under various authorities. The EPA is taking various actions to address PFAS, including establishing MCLs, proposing monitoring under UCMR5, designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances, developing cleanup recommendations, proposing SNURs for new uses, and developing toxicity values. Federal agencies are evaluating human health effects of PFAS exposure. The EPA is evaluating health effects associated with PFAS exposure, including reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and immunological effects in laboratory animals. Studies have shown increased cholesterol levels and potential impacts on infant birth weights, immune system, and cancer in humans. The EPA, CDC, ATSDR, NIEHS, and NTP are researching potential health effects of PFAS exposure, including effects on birth weights, immune system, cancer, and thyroid hormones. EPA has not classified any PFAS as a human carcinogen, but some studies suggest potential risks. Data from these studies may inform regulatory decisions by other agencies. The CDC biomonitoring program collects data on PFAS levels in the general U.S. population. This effort is part of the NHANES survey and includes blood serum levels for PFOA, PFOS, and 14 other PFAS. The data may inform regulatory decisions by federal and state agencies. EPA's actions to evaluate PFAS are discussed in various regulations and environmental remediation efforts. The CDC tracks blood serum levels of perfluoroalkyl substances in the U.S. population, showing a decline from 1999 to 2016. However, finding PFAS in serum does not necessarily indicate adverse health effects, requiring further study. The sample size for this data is small, and more research is needed to determine the potential health impacts of PFAS exposure. The ATSDR has issued multiple draft Toxicological Profiles for perfluoroalkyls over the last decade, including 14 perfluoroalkyls in its third draft in June 2018. These drafts aim to identify potential health effects associated with exposure to certain chemicals within this group of compounds. ATSDR evaluated 14 perfluoroalkyls, focusing on ingestion risks. They established provisional ingestion Minimal Risk Levels for PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA. The proposed MRL values range from 0.000002 to 0.00002 mg/kg/day to quantify intermediate exposure levels. The proposed Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs) for PFNA and PFAS are among the smallest evaluated by ATSDR, indicating greater toxicity. These values, based on conservative assumptions, are estimates of daily human exposure to chemicals not expected to cause adverse non-cancer health effects. MRLs serve as screening levels to identify sites for further evaluation. ATSDR emphasized that MRLs are not meant to set clean-up or action levels and noted limited scientific information on inhalation exposure to perfluoroalkyls. Data was insufficient to establish provisional MRLs for inhalation exposures for 14 perfluoroalkyls. Epidemiological studies on serum PFAS levels and adverse health effects showed inconsistent findings. ATSDR conducted epidemiological and animal studies to assess health effects of PFAS exposure. Site-specific studies were done at over 20 locations in the US, focusing on areas where PFAS were manufactured, used, or disposed. Some studies were carried out at federal facilities like military installations. ATSDR conducted site-specific studies at various locations, including U.S. military installations and privately owned sites, to understand the health risks of PFAS exposure. Congress authorized joint scientific studies by CDC and ATSDR to assess potential health implications from PFAS exposure in water sources. ATSDR announced funding for epidemiological studies at multiple sites in April 2019. The EPA's PFAS Action Plan includes over 1,200 PFAS chemicals out of approximately 85,000 in the inventory. EPA has obtained information on the risks of various PFAS using the authorities of TSCA. EPA reports that over 600 PFAS were produced in the United States between 2006 and 2016. EPA obtained information on PFAS risks to assess if regulation is necessary. Manufacturers voluntarily phased out PFOS and PFOA chemicals. EPA promulgated SNURs for reintroduction of phased-out chemicals. EPA evaluates risks of new chemicals, including PFAS, through Section 5 notifications. Orders may be issued under Section 5(e) to gather more information on new PFAS and impose restrictions until data is provided. Section 6 of TSCA allows EPA to establish regulatory controls at any stage of a chemical's lifecycle. The EPA can establish regulatory controls on chemicals if necessary to mitigate unreasonable risk to health or the environment. Chemical manufacturers may voluntarily phase out production based on risk information. EPA initiated the PFOA Stewardship Program with major manufacturers in 2006. EPA initiated the PFOA Stewardship Program with major manufacturers in 2006 to reduce PFOA and related chemicals by 95% below 2010 levels and phase out their manufacture by 2015. All eight manufacturers met their phaseout goals by 2017. EPA can gather information on chemicals for potential regulation under Section 8 of TSCA, including manufacturing volumes and health studies related to PFAS. EPA can require manufacturers to provide additional information if existing data is insufficient for risk evaluation. EPA authorized testing of fluoropolymers and other PFAS-containing compounds due to insufficient information on environmental effects. Consent orders were issued to industry organizations for testing in 2005. By 2015, EPA determined that the data collected showed unlikely risks. SNURs were promulgated for notification of new PFAS uses, including hexafluoropropylene oxide in 1987. Between 2002 and 2015, EPA issued Significant New Use Rules (SNURs) for various PFAS chemicals, designating certain uses as \"significant new uses\" requiring notification. Section 5(a)(1) of the EPA authorizes the submission of premanufacture notices for new chemicals before production. EPA's PFAS Action Plan includes plans to follow up on the 2015 SNUR for PFOA and related chemicals. In 1984, EPA exempted most polymers from premanufacture notification under Section 5(h)(4) as they were deemed low risk. However, in 2010, EPA required notification for polymers containing perfluoroalkyl constituents due to potential risks. This change allows EPA to assess the need for regulation. If information in a premanufacture notice is insufficient, EPA can issue an order for the manufacturer to provide more data. Specific PFAS have been subject to Section 5(e) orders, such as a consent order issued in 2009. In 2009, EPA issued a Section 5(e) consent order for GenX chemicals, used to make fluoropolymers without PFOA. EPA has assessed risks of PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS multiple times using TSCA data. EPA compared newer studies with existing ones to revise risk understanding, submitting updated assessments in 2005. In 2009, EPA announced plans to consider regulating long-chain PFAS under TSCA Section 6. This would involve developing detailed assessments to support a finding of unreasonable risk, allowing EPA to promulgate a rule to mitigate the risk through various regulatory options. The EPA announced plans in 2009 to regulate long-chain PFAS under TSCA Section 6, requiring clear warnings and instructions for chemical use. If an \"unreasonable risk\" is found, EPA must explore other mitigation options before implementing regulatory controls. No unreasonable risk findings have been made for any PFAS since 2009. EPA has not made unreasonable risk findings for any PFAS. None of the 10 chemicals prioritized for risk evaluation in 2016 are PFAS. Section 5(e) orders have been issued to restrict new PFAS, with requirements for recovery and capture/recycle. EPA has not established Section 6 regulatory controls on PFAS but has used enforcement authorities under TSCA to assess fines and penalties. The EPA has used enforcement authorities under TSCA to assess fines and penalties for violations related to PFAS, including failure to comply with requirements, use of chemicals for commercial purposes that violate regulations, and failure to establish or maintain records. Civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for actions prohibited under TSCA. In 2005, a settlement was announced with DuPont for reporting violations involving PFOA. EPA has taken enforcement actions for violations related to PFAS, including a settlement with DuPont for reporting violations involving PFOA. The settlement required DuPont to pay $10.25 million in civil penalties and perform Supplemental Environmental Projects valued at $6.25 million. EPA also issued a Notice of Violation to Chemours for alleged violations of TSCA involving GenX chemicals. EPA can establish national primary drinking water regulations under SDWA for contaminants in public water systems, with enforceable standards and monitoring requirements. EPA can issue health advisories for contaminants not regulated under SDWA to protect sensitive populations. The EPA has the authority under the SDWA to issue health advisories for contaminants not regulated under the act, including PFAS like PFOA and PFOS. These advisories provide non-enforceable concentrations for contaminants in drinking water to protect sensitive populations. EPA has used its emergency powers to respond to releases of PFAS in public water systems and plans to propose regulatory decisions for PFOA and PFOS in 2019. In May 2016, EPA established Lifetime Health Advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt), separately or combined, with a relative source contribution of 20%. These levels aim to protect sensitive subpopulations, like nursing infants, with a margin of protection over a lifetime of daily exposure. In 2009, EPA issued provisional health advisory levels of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS for short-term exposures from drinking water. EPA has been evaluating whether to establish national primary drinking water regulations for these substances. The evaluation process includes identifying contaminants, assessing health risks, collecting occurrence data, and determining the need for regulatory action. EPA is required to publish a contaminant candidate list every five years, with PFOA and PFOS listed in 2009 on CCL 3. In 2016, EPA published the fourth list, CCL 4, which included PFOA and PFOS for evaluation of health effects and national occurrence data. EPA also issued the third UCMR (UCMR 3) in 2012, where 4,864 public water systems tested for 6 PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS. 1.3% of water systems reported samples exceeding EPA's health advisory level for PFOA and/or PFOS. EPA plans to propose monitoring requirements for additional PFAS in the next UCMR in 2020. Currently, 63 water systems serving 5.5 million individuals have PFOA and/or PFOS levels above the EPA's health advisory level. The agency has developed an analytical method to detect 18 PFAS in drinking water and is working on methods for monitoring more PFAS. EPA must make a regulatory determination every five years for contaminants on the CCL to decide on drinking water regulations. EPA requires key criteria to regulate contaminants in drinking water, including adverse health effects, occurrence in public water systems, and potential for health risk reduction. In 2014, without national occurrence data for PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, EPA could not include them in the regulatory determination. EPA plans to propose monitoring requirements for additional PFAS in the next UCMR in 2020. The EPA plans to propose preliminary regulatory determinations for PFOA and PFOS by the end of 2019 and finalize them by the end of 2020. Several bills in the 116th Congress aim to establish maximum contaminant levels for PFAS in drinking water. EPA must propose a rule within 24 months of determining a contaminant for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA is required to propose a national primary drinking water regulation within 24 months and establish a maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) that ensures no adverse health effects. The MCLG is based solely on health data and is set close to the enforceable limit for contaminants in public water supplies. EPA must consider feasibility when setting the MCL. The EPA is required to propose a national primary drinking water regulation within 24 months, setting the MCL as close to the MCLG as feasible. Regulations include monitoring, treatment, and reporting requirements, with a review every six years for possible revisions. EPA may allow additional time for public water systems to make improvements. States have similar authority for individual water systems. Several bills in the 116th Congress aim to establish national primary drinking water regulations for PFAS, including Senate-passed S. 1790, S. 1507, S. 1473, H.R. 2377, and H.R. 4033. These bills also propose a standard-setting process specifically for PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA has emergency powers to address contaminants in public water systems if state and local authorities fail to act to protect public health. The EPA Administrator has emergency powers under SDWA Section 1431 to protect public health by requiring actions such as providing alternative water supplies or treating contamination. EPA has used this authority in cases of PFOA and/or PFOS contamination, including at DOD sites, to address concentrations above 70 ppt. These emergency orders do not establish liability like CERCLA but aim to abate imminent dangers to public health. The federal role under CERCLA in remediating environmental contamination from PFAS releases focuses on federal facilities and priority Superfund sites. Most PFAS releases from federal facilities are due to AFFF use at military installations. DOD responds to these releases under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program, following CERCLA and SDWA emergency powers. The Defense Environmental Restoration Program, under CERCLA and SDWA emergency powers, addresses PFAS releases at U.S. military installations. NASA has also responded to PFOA and PFOS releases at the Wallops Flight Facility. States typically handle PFAS releases on non-federal lands. CERCLA authorizes the President to respond to hazardous substance releases, including PFAS. The Presidential response authority under the Superfund program allows for removal and remedial actions to address hazardous substance releases, including PFAS. EPA designates sites on the National Priorities List and coordinates with states for response actions. State cost-shares may be required for remedial actions on non-federal lands. Section 104(c) of CERCLA requires states to match a percentage of construction costs for remedial actions on non-federal lands. State cost-shares are not required for more limited \"removal\" actions, which may be fully federally funded. Response actions for releases from federal facilities are exempt from state cost-shares. Federal funding at Superfund sites or federal facilities is subject to annual appropriations. Section 107 of CERCLA establishes liability for response costs, natural resource damages, and ATSDR public health studies. Liability for response costs, natural resource damages, and ATSDR public health studies under CERCLA includes current and former site owners, operators, and those who arranged for hazardous substance treatment or disposal. Exemptions exist for certain parties, such as those who acquired contaminated sites without contributing to the contamination. CERCLA Section 107 authorizes actions to recover response costs for liable parties, while Section 106 allows for enforcement orders to require response actions. Section 122 permits negotiated settlements with the federal government. CERCLA's liability is broader than SDWA, which lacks cost-recovery and settlement authorities. CERCLA allows for federal actions to respond to releases of PFAS as pollutants or contaminants, but does not establish liability for such releases. Liability under CERCLA is limited to designated hazardous substances, not other pollutants. EPA has not designated any PFAS as hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA does not include product liability or personal injury damages, which vary under state tort law. The Tort Claims Act allows claims against the US government for personal injury, death, or property damages caused by federal negligence. The EPA's PFAS Action Plan aims to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. The EPA has the authority to designate hazardous substances, including hazardous wastes, air pollutants, and imminently hazardous chemical substances. The designation of an MCL for PFAS would not trigger a hazardous substance designation under CERCLA. EPA can also designate other chemicals as hazardous substances if they pose a danger to public health or the environment. The EPA has the authority to designate hazardous substances, including PFAS, which pose a substantial danger to public health or the environment. Bills in Congress aim to require EPA to designate all PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, subjecting releases into the environment to liability and reporting requirements. The House-passed bills H.R. 2500, H.R. 3616, and H.R. 2605 aim to designate PFAS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, Clean Water Act, and Clean Air Act. This would require EPA to list PFAS as toxic pollutants and hazardous air pollutants, subjecting them to federal regulation. If PFAS were designated as hazardous substances under CERCLA, potential responsible parties may include federal government entities, civilian airport owners, local fire departments, landfill operators, and chemical manufacturers. CERCLA does not broadly establish product liability for PFAS manufacturers. The application of biosolids containing PFAS is generally not covered by CERCLA, but states can establish liability for PFAS releases under their own laws. Federal facilities not on the NPL may be subject to state laws regarding PFAS liability. States have the opportunity to oversee remedial actions at sites, regardless of NPL status. The EPA can oversee remedial actions at federal facilities on the NPL but cannot enforce state law. EPA responds to PFAS releases using CERCLA authorities for pollutants at non-federal sites. Sites on the Superfund program are contaminated with PFAS and other hazardous substances. EPA's PFAS Action Plan addresses CERCLA response for PFAS. The EPA's PFAS Action Plan includes considering CERCLA response authorities for PFAS contamination and potential emergency powers under SDWA and enforcement authorities under RCRA. PFAS could be classified as solid waste under RCRA if released in a way that constitutes discarding. EPA has not designated any PFAS as hazardous waste, and the toxicity characterization for hazardous waste under RCRA does not currently include PFAS. Additionally, EPA proposed interim groundwater cleanup recommendations for PFOA and PFOS at various contaminated sites on April 25, 2019. The EPA proposed screening levels and preliminary remediation goals for PFAS contamination at various sites, including military installations and federal facilities. The proposed concentration levels for groundwater are 40 ppt as a screening level and 70 ppt as a preliminary remediation goal for sites without existing requirements. These levels align with EPA's Lifetime Health Advisory for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water. If an MCL is established under SDWA, the 70 ppt concentration may be used for remedial actions under CERCLA to protect drinking water sources. The EPA proposed screening levels and preliminary remediation goals for PFAS contamination at various sites, including military installations and federal facilities. DOD has responded to releases of PFAS from AFFF at U.S. military installations under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. DOD's response actions are subject to CERCLA requirements for facilities owned or operated by the federal government. EPA's proposed groundwater cleanup recommendations may be used to evaluate risks at RCRA corrective action sites, although no PFAS have been listed as hazardous waste under RCRA. The Senate-passed S. 1790 would amend program authorities to require DOD to respond to releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants at DOD facilities without enforceable liability under CERCLA. Funding for DOD response actions would still be subject to annual appropriations. National Guard facilities that are state-owned and state-operated have generally been ineligible for funding under the Defense Environmental Restoration Program. The House-passed H.R. 2500 and Senate-passed S. 1790 address the eligibility of DOD funding for responding to PFAS releases at National Guard facilities. DOD actions include providing water supplies and treating contaminated sources. Funding for response actions is subject to annual appropriations across different accounts for various sites. The Defense Base Closure account funds sites closed under BRAC rounds in various years. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 encouraged DOD to establish procedures for remediation of contamination from PFAS at military installations. DOD was directed to assess the impact of contamination on surrounding communities and develop plans for community notification and remediation. The DoD is prioritizing addressing elevated levels of PFOS and PFOA contamination from its activities, ensuring safe drinking water for communities, and taking steps to remove and replace AFFF containing PFOS. They are committed to finding a fluorine-free alternative that meets mission requirements and protects human health and the environment. In March 2018, DOD provided an update on its efforts to respond to PFOA and PFOS releases. The House Committee on Armed Services directed DOD to provide a status update on 401 U.S. military installations with known or suspected releases of PFOA or PFOS. DOD detected these substances in groundwater wells above the EPA Lifetime Health Advisory at 90 installations. Planned actions are identified under the CERCLA site response process, subject to annual appropriations. Stakeholders have expressed concern about the recent detections of PFOA or PFOS in groundwater. Some stakeholders are concerned about environmental contamination from PFAS disposal methods like incineration and landfilling. Incineration can reduce toxicity and volume of wastes but generates air emissions and combustion residuals. Issues include determining necessary temperatures to break down PFAS and ensuring acceptable combustion byproducts. Wastewater discharges and sludge may contain PFAS from industrial facilities and sewage treatment plants. Transitioning to shorter chain PFAS raises concerns about disposing existing stocks of longer chain PFAS and products. Some stakeholders are concerned about the disposal of existing stocks of longer chain PFAS and products containing these chemicals. DOD, federal agencies, civilian airport operators, and local fire departments need to dispose of AFFF as they transition to alternatives. Waste streams from treating PFAS in drinking water and remediating PFAS contamination also require disposal, regulated under federal and state laws. EPA has not set specific standards for PFAS disposal yet, so it is currently regulated similarly to other wastes without contaminant-specific standards. The disposal of PFAS and products containing these chemicals is a concern for stakeholders. Incineration facilities must adhere to solid waste criteria and hazardous air pollutants standards. The Clean Water Act requires permits for the discharge of pollutants into U.S. waters. Legislation may require the Department of Defense to prevent PFAS emissions during incineration. EPA has not established specific standards for PFAS disposal yet. The House provision requires DOD to use incinerators meeting CAA requirements for disposing of AFFF with PFAS. The PFAS Waste Incineration Ban Act of 2019 would prohibit incineration of AFFF with PFAS and require EPA to establish disposal regulations within six months. The House provision mandates DOD to use CAA-compliant incinerators for disposing of AFFF with PFAS. The PFAS Waste Incineration Ban Act of 2019 would prohibit incineration of AFFF with PFAS and require EPA to establish disposal regulations within six months. Additionally, House-passed H.R. 2500 would require EPA to list PFAS as toxic pollutants under the Clean Water Act and establish effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for PFAS by January 1, 2022. DOD has updated its Military Specification for AFFF to transition away from Class B firefighting foams containing PFOA and PFOS. DOD issues Military Specifications for specific products suitable for procurement to meet military needs. The MIL-F-24385 specification on AFFF was initially issued in 1969 and revised over the years. The latest version, MIL-PRF-24385F, addresses PFOA and PFOS levels and other criteria. Reviews of Military Specifications are required every five years, with the next review scheduled for September 6, 2022. The Military Specification MIL-PRF-24385F for AFFF was issued by DOD on September 6, 2022, with restrictions on PFOA and PFOS levels. The specification aims to transition to fluorine-free AFFF in the long term, but a viable solution may take several years to develop. The DoD aims to acquire AFFF with low PFOS and PFOA concentrations in the short term. They are transparent about their efforts and encourage manufacturers to reduce PFAS levels. Research is funded for fluorine-free AFFF, with a report on alternatives issued in June 2018. The report discusses the status of alternatives to AFFF containing PFOA and PFOS, DOD's plans for phase-out and disposal of AFFF stocks with these chemicals, and projects funded under SERDP and ESTCP. Legislation mandates the phase-out of AFFF at military installations and replacement with fluorine-free foams. The FAA uses DOD's AFFF criteria for civilian airport certification. The FAA is required to stop recommending the use of fluorinated AFFF for civilian airport certification by October 5, 2021, as per the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. Currently, fluorine-free foams on the market do not match the performance of fluorinated foams and require more agent to extinguish fires quickly. The FAA is researching potential alternatives to comply with the mandate but noted the challenges in finding a suitable replacement. The FAA must phase out fluorinated AFFF for civilian airport certification by October 5, 2021. Efforts are being made to address health risks of PFAS in foods, with the FDA evaluating potential exposures in dairy products and food contact applications. Regulatory standards for PFAS concentrations in milk and other foods have not been established to date. The FDA has examined various ways in which PFAS can contaminate foods, including through dairy products from livestock consuming contaminated water, meat from livestock in the same situation, food crops grown in contaminated soil or water, fish and shellfish from polluted water bodies, and food contact applications containing PFAS. These pathways of contamination are not unique to PFAS and can lead to human exposure to various contaminants in the environment. The FDA has been assessing PFAS in foods, looking at specific sites with contamination, foods with increased likelihood of contamination, and foods in general. They have regulated PFAS in food contact applications and found low concentrations in sampled foods, concluding that the levels detected do not pose a health concern. The FDA found elevated levels of certain PFAS in dairy milk from livestock that consumed contaminated water in New Mexico. The contaminated milk was discarded and did not enter the food supply. The USDA provided financial assistance to the affected dairy farm, and the ARS examined blood and tissue samples from the contaminated livestock. Cattle from the farm were not eligible for human food processing. The FDA conducts safety assessments for PFAS in foods using current science to evaluate human health concerns. They use EPA's reference dose for PFOA and PFOS, but EPA's lifetime health advisories for drinking water are not intended for other exposure scenarios like food ingestion. EPA does not recommend 70 ppt as a safe concentration of PFOA or PFOS in milk or other foods. The EPA considers risk levels for ingestion of food sources contaminated with PFAS, including fish, meat, and crops irrigated with contaminated water. The agency also takes into account exposure from sources other than drinking water, such as air, food, dust, and consumer products. Multiple bills in Congress address agricultural uses of water contaminated with PFAS. The FY2020 NDAA bills include provisions authorizing the use of DOD funds to address water contamination with PFAS from military activities. This includes funding alternative water sources or treatment for water contaminated with PFOA or PFOS exceeding EPA health advisories. The FY2020 NDAA bills authorize DOD to address water contamination with PFAS from military activities by funding alternative water sources or treatment for water contaminated with PFOA or PFOS exceeding EPA health advisories. Legislation such as H.R. 2566 also aims to revise the \"Safer Choice Standard\" to provide a label for pots, pans, and cooking utensils. H.R. 2827 would amend FFDCA to deem PFAS as unsafe in food contact substances starting January 1, 2022. Section 330B of H.R. 2500 prohibits DOD from procuring MREs with PFAS starting October 1, 2020. Previous Congresses enacted bills for health studies on PFAS and reports on AFFF use in defense legislation. Various laws have addressed PFAS, including legislation for fluorine-free firefighting foams at civilian airports and technical assistance for rural water systems. Funding has been allocated for DOD response actions, health studies, and other federal initiatives. Bills in the 116th Congress aim to require EPA actions on PFAS. In the 116th Congress, over 40 bills have been introduced to address PFAS, with provisions specific to DOD in the House- and Senate-passed NDAA bills. These bills aim to reduce PFAS exposure in drinking water and remediate environmental contamination. Multiple bills require EPA actions on PFAS under existing laws or new authorities."
