Congress finds that a single, open, global Internet is essential for the free flow of information and products across borders. Policies should encourage global technology standards, respect user privacy and security, protect intellectual property rights, and promote innovation without imposing restrictions on Internet service. Certain governments are adopting policies contrary to the goal of a single open, global Internet, including mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers and requiring forfeiture of intellectual property in Internet-related technologies. Certain governments are adopting policies contrary to the goal of a single open, global Internet, including mandating unique technology standards favoring domestic producers and requiring forfeiture of intellectual property in Internet-related technologies. This includes conditions of market access for commercial and civilian uses or government procurement, sponsoring unauthorized access to networks for disruption or intellectual property infringement, restricting Internet communications in a discriminatory manner, and imposing discriminatory market access requirements or liabilities. Actions that discriminate against or impede Internet-related goods, services, and content from other countries threaten the interests of the United States by facilitating foreign governments' attempts to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet, promoting conflicting \"national Internets,\" harming US workers and businesses, and giving foreign competitors an advantage. Actions that discriminate against or impede Internet-related goods, services, and content from other countries threaten the utility of the Internet as a tool of open communication, assembly, and commerce, putting individuals at risk. The Task Force on the Global Internet is established to address actions that hinder international Internet goods and services, jeopardizing open communication and commerce. The Task Force on the Global Internet, established within the executive branch, consists of various government officials including the United States Trade Representative, Secretary of State, Chief Technology Officer, Secretary of Commerce, and others. The President selects a Chairperson from among the Task Force members. The Task Force on the Global Internet, comprised of government officials, can request assistance from other departments and agencies to address foreign government policies that hinder international trade in Internet-related goods and services. The Task Force on the Global Internet aims to address barriers to international trade in Internet-related goods and services by coordinating executive branch departments, preparing strategies, and developing a report and action plan.

Recommendations for modifications or new agreements will be made to advance these objectives.
