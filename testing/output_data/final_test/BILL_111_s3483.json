The \"Motor Carrier Protection Act of 2010\" mandates annual registration renewal fees for freight forwarders and brokers under chapter 139 of title 49, US Code. The fees collected will be used for administering and enforcing registration requirements. The \"Motor Carrier Protection Act of 2010\" requires brokers, freight forwarders, and motor carriers to comply with registration requirements under chapter 139 of title 49, US Code. Noncompliance results in being listed as inactive on Department of Transportation websites. Amendments include the issuance of distinctive registration numbers by the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Administration. The Administrator issues a unique registration number for each registered person's activity or service, indicating the type of service provided (motor carrier, freight forwarder, or broker). Registered persons must specify their operating authority in writing for each compensated shipment. SEC. 3 amends Section 13902 of title 49, United States Code, requiring motor carriers to register and maintain insurance for property damage. A separate registration is needed for motor carriers brokering transportation services. Chapter 139 of title 49, United States Code is amended to require individuals acting as freight forwarders or brokers to hold permits or licenses issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration based on experience and character qualifications. Individuals acting as freight forwarders or brokers must be qualified by experience and character, fit, willing, and able to comply with regulations. Permits or licenses issued shall remain valid as long as compliance with section 13904 is maintained. Freight forwarders must also register separately as motor carriers and meet all requirements. Motor carriers and brokers must meet all requirements under this chapter. A broker must register separately to provide transportation as a motor carrier. Motor carriers can only use their own vehicles for transportation and must obtain a separate permit or license to arrange transportation. Security requirements for freight forwarders and brokers are outlined in section 13904. Security requirements for freight forwarders and brokers, outlined in section 13904, mandate the provision of a bond, trust fund, or other surety to ensure financial responsibility as determined by the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. The Administrator may authorize the use of group bonds or other securities that meet specified standards. Bonds issued under this section must meet the standards set by the Administrator and can only be offered by an approved bonding company. The bond, trust fund, or surety obtained under this section is used to pay claims against a freight forwarder or broker for failure to pay freight charges. The surety company reviews and validates claims if the forwarder or broker does not respond to notice or if the claimant has made a reasonable attempt to resolve the issue. The Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration may not register a person as a freight forwarder unless they file a bond, insurance policy, or security to cover liabilities for bodily injury, death, or property damage. This security must meet the standards set by the Administrator and is used to pay claims if the issue is not resolved within a reasonable period of time. The Administrator may require a registered freight forwarder to have cargo insurance to cover loss or damage to property during their services. This insurance must be approved by the Secretary and will pay up to the amount of the security provided. After the Motor Carrier Protection Act of 2010, freight forwarders and brokers must obtain new licenses and permits from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. These licenses expire after 5 years and can be renewed. Officers must have 3 years of experience or certified training. Information on permits, licenses, and financial security is available online. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requires freight forwarders and brokers to provide minimum financial security of $100,000 and specific performance standards for bonds or surety. Information on permits, licenses, and financial security is publicly available online, including names and addresses of principals and surety submission details. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration mandates freight forwarders and brokers to maintain a minimum financial security of $100,000 through bonds or surety. Surety must consist of easily accessible assets to cover claims, and the surety is financially liable for any payment failures. If a surety is canceled, electronic notification must be sent to the Administrator 30 days prior, and the Administrator must post the cancellation on their website immediately. The Administrator will suspend the registration of a freight forwarder or broker if their available security falls below the required amount. In case of financial failure, the surety must cancel, advertise for claims, and pay uncontested claims within 30 days after the 60-day submission period. Sureties must pay uncontested claims promptly or share pro rata if total claims exceed available security. They must list paid claims on their website and submit a copy to the Administrator. Failure to comply results in liability to the United States. Any surety that violates posting and notification requirements shall be liable for all valid claims against the broker or forwarder, regardless of security amount. Attorney's fees or administrative costs cannot reduce required financial security. The curr_chunk discusses the annual audit of claim payments by sureties and the issuance of regulations by the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to enforce requirements under section 13904(d) of title 49, United States Code. Additionally, it specifies the effective date of these regulations and includes clerical amendments to the table of sections for chapter 139 of title 49, United States Code. The amendment to title 49, United States Code, involves striking the item related to section 13903 and inserting new information.
