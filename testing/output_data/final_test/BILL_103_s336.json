    "content": "Mining claims on Stock Raising Homestead Act lands. The Stock Raising Homestead Act of 1916 is amended to require surface owners to be notified before anyone can explore or locate mining claims on the lands covered by the Act. During the authorized exploration period, individuals can enter lands subject to the Act for mineral activities with minimal surface disturbance and without using certain equipment or materials. The exploration period starts 30 days after notice is given and ends after 90 days or any extensions provided. Any person seeking to locate a mining claim on lands subject to this Act for mineral exploration activities must file a notice of intention with the Secretary of the Interior. The notice should include the person's contact information and a legal description of the lands. The Secretary can record a notice on land status records. Within 90 days of filing a notice, no other person can file a notice, explore for minerals, or acquire an interest in the land. Within 90 days of filing a notice under U.S.C. 1719, no other person can explore for minerals or acquire an interest in the land. If a plan of operations is filed within this period, it will be extended until approved or disapproved by the Secretary. The person filing a notice must provide written notice to the surface owner at least 30 days before entering the land, including a brief description of the proposed mineral activities. The proposed mineral activities must include a description, map, legal details, and contact information of the person managing the activities. Dates of the activities must be stated. Acreage limitations apply, with a maximum of 6,400 acres per person and affiliates in a state, and 1,280 acres for a single surface owner. The term 'affiliate' refers to any person that controls or is controlled by another person. After the effective date of this subsection, no person may engage in mineral activities on a mining claim without written consent from the surface owner or authorization from the Secretary. The Secretary can authorize mineral activities without consent if the person meets certain requirements. Before conducting mineral activities, a person must comply with subsections (e) and (f) by posting a bond or financial guarantee to ensure reclamation completion. The bond must cover compensation for damages to crops, tangible improvements, and loss of income for the surface owner resulting from the activities. Before conducting mineral activities, a person must comply with subsections (e) and (f) by posting a bond or financial guarantee to ensure reclamation completion. The bond must cover compensation for damages to crops, tangible improvements, and loss of income for the surface owner resulting from the activities. The plan of operations required by the Secretary includes procedures for minimizing damages to crops and tangible improvements, as well as disruptions to grazing or other land uses by the surface owner. The bond amount for permanent loss of income considers the potential loss of value due to the estimated permanent reduction in land utilization. The Secretary must provide the surface owner with a proposed plan of operations at least 45 days before making a determination. The surface owner can submit comments and recommendations during this period. Within 60 days of receiving the plan, the Secretary must approve it if it meets the requirements of the Act, including completeness and accuracy. The Secretary must notify the person submitting a plan of any modifications required for compliance with the Act. If agreement on modifications cannot be reached, the plan will be disapproved. The 60-day period for review may be extended. The Secretary may extend the 60-day review period if needed. A plan of operation can be suspended or revoked for noncompliance. Final approval is contingent on meeting specific requirements. A fee must be paid to the surface owner before mineral activities begin. The fee for mineral activities must be paid in advance or as agreed upon, taking into account acreage and potential disruption to existing surface uses. Reclaimed lands should be restored to their original capabilities. Reclamation of lands must proceed concurrently with mineral activities. State laws regarding reclamation, bonding, and environmental standards apply to mineral activities. Surface owners can request inspections for potential adverse effects from violations. Surface owners affected by mineral activities can request inspections for violations of approved plans. The Secretary must respond within 10 days, or immediately if imminent danger is alleged. The surface owner can accompany the inspector. Damages for non-compliance include compensation for permanent damages to crops or improvements. The surface owner may bring an action in court for damages resulting from unauthorized mineral activities or noncompliance with approved plans, potentially receiving double damages for willful misconduct or gross negligence. The surface owner can take legal action in court for damages caused by unauthorized mineral activities, potentially receiving double damages for willful misconduct or gross negligence. Additionally, the surface owner may petition the Secretary for compensation from a bond or financial guarantee for permanent damages to crops, tangible improvements, or loss of income due to land use impairment. The Secretary may use a bond or guarantee to compensate surface owners for damages from land use impairment. The bond will be released upon successful completion of reclamation requirements. The Secretary will simplify procedures for surface owners to obtain title to lands owned by the United States. The term 'mineral activities' includes exploration, mining, and beneficiation activities for locatable minerals on a mining claim. Exploration involves locating and assessing mineral deposits, mining is the extraction process, and beneficiation involves processing ore to separate minerals from other constituents. The term 'tangible improvements' in mining claims encompass agricultural, residential, and commercial enhancements, including those made by residential subdividers. These provisions apply to minerals not covered by the Mineral Leasing Act or the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and the Materials Act of 1947 are referenced in the amendments. Section 9 of the Act of December 29, 1916 is amended for technical conformity. The effective date for the amendments is 180 days after enactment, with regulations to be issued by the Secretary of the Interior by that date."
