    "content": "Title III of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is amended to include a new section providing rent and mortgage relief for Reserve Components members ordered to active duty. Title III of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act is amended to provide rent and mortgage relief for Reserve Component members ordered to active duty. Members are not required to pay rent for their primary residence during military service if assigned to duty at a distant location. During military service, Reserve Component members are not required to make mortgage payments on their primary residence if it is owned by them and secured by a mortgage. Any missed payments are deferred and added to the end of the mortgage term. The term 'mortgage' includes trust deeds or similar securities. Section 309 of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act provides rent and mortgage relief for obligations due after the enactment of the Act. A new tax credit is introduced for lessors offering rent relief to Reserve Component members on active duty. The new tax credit allows lessors to claim a credit against their tax for providing reserve component rent relief. The credit is limited based on the previous year's rent amount for the property. The reserve component rent relief credit allows lessors to claim a credit against their tax for rent not received on leases held due to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. No double benefit is allowed, and regulations will be issued by the Secretary to implement this section. Technical amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is updated. Sec. 36 provides a credit for lessors offering rent relief to reserve components members on active duty. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
