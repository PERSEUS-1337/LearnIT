    "content": "Some European countries are heavily dependent on Russian energy, raising concerns about Russia's influence on neighboring countries like Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia. The United States aims to protect the sovereignty of these vulnerable nations and maintain strong ties with NATO and EU member states. In 2008, the European Union relied on Russia for 23% of its natural gas consumption, with some countries in central and eastern Europe being particularly reliant on Russian energy. Many European countries, especially in central and eastern Europe, heavily rely on Russia for oil and natural gas. The Baltic states are entirely dependent on Russian natural gas, while non-EU countries bordering Russia also rely overwhelmingly on Russian energy. EU countries may increase their dependence on Russian natural gas as North Sea deposits decline. In 2008, 40% of the EU's natural gas imports and 33% of its oil imports came from Russia. The report discusses Russian efforts to control energy infrastructure in the region and reduce energy subsidies to neighboring countries. Former Soviet Union countries are heavily reliant on Russian energy imports. Many European countries, especially in central and eastern Europe, heavily rely on Russia for oil and natural gas. The Baltic states are entirely dependent on Russian natural gas, while non-EU countries bordering Russia also rely overwhelmingly on Russian energy. EU countries may increase their dependence on Russian natural gas as North Sea deposits decline. In 2008, 40% of the EU's natural gas imports and 33% of its oil imports came from Russia. Russian oil and natural gas industries are significant players in the global energy market, particularly in Europe and Eurasia. Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world and is eighth in the world in oil reserves. The concentration of these industries in the hands of the Russian government has been accompanied by an authoritarian political system under President Vladimir Putin. President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, dominates the leadership of Russian oil and gas firms and the government. First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev was designated as Putin's successor in 2007 and became president in 2008. Putin then became Prime Minister. The personal and political fortunes of Russia's leaders are tied to energy firms due to the country's economic reliance on energy exports. Many experts believe that Russia's state-oriented approach to energy exports may be counterproductive in the long run as output growth stagnates. Foreign investment, efficient management, and less government regulation are needed for the oil and gas industries. The global economic crisis has impacted Russia's energy firms and economy, with Gazprom being the largest state-controlled natural gas monopoly in Russia. Gazprom, the largest state-controlled natural gas monopoly in Russia, plays a significant role in the country's economy by contributing 25% of tax receipts and controlling various sectors like banks, industrial holdings, and media outlets. It provides gas at a loss to domestic consumers to ease social pressures, while maintaining a virtual monopoly on exports to wealthier customers abroad. Experts suggest that Gazprom needs to raise domestic gas prices to become a viable business, with Russia agreeing to gradually increase prices by 2011 in response to EU criticisms. Gazprom, Russia's largest state-controlled natural gas monopoly, faces challenges with declining gas fields and aging infrastructure. Foreign investment could help, but Gazprom's actions suggest more state control. In 2005, Russia allowed foreigners to own Gazprom shares, but foreign ownership remains low. In 2006, Gazprom acquired foreign companies' interests in a gas field project at a low price, indicating a trend towards state control. In the Sakhalin-2 gas field project, Russia pressured Shell to sell at a low price due to alleged environmental issues. The Russian government also pushed TNK-BP to hand over the Kovytka gas field cheaply to Gazprom. The arrest of Yukos' head in 2003 marked a shift towards state control in the Russian oil industry. In 2004, Yukos declared bankrupt and its oil field assets were bought cheaply by Rosneft. Gazprom also acquired Sibneft from Roman Abramovich in 2005, now called Gazprom Neft, increasing state control over oil production. Despite Putin's statement in 2006, the Russian government pressures foreign oil companies to sell stakes to state firms, while non-state firms like Lukoil maintain close ties with political leaders to retain control. Russian oil firms seek ties with foreign companies for minority ownership stake despite state control. Government controls oil production and pipelines through Transneft, giving leverage. Transneft is largest shareholder in CPC pipeline, giving Russia monopoly on Kazakh oil transport. ExxonMobil and Chevron involved in Kazakh oil fields. Moscow pressures foreign companies to sell stakes to state firms. Moscow pressures Western oil companies with financial demands and legal threats over alleged unpaid taxes. Russia aims to control key energy assets in European countries to secure energy supplies to Western markets and dominate regional markets. Russian firms have cut off energy supplies to facilities sold to non-Russian firms and provoked unease in the EU by attempting to buy energy infrastructure in Western European countries. EU urges Russia to open pipelines to Western firms and provide stronger protections for foreign investment in Russia's energy sector. Russia rejected EU demands to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and EU's proposal for an energy policy called \"unbundling.\" Russian officials have suggested that foreign companies participating in energy projects in Russia may need to give ownership stakes to Russian firms in downstream assets. EU countries are concerned about Russian efforts to control energy assets in Europe. The EU is concerned about Russian efforts to control energy assets in Europe, including coordinating export policy with other gas-producing countries. Russia has hinted at redirecting energy exports to Asia or the US in the future. There is a divide within the EU on how to approach energy dependence on Russia, with some countries pushing for a stronger stance while others have close ties with Moscow for access to energy supplies. Russia's dependence on oil and gas exports for export revenues and state budget is highlighted. The current gas pipeline system limits Russia's options for selling gas to Europe. Russia is expanding the Baltic Pipeline system and reducing reliance on oil terminals in Baltic states. Russia is expanding its oil and gas pipeline projects, including the North European Gas Pipeline (NEGP) and the South Stream gas pipeline. The NEGP will transport natural gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, while the South Stream will run from Russia under the Black Sea through the Balkans to Austria and Italy. These projects aim to bypass central and eastern European states and increase Russia's gas export capacity. Russia is considering multiple pipeline projects to expand its gas export capacity, including South Stream and Yamal-Europe 2. South Stream aims to bypass central and eastern European countries, with plans to increase capacity to 63 bcm per year. Yamal-Europe 2, running through Belarus and Poland, is unlikely to be built due to disagreements with Russia. By exploring various transit routes, Russia may reduce the leverage of transit countries in negotiations with energy firms. Russia aims to produce oil and gas to fill pipelines, prioritizing transit countries. They seek to deter alternative routes from Azerbaijan and Central Asia to Europe and Asia. Russia also aims to end energy subsidies to former Soviet republics by raising natural gas prices. Leveraging unpaid debts, Russia secures key energy infrastructure in the region. The actions of Russian energy firms may not always align with foreign policy objectives. Russian leaders justify the elimination of energy subsidies to post-Soviet countries as a sound business decision, citing similar price hikes in Russian allies like Armenia and Belarus. The pursuit of multiple pipelines is debated, with some analysts suggesting investing in production over pipeline construction. Concerns in central and eastern Europe arise over Russia's potential use of energy dependency for political interference. Gazprom's energy price increases to Georgia and Ukraine followed elections. After elections in 2004 brought pro-Western leaders to power in Georgia and Ukraine, Gazprom increased energy prices. Russian leaders feared \"color revolutions\" in former Soviet countries that could reduce their influence. Controlling energy infrastructure allows Russia to manipulate the political situation by favoring local businessmen with ties to Gazprom. Critics argue Moscow's motives are clearer in the context of other actions. Moscow's motives are evident in its actions to pressure neighboring states, such as imposing bans on wine imports and supporting breakaway regions. The 2008 military assault on Georgia and cyberattacks on Estonia demonstrate the costs of angering Russia. Critics also point to Russia's \"National Security Strategy to 2020\" as further evidence of its aggressive tactics. Russia's energy policy is a key factor in its foreign policy strategy, as outlined in the \"National Security Strategy to 2020.\" Gazprom's acquisition of Serbia's national oil company at a discounted price in 2008 exemplifies how Moscow leverages foreign policy issues for the benefit of its energy firms. The countries discussed in the report are heavily reliant on Russia for their natural gas and oil resources. The countries discussed in the report are heavily dependent on Russia for their natural gas and oil imports, facing issues of cost, supply reliability, and Russian control over downstream infrastructure. Each country has different geopolitical orientations, with some seeking EU and NATO membership. Ukraine relies on Russia for most of its oil and gas, including supplies from Central Asia. In 2006, Ukraine heavily relied on natural gas imports from Russia, with 66% of its domestic consumption coming from Russia. Russian oil imports accounted for 78% of Ukraine's oil consumption. Ukraine's energy consumption was largely fueled by natural gas, with most homes heated by this source. Despite its inefficient energy usage in heavy industries, Ukraine's vulnerability to Russian pressure was somewhat mitigated by its control over key gas pipelines to Europe, with a capacity of 120 billion cubic meters per year. Ukraine received transit fees from Gazprom for the use of its pipelines. Energy issues have been a key factor in Russian-Ukrainian relations since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russian firms supplied energy to Ukraine at discounted rates, leading to unpaid debts and supply cutoffs in the early 1990s. Both countries' elites profited from non-transparent energy sales. Ukraine has tried to balance ties with the West and Moscow since independence. After the \"Orange Revolution\" in Ukraine, President Yushchenko aimed for serious reforms to join NATO and the EU. Russia, supporting his opponent, reacted angrily to his victory. Gazprom demanded a gas price increase, leading to a supply cutoff in 2006. Ukraine diverted gas meant for Europe, causing protests. Gas deliveries resumed after an agreement was reached between Russia, Gazprom, and Ukraine. The agreement between Gazprom and Ukraine involved gas supplies, purchases through RosUkrEnergo, higher transit fees, and the creation of UkrGazEnergo. Concerns were raised about possible organized crime involvement in RosUkrEnergo. Analysts are concerned about possible organized crime involvement in RosUkrEnergo, with links to corrupt Russian and Ukrainian officials. Gazprom owns 50%, Ukrainian businessman Dimitry Firtash owns 45%, and another businessman owns 5%. In 2005, Ukranian Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko called for the elimination of RosUkrEnergo as a middleman. Yanukovych's party won Ukraine's March 2006 parliamentary elections, leading to smoother discussions with Gazprom in late 2006. In 2006, discussions between Russia and Ukraine went smoothly. In 2007, they agreed on a gradual increase in natural gas prices over five years. Observers believe Russia used gas as leverage against Ukraine's leadership. In September 2007, Putin hinted at manipulating energy prices for political reasons. After Ukraine's parliamentary elections, Gazprom threatened to reduce gas supplies if debts were not paid. In 2007, Gazprom hinted at Ukraine turning over shares in the gas pipeline system to solve energy debts. The crisis was resolved when Ukraine agreed to provide gas from storage facilities as payment. Yuliya Tymoshenko became Prime Minister in December 2007 and vowed to remove certain companies from Ukraine's gas market. Gazprom reduced gas supplies to Ukraine in 2008 over a disagreement on gas prices. In March 2008, gas company officials warned of diverting gas to offset Gazprom's supply cut to Western Europe. An agreement was reached on March 5 to restore supplies. On March 12, UkrGazEnergo was eliminated from domestic gas trade, giving Gazprom direct access to Ukraine's lucrative market. Tymoshenko aimed to remove RosUkrEnergo soon. The Ukrainian government made unilateral changes, barring RosUkrEnergo from re-exporting gas. Gazprom halted gas supplies to Ukraine on January 1, 2009, due to failed negotiations. Russia halted gas supplies to Ukraine after failed negotiations over debt and pricing for 2009. Initially, only Ukraine was affected, but Russia accused Ukraine of diverting gas meant for Europe. By January 6, all deliveries through Ukraine to Europe were cut off. The EU criticized the cutoff but did not take sides. Some European countries were not severely impacted due to gas reserves, but others, especially in the Balkans, suffered. Negotiations between Russia and Ukraine broke down, leading to a gas supply halt to Europe. An agreement was reached on January 18, eliminating RosUkrEnergo as a middleman. Ukraine faced a price increase in the first quarter of 2009 but used stored supplies until prices dropped in the second quarter. Naftogaz's financial struggles and the global economic crisis threatened further gas crises. Gazprom warned of cutting off supplies if not fully paid. In 2009, Ukraine avoided a gas crisis by finding the money to make payments to Gazprom. Russia and Ukraine reached a revised gas deal in November 2009, with Russia pledging not to impose fines on Ukraine for gas shortages. Russia has sought ownership of Ukraine's gas infrastructure, but a proposed joint control agreement in 2007 was met with strong opposition in Ukraine. In 2009, the EU Commission facilitated an agreement for loans from the EBRD and World Bank to help Ukraine upgrade its gas pipeline system. The loans aimed to improve natural gas storage facilities and infrastructure, with potential future loans for sector reform. Prime Minister Putin criticized the EU-Ukraine gas sector agreement in March 2009. Ukraine's gas infrastructure ownership has been a point of contention with Russia. Minister Putin criticized the EU-Ukraine gas sector agreement as \"ill-considered and unprofessional,\" expressing Russia's concerns about potential exclusion from any agreement involving Ukraine's pipelines. Russia's fears stem from the possibility of the EU plan hindering Gazprom's control efforts over Ukraine's pipelines and gas distribution network. Despite Ukraine's reluctance to reform during the presidential election campaign, Russia is exploring alternative energy export routes through projects like the Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines to bypass Ukraine's gas transport system. The Nord Stream and South Stream pipelines are being developed to reduce Ukraine's leverage over Russia on energy issues. This could lead to Russia putting more pressure on Ukraine and key European countries having less stake in Ukraine's future. President Yanukovych aims for a more pro-Russian foreign policy and wants cheaper gas from Russia in exchange for a minority stake. President Yanukovych aims to secure gas from Russia at subsidized prices in exchange for a minority stake in Ukraine's pipeline system, a deal that may face opposition in the Ukrainian parliament due to concerns about transparency and potential ties to RosUkrEnergo. The EU-Ukraine gas sector reform plan's fate remains uncertain. Moldova, Europe's poorest country, heavily relies on Russia for energy resources and exports. Russia's restrictions on Moldovan wine and agricultural products have severely impacted the country's economy. Moldova has tried to balance ties between Moscow and the West since gaining independence in 1991, with Communist leaders seeking greater engagement with the West, causing tensions with Russia. In 2005, Moldova tightened customs policies with EU help to stop smuggling from Transnistria, angering Russia. Russia subsidizes Transnistria, with Russian firms gaining stakes in businesses. Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Moldova in 2006 over price disputes, pressuring Moldova to accept price increases. After Moldova accepted a smaller gas price increase in January 17, Gazprom gained majority control of Moldova's gas infrastructure. Gas supplies were cut off during the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas crisis but were restored later. The global economic crisis led to a drop in Moldova's gas prices. Despite a pro-Western government in Moldova since 2009, energy relations with Moscow have not significantly changed. Georgia also shifted towards a pro-Western orientation. Georgia shifted towards a pro-Western orientation after the \"Rose Revolution\" in 2003, leading to strained relations with Russia. Russia pressured Georgia by supporting breakaway regions and disrupting economic ties, including raising gas prices and sabotaging pipelines. Gazprom threatened to cut off gas supplies to Georgia in 2006. Georgia's strategic position near Azerbaijan has helped it resist Russian pressure. It serves as a transit state for pipelines carrying oil and gas, reducing dependence on Russia. Despite Russian military actions in 2008, pipeline shipments were quickly restored. Gazprom still supplies gas to Georgia. The conflict in Georgia demonstrates Russia's ability to disrupt pipeline routes to European customers. Georgian officials believe participating in the Nabucco pipeline project would meet all their natural gas needs. The Baltic states face energy supply challenges from Russia and pay world market prices for their supplies. In the Baltic states, Russian efforts to control energy infrastructure have been a major concern. Gazprom has significant stakes in natural gas companies in these countries, and when takeover attempts fail, Russia cuts off energy supplies. An example is the Mazeikiai oil complex in Lithuania, which includes a refinery, maritime terminal, and pipeline. In 1999, U.S. firm Williams International bought a stake in Mazeikiai, but Russian oil firm Lukoil slowed deliveries, leading Williams to sell its stake to Yukos. In 2002, Williams sold its stake in the Mazeikiai oil complex to Yukos, which made the refinery profitable again. Yukos later went bankrupt and tried to sell its stake to PKN Orlen, despite Rosneft's interest. Transneft shut down the Druzhba oil pipeline supplying Mazeikiai for repairs in 2006, citing unprofitability, and blocked Lithuania's efforts to secure supplies from Kazakhstan. Critics accused Russia of manipulating energy supplies to punish Lithuania for diversifying ownership. In 2010, Lithuania considered selling a stake in Mazeikiai to a Russian oil firm for oil supplies. In 2003, Transneft cut off oil shipments to Latvia's Ventspils port, diverting them to its own Baltic Pipeline System and Primorsk port. This move was seen as an attempt to control Baltic countries through energy supplies. Russia's Transneft made a power play to secure control of Ventspils Nafta, an oil terminal in Latvia, amidst skepticism. Estonia also faced Russian pressure on its energy supply due to a political dispute. Belarus, a loyal ally to Russia, heavily relies on Russian energy subsidies. In 2006, Russia considered reducing energy supplies to Belarus. In 2006, Russia pressured Belarus to sell control of key energy firms or face higher gas prices. Belarus agreed to pay more and sell a majority stake in Beltransgaz to Gazprom. After resolving the gas dispute, conflicts over oil supplies arose between the two countries. In 2007, Russia reduced subsidies to Belarus, leading to a conflict over oil supplies. Belarus retaliated by increasing transit fees for Russian oil to Europe, causing a disruption in oil supplies. The crisis was resolved by Belarus agreeing to match Russia's export duty on oil products for Western Europe. In response to a drop in Russian subsidies, Lukashenko cut government spending and sought loans from Western banks. Another oil crisis in January 2010 saw Russia demanding a revision in oil export arrangements with Belarus, leading to a reduction in Russian subsidies and pressure for Belarus to sell equity stakes in its refineries to Russian firms. Russia cut oil supplies to Belarus by 70% to force compliance. Belarus agreed to modified terms with Russia on January 27, cutting Russia's subsidy by $1.8 billion. The crisis did not affect oil supplies to Western Europe. Belarus seeks lower energy prices from Russia and diversification of energy sources. Lukashenko calls for imports from Venezuela, Iran, Azerbaijan, and development of coal reserves and a nuclear power plant within Belarus. Belarus has explored receiving oil supplies from Kazakhstan and the world economic crisis has eased its energy burden. Gas prices paid by Belarus have dropped since 2009 due to plummeting crude oil rates. Armenia and Russia have close ties, with Russia increasing gas prices for Armenia in 2006. Critics allege Russia now controls Armenia's energy supplies. Gazprom assumed management control of an energy asset in Armenia in 2006. In 2006, Gazprom took over management of an Iranian-Armenian gas pipeline, potentially signaling Russia's aim to control Armenia's energy routes. This move could help Armenia reduce its dependence on Russian gas via Georgia. The United States criticized Russia for using energy as a political tool during a gas standoff with Ukraine in January 2006. In 2006, the United States criticized Russia for using energy as a political tool during a gas standoff with Ukraine. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Russia of politically motivated efforts to constrain energy supply to Ukraine. Vice President Dick Cheney criticized Russia's tactics of supply manipulation and intimidation against vulnerable countries in the region. Bush Administration officials cast doubt on the reliability of Russian oil and natural gas supplies to Europe and criticized Moscow's nationalistic interventions in its energy sector. Secretary Rice warned against Russia using its oil and gas wealth as a political weapon or treating its independent neighbors as part of an old sphere of influence. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about European energy security and appointed Richard Morningstar as State Department Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy in 2009. The United States has been active on the issue of Eurasian energy supplies, but skeptics argue that key U.S. interests are not at stake as the problem is one of European dependence, not American. The EU and other European countries must take the lead in addressing energy dependence, with the US playing a supporting role. The US has encouraged diversification of energy supplies and supported projects like the BTC pipeline and SCGP to reduce reliance on Russia. The US also backs the Nabucco pipeline for long-term energy security. The US strongly supports the Nabucco pipeline, an EU-sponsored project to supply natural gas from Central Asia and Azerbaijan to Europe. Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey signed an agreement for the project in 2009. Another US-backed proposal is the Italy-Turkey-Greece Interconnector (ITGI) gas pipeline, with completion expected by 2012. Turkey's strategic location is key in various pipeline projects like Nabucco and South Stream. The country's control over the Bosporus Strait limits shipping, forcing oil and gas supplies from Caucasus and Central Asia to cross its territory. The American Macedonian Bulgarian Oil pipeline (AMBO) is another project supported by the US to bypass the Bosporus, expected to be completed in 2011. Turkey aims to leverage its geographic position to become a regional energy hub, using it as bargaining leverage with Russia and the EU. Turkey aims to become a regional energy hub by collaborating with Russia and the EU on various pipeline projects. This includes agreements with Russia for the South Stream pipeline and a nuclear power plant in Turkey. Another proposed project is the White Stream pipeline, which would transport gas from the Caspian to Crimea. Financing for the White Stream pipeline remains uncertain. The Bush Administration officials criticized the Nord Stream pipeline for supplying Germany and western European countries with natural gas, bypassing central and eastern European countries. They supported discussions on alternatives like delivering Norway's gas production to northern Europe and developing LNG terminals in Poland and the Baltic states. Germany strongly supports Nord Stream for a dependable gas source. Nord Stream, a gas pipeline owned by Gazprom, has faced concerns from Baltic countries, Poland, and Ukraine due to fears of Moscow's increased energy leverage. Delays due to environmental concerns have been encountered, but the pipeline is expected to begin operation in late 2011. The Obama Administration has shown less criticism towards Nord Stream compared to the Bush Administration. Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder chairs the Nord Stream consortium. The Obama Administration has been less critical of Nord Stream and South Stream compared to the Bush Administration, possibly as part of an effort to improve ties with Russia. U.S. Eurasian energy envoy Richard Morningstar has emphasized the importance of working with Russia on energy issues and has stated that the U.S. does not oppose Nord Stream or South Stream. Additionally, the U.S. has advocated for extending an existing oil pipeline from Ukraine to Poland. The Odesa-Brody pipeline in Ukraine could potentially be extended to Gdansk in Poland, but currently runs in reverse, pumping Russian oil to Odesa. The success of U.S. \"pipeline diplomacy\" projects depends on private energy firms' profitability rather than diplomatic efforts. Concerns exist about the availability of oil and gas for these pipelines, with Russian-supported pipelines having an advantage due to available supplies. Central and eastern European countries are tempted by the profitability of Russian pipelines, despite efforts to reduce dependence on Russia. The future of projects like Nabucco is uncertain. The prospects for Nabucco are uncertain as Russia's South Stream pipeline, supported by Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary, could potentially undermine it. Russia's acquisition of stakes in key players like MOL and Baumgarten gas storage center could block Nabucco. The availability of natural gas supplies for Nabucco is also in question. The United States opposes tapping Iran's energy resources due to terrorism support, nuclear ambitions, and Iraq policy. Political uncertainty in Iraq hinders future supplies, leading U.S. hopes to Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Russia and Iran obstruct U.S.-backed efforts by claiming Caspian Sea projects need consent from all littoral states. This stance may deter potential investors. Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have longstanding tensions over their Caspian Sea border. Long-standing tensions between Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan over their Caspian Sea border could hinder U.S. plans. Russia's pipeline routes also face supply questions, with gas fields in Siberia declining and new developments delayed. Russia's grip on Central Asian supplies has been questioned, with disputes affecting gas imports from Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is diversifying its supply routes by developing pipelines towards China and Asia. Turkmenistan has expanded its gas pipeline capacity to Iran and China, delivering 30 bcm of gas per year to China since 2009. Azerbaijan is eager to support U.S.-backed pipeline plans but has limited gas exports currently. The U.S. hopes Azerbaijan's gas production will increase by 2015-2016 with the development of the Shah Deniz gas fields. However, Azerbaijan has shown impatience with delays in the Nabucco project. Russia and Azerbaijan signed a memorandum to sell Azerbaijani gas to Russia, potentially impacting Nabucco depending on future gas export volumes. The signing of the intergovernmental agreement on Nabucco was a step forward, but prospects for the pipeline are clouded by pricing disputes between Azerbaijan and Turkey. European leaders are looking to enhance interconnections and increase storage to diversify energy supplies. In 2010, the European Union allocated 1.39 billion Euro for projects to improve natural gas interconnectivity within Europe. The European Union allocated 1.39 billion Euro ($1.9 billion) for projects to improve the interconnectivity of European natural gas pipelines, including 200 million Euro for Nabucco. LNG could be a cost-effective alternative to Gazprom pipelines, helping create an integrated gas market in Europe and allowing countries to diversify their gas supplies. This would reduce reliance on long-term contracts with Gazprom, which can lead to higher prices compared to the spot market. Poland plans to build an LNG terminal on the Baltic Sea by 2014 to diversify gas supplies for central Europe and the Balkans. Advances in unconventional gas production could decrease Russia's leverage, with the US being a major producer. Croatia also considers an LNG terminal on the Adriatic Sea. Russia is a leading producer of unconventional gas. U.S. and European officials emphasize the need for energy conservation and alternative fuels in the region. Russia's energy policy may be influenced by the need for Western investment to exploit new oil and gas fields. There is a possibility for the U.S. and other countries to persuade Russia to liberalize its energy sector. However, Russia's current statist system has provided its leaders with wealth and power, which may deter them from making changes. The United States and EU are working with Ukraine to develop an energy efficiency action plan and improve investment climate for tapping into Ukraine's natural gas and oil resources. They provide aid to the region to enhance energy security through feasibility studies and funding for pipeline projects. The United States and EU are working with Ukraine to enhance energy security through aid and investment in pipeline projects. Members of Congress are concerned about Russian energy dependency in central and eastern Europe, calling for diversification of energy supplies and a greater NATO role in providing emergency energy assistance. Senator Richard Lugar has advocated for NATO involvement in securing energy infrastructure. Senator John Kerry has led hearings on policy toward Russia and energy security in the 111th Congress. In May and July 2009, Senate hearings chaired by Senator John Kerry and Senator Lugar discussed Russia's political use of energy supplies. The signing of the Nabucco agreement was hailed during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. In February 2009, the House Foreign Affairs Committee criticized Russia's energy tactics in Europe. In June and July 2009, concerns about Russia's energy policy in Europe were raised in House Foreign Affairs Committee hearings. In March 2010, Chairman Berman and witnesses discussed energy security in relations between Europe, the United States, and Russia. Congress passed resolutions criticizing Russian energy policy towards Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other countries. The Senate resolutions in 2007 and 2008 condemned Russia's use of gas supplies as a political tool against various countries. The Senate passed S.Res. 612 urging constructive relations with Moscow at the 2008 G-8 summit but criticized Russian trade and energy policies. Representative Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.Con.Res. 61 conditioning Russia's G8 membership on compliance with international obligations and democratic standards, citing Russian use of energy resources for political leverage. Energy companies sought control over industries and energy infrastructure in Europe to dominate European energy markets."
