Uninsured children are less likely to have recommended medical visits and immunizations, relying more on emergency rooms for care. A child's insurance status is largely dependent on their parents' employer-sponsored coverage. Medicaid and CHIP are available for children without employer-sponsored insurance. States administer their own Medicaid programs under federal rules. CHIP covers low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels. Some disabled children qualify for Medicare, while others have insurance from small-group market policies. This report analyzes the health insurance status of children under 19 in 2009 using data from the 2010 Current Population Survey. It examines the relationship between types of health insurance, child and parent characteristics, and trends in insurance status since 1999. The Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the Current Population Survey (CPS) collects data on individual health insurance status, income, and poverty. The ASEC, also known as the March Supplement, surveys about 100,000 addresses in March to estimate levels of uninsurance in the United States. The key variable in this report is whether each child was uninsured in 2009, measuring if they lacked health insurance at any point during the year. The report uses the term \"uninsured\" to refer to those without insurance at some point in 2009. It covers the relationship between health insurance and children's demographic and employment characteristics. The percentage of uninsured children in 2009 varied by age, with 9.2% for children under 6 and 12.5% for those aged 13-18. Public insurance decreased with age, while employer-sponsored coverage increased. For children under 6, 39.9% had public insurance and 52.1% had employer-sponsored insurance, compared to 26.9% and 60.6% respectively for children aged 13-18. In 2009, uninsured rates varied by age and race/ethnicity among children. Hispanic children had the highest uninsurance rates (17.5%) and lowest employer-sponsored coverage (35.0%). White children had the lowest uninsurance rates (7.3%) and highest employer-sponsored coverage (69.4%). Black or Hispanic children were more likely to have public coverage than white or Asian children. Children in the Northwest or Midwest were less likely to be uninsured (7.3% and 7.8%) compared to those in the South or West (13.0% and 11.0%). Employer-sponsored health insurance covered about 63% of children in the Northeast and Midwest, and about 53% in the South and West. In 2009, uninsured rates varied by age and race/ethnicity among children. Hispanic children had the highest uninsurance rates (17.5%) and lowest employer-sponsored coverage (35.0%). White children had the lowest uninsurance rates (7.3%) and highest employer-sponsored coverage (69.4%). Black or Hispanic children were more likely to have public coverage than white or Asian children. Children in the Northwest or Midwest were less likely to be uninsured (7.3% and 7.8%) compared to those in the South or West (13.0% and 11.0%). Native-born and naturalized children had similar rates of employer-sponsored health insurance, at 57.7% and 58.3%, respectively, while only 31.4% of children who were not citizens had employer-sponsored insurance. Insurance coverage among children under age 19 who lived with at least one parent also differed by family structure, with 8% of children in two-parent families uninsured, compared to 12% of children with a single mother and 16% with a single father. Children living with two parents were more likely to have private health insurance coverage compared to those living with a single mother. Family income influenced the type of coverage, with higher income families more likely to have employer-sponsored coverage. A child's insurance source was strongly linked to their parents' coverage. Children with uninsured parents were more likely to have public coverage. In 2009, children with at least one parent working full-time had 71.2% with employer-sponsored health insurance and 8.2% uninsured. For children with parents working part-time, 31.6% had employer-sponsored coverage and 12.8% were uninsured. Public insurance filled gaps, with rates at 20.7% for children with full-time working parents and 58.2% for those with less attached parents. Employer-sponsored coverage rates varied based on the size of the firm, with higher rates in larger firms. Uninsurance rates were lower for children of parents in larger firms compared to those in smaller firms. It is crucial to choose an appropriate comparison group when evaluating uninsured children. Different representations of data can lead to different conclusions if not evaluated carefully. Different conclusions can be drawn from the same data if not evaluated carefully. Figure 1 shows the percentage of uninsured children by family structure, with the highest percentage among two-parent families. However, comparing the percentage of uninsured children within each family structure may lead to different conclusions, as shown in Figure 2 for two-parent families, single-father families, and single-mother families. Children in two-parent households are the largest group of uninsured children, but they are less likely to be uninsured compared to children in single-parent families. This paradox arises because even though two-parent families have the lowest uninsurance rate, they can still have the largest number of uninsured children due to their high representation in the population. This has implications for policymakers aiming to reduce the number of uninsured children. The report focuses on the health insurance and uninsurance patterns of children under 19 in 2009, with a shift to examining trends between 1999 and 2009. Economic recessions may lead to an increase in the uninsurance rate for children as parents may lose their jobs and employer-sponsored health insurance. During economic recessions, an increase in the uninsurance rate for children may occur if parents lose employer-sponsored coverage. However, a drop in parental income could make children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. Legislative changes, like the ARRA in 2009, can also impact insurance eligibility and benefits, potentially reducing the number of uninsured children.

Legislative changes, like the ARRA in 2009, can impact insurance eligibility and benefits, potentially reducing the number of uninsured children. The national percentages of uninsured children under age 18 ranged from 12.5% in 1999 to 9.0% in 2008, with a 3.5 percentage-point spread over the 10-year period. Economic recessions did not seem to have a significant effect on the uninsurance rate. The uninsurance rate for children remained relatively stable despite economic recessions in 2001 and 2008-2009. However, there were significant changes in children's insurance status over the 10-year period. The percentage of children covered by employer-sponsored insurance decreased from 65.2% in 1999 to 55.8% in 2009, leading to an increase in the uninsurance rate. On the other hand, the number of children covered by public health insurance, such as Medicaid and CHIP, increased during the same period. The percentage of children covered by public insurance increased from 20.3% in 1999 to 33.8% in 2009. Factors contributing to this rise include ARRA's temporary increase in federal Medicaid payments and the expansion of CHIP enrollment. These measures helped maintain Medicaid eligibility standards and reduced the number of uninsured children. The increase in public coverage for children from 1999 to 2009 was influenced by factors such as the expansion of CHIP enrollment and changes in parental take-up of public health insurance. This led to a decrease in uninsured children as more kids became eligible for need-based criteria or parents chose to enroll their children in public health insurance."
