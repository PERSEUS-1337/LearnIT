The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 is amended to support better decision-making to reduce drought impacts and costs. The system will provide an effective early warning system by collecting and integrating information on key drought indicators. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 aims to provide usable, reliable, and timely drought forecasts at national and regional levels. It also involves communicating forecasts, conditions, and impacts to stakeholders at various government levels, the private sector, and the public. Additionally, the system will offer data, information, and products that consider local, regional, and state differences in drought. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 aims to coordinate federal research and monitoring for a drought early warning system, integrate existing forecasting programs, and continue research on drought impacts and climate variability. The National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 requires a report on the system's implementation, including an assessment of the information provided. The report on the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 includes plans for system development, research needs for enhancing drought early warnings, and a list of partners. The Under Secretary collaborates with partners to implement the National Integrated Drought Information System and conducts outreach activities. Consultation with various government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector is required for developing the report. The Senate passed S. 376 on February 3, 2014, reauthorizing the National Integrated Drought Information System."
