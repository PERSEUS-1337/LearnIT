    "title": "AB 36",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 54141 of the Government Code is amended to define terms related to surplus military equipment for local agencies, including the definitions of \"local agency,\" \"United States,\" \"State,\" \"legislative body,\" \"surplus military equipment,\" and \"tactical surplus military equipment.\" The state coordinator is the agency responsible for administering a state program for acquiring surplus military equipment. A local agency must obtain approval from its legislative body before applying to receive tactical surplus military equipment. Local agencies can adopt an ordinance allowing law enforcement to apply for tactical surplus military equipment, with a list of approved equipment types. The ordinance must be reviewed annually by the legislative body for renewal. If not renewed, the authorization expires. The legislative body of a local agency is not required to approve each individual item of tactical surplus military equipment unless specified by the ordinance. This section applies to charter cities and counties, superseding any inconsistent provisions in their charters. The state coordinator must develop a list of tactical surplus military equipment by January 31, 2016, for public input and update it annually on their website. The state coordinator must consider federal regulations when developing a list of surplus military equipment, including weapons, armored vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and other tactical equipment. Local agencies are prohibited from receiving certain types of equipment such as tracked armored vehicles, weaponized vehicles, firearms and ammunition of .50 caliber or greater, grenade launchers, bayonets, and camouflage uniforms. The Legislature finds that requiring public meetings prior to acquiring federal surplus military equipment enhances public scrutiny and access to information. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. Costs incurred by local agencies or school districts would result from a legislative mandate within the scope of the Constitution."
