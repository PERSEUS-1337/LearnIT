Extradition is a formal legal process where a person is surrendered within a country's jurisdiction to another country. Irregular or extraordinary renditions involve the extrajudicial transfer of a person for purposes of arrest, detention, and interrogation. Irregular renditions involve the extrajudicial transfer of individuals for arrest, detention, and interrogation without access to the judicial system. Persons may be seized in another country and immediately transferred without setting foot in the rendering State. Aliens in the United States may be removed to another State under immigration laws if deportable or inadmissible. The legal justification for removing an alien from the United States via deportation or denial of entry is based on the sovereign authority of the United States to control its borders. This practice, although similar to irregular rendition in some cases, is distinct from historical renditions. The term \"extraordinary rendition\" has been used occasionally. The term \"extraordinary rendition\" has been used to describe the transfer of aliens suspected of terrorist activity to third countries for detention and interrogation. The United States has rendered persons to other countries via the CIA and law enforcement agencies, often with cooperation from the States where the individuals were seized. The Obama Administration has continued this practice, and there have been no widely-reported cases of persons being rendered from within the United States. The United States has conducted renditions of non-U.S. citizens to third countries, often involving individuals seized outside U.S. territory. Noncitizens arriving at U.S. ports of entry have fewer procedural protections against removal compared to aliens residing in the U.S. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects U.S. citizens abroad from actions by the federal government. The United States has conducted renditions of non-U.S. citizens to third countries, often involving individuals seized outside U.S. territory. Noncitizens arriving at U.S. ports of entry have fewer procedural protections against removal compared to aliens residing in the U.S. The Constitution protects U.S. citizens abroad from actions by the federal government, limiting the summary transfer of such persons to foreign governments. President Ronald Reagan authorized the rendition of terrorist suspects in 1986, and the CIA's rendition program began in mid-1995 as part of U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The rendition program began in mid-1995 with the goal of detaining Al Qaeda members and seizing documents. After 9/11, rendered al-Qaeda operatives were kept in U.S. custody. President Bush's national security team wanted to interrogate captured fighters. The CIA had rendered 70 terrorists before 9/11. President Bush issued a directive broadening the CIA's authority to render suspects to other States. The CIA's authority to render terrorist suspects to other States was broadened by a directive issued by President Bush. Controversy arose over the alleged rendition of suspected terrorists to States known for practicing torture. In 2009, an Italian court convicted 22 CIA operatives and a U.S. military colonel in absentia for their role in the irregular rendition of an Egyptian cleric. The Italian Ministry of Justice has not yet requested the extradition of these individuals. The Bush Administration did not dispute charges of rendering persons to foreign States believed to practice torture but denied doing so for torture purposes. President Bush stated that the US received promises that transferred persons won't be tortured. Acting CIA Director Porter Goss mentioned increased safeguards over renditions post-9/11. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice affirmed the US does not transport individuals to countries where torture is expected. In January 2009, President Obama created a task force to review U.S. transfer policies, including rendition, to prevent torture. Recommendations were made to strengthen procedures for obtaining assurances from countries that transferred persons will not face torture. Limited information is available on U.S. renditions to countries practicing torture. The legal authority for U.S. agencies to engage in renditions is unclear, with only one provision in the United States Code permitting participation in renditions. Legal limits on renditions, especially regarding torture, exist despite U.S. participation in the practice. The U.N. Convention against Torture and U.S. domestic laws restrict the transfer of individuals to countries where they may face torture. Torture is defined as severe pain intentionally inflicted under the color of law. The U.N. Convention against Torture, ratified by the United States in 1994, prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Convention established the Committee against Torture to monitor compliance, and State parties must submit reports on their adherence to the Convention. The U.S. declared that the Convention required domestic legislation for enforcement. The U.N. Convention against Torture, ratified by the United States in 1994, prohibits torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Convention requires domestic implementing legislation for enforcement. CAT Article 2 prohibits torture under any circumstances, but other provisions may allow for limited exceptions. The following paragraphs discuss restrictions on rendition to countries where torture is likely. The U.S. ratification of the U.N. Convention against Torture (CAT) in 1994 prohibits torture and cruel treatment. CAT Article 3 prohibits expelling or extraditing individuals to a country where they may face torture, based on a \"more likely than not\" standard. However, CAT does not prevent transferring individuals to countries where they may face harsh treatment that falls short of torture. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 implemented U.S. obligations under CAT Article 3, stating the policy not to return individuals to a country where they may be tortured. However, regulations adopted to implement CAT Article 3 excluded certain aliens described in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(B) provides exceptions to the general prohibition on removing aliens to countries where they may face persecution. Aliens may be removed if they assisted in Nazi persecution, engaged in genocide, committed serious crimes, pose a danger to the community or security of the United States, or are suspected of serious nonpolitical crimes. The U.S. regulations prohibit the removal of individuals to countries where they may be tortured, even if they are considered a security threat. CIA regulations on renditions are not publicly available but would likely need to comply with FARRA. Diplomatic assurances can be considered in removal decisions under CAT Article 3 regulations. The U.S. regulations prohibit the removal of individuals to countries where they may be tortured, even if they are considered a security threat. Diplomatic assurances deemed \"sufficiently reliable\" are used in transfer decisions, including those made by military authorities and the CIA for rendition purposes. The Obama Administration task force recommended State Department involvement in evaluating assurances for rendition. CAT Article 3 requires consideration of human rights records and relevant factors in transfer decisions. Assurances against torture by the receiving State should be a relevant consideration for rendering individuals. The United States obtains assurances from foreign governments to prevent torture when transferring detainees, but the Committee against Torture has expressed concerns about this practice. The US would not transfer individuals if concerns about treatment are not resolved satisfactorily. The United States is recommended to rely on \"diplomatic assurances\" only from States that do not systematically violate the Convention's provisions. Clear procedures for obtaining assurances, judicial review, and post-return monitoring are necessary. The US must exercise discretion in using assurances and look beyond face value if a State consistently violates them. The Convention Against Torture (CAT) criminalizes all instances of torture, regardless of location. States must establish jurisdiction over torture offenses committed within their territory, on registered ships or aircraft, or by their nationals. The United States enacted laws criminalizing torture outside its borders to comply with the Convention Against Torture. Jurisdiction is established if the offender is a U.S. national or present in the U.S., regardless of the victim's nationality. No specific legislation was enacted for torture within the U.S. as existing federal and state laws were deemed sufficient. The Federal Torture Statute criminalizes torture, attempts, and conspiracies to commit torture with specific intent required for the criminal offense. The intent of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) is to prevent torture, but it is unclear if CAT would always prohibit renditions to countries that practice torture. The Convention Against Torture (CAT) aims to prevent torture, but it is uncertain if CAT would always forbid renditions to countries that practice torture. CAT Article 3 prohibits renditions from a signatory State to another State when there are substantial grounds to believe the person would be tortured. Even if renditions do not constitute \"extraditions\" under CAT Article 3, transferring a person to a country where they may be tortured violates the Convention. Diplomatic assurances could potentially justify renditions if deemed credible, as US regulations allow their use in removal decisions. The United States must exercise discretion in using diplomatic assurances to fulfill its obligations under the Convention Against Torture. If a State consistently violates assurances or if the US learns they won't be met, further scrutiny is needed before transferring individuals. The US can transfer individuals to countries where they may face harsh treatment not amounting to torture, based on diplomatic representations. The United States must use caution when using diplomatic assurances to meet its obligations under the Convention Against Torture. There is uncertainty about the extent to which the Convention applies when a country seizes suspects outside its territory and transfers them to another country. The US generally believes human rights treaties apply to persons within its territory, not those with whom its government agents interact. In 2006, the U.S. State Department informed the CAT Committee Against Torture that CAT Article 3 does not apply to persons outside U.S. territory. However, they also stated that the U.S. accords CAT Article 3 protections to all persons in U.S. custody, regardless of their location. State Department Legal Advisor John Bellinger testified in 2008 that this has been the U.S.'s position since ratifying the Convention against Torture in 1994. CAT Articles 4-5 require parties to criminalize all acts of torture, regardless of where they occur, including outside the United States. CAT Article 3 may also have extraterritorial scope, but there are arguments about its application to extraordinary renditions outside the U.S. jurisdiction. Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture prohibits the expulsion, return, or extradition of individuals to countries where they may face torture. However, there are debates about whether certain extraterritorial renditions fall under this provision, especially if individuals are transferred to countries where they have not previously resided. The United States may argue that such renditions do not constitute \"expelling\" or \"returning\" individuals, particularly if the process is informal. If renditions are not formal, they may not be considered extraditions under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The United States could argue that transferring individuals to countries where they may face torture does not violate Article 3 as long as the renditions do not take place within its territorial jurisdiction. Critics may argue that this narrow interpretation contradicts the Convention's goal to prevent torture. The Convention requires parties to take legal steps to eliminate torture and impose criminal penalties on offenders, suggesting that States Parties should never engage in or condone torture. The Convention Against Torture prohibits States from engaging in or being complicit in torture, even extraterritorially. Some argue that the Convention covers all forms of transferring individuals to another State, including renditions. Critics oppose a narrow interpretation that allows for transfers to countries where torture is likely. In 1994, the CAT Committee against Torture stated that Article 3 prohibits the transfer of a person to any country where they face a risk of torture. In 2006, the Committee urged the United States to apply this guarantee to all detainees and cease renditions to countries where torture is likely. The United States is bound by CAT-implementing legislation to not return individuals to countries where torture is probable. The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA) prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to a country where they may face torture, even if they are not in the United States. There are arguments that this prohibition may not apply to renditions from outside the US, but exceptions exist for individuals deemed a danger to the US under section 2243(c) of the act. FARRA prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to a country where they may face torture, even if they are not in the United States. There are arguments that this prohibition may not apply to renditions from outside the US, but exceptions exist for individuals deemed a danger to the US under section 2243(c) of the act. Regulations exclude aliens believed to pose a danger to the US, in line with CAT obligations. This could mean excluding such persons from CAT protection under implementing regulations. Another argument is that the clause \"regardless of whether the person is physically present in the United States\" should only refer to the prohibition on involuntary return, not extradition or expulsion. CAT Article 3 obligates States not to expel, return, or extradite a person to a State where they would face torture. The principle of non-refoulement prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to a country where they may face torture, regardless of their physical presence in the United States. While CAT-implementing legislation in the US does not use the term \"refouler,\" it reflects the non-refoulement principle expressed in CAT. The non-refoulement principle under CAT prohibits the involuntary return of individuals to a country where they may face torture. Regardless of renditions occurring outside the US, CAT Article 4 criminalizes acts of torture and complicity, preventing US officials from conspiring with other states to render a person for torture. The Federal Torture Statute and CAT Article 4 do not explicitly forbid transferring individuals to a country where they may be tortured. Criminal penalties only apply to acts, attempts, or conspiracies to commit torture. US officials could be held liable under the Federal Torture Statute if they render someone with the intent for them to be tortured. However, if assurances are received that the individual will not be tortured, liability for conspiracy to commit torture is unlikely. The 1949 Geneva Conventions may impose limitations on renditions separate from those imposed by CAT, providing protections to specified categories of persons in armed conflict or occupied territory. The Geneva Conventions prohibit inhumane treatment of civilians and protected prisoners of war, including coercion to obtain information. Transferring civilians forcibly to another state is a grave breach of the Conventions and constitutes a war crime. Extradition of such persons for ordinary criminal offenses is allowed, but they cannot be transferred for disciplinary punishment. POWs may be transferred to penitentiaries for disciplinary punishment, but persons protected by the Conventions can only be transferred to other Convention parties with assurances against torture. If the transferee Power fails to abide by the Convention, the transferring Power must request their return or take corrective action. The United States must ensure the receiving State is a Convention member, provide assurances against torture, and take action if needed. In armed conflicts, parties must provide de minimis protections to individuals not participating in hostilities, including humane treatment and prohibition of torture and cruel treatment. The Geneva Conventions apply in limited circumstances to ensure the protection of individuals in such situations. The Geneva Conventions apply in limited circumstances, protecting designated categories of persons in armed conflict or post-conflict occupied territory. The Bush Administration argued that the Conventions did not apply to Al Qaeda members and that certain prohibitions did not extend to \"illegal aliens\" in Iraq. However, the Supreme Court ruled in the 2006 case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, providing minimal protections to its members. Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions provides minimal protections to Al Qaeda members, but it does not expressly prohibit the transfer of persons to other countries where they may face torture or cruel treatment. The interpretation of Common Article 3 in relation to renditions to countries where detainees may be tortured is unclear, especially in the context of U.S. law. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 clarifies that engaging in conduct inconsistent with the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 or subject to criminal penalty under the War Crimes Act could violate Common Article 3, but only if the victim is in U.S. custody. Transferring a person to a third-party for harsh treatment may not constitute a violation of Common Article 3. The War Crimes Act imposes criminal penalties on U.S. nationals or Armed Forces members for committing listed offenses of the laws of war, potentially resulting in life imprisonment or the death penalty. War crimes include \"grave breaches\" of the Geneva Conventions, such as torture of protected individuals and certain violations of Common Article 3. Hamdan, under U.S. law, Common Article 3 protects Al Qaeda members in armed conflict, prohibiting torture and cruel treatment. The War Crimes Act penalizes conspiring to mistreat protected persons in custody. However, it does not cover rendition for torture in other countries. The War Crimes Act prohibits conspiring to commit acts like rape, mutilation, or causing serious bodily injury against protected persons. U.S. personnel could be criminally liable for conspiring with officials in other states to render a person for such acts. It is unclear if the War Crimes Act would prohibit renditions not already prohibited under the Federal Torture Statute. The Federal Torture Statute and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibit torture and inhuman treatment. The Human Rights Committee interprets this to prevent extradition or expulsion to countries where torture may occur. U.S. ratification of the ICCPR included a declaration that its obligations are not self-executing. The United States has not enacted laws to comply with the Human Rights Committee's position that ICCPR Article 7 prohibits transferring individuals to countries where they may face torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. CAT-implementing regulations prohibit transfers to countries where torture is likely, but not necessarily cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, exile, torture, and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Member States are obligated to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms as outlined in the Declaration. President Barack Obama issued Executive Orders in 2009 regarding the treatment of persons apprehended by the United States in armed conflicts or counterterrorism operations. The Orders did not change U.S. rendition policy but mandated the closure of CIA detention facilities. Two Orders established task forces to review U.S. detention policy, including the transfer of detainees to foreign States. The \"Ensuring Lawful Interrogations\" Order created a Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies to ensure compliance with international law. The Executive Orders issued by President Barack Obama in 2009 addressed the treatment of individuals apprehended in armed conflicts or counterterrorism operations. One Order mandated the closure of CIA detention facilities and established a task force to review U.S. detention policy, including the transfer of detainees to foreign States. Another Order created a Special Task Force on Detainee Disposition to review lawful options for apprehension, detention, trial, transfer, release, or other disposition of individuals captured in connection with armed conflicts and counterterrorism operations. The Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies issued recommendations to ensure compliance with legal requirements and prevent torture during transfers. The Task Force recommended strengthening procedures for obtaining assurances from receiving countries to prevent torture during transfers. This includes involving the State Department in evaluating assurances, establishing a monitoring mechanism for transferred individuals, and preparing an annual report on transfers by relevant agencies. The Task Force recommended specific measures for immigration removal proceedings and military transfer decisions, including classified recommendations to ensure lawful treatment. Legislative proposals in Congress aimed to limit U.S. agencies' ability to render individuals to foreign States, with S. 1876 proposing restrictions on renditions without authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Torture Outsourcing Prevention Act aimed to restrict renditions of individuals to foreign states without authorization from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. It required evidence that the person was an international terrorist and would not be subjected to torture or cruel treatment. The Torture Outsourcing Prevention Act aimed to limit renditions to countries where torture is common. Transfer to such countries required approval from the Secretary of State, with exceptions for humanitarian access. Assurances from foreign governments were not sufficient to prevent torture."
