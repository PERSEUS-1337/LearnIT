    "content": "The \"Hunting Heritage and Fishing Preservation Act of 2004\" is also known as the \"Hunting Heritage Protection Act.\" This act aims to protect hunting heritage and fishing preservation. The Congress recognizes recreational hunting as a traditional activity with millions of participants who support wildlife management and conservation through licenses and taxes, essential for effective wildlife management. Effective wildlife management involves reducing conflicts between people and wildlife, providing incentives for conservation of wildlife, habitats, and ecosystems. Each state must have an agency with trained personnel to manage wildlife, and recreational hunting on federal public land is considered environmentally acceptable. SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS. The term \"agency head\" refers to the head of a Federal agency managing natural resources or Federal public land. Federal public land is publicly accessible land owned by the United States and managed for conservation. It excludes land held in trust for Indian tribes. \"Hunting\" is defined as lawful hunting activities. The term \"hunting\" refers to the lawful pursuit, trapping, shooting, capture, collection, or killing of wildlife, or the attempt to do so. SEC. 104. RECREATIONAL HUNTING. Federal public land is generally open for recreational hunting, with limitations for reasons like national security, public safety, or other authorized closures. Each agency head must manage the land to support and enhance hunting opportunities, following applicable state laws. Federal public land management decisions should aim to maintain hunting opportunities without a net loss of land area. Agency heads must submit an annual report on any closures of Federal public land for recreational hunting. The agency head must report closures and openings of Federal public land for recreational hunting. Closures of 5,000 or more acres require submission to congressional committees before taking effect. The bill requires the agency head to notify Congress of any closures or openings of Federal public land for recreational hunting. It also clarifies that the bill does not mandate the opening of national parks or monuments for hunting, nor does it prioritize hunting over other land management uses or state wildlife management authority. The bill allows hunting, fishing, and trapping on state and federal public land without requiring a license. States can take legal action against agency heads for non-compliance with the bill, including seeking injunctions and court costs. If the district court grants an injunction or rules in favor of the State, it must award the State reasonable costs, including attorney's fees, for bringing the civil action. TITLE II--FREEDOM TO FISH\n\nSEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\nThis title may be cited as the ``Freedom to Fish Act''. Recreational fishing is popular with over 50,000,000 participants in the US, contributing $116 billion annually to the economy and supporting 1,200,000 jobs. Anglers also play a role in conservation efforts. Recreational anglers contribute over $500,000,000 annually to State fisheries conservation programs. Federal policy allows public access to public lands for recreational purposes while maintaining fishery resources through various management measures. A clear policy is needed to manage recreational fishing effectively, including implementing marine protected areas to balance fishing and conservation efforts. The United States policy aims to conserve fishery resources by ensuring access for recreational anglers and involving them in regulatory procedures. Limitations on access are only imposed if scientifically necessary for conservation. Additionally, there are limitations on closures under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Section 303(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to prohibit establishing geographic areas where recreational fishing is prohibited unless specific conservation problems are caused by recreational fishing, alternative conservation measures related to recreational fishing are inadequate, and the management plan includes specific measurable criteria. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits establishing areas where recreational fishing is banned unless specific conservation issues arise, alternative measures are insufficient, and specific criteria are in place for assessment. The closure must be supported by scientific data and reviewed every 3 years, with termination once the initial condition no longer exists."
