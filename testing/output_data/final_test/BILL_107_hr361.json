    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that international family planning funds save women's lives by providing reproductive health care, including prenatal, postpartum, and HIV/AIDS education. Over 585,000 women die annually from pregnancy complications, with millions more facing health issues. Additionally, over 5.8 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS. Family planning programs funded by international organizations help combat the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS, with over 5.8 million people infected in 1998. These programs also play a crucial role in addressing environmental issues exacerbated by rapid population growth, such as pollution, habitat loss, and climate change. By empowering women to choose the number and spacing of their children, family planning contributes to slowing global population growth and improving family management worldwide. Improving access to family planning resources worldwide reduces mortality risks for women and children. Voluntary family planning services uphold individuals' right to plan their families, leading to fewer abortions. Data from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development highlights the benefits of quality family planning services. Development in 1994 estimated that providing family planning and health services would cost $17 billion by 2000. The US and other donor countries agreed to contribute one-third of the funds. The US should provide nearly $1.9 billion for population assistance in 2001. Restoring funding to 1995 levels would help ensure global access to family planning and reproductive health care. International organizations are crucial in meeting the needs of the world's population exceeding 6 billion. Nongovernmental organizations are vital for meeting various needs in society and promoting democratic participation. They should receive adequate funding without restrictions on free speech, similar to government assistance from the United States. SEC. 3 authorizes $366,000,000 for international organizations and programs in fiscal year 2002. SEC. 4 allocates $541,600,000 for population planning assistance in the same year, including funding for nongovernmental and multilateral organizations. SEC. 135 states that nongovernmental and multilateral organizations must meet eligibility requirements for population planning assistance, which should not be more restrictive than those for foreign governments."
