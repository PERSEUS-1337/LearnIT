The \"Mentor Schools Act\" aims to address educational gaps for low-income students by implementing successful educational alternatives to improve their opportunities and achievements. Same gender schools show promising academic and behavioral improvements for low-income, educationally disadvantaged students. Extensive data is needed to determine if same gender schools effectively educate all children to their best ability. Legal challenges have hindered efforts to experiment with same gender schools, but they are a valid educational alternative to coeducational schools under Title IX regulations. The Act aims to award grants for establishing same gender schools for low-income students, to assess their impact on educational achievement, and to enhance academic performance and school persistence. The schools must comply with Title IX regulations ensuring equal access to courses, services, and admission policies for both sexes. The Act aims to establish same-gender schools for low-income students to improve academic achievement and involve parents in their children's educational choices. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"evaluating agency\" as an academic institution, consortium of professionals, or private/nonprofit organization with experience in evaluations. It also defines \"mentor school\" as a public elementary/secondary school or consortium receiving funds under the Act, providing access to single-gender and coeducational schools. The Act requires a coeducational school to offer parents the choice of sending their child to specific schools, admit students through a lottery if there are more applicants than spots, and operate a one-to-one mentoring program pairing community volunteers with students of the same gender. The Act mandates coeducational schools to provide parental choice, conduct lotteries for oversubscribed spots, and implement a mentoring program with community volunteers. The program aims to improve achievement for all children based on specific educational objectives set by the local educational agency in collaboration with the mentor school advisory board. The mentor school advisory board is established in accordance with section 3(d) of the Act, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education.

The mentor school advisory board is established in accordance with section 3(d) of the Act, and the term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Education. SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to 100 local educational agencies for mentor schools. Grants are only awarded to agencies receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and among the top 20% in the state for children in need. Each grant under subsection (a) may be awarded for a period of up to 5 years, with 1 year designated for planning and program development for a mentor school. The Secretary cannot award more than 1 grant to support a specific mentor school. Local educational agencies must establish a mentor school advisory board composed of various stakeholders to assist in developing applications and advising on the mentor school's operations. Each local educational agency operating a mentor school is encouraged to employ teachers with alternative teaching certificates, including participants in the Troops to Teachers Program. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. Each local educational agency seeking a grant under this Act must submit an application to the Secretary with details on the educational program, objectives, monitoring methods, and curriculum to be used at the mentor school. The application for a grant under this Act must include details on how the mentor school will involve school administrators, teaching personnel, private sector role models, parents, teachers, local government, and volunteers in its design and implementation. It should also describe the one-to-one mentoring program, plans for continued operation after the grant expires, use of grant funds, and involvement of students in the mentor school or community. The grant application must include information on how mentor schools will inform the community about voluntary admission, use grant funds in conjunction with other programs, provide progress reports to the Secretary, and cooperate in program evaluation. The grant application must include assurances that resources will be used equally for boys and girls, activities will not adversely affect either sex, and any other information required by the Secretary. The Secretary will award grants based on the quality of applications, considering factors like curriculum, management, progress assessment, community support, meeting objectives, and assurances. Evaluation will also be conducted. The Secretary will allocate funds for an evaluation of the mentor schools program, measuring academic and social outcomes of students. The evaluating agency must submit a report to Congress by September 30, 2002. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 and additional funds for the following years until 2000 to support the implementation of this Act. The allocated funds will remain available until fully expended."
