    "content": "The Bush Administration has prioritized promoting democracy in the Middle East as a response to 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq. However, the effectiveness of this policy is being questioned due to ongoing violence and entrenched Arab regimes. Despite doubts about U.S. sincerity and commitment, the focus on Arab democratization post-9/11 is seen as significant by skeptics and advocates alike. The Arab world experienced upheaval with debates, demonstrations, and manipulated elections following attacks. The dilemma for U.S. policymakers is whether to pressure Arab governments for political openness, knowing that Islamists could benefit. Islamist groups oppose key U.S. policies in the Middle East, such as support for Israel and the occupation of Iraq. The United States may have inadvertently strengthened Islamist opposition movements in the Middle East by encouraging free and fair elections. The dilemma arises when considering the participation of non-violent Islamist groups in politics, some of which operate in a \"gray zone\" with limited participation. U.S. efforts to promote Arab democracy should include seeking more rights for all legitimate actors, including these Islamists, despite differing circumstances across the region. The report examines U.S. democracy promotion efforts in Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan, focusing on the interaction with Islamists. Key questions include the legitimacy of Islamist groups as democratic actors, their stance on U.S. Middle East policy, and the potential for engagement with non-violent Islamist groups. The dilemma of engaging with these groups without isolating key Arab regimes is also addressed. The democratization issue in the Middle East revolves around questions of national identity, the role of Islam in political life, rights for minorities, and the status of women. With secular Arab nationalism discredited, Islamism and ethnic politics have filled the identity vacuum. Various identities compete for dominance in the region, with \"moderate Islamists\" seeking political and social reform within Islamic law, while more radical Islamists may participate in elections. Some Islamists use elections to establish strict Islamic rule, while non-Islamist reformers seek support from secular intellectuals and minority groups. Secular intellectuals, minorities, and women's rights advocates are often accused of collaborating with foreigners due to their democratic vision resembling Western democracies. Ruling elites create \"national identities\" to maintain power, with some regimes being dominated by the military or ruling families tracing their legitimacy to Prophet Muhammad. Many ruling families in the Arab world base their legitimacy on common ancestry from Prophet Muhammad. Islamism is seen as a popular identification model, resonating with disillusioned populations facing political exclusion and economic deprivation. Islamists believe \"Islam is the solution\" to socio-economic problems posed by modernity and Western consumer culture, establishing their own institutions like political organizations, health clinics, and schools through extensive social welfare networks. Islamists in the Middle East have established alternative state structures through social welfare networks, gaining political participation and sometimes renouncing violence. Arab governments may allow their involvement to alleviate public pressure during economic downturns and unrest. Non-violent Islamist groups exist in an ambiguous position, with regimes exaggerating the threat they pose. Since the 1979 Iranian revolution, the U.S. government has increasingly believed that Islamist groups, if they come to power, would adopt a more confrontational foreign policy towards the United States. Arab regimes may exaggerate the threat posed by Islamists to maintain control, but also allow limited opposition activity if it benefits the regime. This dilemma was previously an academic question but has now become a significant policy concern. Arab regimes focus on symbolic democratic changes to deflect international criticism of their lack of political freedom. They manipulate elections, keep parliamentary systems weak, and allow only token opposition. U.S. suspicions of Islamist movements are fueled by the entry of Hamas and Hezbollah into formal politics. The U.S. suspicions of Islamist movements are fueled by groups like Hamas and Hezbollah maintaining armed militias and refusing to renounce terrorism. Some Arab regimes manipulate Western fears of political Islamism to position themselves as moderate alternatives. Arab governments like Egypt, Syria, and Algeria have a history of violent confrontation with Islamic extremists. They have been engaged in their own \"war on terror\" for years, making them reluctant to recognize non-revolutionary Islamist groups. Some Arab human rights advocates believe regimes use fear of terrorism to justify one-party rule. The Bush Administration rejected the idea that authoritarian Arab regimes are the bulwark against Islamic radicalism post-9/11. The notion that a democratic Middle East would be less vulnerable to extremism influenced the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The U.S. invasion of Iraq was influenced by the belief that a democratic Middle East would be less vulnerable to extremism. The President's \"Forward Strategy of Freedom in the Middle East\" emphasized the importance of promoting freedom in the region to prevent stagnation, resentment, and violence. The spread of weapons of mass destruction further underscored the need for change in the authoritarian governance of the Middle East. In the broader Middle East, there is debate within the U.S. foreign policy establishment about engaging Islamist groups in the event of political reform. Some view all Islamists as suspect, believing they are inherently anti-democratic and anti-Western. Dr. Martin Kramer argues that Islamists reject democracy and diversity, instead advocating for Islamic law. Some experts argue that engaging Islamist groups in political reform could be detrimental, as they may not condemn terrorist acts and could restrict the rights of women and religious minorities. Daniel Pipes warns against facilitating their political participation, stating it would be \"helping the enemy.\" Some suggest that to counter Islamist influence, the US should strengthen rule of law, civil society, and secular movements in the region. There are differing opinions on promoting political liberalization or allowing market forces to drive change. Experts also debate on integrating non-violent Islamist groups into political systems. Some experts suggest integrating non-violent Islamist groups into politics to counter radical influences and promote democracy in the Middle East. The US is taking a pragmatic approach towards democratization in the region, with considerations of realpolitik moderating political behavior. The United States is adopting a pragmatic approach to Middle East democratization, considering political conditions and differences among Islamist movements. Some experts suggest integrating non-violent Islamist groups into politics to promote democracy, despite constraints from strategic relationships with authoritarian regimes. The United States is employing a pragmatic approach to promoting democracy in the Middle East, focusing on diplomatic tools and bilateral diplomacy with Arab governments. Despite criticism, President Bush has made regional reform a priority and allocated resources for its implementation. Public statements by the Administration support these efforts. Since 9/11, the US has increased funding for democracy promotion in the Arab world, despite challenges in measuring its effectiveness. Public statements by US officials visiting the region aim to keep reform visible in dealings with Arab regimes, but are often criticized for meddling in Arab affairs. Islamist groups seize on these opportunities to criticize US policies in the Middle East. Democracy assistance in the Arab world is not easily quantifiable like traditional foreign aid for tangible projects. The US spends more on military assistance than on reform, but the focus should be on the substance of programming. Support for indigenous reformers does not always require large financial assistance but must be channeled effectively. Congress funds reform programs like the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) through State Department appropriations. The US provides funding for reform programs in Arab countries through initiatives like the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI), the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund (HRDF), and the National Endowment for Democracy's Muslim Democracy Program. Additionally, USAID supports democracy and governance activities in countries like Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Yemen. Congressional action allows for direct funding of these programs. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allows USAID to provide direct funding to NGOs in Egypt for democracy and governance activities, bypassing the approval of the Egyptian government. Funds are awarded competitively through an Annual Program Statement method. The USAID funds activities through NGO proposals, with quarterly reviews and awards made throughout the year. MEPI issues grants to NGOs in the Middle East for democracy and economic development, including training election monitors. Critics question MEPI's credibility for awarding grants to American-run organizations with limited impact. MEPI, criticized for funding programs with limited impact, faces suggestions to become a private foundation. U.S. officials reject the idea, emphasizing the need for policy tools in the region. BMENA, a G-8 initiative, aims to promote democracy and reform in the Middle East through annual conferences. The next meeting is planned for Jordan in 2006. The Bush Administration created the BMENA initiative in late 2006 to promote political and economic reform in Muslim-majority and Arab countries. Some analysts doubt its effectiveness and see it as just a forum for dialogue. BMENA countries support two funds: the \"Foundation for the Future\" for NGOs to strengthen civil society, and the \"Fund for the Future\" to help businesses in the region. The \"Fund for the Future\" supports businesses in the region, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to create jobs and economic growth. U.S. contributions come from MEPI-controlled accounts. The section profiles non-violent Islamist movements in Morocco, Egypt, and Jordan, focusing on groups that have disarmed militias or renounced terrorism. Experts have long studied Morocco's reform process for its potential impact on democratization in North Africa and the Middle East. Morocco has undergone a limited liberalization process in the past decade, with the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD) gaining seats in parliamentary elections. The monarchy has allowed Islamist political activity as long as it does not challenge the king's authority. The relationship between the PJD and the palace has been mutually beneficial, although there have been confrontations. Concern remains over the presence of Jihadist terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the region. Morocco has chosen inclusion over exclusion to attract Islamists away from militancy and towards political participation, possibly due to economic reasons. The country lacks natural resources and relies on foreign aid and trade with the West, making it important to maintain momentum on reforms. The Justice and Development Party (PJD) is not the only Islamist group in Morocco, with another group called Justice and Charity (JCO) also present, although not legally recognized. The JCO rejects the legitimacy of the Moroccan monarchy. The PJD in Morocco is believed to have ambiguous goals, with some speculating it aims to establish an Islamic state with Sharia law. The party is active in urban areas and may seek ministerial portfolios in future government coalitions. The PJD in Morocco is known for its Islamist agenda and popularity among lower and middle-class Moroccans. Despite its conservative stance, the party has supported progressive reforms, such as the 2004 revision of the family code. The PJD in Morocco, known for its Islamist agenda, supported progressive reforms like the 2004 family code revision. The party emphasizes the compatibility of Islam and democracy, focusing on fighting corruption and promoting transparency in politics. They hold members accountable for attendance and productivity in legislative sessions. Justice and Charity, led by Shaikh Abdessalem Yassine, has a contentious relationship with the Moroccan government due to its rejection of the monarchy. Nadia Yassine, the group's spokesperson, was arrested in 2005 for advocating for a republic over a kingdom. This stance has strained relations with the government, which values monarchic principles. The PJD condemned Nadia Yassine's remarks on republican values, stating she transgressed sacred institutions. Her trial drew international attention in an uncertain political climate. Justice and Charity denounces terrorism and violence for political ends, tolerated by the government but monitored as a subversive organization. Justice and Charity, a group closely monitored and considered subversive, faces scrutiny for its political agenda. Supporters of Nadia Yassine view her as an Islamic feminist, but she has opposed certain reforms, stating they cater to foreign interests. The group aims to garner mass support for the imposition of Islamic law. Nadia Yassine, a figure in the Justice and Charity group, supports Islamic law and women's rights. She opposes quotas for women in government, but acknowledges the need for reforms in personal status laws. The U.S. has a strong relationship with Morocco, with a focus on promoting democracy and human rights. Morocco is a key partner in North Africa and has helped with Middle East peace and counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. has increased military and economic aid, signed a free trade agreement, and supported reform initiatives in the region. Morocco is eligible for funding under the Millennium Challenge Account and the Middle East Partnership Initiative. Concerns about socio-economic conditions leading to radicalism have led to increased U.S. funding for education, health care, women's rights, job creation, and structural readjustment programs in Morocco. U.S. democracy promotion efforts in Morocco are regime-friendly, but the U.S. has sponsored programs involving the PJD party. The PJD party in Morocco is actively participating in programs sponsored by the U.S., with no special outreach efforts towards Islamist groups. Public opinion polls show up to 47% support for the PJD. Members have taken advantage of training opportunities from international NGOs. The PJD party in Morocco has received training and support from international NGOs and the U.S. government. Despite initial opposition, the PJD now engages in U.S.-sponsored programs. U.S. officials advocate for engagement with the PJD rather than ignoring it. The U.S. State Department's International Visitor's Program sponsored a visit by the PJD's leader, Saad Eddine Othmani, showing the party's interest in dialogue with the United States. Othmani emphasized the importance of building trust and identifying common interests through cooperative dialogue with the U.S. despite internal divisions within Islamist organizations like the PJD. The PJD, a political party in Morocco, has hardliners opposed to better relations with the West, especially the US due to their actions in Iraq. They occasionally boycott US embassy events and criticize US and EU policies. The PJD in Morocco has criticized the US and EU for cutting support to the Palestinian Authority after Hamas' victory in 2006. PJD leader Saad Eddine Othmani believes Hamas in government may seek a peaceful solution. US policymakers are cautious about their contacts with the PJD due to public skepticism in Morocco, while the EU's cooperation with Islamist groups is viewed more favorably. The PJD in Morocco takes a gradualist approach to political reform and has faced government pressure in past elections. Some suggest they may join a coalition government to gain governance experience and improve electoral chances in 2012. Critics are concerned about US government dealings with Moroccan Islamists. Experts caution against U.S. government interactions with Moroccan Islamists, warning that their non-violent approach to politics masks an ultimate goal of establishing a non-democratic state based on Islamic law. They argue that accommodating Islamists is not the solution to combating radical Islamism, as it undermines U.S. interests in Arab and Muslim societies. Critics believe that U.S. policy should not provide support that enables Islamist legislators to criticize the government effectively. Critics argue that U.S. policy should focus on promoting democratic alternatives to Islamists, while U.S. officials claim to treat all Moroccan parties equally. Moroccan media outlets have called for the U.S. to cease contacts with Islamists, fearing unintended empowerment. The Moroccan government warns that non-violent Islamists see electoral politics as a path to establish a theocracy. Congress has supported efforts to strengthen ties with Morocco, approving a free trade agreement in 2004. In 2006, Congress provided increasing foreign aid to Morocco for countering terrorism, democratization, and the FTA. Funding included $10.89 million in ESF, $12.375 million in FMF, $8.217 million in DA, and $1.856 million for IMET. The potential dilemma of non-violent Islamist movements is more significant for U.S. relations with Egypt than with Morocco. Egypt, a strategic partner for U.S. national security interests, has been at peace with Israel since. Egypt, a key strategic partner for U.S. national security interests in the region, has been at peace with Israel since 1979. President Mubarak plays a crucial role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Egypt cooperates closely with the U.S. on military and intelligence matters. The government is cautious about political reform to prevent empowering the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the main opposition group. The rise of Hamas in 2006 has increased Egypt's strategic importance in containing Hamas, aligning with U.S. and Israeli interests. The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has a complex relationship with the government, ranging from support to suppression. Despite their commitment to non-violent opposition, there are concerns about how an Islamist government would impact sectarian tensions in the country, especially with the presence of millions of Coptic Christians. The Muslim Brotherhood's history and ideology have caused divisions among Western observers regarding engagement with the group. The Egyptian government strongly opposes any Western dealings with the MB, especially with the resurgence of terrorist activity in Egypt. Despite this, some experts believe that engagement with the MB is inevitable due to its significant opposition power in Egypt. Others suggest promoting secular opposition groups instead. Many view the issue of Islamist inclusion in Egypt's political system as a domestic matter, warning against foreign involvement. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, has been a leading force in Sunni political Islamism in the Arab world. It grew militant between 1930-1950, challenging the Egyptian regime. Despite assisting in overthrowing the monarchy in 1952, the Brotherhood turned against the new military leaders and was suppressed after a failed assassination attempt in 1954. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, renounced violence in the 1970s and gradually reentered politics. It has fielded candidates in parliamentary elections and controls professional syndicates. The organization is recognized for its charitable work and support among the professional middle class. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, renounced violence in the 1970s and gradually reentered politics. It has fielded candidates in parliamentary elections and controls professional syndicates, including engineers, doctors, lawyers, and academics. The organization claims to support Egyptian democratization and sees democracy as compatible with Islam. The Muslim Brotherhood supports democracy as a means of change and endorses elections, reform, accountability, and non-violence. However, doubts exist about their democratic credentials due to the traditional leadership structure and lack of transparency. The group's anti-Israeli rhetoric is strong, influenced by Egypt's involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is known for its anti-Semitic rhetoric, rejecting normalization of relations with Israel. While not directly involved in terrorism, its leaders advocate resistance against Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands. The group's views on Israel are influenced by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Muslim Brotherhood's stance on Israel is influenced by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Despite condemning terrorist attacks in Egypt, they support Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians. There is uncertainty about whether they would abrogate Egypt's peace with Israel if they came to power. Some experts believe the military would intervene to maintain the status quo, while others think economic realities would force the Brotherhood to maintain a \"cold peace\" with Israel. The Al Wasat organization, despite its rejection as a legal party, promotes pluralism, religious toleration, and secular political principles. It was founded in 1996 by former Brotherhood members and advocates for the participation of women and Coptic Christians. Party leader Abu-al-Ila Madi emphasizes that Al Wasat is not a religious party and opposes theocratic thinking. The Al Wasat organization, rejected as a legal party, promotes pluralism, religious toleration, and secular political principles. Despite weak popular support, U.S. policy towards Egypt has shifted towards democracy promotion post-9/11, balancing security and economic interests with democracy promotion. The United States has used diplomatic tools to push for reform in Egypt, including visits by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and increased foreign aid and democracy programming activities. The State Department's Middle East Partnership Initiative began distributing grants to support political activists and human rights groups. The U.S. protested when an opposition leader was imprisoned in Egypt. The U.S. has pushed for reform in Egypt through diplomatic means, including visits by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and increased foreign aid. Some analysts question the depth of U.S. commitment to democratization in Egypt, especially after Hamas' victory in Palestinian elections. There are speculations that U.S. policymakers may soften their stance on reform in Egypt due to shared interests in containing Hamas. The U.S. has been pushing for reform in Egypt, but there are speculations that policymakers may tone down their rhetoric on reform. The dilemma of how to approach Islamist issues in Egypt perplexes U.S. policy makers and observers. The United States respects Egypt's decision to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood from U.S.-sponsored activities. U.S. NGOs must ensure no Brotherhood members attend funded programs. While the U.S. won't directly engage with the Brotherhood due to Egyptian law, members can still participate in meetings with U.S. officials and parliament members. According to J. Scott Carpenter, U.S. officials must be cautious in addressing the Islamist issue in Egypt. Informal dialogue with some Egyptian Islamists, like the Al Wasat organization, could be possible for future participation in U.S.-government democracy training programs. However, policymakers need to avoid showing favoritism. In June 2006, the Egyptian government accused the local head of the International Republican Institute's Egypt program of meddling in Egypt's internal affairs. U.S. officials are pressing Islamists on their views on issues important to U.S. policy in the region, including protection of minorities and women's rights. With 88 independent members of parliament sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood, MB politicians operate openly and are accessible. Some analysts question if Islamists in Egypt would welcome U.S. dialogue due to suspicion of Western intentions. Many Muslim Brotherhood members oppose U.S. policy in the Middle East and may avoid cooperation in politics. While some individual members may be open to U.S. programs, overall, only a few interact with Western observers. Experts recommend U.S. policy to support local demands for political liberalization in Egypt, but there is a lack of consensus. Local demands for political liberalization in Egypt have led to a lack of consensus on which reformers the United States should support. The choice is often between the ruling National Democratic Party or the Muslim Brotherhood, limiting options for the West. Despite efforts to promote a \"Third Way\" with non-Islamist or secular liberal movements, regime actions have hindered progress. Some experts suggest that the U.S. should promote openness and provide resources for Egyptians to address issues themselves, rather than openly supporting opposition movements. Dunn of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace emphasizes the need for foreign governments to press the Egyptian government to maintain political space for dialogue between Islamists and secularists. Congress funds reform programs in Egypt through USAID and MEPI. The Egyptian government's restrictions on political space have caused frustration in the West. The Egypt Office, MEPI, HRDF, and NED's Muslim Democracy Program are programs aimed at promoting reform in Arab countries. Congress ensures that U.S. foreign assistance for Egypt is used to promote democracy and governance activities without prior approval from the Egyptian government. The FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act designates $100 million for USAID education and democracy programs in Egypt, with a requirement that at least 50% of funds for democracy and governance be provided through non-governmental organizations. In FY2007, an amendment to reallocate $100 million in economic aid was narrowly defeated in the House. The Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill aimed to redirect $100 million from economic aid to Egypt towards global AIDS efforts and assisting Darfur. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, a key U.S. ally, faces challenges due to Hamas gains in Gaza and the West Bank, potentially leading to closer ties with Hamas sympathizers in Jordan. Jordanian government works to promote a unique national identity to counter Palestinian nationalism and Islamism. The Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood has a long history in Jordan, integrated into the political mainstream with fluctuating relations with the Palace. It has been recognized as a charitable organization and later as a quasi-political organization, openly participating in parliamentary elections under the name Islamic Action Front (IAF). The relationship between the Brotherhood and the Palace has been mutually beneficial over the years. The Brotherhood in Jordan has been politically beneficial for the monarchy, especially during conflicts with Arab nationalists and secular Palestinian nationalism. They gained control of the education system after supporting King Hussein during the Black September crisis. Through charitable networks, they established Sunni Muslim schools and higher education institutions. The Brotherhood in Jordan has extensive educational, social, and health services, with a budget rivaling the government's. The Islamist Action Front (IAF) became a political party in 1992, but electoral law changes favored tribal candidates over ideological parties like the IAF. Urban middle-class Jordanians of Palestinian descent mainly supported the IAF. The Islamic Action Front (IAF) in Jordan, supported by urban middle-class Jordanians of Palestinian origin, faced challenges in government relations and boycotted the 1997 elections. In the 2003 parliamentary elections, the IAF won 22% of the vote, gaining 18 seats in the lower house. Despite doubts about winning a majority due to unchanged laws, the IAF aimed for fair participation. Speculation arose in 2006 about the IAF's ties to Hamas, with the new secretary general emphasizing their stance in an interview. The new secretary general of the IAF emphasized the organization's independence from Hamas. Jordan initially welcomed Hamas after their election win but later cancelled a visit over allegations of hidden weapons. Hamas denied the charges, citing political motives. Hamas had been expelled from Jordan in 1999. The IAF questions Jordanian government's accusations against Hamas, suspecting fabrication to discredit Islamists. Experts note a trend towards a growing Palestinian presence in IAF leadership, potentially leading to a \"Hamasization\" of the group. IAF's stance towards the US combines pragmatism with opposition to US policies in the region. Observers doubt non-violent Islamist groups in Jordan can afford to sever ties with the US due to the country's growing population and severe lack of natural resources. The IAF in Jordan opposes the peace treaty with Israel and calls for cutting ties. In 2006, IAF members were arrested for praising Al Qaeda leader Zarqawi. Jordan relies on US and European aid, making it difficult for non-violent Islamist groups to sever ties with the US. Jordan relies on foreign assistance from the United States and Europe, emphasizing its reform efforts to position itself as a modernizing Arab state. The pursuit of reform programs aligns with U.S. policy priorities, aiming to address high unemployment rates and develop opportunities for the young population. A free trade agreement signed with the U.S. in 2000 led to a significant increase in Jordanian exports to American markets. Jordan's educational system has undergone reform with a $380 million, five-year plan supported by USAID, the World Bank, and others. The initiative, criticized by Islamist deputies, includes building computer labs in public schools and incorporating information technology in the curriculum. This has drawn backlash for teaching distinctions between terrorism and \"legitimate resistance.\" The United States pressured Arab and Muslim countries to modernize their school curriculum. In Jordan, the government faces challenges in improving institutions without being accused of outside influence. U.S. democracy assistance in Jordan focuses on increasing female participation in politics, including a quota for women parliamentarians and training programs for women candidates. The International Republican Institute runs programs in Jordan to increase citizen participation in politics. Jordan has been targeted by Jihadist terrorist groups, with a major attack in 2005. U.S. officials may be cautious in pushing for political reform in Jordan. There is limited engagement with the Islamic Action Front (IAF) by U.S. diplomats in Amman. King Abdullah and Jordanian officials stress the need for internal-driven reform. Foreign Minister Muasher emphasized agreement on reform content but opposes external imposition. US supports Jordan's economy and military, adjusting to the pace of political reform set by the government. Jordan has received increased aid from the US since 9/11 and the Iraq war, with annual average aid rising to $780 million from $246 million. The FY2006 Emergency Supplemental Bill includes $100 million in economic aid for Jordan's reforms."
