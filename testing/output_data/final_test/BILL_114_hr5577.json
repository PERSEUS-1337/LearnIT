    "content": "The Act titled \"Innovation in Offshore Leasing Act\" allows for internet-based offshore oil and gas lease sales. The Innovation in Offshore Leasing Act authorizes internet-based oil and gas lease sales through a sealed-bidding process to maximize returns, reduce fraud, and ensure fairness. Sales must include digital bid delivery and bidder verification processes. The Innovation in Offshore Leasing Act includes bidder verification processes, a designee to observe bid readings, and data security measures to ensure transparency and prevent wrongdoing in internet-based oil and gas lease sales. The Secretary must publicly disclose statistical data on each lease sale, including high bid value, number of tracts and acres offered, number of bids, and more, on the day of the sale. The statistical data disclosed for each lease sale includes total number of bids, average bids per tract, total bidders participating, bidding statistics by water depth, bidder names and bid amounts per tract, number of bids per tract by water depth, tract with most bids, tract with highest bid, and any other relevant statistical data. The Secretary ensures data transparency for lease sales, making all data publicly available online in machine-readable format. Before the first Internet-based lease sale, the Secretary requests information from companies present at recent oil and gas lease sales. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act aims to gather input from the public on Internet-based leasing. The Secretary will integrate suggestions and conduct user workshops before lease sales. The deadline for Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale is 18 months after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct Internet-based lease sales for Gulf of Mexico acreage. A thorough analysis of these sales will be sent to Congress within 90 days after the third sale, including estimates of bidder numbers and bid amounts. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct Internet-based lease sales for Gulf of Mexico acreage. A report to Congress will include cost comparisons, feedback from participants, and evaluations of lease sale structures to maximize bidder participation and ensure integrity. The House of Representatives passed the document on September 6, 2016, with Karen L. Haas as the Clerk."
