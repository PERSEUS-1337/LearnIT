However, many teachers feel unheard at higher levels of education administration, hindering their engagement in reforms. Leveraging teachers' expertise is essential for addressing education challenges effectively. Empowering teachers to lead beyond the classroom will demonstrate trust and respect for their expertise, improving teaching and student outcomes. The Act aims to empower teachers to develop projects that improve teaching and student outcomes by addressing challenges in the education system. It includes a grant program to support these initiatives.

Grants are for a maximum of five years, with at least 90% reserved for subgrants. Nonprofit organizations can apply for grants to award subgrants for teacher-led projects. The grant can be used for administrative purposes up to 10%. The application must demonstrate the ability to operate a program reaching at least 100,000 students and manage the subgrant program. The organization should also describe how it will provide outreach and solicit subgrant applications nationwide. The grant program allows nonprofit organizations to award subgrants for teacher-led projects in various areas. The program includes conducting a subgrant competition, peer review of applications, providing technical assistance, monitoring project implementation, and promoting collaboration among participants.
