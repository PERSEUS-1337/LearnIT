    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new credit for charitable contributions to certain private charities assisting the poor under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The tax code allows individuals to claim a credit for qualified charitable contributions made during the taxable year, with a limit of $100 ($200 for joint returns). A qualified charitable contribution is defined as a cash donation to a qualified charity, with details of each contribution and recipient required on the tax return. A qualified charity is any organization that meets the criteria specified for the taxpayer. A qualified charity, as defined by the tax code, is an organization certified by the Secretary under section 501(c)(3) and exempt from tax under section 501(a). The charity must primarily assist the poor by providing services to individuals with incomes not exceeding 150 percent of the official poverty line. The organization must ensure that its annual exempt purpose expenditures are at least 70 percent of its annual aggregate expenditures to meet the requirements for a qualified charity under the tax code. The tax code requires organizations to ensure that their annual expenditures include administrative expenses, expenses for influencing legislation, fundraising expenses, and litigation expenses. Contributions made by the taxpayer before the deadline for filing the tax return can be treated as made on the last day of the taxable year. The tax code requires organizations to include various expenses in their annual expenditures. Contributions made before the tax return deadline are considered as made on the last day of the taxable year. The credit for charitable contributions is in lieu of any deduction allowable under the chapter. Taxpayers can elect to not apply this section for a taxable year. Qualified charities must provide copies of their annual return for charities receiving creditable contributions. Qualified charities must provide a copy of their annual return to individuals upon request at no charge, except for reproduction and mailing costs. The request can be made in person for immediate access or within 30 days if made otherwise. This provision is applicable for a 3-year period starting from the filing date of the return. Clerical Amendment: A new item is added to the table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code after section 22. The section provides a credit for certain charitable contributions, with amendments applying to contributions made after the 90th day following the enactment of the Act in taxable years ending after that date. Additionally, there is a repeal of certain changes made in the earned income credit. SEC. 2. REPEAL OF CERTAIN CHANGES MADE IN THE EARNED INCOME CREDIT. This section repeals the credit for individuals without children and increases in the amount of credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The earned income credit percentages for eligible individuals with qualifying children are 34% for 1 child and 36% for 2 or more children, with phaseout percentages of 15.98% and 20.22% respectively. Earned income and phaseout amounts are determined accordingly. For an eligible individual with 1 qualifying child, the earned income amount is $6,000 and the phaseout amount is $11,000. For 2 or more qualifying children, the earned income amount is $8,425 with a phaseout amount of $11,000. Paragraph (1) of section 32(i) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to replace \"subsection (b)(2)(A)\" with \"subsection (b)(2)\".
