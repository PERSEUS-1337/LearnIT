    "content": "The proportion of high school graduates with parents lacking a college degree has decreased over the last three decades, while the percentage of college graduates in the U.S. population has increased. The proportion of first-generation college students has also declined, coinciding with the rise in educational attainment. The percentage of high school graduates from low-income families has remained stable at around 21% over the past 30 years. The proportion of low-income and first-generation college students has modestly declined from 1987 to 2000. The representation of these students in college enrollment has consistently been lower than in high school graduation. High school graduates from low-income families and those without a parent with a college degree are less likely to enroll in college. The rate of college enrollment for the high school class of 2000 was 53%, with parental educational attainment and family income strongly influencing enrollment. Those with parents who did not attain a Bachelor's degree had a 46% enrollment rate, while those with parents holding a Bachelor's degree had a 75% enrollment rate. High school graduates from low-income families and those without a parent with a college degree are less likely to enroll in college. The rates of enrollment for the fall of 2000 were 35% for those from families below 150% of the poverty line and 58% for those above 150% of poverty. High school graduates from families below 150% of poverty were over 50% more likely not to be enrolled in college the fall after graduation as those from families above 150% of poverty (65% compared to 42%). The figures in Tables 1 and 2 show the strong link between parents' socio-economic status and their children's college attendance. Research since the late 1960s has highlighted the importance of class background in determining college enrollment. Factors like family income, parent's education, educational aspirations, and college preparedness are positively associated with college attendance. Table 3 examines the impact of first-generation status and family income on college enrollment rates in 2000. Table 3 shows college enrollment rates in fall 2000 for high school graduates based on parental educational attainment and family income. Among low-income families, parental education does not significantly affect enrollment. However, for students above 150% of poverty, parental education strongly influences college attendance. Graduates with parents without a Bachelor's degree had a 51% enrollment rate, compared to 75% for those with parents who have a Bachelor's degree. Rates of college enrollment vary by family income and parental educational attainment. Low-income and first-generation students had lower enrollment rates compared to the overall rate for 2000 high school graduates. First-generation status was found to have little association with the enrollment rate of low-income students but was strongly associated with students from higher-income families. This has implications for TRIO programs, which require two-thirds of participants to be low-income and first-generation students. The study suggests that first-generation status does not affect the enrollment rate of low-income students, but it does impact students from higher-income families. This raises the question of potentially amending the requirement for TRIO programs to include students at higher income levels affected by first-generation status."
