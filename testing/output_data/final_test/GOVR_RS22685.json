    "content": "U.S. copyright law does not protect useful articles like fashion designs due to their utilitarian value. Legislation to extend design protection to fashion design has been introduced in multiple Congresses but not passed. The Copyright Act does not protect useful articles like fashion designs due to their utilitarian function. However, certain aesthetic aspects of useful articles can receive copyright protection if they can be identified separately from the utilitarian aspects. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to extend design protection to fashion designs. Protection for aspects of utilitarian articles that fall into the categories of \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural\" works is permitted under copyright law. The separability test allows for limited protection of designs of useful articles, with trade dress and design patents also offering potential means of protection for fashion designs. The Copyright Act provides unique protection for vessel hull and deck designs for a period of 10 years, granted upon registration within two years of being made public. The owner of a protected design has exclusive rights to make, import, or sell articles embodying the design. Fashion design owners could be granted exclusive rights to their designs under Chapter 13 of the Copyright Act, preventing others from copying, importing, selling, or distributing their designs without authorization. Proposed acts aimed to provide three-year copyright protection for fashion designs, but did not progress in legislation. The House Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate Judiciary Committee considered bills to amend Chapter 13 of the Copyright Act to grant protection to fashion designs. The bills aimed to expand the definition of \"useful article\" to include apparel designs, but did not pass in the 111th Congress. The bills aimed to expand the definition of \"useful article\" to include apparel designs, adding definitions for \"fashion design,\" \"design,\" and \"apparel.\" The broad definition of \"apparel\" includes clothing, accessories, and bags, while \"fashion design\" had specific qualifications for protection. The bills aimed to expand the definition of \"useful article\" to include apparel designs, adding definitions for \"fashion design,\" \"design,\" and \"apparel.\" The definition of \"design\" includes the appearance of an article of apparel, with original elements that provide a unique variation over prior designs. The additional requirements in S. 3728 suggest that fewer fashion designs would likely be eligible for protection compared to H.R. 2196. Both H.R. 2196 and S. 3728 aimed to amend the Copyright Act to provide a three-year term of protection for fashion designs. This shorter term was proposed to protect high-end designs from being copied and sold at lower prices due to quickly changing trends. The proposed bills aimed to amend the Copyright Act to protect fashion designs for a three-year term. This shorter term was suggested to prevent high-end designs from being copied and sold at lower prices due to rapidly changing trends. H.R. 2196 would have added fashion design registration within a six-month window after being made public, similar to vessel hull and deck design protection. The proposed bill, H.R. 2196, aimed to protect fashion designs for a three-year term by requiring prompt registration to claim design protection. The bill would have established a two-year registration window for vessel hull and deck designs, while fashion designs would need to be registered with the Register of Copyrights within six months of being made public. Additionally, the legislation mandated a brief description of the design to be included in a new searchable electronic database. S. 3728 did not require fashion designs to be registered with the Copyright Office for protection, unlike H.R. 2196. Protection under S. 3728 arises upon the design's creation. The bill aimed to establish a searchable electronic database containing information on protected fashion designs, including owner contact information, design details, and public release date. The legislation required a database with visual representations of fashion designs, accessible to the public for free. Copyright Act Section 1302 outlines criteria for design protection, excluding designs that are not original or commonplace. The Copyright Act Section 1302 outlines criteria for design protection, excluding designs that are not original or commonplace. Protection is available for designs that are variants commonly used in relevant trades, dictated by utilitarian function, or made public more than 2 years before registration. Proposed amendments would limit protection for fashion designs made public more than six months before registration. The proposed amendments to the Copyright Act would limit protection for fashion designs made public more than six months before registration. The bills aim to exclude certain criteria, such as the presence of specific colors or graphic works on fabric, in determining the originality of a fashion design or infringement. Section 1309 of the Copyright Act defines infringement of a design of a useful article. Section 1309 of the Copyright Act defines infringement of a design of a useful article, including selling or distributing infringing articles and inducing others to make or import them. There is an exception for innocent infringement if the design was created without knowledge of its protection. H.R. 2196 aimed to narrow this exception. H.R. 2196 and S. 3728 aimed to amend the \"innocent infringement\" exception for design protection. S. 3728 specified that infringement occurs if one had actual knowledge or knowledge that can be reasonably inferred from the circumstances that a design was protected and copied. Both bills also added protection for images of fashion designs and included actions like \"offer for sale\" and \"advertise\" as infringing activities. The proposed legislation aimed to amend the design protection laws by addressing infringement issues, including secondary liability. However, concerns led to the removal of the secondary liability section from the bill. Additionally, changes were proposed to increase damages for infringement. The proposed legislation aimed to amend design protection laws by increasing damages for infringement from $50,000 or $1 per copy to $250,000 or $5 per copy. Both bills defined \"infringing article\" as a copied design without consent, with exceptions for certain mediums. H.R. 2196 included limitations on infringement liability for original articles not closely similar to protected designs or reflecting a trend. The bill proposed establishing limitations on liability for infringement, including cases where the allegedly infringing article is not substantially identical to the original design, is independently created, or is produced for non-commercial personal use. Whoever makes a false representation to obtain design registration under this chapter shall pay a penalty of $500 to $1,000 and forfeit any rights in the design. Proposed bills H.R. 2196 and S. 3728 aimed to increase the penalty to $5,000 to $10,000 for false representation. The Copyright Act requires registration before suing for infringement, a requirement unchanged by H.R. 2196. S. 3728 aimed to amend Section 1321 to allow fashion designers to sue for infringement without registration. There are differing opinions on granting copyright protection to fashion design, with proponents arguing for recognition of creative expression and the impact of technology on design copying. The impact of modern technology on copying fashion designs is highlighted, with easy access to runway photos online. Young designers are particularly vulnerable to having their work quickly copied by established competitors. Supporters argue for copyright protection, citing success in other countries. Opponents believe copying is integral to the fashion industry and fear increased litigation and stifled creativity if copyright protection is granted. Critics argue that fashion design protection may stifle production and limit consumer choice. They point out that even in countries with design protection laws, copying still occurs to the same extent as in the U.S. where there is no such protection."
