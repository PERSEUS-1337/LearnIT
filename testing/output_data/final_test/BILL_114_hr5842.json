    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Helping Our Veterans with Chronic Pain and Opioid Addiction Act of 2016\". The findings and sense of Congress are also included in the Act. Many veterans and their families have been affected by the national opioid epidemic, with prescription opioid overdose rates for veterans receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs being twice the national average. Over 50% of veterans receiving care suffer from chronic pain, and almost one in three are prescribed opioids for pain management, putting them at risk of dependency. Many veterans receive healthcare from both the Department and community providers, highlighting a lack of comprehensive care. Veterans receiving care from Department and community providers lack care coordination, leading to poor health outcomes and inefficient use of resources. Veteran-centric care coordination improves patient outcomes. Congress believes veterans with opioid dependency should have timely access to treatment managed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Department of Veterans Affairs must ensure veterans receiving opioid addiction treatment in the community maintain high-quality care coordination and veteran-centric elements. Care purchased from community providers should be cost-effective and complement the larger health care system. The pilot program aims to improve treatment for veterans with opioid addiction and chronic pain. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a pilot program providing health services for veterans with opioid addiction and chronic pain in five different states with Department medical facilities. States demonstrating the need for additional resources to provide health care services, including mental health, chronic pain management, and social services to veterans with opioid abuse. This includes areas with high rates of opioid addiction and a lack of capacity in Department facilities for treatment. The selected States must meet specific requirements, including serving highly rural and urban counties with high rates of opioid addiction. The Secretary may provide health care services to veterans in counties with high rates of opioid addiction, drug overdose deaths, low funding for substance abuse treatment, and high rates of veterans with chronic pain and prescription opioids. The Secretary can provide health care services to veterans through contracts with qualified non-Department providers. A functional capability for exchanging medical information must be developed. The Secretary must submit an annual report to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs assessing the pilot program. The Secretary assesses the pilot program yearly, considering cost, volume, quality, patient satisfaction, and benefits to veterans. Recommendations include continuing, expanding, or making the program permanent for covered veterans enrolled in the patient enrollment system. The pilot program established under section 1705(a) of title 38, United States Code, is for veterans eligible for health care under section 1710(e)(3)(C) or in need of treatment for opioid addiction and chronic pain. The program will terminate three years after its commencement. Assessment of department and non-department capabilities for treating opioid dependency and ensuring access to health care services. The Secretary will assess the Department of Veterans Affairs' capabilities for providing health care services related to opioid dependency and abuse, chronic pain management without opioids, and evidence-based methods for reducing opioid doses safely. This includes treatments such as mental health services, opioid agonist treatment, alternative therapies like physical therapy and acupuncture, and non-opioid chronic pain management. The Secretary will assess the Department of Veterans Affairs' capabilities for providing health care services related to opioid dependency, chronic pain management without opioids, and evidence-based methods for reducing opioid doses safely. This includes assessing community providers for necessary health care, mental health, social services, and alternative chronic pain management treatments for veterans. The Secretary will assess the Department of Veterans Affairs' capabilities for providing health care services related to opioid dependency, chronic pain management without opioids, and evidence-based methods for reducing opioid doses safely. Community providers will be evaluated for their ability to offer health care services for opioid dependency, mental health, social services, and non-opioid chronic pain management. A comprehensive report on the assessment results and any implementation plans will be submitted to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs within one year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will assess the Department of Veterans Affairs' capabilities for providing health care services related to opioid dependency, chronic pain management, and reducing opioid doses safely. Recommendations will be made to improve health care services for veterans needing treatment for pain management and opioid addiction. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will require all appropriate facilities to have naloxone or other medication for reversing opioid overdose and ensure employees receive training on its administration."
