    "content": "State-of-the-art results in imitation learning are currently achieved through adversarial methods that estimate the difference between student and expert policies to improve imitation policy. However, imitation learning from observations alone has not seen the same level of success. Recent work in adversarial methods for generative models has shown that the choice of measure to judge the discrepancy between real and synthetic samples significantly impacts model performance. While choices like Wasserstein distance and $f$-divergences have been explored in adversarial networks, the existing imitation-learning framework using $f$-divergences faces numerical instabilities. This work reparameterizes adversarial imitation learning as $f$-divergence minimization and extends the framework to handle imitation from observations only. This work reparameterizes adversarial imitation learning as $f$-divergence minimization to handle imitation from observations only. The design choices for coupling imitation learning and $f$-divergences are crucial for successful imitation policies, outperforming baseline approaches in continuous-control tasks. High-dimensional observations still show a significant performance gap, indicating potential for future research. Recent work has reparameterized adversarial imitation learning as $f$-divergence minimization to handle imitation from observations only. This approach aims to overcome challenges in accessing optimal expert action labels, which can be laborious or costly to obtain. By utilizing trajectories annotated with expert actions, this learning paradigm offers a powerful alternative to standard reinforcement learning, especially in tasks with complex or unspecified reward functions. Recent work has explored a more natural problem formulation where an agent learns an imitation policy from expert observation sequences, known as Imitation Learning from Observations (ILfO). This setting has the potential to enable learning complex tasks from freely available videos but comes with additional challenges. The paper incorporates generative-adversarial training of deep neural networks to advance the state-of-the-art in ILfO, aiming to enable sample-efficient imitation from expert demonstrations with or without expert action labels. The paper explores the use of generative-adversarial networks for Imitation Learning from Observations (ILfO) to improve sample-efficient imitation from expert demonstrations, with or without expert action labels. Nowozin et al. (2016) introduce Variational Divergence Minimization (VDM) as a generalization of the generative-adversarial approach. In the context of Imitation Learning from Observations (ILfO), the paper discusses the use of generative-adversarial networks and Variational Divergence Minimization (VDM) to improve sample-efficient imitation from expert demonstrations. Existing work combining adversarial IL and f-divergences fails to consider the optimization differences in generator policy-gradient reinforcement learning, resulting in algorithms that struggle in high-dimensional observation environments. The paper explores the VDM principle and alternative f-divergences in the context of Imitation Learning (IL) and ILfO. It reparameterizes the IL framework to allow for transparent choices in designing adversarial imitation algorithms. A single instantiation of the framework enables stable training of policies across various f-divergences, leading to superior results. The framework is extended to ILfO, showing efficacy in continuous-control tasks in the MuJoCo domain. Empirical results validate the framework as a unification of adversarial imitation methods under the VDM principle. Recent advances in stabilizing regularization for adversarial training have led to improvements in performance under an appropriate choice of f-divergence. However, there is still a significant performance gap between recovered imitation policies and expert behavior for tasks with high dimensional observations, leaving room for future work in developing improved ILfO algorithms. These algorithms align with inverse reinforcement learning approaches and have seen success with hand-engineered feature representations in the past. The recent surge in using deep neural networks has further advanced these algorithms. In recent years, deep neural networks have enabled approaches to scale to high-dimensional observations in control problems. Adversarial methods, particularly Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), have shown widespread effectiveness in imitation tasks without the need for interactive experts. GAIL leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce high-fidelity imitation policies and achieve state-of-the-art results in continuous-control benchmarks. Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to optimize a reward function for imitation policy learning. It aims to shift the agent's behavior closer to that of the expert by discriminating between state-action pairs visited by the imitation and expert policies. Recent research has focused on the challenging task of imitation learning from observation. The ILfO problem involves learning from expert demonstration data without expert action labels. Early approaches use expert observation sequences to learn a semantic embedding space for reinforcement learning. Torabi et al. (2018a) introduce Behavioral Cloning from Observation (BCO) which trains an inverse dynamics model using state-action trajectories collected under a random policy. Generative Adversarial Imitation from Observation (GAIFO) is introduced as a natural counterpart to Behavioral Cloning (BCO) for Inverse Learning from Observation (ILfO). GAIFO uses state transitions instead of state-action pairs, but falls short of expert performance in empirical results. This highlights the need for scalable ILfO algorithms to achieve expert performance. The text discusses the need for scalable ILfO algorithms to achieve expert performance, exploring alternative formulations of the GAN objective underlying GAIFO. It delves into imitation learning and f-divergences within the Markov Decision Process formalism. In Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IL), the agent learns from expert demonstrations instead of a concrete reward function. The goal is to synthesize a policy using the dataset of expert demonstrations D = {\u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 , . . . \u03c4 N } and access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP) M. The focus of our work is on adversarial methods in Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IL) using GAIL. GAIL leverages GANs to update a discriminator, D \u03c9 (s, a), distinguishing between expert and student state-action pairs. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning is then used to align the policy towards expert behavior, rewarding generated state-action pairs accordingly. The text discusses the use of GAIL in Inverse Reinforcement Learning, where a discriminator distinguishes between expert and student state-action pairs. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning aligns the policy with expert behavior by issuing higher rewards for expert state-action pairs. The reward function is based on the output of the discriminator neural network. An entropy regularization term is often added to avoid premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. In the context of Inverse Reinforcement Learning, GAIL is used to align the policy with expert behavior by distinguishing between expert and student state-action pairs. GAIFO is introduced as an extension of GAIL to match the state transition distribution of the expert policy, providing per-timestep feedback without temporal alignment issues. The algorithm iteratively minimizes a maximization problem to achieve this goal. The curr_chunk discusses the solution to a minimax optimization problem using stationary distributions and a binary classifier. It also introduces f-divergences and their impact on Inverse Reinforcement Learning through the f-VIM framework. The approach for minimizing f-divergences in ILfO is presented. The curr_chunk discusses various f-divergences and activation functions used in the study, along with regularization techniques for stabilizing discriminator training. It focuses on a more general class of divergences, including the Jensen-Shannon divergence, known as Ali-Silvey distances or f-divergences. The f-divergence between probability distributions over domain X with continuous densities p and q is calculated using a convex, lower-semicontinuous function f. Different choices of f yield well-known divergences. Nguyen et al. (2010) propose a variational estimation approach for f-divergences using the convex conjugate function. Nowozin et al. (2016) extend this method for GANs that utilize arbitrary f-divergences, or f-GANs. The variational lower bound for GANs, known as f-GANs, involves two distributions: the real data distribution P and a synthetic distribution Q \u03b8 generated by a model with parameters \u03b8. The discriminator is parameterized as T \u03c9, leading to the VDM principle defining the f-GAN objective. Nowozin et al. (2016) introduced the unconstrained discriminator network X \u2192 R and an activation function g f : R \u2192 dom f * based on the f-divergence being optimized. They also provided effective choices for g f in their work. The f-GAN framework introduces f-Variational Imitation (f-VIM) for estimating and minimizing the divergence between expert and imitation policies. The discriminator network provides rewards for policy optimization, with experiments focusing on mode-seeking/mode-covering aspects of f-divergences in imitation learning. In the f-VIM framework, activation function choices play a critical role in defining the reward function optimized by the imitation policy. Activation choices have strong implications on learning success and efficiency in reinforcement learning. Activation choices in f-GANs are crucial for defining the reward function in imitation-learning algorithms. Specific activation choices for KL and reverse KL divergences led to numerical instabilities, causing the algorithms to fail in execution. The Total Variation distance in f-GANs requires a tanh activation for the variational function, leading to reward signals centered around 0. To address reward scale issues, a new activation function g f (v) = f * \u22121 (r(v)) is proposed, allowing practitioners to choose a reward function parameter r according to heuristics in deep reinforcement learning. The reparameterized saddlepoint optimization for f-VIM involves selecting g f accordingly, with per-timestep rewards given by r(s, a, s) = r(V \u03c9 (s, a)). By considering r(u) = \u03c3(u), where \u03c3(\u00b7) is the sigmoid function, bounded rewards in the interval [0, 1] are achieved, aligning with the f-divergences examined. Evaluation of imitation-learning algorithms using this choice against f-GAN activations shows varied results, highlighting the importance of reward scale and the underlying reinforcement-learning problem being solved. The f-VIMO extension addresses issues with f-GAN activation choices in imitation learning algorithms. It leverages the VDM principle in saddle-point optimization and uses policy-gradient reinforcement learning for generator optimization. The f-VIMO objective includes per-timestep rewards based on r(s, a, s) = r(V \u03c9 (s, s )). The discriminator outputs scale the policy gradient, unlike traditional discriminator optimization. The reparameterization of the f-VIM framework focuses on scaling the policy gradient using discriminator outputs, addressing instability issues in generator optimization during adversarial training. Regularizing the discriminator side of the optimization is also explored for improved stability. Alternative choices for activation functions are left for future investigation. The optimization for improved stability in GANs involves gradient-based regularization to disincentivize the discriminator from deviating from the Nash equilibrium. This regularization term controls the strength of the penalty to ensure convergence properties. In adversarial imitation learning, regularization term R(\u03c9) improves stability and convergence of f -VIMO across various domains. Evaluation conducted in four MuJoCo environments with different f -divergence choices: GAN, Kullback-Leibler, reverse KL, and Total Variation. The study evaluates the impact of activation choice on imitation policy performance in f-VIM, the significance of f-divergences in IL algorithms, and the effect of discriminator regularization on f-VIM stability. Expert demonstration data's influence on f-divergences is also examined through reward analysis in OpenAI Gym environments. The study uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training the imitation policy with specific parameters. Generalized Advantage Estimation is applied with certain parameters, and f-VIM and f-VIMO are run for 500 iterations. The policy and discriminator architectures consist of two separate multi-layer perceptrons. The study utilized Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training the imitation policy with specific parameters, including two hidden layers of 100 units separated by tanh nonlinearities. A grid search determined the initial learning rate and number of epochs for discriminator training. Results were reported for the best hyperparameter settings. The study also examined the impact of expert demonstrations on algorithm performance, varying from 1 to 15 demonstrations. Results were compared to the original f-VIM framework and its natural ILfO counterpart to validate modifications to the framework. In experiments using KL and reverse KL divergences, completion was hindered by numerical instabilities from exploding policy gradients. Results for Total Variation distance showed stagnation in learning with original f-GAN activation. Varying divergence in f-VIM and f-VIMO across domains was assessed, highlighting the need to examine each domain individually. In the ILfO setting, different choices of f-divergence such as KL, TV, RKL, and GAN have shown to produce near-optimal imitation policies in specific domains like Hopper, HalfCheetah, and Walker. The use of discriminator regularization is crucial for performance gains in ILfO but generally fails to help in the IL setting. The Ant domain remains challenging for ILfO algorithms. In the ILfO setting, different f-divergences like KL, TV, RKL, and GAN have shown to produce optimal imitation policies in specific domains. However, discriminator regularization hinders learning in both IL and ILfO settings. The gap between state-of-the-art and expert performance remains unchanged, posing a challenge for future work. Certain f-divergences are more robust with less expert data, with KL-VIM and TV-VIM outperforming GAIL with a single expert demonstration. In the ILfO setting, certain f-divergences like KL and TV show promise in producing optimal imitation policies with minimal expert data. Future improvements may come from exploring alternative f-divergences and variational function activations. Discriminator regularization has been found to hinder learning in both IL and ILfO settings. In this work, a general framework for imitation learning and imitation learning from observations under arbitrary choices of f-divergence is presented. The success of Total Variation distance in experiments suggests future work on IPM-based ILfO algorithms. Empirical validation shows overcoming prior shortcomings and offering a wide class of IL and ILfO algorithms capable of scaling to larger problems. In the context of Learning from Demonstrations (LfD), two main approaches are discussed: Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). BC treats demonstration data as input-output pairs for supervised learning, while IRL estimates the reward function used by the expert policy and applies reinforcement learning algorithms. In the context of Learning from Demonstrations (LfD), two main approaches are discussed: Behavioral Cloning (BC) and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). BC treats demonstration data as input-output pairs for supervised learning, while IRL estimates the reward function used by the expert policy and applies reinforcement-learning algorithms to recover the imitation policy. Various approaches at the intersection of IL and reinforcement learning are also acknowledged, with a mention of preventative measures for covariate shift and methods like DAgger for a more principled solution. In the realm of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), methods like DAgger and its successors address covariate shift by obtaining action labels from an expert. Recent advancements leverage deep neural networks to handle raw, high-dimensional data in real-world control tasks. Our work focuses on adversarial methods, specifically Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), which leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce high-fidelity imitation policies. GAIL achieves state-of-the-art results in continuous-control benchmarks by optimizing a parameterized reward function iteratively. The text chunk discusses optimizing a reward function to shift the agent's behavior closer to that of an expert using policy-gradient reinforcement learning. It also mentions the challenging problem of imitation learning from observation and leveraging publicly-available data for observational learning. The ILfO problem involves learning from expert demonstration data without expert action labels. Approaches use expert observation sequences to minimize a cost signal through reinforcement learning. An empirical evaluation of the f-VIM framework shows issues with design choices when coupled with adversarial IL and training the generator via policy-gradient reinforcement learning. In the f-VIM framework, the generator is trained using policy-gradient reinforcement learning instead of direct backpropagation. The framework is extended to the IFO problem (f-VIMO) and compared against GAIFO. Experiments were conducted in MuJoCo environments with continuous observation and action spaces. All algorithms were trained for 500 iterations, collecting 50,000 environment transitions per iteration. The paper advocates for using a variational lower bound for f-divergence in f-VIM and f-VIMO. It highlights the importance of the reward function choice for stability and convergence in adversarial IL/ILfO algorithms. The lower bound involves swapping the positions of two distributions, resulting in an activation function applied to the output of the discriminator. The codomain of the activation function must adhere to the domain of the convex conjugate. The original unswapped bound in Equation 11 outperforms variants with the distributions swapper in the Ant and Hopper domains for both IL and ILfO settings. The KL-VIM in the Ant domain no longer achieves expert performance when optimizing the swapped bound."
