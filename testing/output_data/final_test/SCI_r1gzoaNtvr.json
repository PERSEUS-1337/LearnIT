    "content": "Recent work has explored the emergence of compositional language among deep reinforcement learning agents collaborating to solve tasks. Evolutionary linguists have found that cultural transmission dynamics play a significant role in the development of compositionality. Introducing cultural evolutionary dynamics by periodically replacing agents in a population encourages better compositional generalization in resulting languages. Compositionality reflects a disentangled understanding of the world. Compositionality is crucial in language as it enables the expression of numerous concepts using a limited set of elements. Agents with compositional understanding can generalize correctly even with limited training examples. Developing artificial agents that grasp and produce compositional language could enhance generalization and human-AI interactions. Evolutionary linguistics studies how compositionality emerges in human languages through cultural transmission dynamics. Cultural transmission of language occurs when a group of agents pass their language on to a new group, allowing the language to change over time via cultural evolution. This process explains the emergence of compositionality as a result of expressivity and compressibility. Studies in evolutionary linguistics show the emergence of compositional languages in both simulations and with human subjects. The goal is to understand and design artificial neural networks. Recent work in AI has focused on studying language emergence in multi-agent, goal-driven tasks. Agent languages have been shown to emerge for coordination-centric tasks without direct language supervision. However, these languages are often non-compositional and challenging to interpret. Some studies have explored ways to encourage compositional language formation. This work bridges the gap by examining the impact of generational cultural transmission on the compositionality of emergent languages. The study explores the effect of generational cultural transmission on the compositionality of emergent languages in a multi-agent, goal-driven setting. New agents learn language from older agents, leading to more compositional languages over time in a cooperative dialog-based reference game involving discrete symbols. The study examines the impact of cultural transmission on emergent languages in a multi-agent setting. Periodically re-initializing agents induces cultural transmission, resulting in more generalizable language. The method introduces implicit cultural transmission in neural language models. The study introduces a method for inducing implicit cultural transmission in neural language models, showing an increase in compositionality from 13% to 46% accuracy on a novel test set. This is complemented by previous priors encouraging compositionality. The cooperative Task & Talk reference game is used to demonstrate the cultural transmission procedure, where two agents exchange single-token utterances to retrieve attributes of an object. The study introduces a method for inducing implicit cultural transmission in neural language models through a cooperative Task & Talk reference game. Agents exchange single-token utterances to retrieve object attributes, leading to the emergence of a language grounded in objects. Compositional solutions involve question-answer style dialogs where agents query for specific attributes. Agents must learn to associate meanings to words without grounding supervision, making the emergence of compositional languages unlikely by chance. In a cooperative Task & Talk reference game, agents use compositional language to generalize to novel instances. Agent policies Q-bot and A-bot, parameterized by neural networks Q and A, communicate through question-answer style dialogs to predict attribute pairs. Both agents are rewarded only if both attributes are correctly identified. The emergence of compositional languages is unlikely by chance, requiring agents to associate meanings to words without grounding supervision. The text discusses the use of neural network architectures in measuring compositional generalization in a synthetic dataset. It evaluates compositionality by testing on 12 random instances and highlights shortcomings in the evaluation protocol. The text discusses the evaluation of compositional generalization using neural network architectures on a synthetic dataset. It addresses issues with the evaluation protocol by reporting results from multiple training runs with different random seeds and introducing a harder dataset where all instances for a set of attribute pairs are withheld. In a study on compositional generalization using neural networks, a new challenging dataset is introduced where instances for certain attribute pairs are withheld. This new setting requires a stricter notion of compositionality aligned with human intuitions. The goal-driven nature of the reference game already promotes expressivity, but to introduce compressibility pressure, a population of agents is introduced. In evolutionary linguistics, a population of agents interact to adopt a unified language through implicit cultural transmission. Agents with different parameters are paired to communicate and receive updates, promoting the use of a common language. Reinitialized agents receive rewards faster when using language understood by their partners, encouraging the adoption of 'compressible' languages. Agents in a population must model linguistic differences between conversational partners to adopt a common language. Introducing multiple agents can increase language diversity and improve generalization. Generational pressure, where some agents know less than others, also plays a role in language adoption. Generational pressure is important for compositionality in the setting of multiple agents. To create 'generations', agents are periodically replaced using a strategy \u03c0. Three settings of \u03c0 are investigated: Uniform Random, Epsilon Greedy, and Oldest. The evaluation is done on a modified Task & Talk dataset and the original dataset. The study examined different settings to study conditions for compositionality emergence in a multi-agent setting. Results are reported from 16 trials with accuracy based on Q-bot getting both task elements correct. Different settings include Memoryless + Minimal Vocabulary showing best compositional generalization. In a study on compositionality emergence in a multi-agent setting, different settings were examined. Results showed that Memoryless + Minimal Vocabulary setting had the best compositional generalization. A-bots and Q-bots were trained with specific parameters and optimizer. Cultural transmission variations outperformed baselines in a harder dataset. In a study on compositionality emergence in a multi-agent setting, different settings were examined. Results showed that Memoryless + Minimal Vocabulary setting had the best compositional generalization. A-bots and Q-bots were trained with specific parameters and optimizer. Cultural transmission variations (darker blue bars) outperform the baselines where language does not change over generations. Training stopped after 8 generations (199000 epochs Multi Agent; 39000 epochs Single Agent). Negative mining was not performed. Baselines were considered to isolate the effect of the approach, including Single Agent Populations and No Replacement scenarios. Cultural transmission approaches outperform baselines in multi-agent experiments, showing gains from replacement strategy. Results with standard deviations against a harder dataset are reported. Dependent paired t-tests were used to compare methods and models, with significant differences found. In multi-agent experiments, cultural transmission approaches show significant improvements over baselines, supporting the claim that they encourage compositional language. Population dynamics without replacement generally lead to some level of compositionality, with Multi Agent No Replacement policies typically outperforming Single Agent No Replacement policies. Variations in replacement strategy do not significantly affect performance. The Multi Agent Uniform Random/Epsilon Greedy/Oldest replacement strategies do not significantly affect performance. It is not critical whether agents with worse language are replaced or if there is a pool of similarly typed agents. New agents learn best in the presence of others who already know a language. Cultural transmission complements factors that encourage compositionality. The Memoryless + Small Vocab model is the best, as noted in previous studies. Removing memory has minor effects and does not impact Single Agent settings. Adding cultural transmission to neural dialog agents improves compositional generalization of learned languages, complementing other priors. The relationship between memory and compositionality is unclear, with memory having a small effect in Multi Agent settings. The Memoryless + Overcomplete setting has not been reported before, suggesting the importance of cultural transmission. The impact of cultural transmission may not be directly measurable, as improvements could stem from other sources. The text discusses measuring cultural transmission in A-bots by comparing their language similarities in the same context. This approach helps determine if the language was culturally transmitted rather than emerging by chance. The focus is on how similar A-bots' languages are when describing objects, using the distribution of tokens. The text discusses measuring cultural transmission in A-bots by comparing their language similarities in the same context. It involves computing the KL divergence between two A-bots' language distributions and averaging over context to get a pairwise agent language similarity metric. The final measure of language similarity is obtained by averaging over all pairs of bots. The metric applies to a group of agents in Multi Agent settings. The language dissimilarity metric is measured for a group of agents in Multi Agent settings. Two new baselines are introduced, Single Agents Combined and Random Initialization, to evaluate language similarity. These baselines act as upper and lower bounds on language dissimilarity. The paired Single Agents show high dissimilarity compared to agents from Multi Agent populations. Replacement strategies result in increased language similarity among agents. Replacement strategies in Multi Agent settings lead to increased language similarity, indicating cultural transmission. This approach results in more compositional languages due to repeated teaching of new generations of agents. Visualizations of language learned by agents at different training stages support these findings. Our method induces cultural transmission in populations of bots, leading to the emergence of compositional language. The similarity between different pairs of bots suggests that language is indeed transmitted in our approach. The comparison between Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c shows language transmission in the approach. Fig. 4a summarizes a Single Agent No Replacement run, Fig. 4b shows dialogs between an old Q-bot and a re-initialized A-bot in a Multi Oldest run, and Fig. 4c displays dialogs between the same old Q-bot and an old A-bot from the same experiment. The A-bot trained with other bots has learned a compositional language, while the Single Agent A-bot has not. The language of the old A-bot in Fig. 4c is similar to the new one in Fig. 4b, leading to the same mistakes. The comparison between Fig. 4b and Fig. 4c shows language transmission in the approach, suggesting that language is transmitted between bots. Researchers have studied how unique properties of human language like compositionality could have emerged through a combination of innate cognitive capacity and cultural transmission. Explanations on how the cultural evolution of languages could cause structure like compositionality are abundant. Recent research has shown that cultural transmission plays a significant role in the emergence of linguistic structure, particularly in promoting compositionality. While previous work in deep learning has focused on biases that encourage compositionality, other factors are also being emphasized in evolutionary linguistics and deep learning studies. Recent research has shown that cultural transmission promotes compositionality in the emergence of linguistic structure. In deep learning, agents can develop their own language in multi-agent environments, driven by tasks requiring communication. Limiting vocabulary size can lead to the emergence of compositional language. Limiting vocabulary size encourages compositionality in the emergence of language among neural agents. Multi-agent interaction improves emergent translation but does not measure compositionality. Cultural transmission of ideas may help in escaping local minima in neural networks. Experiments support the idea that supervision of intermediate representations allows for more complex tasks. In this work, cultural transmission in deep neural dialog agents is investigated, focusing on language emergence. The role of periodic agent replacement in encouraging easy-to-teach languages and increasing efficiency in neural language transmission is explored. Co-evolving agents with language amplifies the effects observed in the study. The study explores cultural transmission in deep neural dialog agents for language emergence, favoring an implicit model over explicit models used in evolutionary linguistics. The research shows that language transmission aids agents in achieving their goals, leading to cultural transmission and compositionality. Future work includes investigating the impact of explicit cultural transmission on language structure and exploring cultural transmission as a prior for neural representations of non-language information. The study investigates cultural transmission in deep neural dialog agents for language emergence, emphasizing an implicit model. Results show that language transmission helps agents achieve goals, leading to cultural transmission and compositionality. The proposed approach outperforms models without replacement or multiple agents, with strategies for agent replacement outlined. In the study, models and replacement strategies for deep neural dialog agents are compared through dependent paired t-tests. Results are reported with p-values, and comparisons are shown in figures for single agent and multi-agent scenarios."
