    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts the following. Section 8670.11 requires the administrator to establish a schedule of drills and exercises with the US Coast Guard. Section 8670.12 authorizes the administrator to conduct studies and evaluations for improving oil spill response and wildlife rehabilitation, using funds from the Oil Spill Prevention and Administration Fund. The administrator must study the use of various spill response methods and update the federal California Dispersant Plan by May 1, 2016, based on current scientific literature. The study should be periodically updated to ensure the best protection possible. In individual cases, requirements may be established to provide the greatest protection without excessive costs. The administrator must evaluate the effectiveness and potential impacts of dispersants and other agents in oil spill response, considering environmental conditions and public health. Recommendations on their use should be based on scientific literature and studies by federal, state, and international entities. The administrator supports the federal Regional Response Team in developing plans for chemical agent use in California. They evaluate new technologies for oil spill response and submit reports to the Legislature on equipment assessment. The administrator evaluates new technologies for oil spill response and submits reports to the Legislature on equipment assessment. The report shall evaluate recovery system potential and update regulations for oil spill contingency plans by July 1, 2018 to enhance prevention, response, containment, cleanup, and wildlife rehabilitation capabilities. The administrator directs Harbor Safety Committees to assess tug presence and capability for emergency towing of vessels in specific geographic areas. Assessments for San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles-Long Beach areas start by May 1, 2016, and for other harbors by January 1, 2020. Data from Coast Guard systems, incident data, simulation models, and high-risk transit areas are considered in the assessment. The assessment will evaluate the condition of tank and nontank vessels in harbors, focusing on risks related to hull or engineering deficiencies, crew training, and professionalism. A new section 8670.13.3 is added to the Government Code. Section 8670.13.3 of the Government Code requires the administrator to notify the Legislature within three days of using dispersants in response to an oil spill in state waters. A written justification and report on the effectiveness of the dispersants must also be provided within two months. Section 8670.28 of the Government Code is amended. The administrator shall adopt regulations governing the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans in consultation with the Oil Spill Technical Advisory Committee, consistent with state and federal requirements for the protection of waters and natural resources. Regulations will allow for the development and use of contingency plans across similar vessels, pipelines, terminals, and facilities within and across companies and organizations. The regulations shall ensure the adequacy of oil spill contingency plans across companies and organizations. State waters are protected by prevention, response, containment, and cleanup equipment and operations. Standards for equipment and operations are maintained and improved. Personnel receive training in oil spill response. Contingency plans include financial arrangements for necessary equipment and services. Each oil spill contingency plan must demonstrate the protection measures in place to prevent spills, including response to disabled vessels and compliance with relevant regulations. Plans also outline equipment types, locations, and delivery times. Each facility conducts a hazard and operability study to identify hazards, including operating errors and equipment failures. An offsite consequence analysis is conducted for identified hazards. Oil spill contingency plans include contacts for emergencies, measures to protect sensitive areas, and response to oil spills. Standards for determining a reasonable worst case oil spill for nontank vessels involve a spill of the total volume of the largest fuel tank. Each oil spill contingency plan must designate an agent for service of process located in the state. Regulations also require public review and comment on submitted oil spill contingency plans. The regulations for oil spill response must address equipment types, deployment time, distance to response entities, dispersant amounts, and application time. Booming is required for vessels in lightering operations if deemed necessary for best achievable protection. The administrator will establish regulations for oil spill contingency plans for mobile transfer units, small marine fueling facilities, and vessels carrying oil as secondary cargo. The committee will convene a taskforce to evaluate the feasibility of using vessels of opportunity for oil spill response in marine waters. The taskforce will evaluate the use of vessels of opportunity for oil spill response in marine waters and provide final recommendations to the administrator and Legislature by January 1, 2017. If deemed appropriate, regulations will be updated by January 1, 2018 to include vessels of opportunity in oil spill prevention, response, and preparedness programs. Public meetings will be held in southern and northern California as part of the evaluation process. Section 8670.67.5 of the Government Code is amended to hold individuals strictly liable for spills, with penalties of up to $20 per gallon for negligence and up to $60 per gallon for gross negligence or reckless conduct."
