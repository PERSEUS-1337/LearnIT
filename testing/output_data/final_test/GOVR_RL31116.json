    "content": "The federal government has been involved in regulating and funding drinking water and wastewater treatment systems for many years. While funding for water infrastructure programs is addressed annually, the last authorizing legislation was enacted in 1996 for drinking water and 1987 for wastewater. Recently, policymakers and legislators have been giving more attention to water infrastructure issues. The renewed attention to water infrastructure issues is driven by various factors, including meeting regulatory requirements set by the EPA. These regulations impose new or stricter limits on contaminants in drinking water systems, such as arsenic and disinfection byproducts. Wastewater systems also face regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, with most communities working towards compliance. Additional rules for unregulated contaminants like perchlorate and radon are pending. The cost of controls and practices for managing wet weather pollution problems is a newer issue for wastewater systems. Many communities are now identifying specific measures and financing options to address these problems. There is a growing focus on the need to repair and replace aging infrastructure that is at risk of failing soon. The American Water Works Association warns of a looming conflict between infrastructure replacement needs and compliance investments. Stakeholders emphasize the necessity of increased investment in infrastructure to meet regulatory standards for wastewater and drinking water systems. EPA funding programs primarily focus on upgrades and new construction rather than repair and replacement. The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks has also led to new security investment needs for water systems, with estimated costs exceeding $1.6 billion for municipal water systems alone. Water systems face a significant financial burden of over $1.6 billion to secure critical assets, not including costs for addressing vulnerabilities. EPA's 2009 report highlighted $422.0 million for security projects, but this was deemed underestimated. Competition for funding is intense, with many security costs being integrated into broader construction projects. Some interest groups argue that traditional federal programs and financing approaches do not fit well with certain current needs. Issues include inadequate solutions for metropolitan drinking water systems, funding challenges for projects with mixed elements, and the need to expand program eligibility for water conservation or \"green infrastructure\" projects. Conservation or \"green infrastructure\" projects could reduce capital investment needs. Concerns arise in small communities where on-site treatment systems may be preferable but are not eligible for federal aid. Congress must decide whether to modify existing programs or address issues individually. Legislative models from surface transportation and aviation suggest new financing models for water infrastructure. Some propose a federal water trust fund to bridge the gap between needs and available funds. A federal water trust fund is proposed to supplement existing resources for water infrastructure, as there is no dedicated trust fund or identifiable revenue source. Other options include a national infrastructure bank or a program similar to TIFIA. The role of the federal government in funding local water projects is changing due to budget pressures and shifting from grants to loans. The federal government's role in funding local water projects is evolving due to budget constraints. The report discusses key issues such as funding needs, federal involvement, and mechanisms for delivering support. EPA plays a significant role in regulating and funding wastewater and drinking water systems. The Water Pollution Control Act of 1948 marked the beginning of federal support for clean water programs, providing grants and loans for wastewater treatment facilities. Subsequent statutes in the 1950s and 1960s increased federal assistance, expanding funding, coverage of costs, and eligible project expenses. EPA plays a crucial role in regulating and funding water projects. In 1972, the Clean Water Act was passed to address water quality issues and set national standards for wastewater treatment. Congress mandated that treatment works achieve secondary treatment by July 1, 1977, to improve water quality nationwide. The Clean Water Act of 1972 set a deadline for meeting secondary treatment standards by July 1, 1977. Federal funds for projects increased significantly, with the federal share raised to 75% and annual authorizations reaching $7 billion in FY1975. The grant program was reauthorized through FY1982 with restrictions on eligible projects and requirements for innovative technology and rural area projects. In 1981, further restrictions were imposed under P.L. 97-117. In 1981, under P.L. 97-117, significant restrictions were imposed on the Clean Water Act program due to concerns about its wide scope and lack of focus on key goals. The federal share was reduced to 55%, project eligibilities were limited, and annual authorizations were set at $2.4 billion. A \"needs survey\" every two years adjusted grant funds among states based on capital costs estimates for water quality projects. The survey figures fluctuated from $63 billion in 1973 to a high of $342 billion in 1974, dropping to $96 billion in 1976, and rising to $345 billion in the most recent survey. The most recent survey estimates that $345 billion is needed for water quality and public health-related problems over the next 20 years, including $192 billion for wastewater treatment plants and related pipes. Inconsistencies in survey data have been attributed to factors like lack of precision in assessing project needs and state estimators wanting to secure high federal allotments. EPA believes recent surveys are credible due to the requirement for project-specific documentation. Policy debates in the mid-1980s focused on the future of the construction grants program and the federal role. The Reagan Administration sought to phase out the construction grants program by 1990 due to budgetary reasons and the belief that the backlog of wastewater projects had been completed. Many states and localities supported the water quality goals but were critical of burdensome rules and regulations. In response to criticism of burdensome rules and regulations, Congress passed amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4) authorizing $18 billion for sewage treatment plant construction over nine years. This included a new State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) program, where federal grants would seed state-administered loans for water quality projects, enabling a phaseout of federal involvement. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRF) program was established in 1987 to provide capital for water quality projects, replacing the previous grant program by 1991. States were given more flexibility in setting priorities and administering funding, with federal aid ending in 1994. Despite progress, water quality reports show that wastewater treatment plants remain a significant source of impairments nationwide. The Clean Water Act assistance has received nearly $85 billion in funding through FY2012, with $36 billion allocated for SRF capitalization grants since 1987. Public water systems are regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act to address water quality problems and health risks. Congress has yet to shift full state responsibility for water quality management. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) of 1974 granted the EPA authority to regulate contaminants in public water supplies. Approximately 153,500 public water systems are subject to SDWA regulations, including community water systems (CWSs) and non-transient, non-community water systems (NTNCWSs). CWSs serve residential populations year-round, with some being investor-owned. NTNCWSs, such as schools or factories, have their own water systems. Non-community water systems (NTNCWSs), like schools or factories, have their own water supply and serve people for more than six months but not year-round. Congress established a program under SDWA in 1996 to help public water systems finance projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Funding support for drinking water only occurred more recently due to fewer regulations and lower costs for good quality drinking water in the past. Essentially, communities have had to upgrade sewage treatment facilities to meet Clean Water Act requirements. Drinking water circumstances have changed due to increased contaminants from various land uses. The number of regulated drinking water contaminants grew from 23 to 83 from 1986 to 1996, leading to the need for additional treatment to meet new standards and protect public health. The 1996 SDWA Amendments (P.L. 104-182) established a drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program to help public water systems finance projects needed to comply with SDWA regulations. This program authorizes EPA to make grants to states to capitalize DWSRFs, which states then use to make loans to water systems. States must match 20% of their federal capitalization grant and allocate 15% of their grant for loan assistance to small systems. Communities repay loans into the fund, ensuring resources are available. The Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) program was established in 1996 to help public water systems finance projects for SDWA compliance. Communities repay loans into the fund, making resources available for projects in other communities. Eligible projects include installation and replacement of treatment facilities, distribution systems, and storage facilities. Systems must have the capacity to comply with the act and not be in significant noncompliance with SDWA requirements to receive DWSRF assistance. The Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) program was established in 1996 to help public and privately owned water systems finance projects for SDWA compliance. Congress has provided $16.4 billion for the program through FY2012, including funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. States can use up to 30% of their DWSRF grant for additional assistance. The Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF) program allows states to use up to 30% of their grant to provide extra assistance to economically disadvantaged communities. EPA assesses capital improvement needs of eligible water systems every four years, distributing funds based on the latest survey results. Eligible systems include public and privately owned community water systems and not-for-profit noncommunity water systems. EPA administers the largest federal water infrastructure assistance programs, while USDA also provides funding through grant and loan programs. The USDA administers grant and loan programs for small communities with populations of 10,000 or less, providing assistance to those facing difficulties in qualifying for and repaying loans for sewage treatment or drinking water projects. These programs aim to provide basic amenities, alleviate health hazards, and promote the growth of rural areas. The USDA administers grant and loan programs for small rural communities to improve water and waste disposal facilities. Congress allocated $499.8 million for these programs in FY2012. USDA and EPA work together to coordinate efforts and minimize redundancies in administering their programs. In October 2012, the Government Accountability Office reported that funding for rural water and wastewater infrastructure remained fragmented, with EPA and USDA efforts lacking coordination at the state level. Efforts are being made to develop uniform guidelines for communities seeking funding, but challenges persist in meeting federal regulatory requirements and broader funding needs. The Water Infrastructure Network (WIN), a coalition of various groups, highlighted the significant funding gap for municipal wastewater and drinking water systems. WIN estimated a $24.7 billion annual investment gap for the next 20 years, totaling $940 billion for infrastructure investments and over $1 trillion for operation and maintenance spending. The Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) identified a $24.7 billion annual investment gap for municipal wastewater and drinking water systems. A 2001 WIN report recommended a multibillion dollar investment program in water infrastructure. Private water industry groups advocate for increased private sector participation in infrastructure projects. Setting priorities for infrastructure spending is traditionally based on various factors, including estimates of funding needs to determine the required investment level for quality or service. This differs from economists' view that optimal infrastructure investment is based on balancing social marginal benefits and costs. Needs assessments are anchored to a benchmark, such as current provision in terms of physical condition and/or performance, to determine future spending needs for infrastructure systems. Estimates may focus on eligible project categories for federal assistance, potentially overlooking needs for non-eligible categories like aging infrastructure replacement. The federal agencies estimate funding needed to bring infrastructure to a state of good repair, known as the infrastructure \"backlog.\" EPA contributes to this by conducting wastewater and drinking water needs surveys, as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA also assesses needs for drinking water treatment facilities for Indian tribes in consultation with the Indian Health Service. The EPA conducts surveys to estimate the funding needed for infrastructure backlog, including wastewater and drinking water needs. This includes assessing the capital costs for building or rehabilitating facilities to ensure safe drinking water for Indian tribes and addressing water quality issues. The Clean Water Act also requires reporting on the construction costs of wastewater treatment works every four years. EPA defines \"need\" as the unfunded capital costs of projects addressing water quality or public health problems. Initial surveys for public water systems were conducted in 1995. EPA estimated that public water systems needed $276.8 billion for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with regulations and ensure safe water. This amount exceeded the 2001 estimate by more than 60% due to new regulations and improved assessment of infrastructure needs in 2003. The most recent survey in 2007 highlighted the ongoing funding challenges for drinking water infrastructure. The 2007 drinking water needs survey indicates that systems need $334.8 billion for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with regulations and ensure safe water. 84% of this amount represents nonregulatory costs, with only 16% attributable to federal drinking water regulations. EPA notes improvements in reporting and methodologies for needs estimation. The 2007 drinking water needs survey shows that systems require $334.8 billion for infrastructure improvements over 20 years to comply with regulations and ensure safe water. 84% of this amount represents nonregulatory costs, with only 16% attributable to federal drinking water regulations. Small community water systems and American Indian/Alaska Native Village water systems also have significant needs. The estimated cost for water infrastructure needs in the United States is $322 billion over the next 20 years, with the largest portion allocated for wastewater treatment plants, pipe repairs, and new installations. Stakeholders are urging Congress to reauthorize and increase funding for the DWSRF program to address the growing number of regulated drinking water contaminants. The EPA reported significant increases in needs for wastewater treatment and stormwater management, attributed to aging infrastructure, water quality standards, population growth, and wet-weather flows. Small communities accounted for 8% of total needs, with separate estimates made for Alaskan Native villages and Indian tribes by the Indian Health Service. The Indian Sanitation Facilities Act (P.L. 86-121) estimated tribal wastewater needs at $719.2 million in 2007. EPA acknowledges conservative bias in needs estimates. Reported needs must be documented with project-specific information. Ineligible needs for SRF funding are not reflected in surveys. Growth-related projects are not eligible for EPA funding. Privately owned facilities and those serving federal facilities are not eligible for clean water SRF program funding. Financing costs associated with utility are not accounted for in surveys. In the most recent drinking water needs survey, EPA reported successful efforts to correct past under-reporting of needs. The Gap Analysis study in 2002 assessed the difference between current spending and total funding needs for water infrastructure. It estimated total needs for drinking water and clean water from 2000 to 2019, including financing costs. The Gap Analysis report in 2002 estimated a 20-year investment gap between current spending levels and capital investment needs for wastewater and drinking water combined, ranging from $66 billion to $224 billion. Additionally, it projected a 20-year gap in spending for operations and maintenance between $10 billion and $309 billion. EPA's analysis indicated an average annual gap between current spending and investment needs of $1.6 billion to $23.1 billion, and an average annual O&M gap of $0.3 billion to $36.3 billion. EPA's projections suggest an annual increase in costs for capital investment and O&M ranging from 2.8% to 85.8% over 20 years. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) presented two scenarios for future water infrastructure needs, estimating annual costs between $11.6 billion and $20.1 billion for drinking water systems, and $13.0 billion and $20.9 billion for wastewater systems from 2000 to 2019. Limited data availability complicates making accurate 20-year estimates. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated annual costs between $11.6 billion and $20.9 billion for water infrastructure needs from 2000 to 2019. The difference between actual capital spending and future costs would create an investment funding gap of $3.0 billion annually in the low-cost scenario and $19.4 billion in the high-cost case. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated annual costs for water infrastructure needs from 2000 to 2019. The future costs represent growth of 14% in the low-cost scenario and about 90% in the high-cost case. CBO criticized WIN's 2000 report for not reflecting \"costs as financed\" in its analysis, which includes total capital investment needs and debt service. The CBO criticized WIN's 2000 report for not accurately estimating investment needs, resulting in a 20% over-estimate. Differences between EPA's and CBO's projections of total investment costs are not significant, but both have implications. EPA and CBO's high-end estimates reflect a near doubling in costs. The CBO's high-end estimates show a near doubling of baseline investment costs through 2019, raising doubts about the feasibility and sustainability of such an increase in spending. While precise funding needs estimates are debated, recognizing the general need is crucial. Projections of future water infrastructure costs are uncertain, with different assumptions potentially impacting results. Data limitations make it challenging for agencies to accurately predict costs over a 20-year projection window. The CBO and EPA believe that funding gaps for water infrastructure are not inevitable if steps are taken to reduce costs. Future spending and asset management processes could significantly alter estimates of future needs. Questions remain about how to fill the gap in funding, including the federal government's role and who will pay for the infrastructure needs. The scope of the water infrastructure problem includes significant needs for upgrading wastewater and drinking water systems to comply with federal standards. The 2008 clean water needs survey shows that a large portion of the $192 billion needed for treatment plants and pipes is for correcting overflows and managing stormwater. For drinking water needs, $52 billion is required for compliance with regulations, with an expected increase in needs due to more regulations. Water utilities prioritize $282.8 billion for high-priority projects. $282.8 billion (84%) of total needs is for high-priority projects to ensure safe drinking water delivery, focusing on upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure. Stakeholders also address the lack of federal aid for major repair and replacement of existing systems, which are reaching the end of their service life. Advocacy groups warn that aging water infrastructure systems are reaching the end of their service life and will require significant investment in the near future. The American Water Works Association estimates that $250 billion may be needed nationally by 2030 to replace worn-out facilities and systems installed decades ago. The problem is not due to neglect but because infrastructure installed in response to past population growth and economic booms is now wearing out. The useful life of water pipes varies based on factors like soil conditions and materials used. Pipes installed after World War II have an average life of 75 years, while older pipes from the late 1800s last about 120 years. The American Water Works Association predicts that replacing aging pipes installed from the late 1800s to the 1950s will be a major challenge, with newer pipes from the latter half of the 20th century also needing replacement in the future. Treatment plant assets have shorter service lives of 15 to 50 years, with many built in the 1970s and 1980s now due for replacement. The debate on the replacement problem for utilities is not about historical funding gaps but about ramping up budgets to prevent future replacement gaps. Security-related needs are not fully accounted for in investment reports, with preliminary estimates suggesting security costs will be relatively small compared to other infrastructure investments. The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 required large wastewater utilities to assess security needs, with operators identifying $135 million in needs for 2002-2006. Approximately one-quarter reported needs exceeding $1 million. The costs of addressing security concerns for drinking water systems are expected to be significant, with community water systems now taking steps to improve security. The AWWA estimated that community water systems covered by the Bioterrorism Act would need to spend over $1.6 billion for basic security measures. This cost does not include upgrades to address vulnerabilities identified in assessments. Nationwide, billions of dollars will be needed to address vulnerabilities in water systems. The total security need from a 2003 survey was estimated at $1 billion. In the 2007 survey, water systems identified $422 million in needed security projects, but the total cost to protect infrastructure and water quality is likely much greater. Some water utilities have increased rates to cover security improvement costs, while others have reallocated resources. Some water utilities have increased rates to cover security improvement costs, while others have reallocated resources. Congress authorized funding for EPA to provide financial assistance to drinking water systems for security enhancements, but no funding was provided. EPA has identified security improvements eligible for funding through state revolving fund programs. The Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds may be used for security measures, but it is uncertain how readily these funds might become available for such purposes. Wastewater SRF funding is primarily used for construction of wastewater treatment plants and pollution management programs, while Drinking water SRFs may provide assistance for compliance with drinking water regulations or health protection objectives. There are proposals to expand the scope of activities eligible for SRF funding. Recent legislative proposals have suggested expanding the types of projects eligible for SRF funding to include water conservation, water reuse, facility security measures, and green infrastructure projects. Green infrastructure investments are now a priority for the EPA, aiming to reduce the need for capital investment in traditional infrastructure. Congressional interest in these projects is evident in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) mandated states to allocate 20% of SRF funding for green infrastructure, water or energy efficiency improvements. Congress has continued to emphasize green projects in subsequent appropriations acts. While supporting non-traditional projects through the SRF could enhance water quality, it may divert focus from traditional needs. This tension is evident in the wide range of set-asides authorized under the drinking water SRF. States can reserve up to 31% of their federal capitalization grant under the drinking water SRF for various purposes, including implementing wellhead protection programs and funding local source water protection initiatives. Investing in managing nonpoint sources of water pollution is crucial for public health and water quality, as polluted runoff is a major issue in the United States. Investing in managing nonpoint sources of water pollution, such as farm and ranch land, construction sites, and mining operations, is crucial for water quality. Municipal point sources contribute a smaller percentage of impairments. The cost of addressing nonpoint pollution has not been fully documented, but investments in nonpoint pollution abatement could have significant environmental benefits, potentially outweighing investments in water infrastructure. For example, New York City is funding a watershed protection program to avoid the need for a costly filtration plant. Local officials are facing challenges in providing affordable water and wastewater services to growing populations. Many existing small and rural communities lack access to public sewers and water supply, leading to the use of alternative systems to comply with environmental laws. Congress is being urged to provide direct financial and technical assistance for developing water projects, including rural water supply initiatives. The 109th Congress passed legislation authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation to establish a program for rural water supply projects in the West, reflecting priority problems in need of federal solutions. Policymakers face decisions about priorities and tradeoffs in funding traditional infrastructure projects versus emerging water supply challenges. The federal government is considering priorities and tradeoffs in funding traditional infrastructure projects, emerging water supply challenges, and nonpoint pollution management. Stakeholders are advocating for increased federal spending on water infrastructure due to funding gaps from federal, state, and local sources. There is a debate on expanding eligibility for SRF funding to include less traditional activities and determining the federal role in supporting these activities. In its 2001 report, WIN recommended doubling federal support for water infrastructure and increasing it by 500% after five years. Some doubt the need for such a large increase in federal support. Questions remain about defining the federal role and priorities. EPA data shows that federal capitalization grants are the main source of funds for SRFs, with $21.2 billion in funds available from drinking water SRFs from 1996 to mid-2010. $12.4 billion came from capitalization grants, while the rest came from state match contributions, bonds, repayments, and interest earnings. Clean water SRFs had $71 billion from 1988 to mid-2010. From 1988 to mid-2010, clean water SRFs had $71 billion in funds available, with $31 billion from federal capitalization grants. State assistance outside of SRF programs also contributes to water infrastructure funding, with states providing $13.5 billion from FY1991 to FY2000 for drinking water and wastewater projects. On average, ratepayers cover 90% of the total cost for their water systems, with federal funds making up the remainder. Local governments heavily rely on government aid for funding water infrastructure, with capital costs totaling about $60 billion annually. Since 1972, nearly $1.7 trillion has been spent on clean water and drinking water systems. Municipalities have been increasing water and sewer rates to cover rising operating and maintenance costs, which have been growing 6% above inflation annually. Despite efforts to raise local fees and taxes, municipal officials argue that this alone cannot solve all funding problems. Federal expenditures on water utilities have declined by 13% from 2003 to 2007, while state and local investments have increased by 3% annually. Water and wastewater officials acknowledge the challenge of covering the majority of water infrastructure needs while keeping water affordable. In some areas, doubling or tripling water and sewer rates may be necessary to meet all needs, leading to declining service levels and threats to public health. Stakeholders are seeking greater federal support to address financial impacts and affordability concerns. The Water Infrastructure Network emphasizes the need for federal support to address water and sewer infrastructure challenges. They estimate that with additional federal investment, average household water and sewer rates would increase by 100% over the next 20 years, compared to 123% without federal help. Affordability is a key concern in discussions between the EPA and municipalities, with a focus on providing flexibility for local governments to allocate funds for water infrastructure projects. EPA released an Integrated Planning Framework in 2012 to assist cities in managing stormwater and wastewater overflows. In June 2012, EPA introduced an Integrated Planning Framework to help cities manage sewer overflows while meeting water quality standards. This approach aims to identify efficiencies in implementing wastewater and stormwater programs, which account for 35% of funding needs for clean water projects. Some analysts argue that local communities need to prioritize water and wastewater services by setting appropriate user charges to cover expenses. Publicly owned utility systems in the wastewater industry constitute over 95% of the sector, while around 33% of public water systems are privately owned, serving approximately 15% of the U.S. population. Analysts suggest that \"rate shocks\" from large rate increases can be managed through financing, ratemaking, and conservation strategies. There are debates on federal subsidies for water services, with suggestions to use needs-based subsidies to assist low-income households. The CBO has emphasized the need for strategic and equitable use of federal funds. The CBO argues that federal spending programs for water infrastructure can have unintended consequences, such as encouraging inefficient decisions and reducing incentives for cost-effective solutions. One option presented by CBO is to phase out federal capitalization grants for SRFs, citing economic rationales for doing so. The CBO suggests that federal funding for infrastructure projects should align with supply and demand by pricing services accurately. They recommend funding projects that benefit the nation as a whole and only funding projects for specific states if they generate nationwide benefits. The CBO emphasizes the importance of identifying economically justifiable projects that have benefits outweighing costs to achieve long-term economic growth. The budget office advises that federal infrastructure funding should prioritize projects with benefits that exceed costs, although identifying such projects is challenging. Economic efficiency is not always the main driver for federal infrastructure spending, with various public policy goals taking precedence. Issues surrounding federal financial support for water infrastructure projects include aid composition, assistance for private entities, federal requirements' impacts, and allocation of funds to states. Stakeholders are divided on whether grants or loans should be the preferred source of assistance. The drinking water State Revolving Fund (SRF) program allows for grants or loans, with a preference for grants by cities and the WIN group, while states and the National Association of Water Companies prefer loans. Both SRF programs authorize states to provide loans at or below market interest rates, including zero interest loans. Small and large cities have urged Congress to authorize water infrastructure grants in addition to loans. The drinking water SRF program allows up to 30% of capitalization grants to be used for additional loan subsidies for disadvantaged communities. Grants that do not require repayment are preferred by communities. Some communities struggle to repay loans for water infrastructure projects due to lack of industrial tax base or economies of scale. Grants are preferred by larger cities to help make costs more affordable for ratepayers. Permitting longer loan repayment periods can reduce annual amounts due and lessen rate increases needed for repayment. Total financing costs may be higher, but repayment is fully amortized 20 years after project completion. Repayments for water infrastructure projects typically begin one year after completion and are fully amortized 20 years later. Economically disadvantaged communities may have up to 30 years to repay loans under the drinking water SRF. Some states, like Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Maryland, have been allowed to issue 30-year clean water SRF loans. State officials are hesitant to use SRF funds for grants as it diminishes the fund's ability to be self-sustained. States recognize that forgiving a portion of SRF loan principal can benefit disadvantaged communities, but many prefer to limit grants to avoid substituting federal funds for state and local investments. Only a few states have utilized principal forgiveness authority under the drinking water SRF since 1996, with assistance totaling less than 3% of all SRF funding. In 2009, Congress provided $6 billion in supplemental appropriations for SRF programs, requiring states to provide at least 50% of funds as subsidization. Subsequent appropriations acts have continued to encourage states to provide subsidization, with EPA's FY2012 appropriation specifying 20-30% of grants for additional subsidy. Some groups prefer limited federal assistance to promote business-like operations for utilities. Some groups prefer federal assistance in the form of low-interest or zero-interest loans to promote business-like operations for utilities. They also support assistance for low-income families to supplement water and sewer bills, either through direct payments or to the utility. Loan forgiveness or grants with local cost sharing are options in rare cases, as long as they lead to long-term solutions and cost-effective use of federal funds. Assistance for low-income households is favored over grants, as grants or loans with forgiveness may subsidize all customers' rates inefficiently. Under the drinking water SRF program, eligible loan recipients include community water systems, not-for-profit noncommunity water systems, and eligible loan recipients for wastewater SRFs are municipalities and state agencies. Some stakeholders advocate for SRF funds to be available to privately owned wastewater systems to level the playing field and increase infrastructure investment. This raises issues with the Internal Revenue Code regarding activities financed by state and local bonds. Tax-exempt financing for state and local government activities allows borrowing at lower interest rates. Public/private activities eligible for tax-exempt financing are subject to a cap on private activity bonds (PABs). Water infrastructure projects can secure tax-exempt financing if they obtain an allocation from the volume cap. Private water bonds compete with other private bond uses under this cap. President Bush proposed exempting PABs for water and sewage facilities from the volume cap to increase access to financing for water infrastructure needs. Legislation has been introduced to provide this exemption, similar to the one already in place for government-owned solid waste disposal facilities. Opponents argue that maintaining restrictions on tax-exempt financing is necessary to prevent costs to the federal government in terms of lost income tax revenues and inefficient allocation of capital. Opponents argue that tax-exempt bonds for water infrastructure projects may lead to inefficient allocation of capital and increased financing costs for traditional governmental activities. Legislation has been introduced to allow tax exemption on USDA loans for water, wastewater, and community facilities. Another issue is arbitrage, where earnings from investing tax-exempt bond proceeds in higher-yielding securities could replace citizens' tax contributions. Congress aims to limit arbitrage by requiring quick use of bond proceeds for construction projects. The IRS imposes arbitrage restrictions on State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to ensure bond proceeds are used promptly for construction projects. Leveraging federal grants and state funds to borrow at tax-exempt rates for municipal bonds can lead to higher earnings but may conflict with IRS regulations. EPA's Environmental Finance Advisory Board is concerned about limitations on arbitrage reducing available funds for projects. The IRS arbitrage limitations on State Revolving Funds (SRFs) have raised concerns about reducing funds for infrastructure projects. Many state officials and the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities (CIFA) are advocating for amending the Internal Revenue Code to exempt SRF reserves from arbitrage restrictions to allow for more investment in water infrastructure projects. CIFA argues that applying arbitrage rules to SRFs does not align with their intended purpose of financing water and wastewater facilities. CIFA advocates for lifting arbitrage restrictions on State Revolving Funds (SRFs) to increase investment in water infrastructure projects. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to lift these restrictions but has not been reintroduced. If restrictions were lifted, SRFs could earn an additional $100 million to $200 million annually, potentially providing $200 million to $400 million for infrastructure projects. However, concerns exist about potential misuse of tax-exempt bonds for arbitrage profits, leading to revenue losses and higher interest rates. Under the State Revolving Funds (SRFs), federal authorities, executive orders, and government-wide policies apply to projects receiving federal financial assistance. These requirements include environmental, social, and economic laws. Previously, these requirements only applied to projects funded directly by federal grants, not to SRF activities funded by loan repayments or state monies. Many stakeholders find the statutory and cross-cutting requirements attached to activities funded by the clean water State Revolving Fund burdensome and costly. One contentious issue is compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, which critics argue increases construction costs and hampers competition, while supporters believe it stabilizes wages. The Davis-Bacon Act provisions have been added to various program statutes, including the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. However, the applicability of Davis-Bacon to the clean water State Revolving Fund expired in FY1994. EPA had interpreted the SDWA to not require Davis-Bacon Act compliance for construction projects supported by SRFs. The controversy surrounding the inclusion of Davis-Bacon Act requirements in the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act State Revolving Fund programs has hindered water infrastructure financing legislation. Davis-Bacon requirements were imposed on funds provided under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, leading to debates on set-asides for SRF capitalization grants. Under the clean water SRF, states must reserve a minimum of 1% of their capitalization grant or $100,000 annually for planning requirements under the CWA. For the drinking water SRF, states can allocate up to 31% of their grant for SDWA programs like public water system supervision and compliance. However, reserving a large portion of funds for these activities limits the available funding for infrastructure projects, raising concerns that Congress may rely on SRF funds for other SDWA requirements instead of providing authorized appropriations. Many state clean water program officials have reservations about mandatory set-asides in the drinking water program, as they have experienced challenges in spending reserved funds in the past. Despite the flexibility states have in reserving funds, only a few have utilized the full 31% allowed by law, with the average reservation being 16% since 1996. This has raised concerns about the availability of funds for infrastructure projects. Many stakeholders oppose mandatory set-asides in the CWA SRF program, except for covering states' administrative costs. Some groups suggest reserves for projects in rural communities or \"green\" infrastructure. States argue that reserving 4% of federal grants for administration is insufficient as loan portfolios grow. The issue of insufficient funding for administering the Clean Water Act SRF program has been a concern for many stakeholders. States argue that reserving only 4% of federal grants for administration is inadequate, especially as loan portfolios grow. There is also a debate on how federal funds are allocated among states, with calls for increasing the amount states can reserve for administrative purposes and for a more permanent solution to cover the cost of administering SRF loans. The Clean Water Act allocation formula is based on state population and capital needs for wastewater projects. The formula has not been updated since 1987, leading to debates on the distribution of federal funds among states. In contrast, drinking water SRF grants are allocated based on each state's needs identified in a national survey. Questions arise on whether a single formula should apply to both programs and if EPA's needs surveys accurately reflect state needs for distribution. Crafting an allotment formula for Clean Water Act reauthorizations has been a controversial issue, with significant dollars at stake. There is debate on how new activities like pollution prevention should impact state-by-state allocations. Another issue is the allocation of federal water infrastructure funds through earmarks for specific community projects. Congressional appropriators have historically dedicated a portion of annual water infrastructure assistance as grants for communities with a federal cost-share of 55%. For example, in FY2010, Congress appropriated $2.1 billion for clean water SRF. In FY2010, Congress appropriated funds for clean water SRF capitalization grants, drinking water SRF grants, and earmarked grants for specific projects. State officials administering SRF programs oppose earmarked grants as it limits their control over project funding priorities. Congress imposed a moratorium on earmarking in FY2011 but could reinstate it in the future. Utility officials often stick to conventional technologies for water and wastewater needs. Utility officials tend to prefer traditional systems and technologies, especially in the wastewater sector where regulations have been stable. However, new regulations are now requiring public water systems to adopt new technologies, such as the EPA's revised drinking water standard for arsenic. Congress has expressed concerns about the financial burden this may pose on small communities, particularly in the West, and has allocated funding for research on cost-effective arsenic removal. Congress has allocated funding for research on cost-effective arsenic removal technologies for small systems. Federal support for research and development of new drinking water and wastewater technologies has been limited, with competition for funding considerable. Technology R&D is mainly supported by programs of EPA's Office of Research and Development and EPA's Environmental Technology Verification Program, as directed by Congress. The EPA has directed appropriated funds to nonprofit research foundations for technology verification programs in water and drinking water areas. The ETV Program verifies innovative technologies and accelerates their entrance into the market. WIN recommended Congress authorize $250 million annually for an Institute of Technology and Management Excellence to support the development of cost-effective drinking water technologies. The CBO suggests increasing federal support for water infrastructure through R&D funding to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Federal involvement may be necessary to increase cost-effectiveness when other entities lack incentive to consider national benefits. This support could include technical R&D into new pipe materials, construction methods, and treatment technologies managed by EPA or through federal grants to private organizations. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act authorized incentives for innovative technologies in water infrastructure projects, including increasing federal funding for projects that reuse or recycle wastewater, reduce costs, or save energy. This included provisions for full replacement of systems in case of failure to reduce uncertainty in using new technologies. In 1989, EPA estimated that investing in innovative wastewater projects saved 40 cents for every dollar spent compared to conventional treatment systems. However, without bonus funds or 100% replacement grants, few communities are now using unproven technology under the clean water SRF program. The Safe Drinking Water Act lacks similar incentives, but regulatory pressures and population growth are driving water infrastructure projects. Regulatory pressures and population growth are driving water and wastewater utilities to consider alternative treatment technologies. Congressional considerations could include financial or regulatory incentives for innovative technology and increased federal support for R&D. EPA's Drinking Water Strategy aims to develop new technologies to address health risks from contaminants, with a focus on forming partnerships for innovative water treatment solutions. These technologies have the potential to reduce treatment costs and infrastructure needs significantly. Technologies can reduce treatment costs and infrastructure needs significantly. Momentum in Congress has increased since the 107th Congress, with steps taken to ensure efficient investment. House and Senate committees have addressed water infrastructure financing, with the House approving a bill for $20 billion in clean water assistance. The Senate reported legislation for $35 billion in funding over five years for clean water. In the 108th Congress, attention shifted to legislation authorizing $35 billion over five years for clean water and drinking water SRF programs. Controversies over Davis-Bacon Act requirements and CWA grant allocation formulas stalled progress on the bills. The House approved H.R. 1560, similar to H.R. 3930, authorizing $20 billion for the clean water SRF program with provisions to benefit economically disadvantaged communities. The 108th Congress focused on legislation authorizing $35 billion over five years for clean water and drinking water SRF programs. The bill included provisions for extended loan repayments, additional subsidies, and requirements for communities to plan for infrastructure needs. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported S. 2550, authorizing $41.25 billion over five years, with allocations for clean water and drinking water SRF programs. The 108th Congress focused on legislation authorizing $35 billion over five years for clean water and drinking water SRF programs, with provisions for extended loan repayments, additional subsidies, and infrastructure planning requirements. The 109th Congress considered bills for the allocation of clean water SRF grants and expanding eligible project types, but no further action was taken. Issues included the applicability of Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements, funding allocation formulas, and opposition to funding levels. During the 109th Congress, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a water infrastructure financing bill, S. 1400 (S.Rept. 109-186), authorizing $20 billion for the clean water SRF program and $15 billion for the drinking water SRF program. The bill aimed to update the CWA formula for state-by-state allocation of SRF funds, apply Davis-Bacon Act wage requirements to SRF projects, establish grant programs for small communities, authorize loans for small systems, and promote a demonstration program for water quality projects. The 110th Congress considered water infrastructure financing, with no legislation enacted. In March 2007, the House passed H.R. 720, authorizing $14 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2008-FY2011, with provisions for economically disadvantaged and small communities. The 110th Congress considered water infrastructure financing, with no legislation enacted. In March 2007, the House passed H.R. 720, authorizing $14 billion for the clean water SRF program for FY2008-FY2011, with provisions for economically disadvantaged and small communities. Additional subsidies for communities meeting affordability criteria were included in H.R. 720. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved S. 3617 in September 2008, authorizing $20 billion for Clean Water Act SRF grants and $15 billion for Safe Drinking Water Act SRF grants through FY2012. In March 2009, the House passed H.R. 1262, the Water Quality Investment Act, similar to H.R. 720 from the 110th Congress. In July 2010, the House passed H.R. 5320, the Assistance, Quality, and Affordability Act of 2010, authorizing appropriations for the drinking water SRF for three years and making changes to the program. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a bill for water infrastructure financing, but it was not taken up by the Senate. The Water Protection and Reinvestment Act was introduced to establish a water infrastructure trust fund supported by excise taxes. Legislation for a water infrastructure trust fund and to reauthorize the clean water SRF program was introduced in the 112th Congress but not taken up by committees. The George W. Bush Administration did not offer legislative proposals for water infrastructure, opposing SRF authorization levels in Congress. They argued that federal funding needs should be supplemented by local government actions. Stakeholder groups agreed that the issue requires a combined effort. During the Bush Administration, stakeholders agreed that the responsibility for water infrastructure is shared among different levels of government. However, many felt that federal investment levels were inadequate to meet the nation's water goals. The EPA's main initiative focused on promoting the Four Pillars of Sustainable Infrastructure: better management, full-cost-pricing, efficient water use, and watershed protection. This initiative aimed to find new ways to address water infrastructure challenges. The EPA's initiative focused on promoting the Four Pillars of Sustainable Infrastructure to improve water and wastewater industries. This included encouraging utility rate structures for full-cost pricing, promoting water-efficient products, and supporting sustainable practices to reduce funding gaps. In October 2010, EPA issued a \"Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Sustainability Policy\" to encourage conservation and provide long-term funding for infrastructure. The Obama Administration supported $6.0 billion for water infrastructure investments, shifting the debate on federal budgetary resources. EPA works with water utilities to promote planning processes that focus on public health, water quality, conservation, and innovative treatment approaches. The Obama Administration supported $6.0 billion for water infrastructure investments, including clean water and drinking water SRF programs. In subsequent budget requests, increased funding was sought for these programs. Congress appropriated $2.4 billion for FY2012. Various issues regarding water infrastructure needs and concerns have been debated by Congress, the Administration, and stakeholders, with a focus on finding alternatives for funding the larger financial commitment. The need for alternative funding sources for a larger federal role in water infrastructure has been a topic of debate. Questions arise about where the money would come from if a financing gap exists. Analytic work has been done in the past to identify alternative revenue sources to support increased federal involvement. EPA has contributed analysis on financial mechanisms for water infrastructure enhancement. A study requested by Congress in the mid-1990s examined financial mechanisms to enhance government funding for environmental goals. The EPA's Environmental Finance Advisory Board has developed publications like A Guidebook of Financial Tools to help communities pay for environmental projects. Stakeholders agree on the need for more investment in water infrastructure and support options like water-related fees or new federal funding. Increased public/private partnerships and other financing options are being considered to address water infrastructure needs. There is no consensus on a preferred policy, with many advocating for a combination of approaches. The 112th Congress focused on cutting federal spending, and it is unclear how this will impact infrastructure programs in the future. The debate now is whether infrastructure investments will be treated equally with other programs or be seen as crucial for economic growth, potentially receiving more federal resources."
