The Act, titled the \"American Manufacturing and Worker Protection Act of 2014,\" defines an \"affected domestic producer\" as a manufacturer or producer who supported a petition resulting in an antidumping duty order, and who remains operational. The Act defines an \"affected domestic producer\" as a manufacturer who supported an antidumping duty order petition and is still operational. An individual is an 'eligible employee' if they were separated from employment due to dumping. The terms 'Commissioner' and 'Commission' refer to specific entities in the context of the Act. The Act defines an \"affected domestic producer\" as a manufacturer who supported an antidumping duty order petition and is still operational. An eligible employee is someone who was separated from employment due to dumping or subsidy. An executive officer of an affected domestic producer is not considered an eligible employee. The term 'partially separated' refers to an employee whose work hours have been reduced to 80% or less due to dumping or subsidy. Executive officers of affected domestic producers are not eligible employees. The term 'qualifying expenditure' refers to expenses incurred by an affected domestic producer after an antidumping or countervailing duty order is issued, including costs related to manufacturing facilities, equipment, research and development, and personnel training. The qualifying expenditures include costs for research and development, personnel training, acquisition of technology, health care benefits, pension benefits, environmental equipment, raw materials, working capital, and related entities. The text chunk discusses the criteria for control between companies, businesses, or persons, either directly or indirectly, and how this control can influence their actions compared to nonrelated parties. Control is defined as having legal or operational influence over another party. The term 'totally separated' refers to the layoff or severance of an individual from employment with an affected domestic producer due to dumping or a subsidy. Duties assessed under countervailing duty orders or antidumping duty orders are distributed semiannually to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures and cash to eligible employees, known as the 'antidumping and subsidy protection amount'. The 'antidumping and subsidy protection amount' is distributed semiannually to affected domestic producers. 40% is for eligible employees, 50% for qualifying expenditures. The Commissioner will prescribe distribution procedures, requiring equal distribution to all eligible employees within 60 days after each 6-month period. The Commission distributes antidumping and countervailing duties to affected domestic producers semiannually. A list of petitioners and supporters must be forwarded within 45 days of the effective date of the Act or issuance of an order. The Commission consults with the administering authority to identify petitioners and domestic parties supporting a petition. A notice is published in the Federal Register before distributing antidumping and subsidy protection amounts to eligible domestic producers. The Commissioner requests certification from eligible affected domestic producers for distribution of funds from assessed duties received in a fiscal year. This includes details on producer eligibility, qualifying expenditures, and eligible employees. The Commissioner requests certification from eligible affected domestic producers for distribution of funds from assessed duties received in a fiscal year. Distributions are made on a pro rata basis based on qualifying expenditures and eligible employees. Special accounts are established in the Treasury of the United States for duty orders and findings. The Commissioner establishes special accounts in the Treasury of the United States for duty orders and findings, depositing antidumping or countervailing duties into these accounts. Regulations will dictate the time and manner of fund distributions from these accounts. The special account established for duty orders and findings will terminate if the order has ended, all entries have been settled, and the Commissioner has given notice for distribution. Unclaimed amounts will be dealt with after a 90-day period. The Commissioner must submit an annual report to Congress on antidumping and countervailing duty assessments, including any recommendations and findings of waste, fraud, or abuse. Unclaimed amounts after a 90-day period will be deposited into the Treasury's general fund. The amendments made by this section regarding the distribution of duties will be effective on October 1, 2014, applying to antidumping and countervailing duty assessments. These amendments also apply to goods from Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement."
