    "content": "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes rules for non-U.S. nationals entering the United States under family-based, employment-based, and diversity-based categories. It also outlines requirements for refugees, temporary nonimmigrant admissions, and removal of aliens who violate the INA. The Department of Homeland Security enforces these regulations. The Department of Homeland Security enforces the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which allows for the removal of aliens in the United States who violate the law, whether they entered surreptitiously or overstayed a visa. DHS can remove up to 400,000 aliens per year, but sometimes chooses not to for various reasons. The Department of Homeland Security enforces the Immigration and Nationality Act by removing aliens who violate the law. Well-known examples of reprieves include DACA and TPS, providing temporary protection from removal to aliens from unstable countries. These discretionary reprieves depend on the Executive's decision not to seek removal. Discretionary reprieves, like TPS, do not grant LPR status but may aid in adjusting to it. They offer temporary protection from removal and work authorization. Legal scholarship terms them as \"quasi-legal status\" or \"status of nonstatus.\" They have become more prevalent in recent years in regulating unlawfully present individuals. Discretionary reprieves, such as DACA and DED, are a significant aspect of federal regulation for unlawfully present individuals. Changes in executive policy may lead to a decline in these reprieves. The Executive's enforcement discretion allows for the granting of various forms of reprieves, providing temporary protection from removal. The Executive's enforcement discretion in immigration law allows for prioritizing cases, similar to prosecutorial discretion in criminal law. This authority to decline removal of some unlawfully present aliens is known as \"prosecutorial discretion,\" even though removal proceedings are civil. Enforcement discretion in immigration has unique attributes compared to prosecutorial discretion in criminal law, as there is no general statute of limitations on removal under the INA. The Executive's enforcement discretion in immigration law allows for prioritizing cases, similar to prosecutorial discretion in criminal law. Unlike in criminal law, there is no general statute of limitations on removal under the INA, meaning aliens can be removed indefinitely. Discretionary reprieves from removal often have fixed terms, like DACA's two-year renewable term. The Executive has granted various reprieves over time under different terms. In 1974, John Lennon pursued a reprieve called \"nonpriority status,\" later termed \"deferred action\" by the INS, now used by DHS. Other reprieves include EVD, DED, and DACA, each with specific criteria and focus groups. Criteria for reprieves are outlined in agency manuals and policy memoranda. The criteria for reprieves are outlined in agency manuals and policy memoranda, but federal statute does not set specific criteria for reprieves based on enforcement discretion. The Executive's authority to grant reprieves in a programmatic fashion for large populations of aliens is still a debated issue, with the Supreme Court yet to decide. While most discretionary reprieves are based on enforcement discretion, a few have a statutory basis under the INA. The INA grants DHS authority to provide immigration parole on a case-by-case basis, including parole-in-place and advance parole. Additionally, DHS can grant TPS relief to nationals from designated countries, offering protection from removal with limited grounds for termination. This relief is significant for aliens without a legal foothold to remain in the United States. The INA grants DHS authority to provide immigration parole on a case-by-case basis, including parole-in-place and advance parole. Additionally, DHS can grant TPS relief to nationals from designated countries, offering protection from removal with limited grounds for termination. TPS is particularly important for aliens without a legal foothold in the US, providing temporary assurance against imminent removal. Aliens granted TPS have a relatively secure status that is difficult for DHS to withdraw, unlike deferred action or DACA. LPR, refugee, and asylee status offer the strongest protection against removal, while aliens with discretionary reprieves remain technically removable under the INA. Aliens granted TPS have a secure status that is hard for DHS to revoke. Discretionary reprieves offer protection from removal and eligibility for an employment authorization document. Time spent on reprieves does not count towards unlawful presence for admission bars. A discretionary reprieve may trigger eligibility for benefits like in-state university tuition. State governments may have limited discretion in denying benefits to unlawfully present aliens with a reprieve. Discretionary reprieves do not confer lawful immigration status, which is an imprecise term in the INA. According to DHS regulations, TPS holders do not have \"lawful status,\" even though they have protection against removal. Nonimmigrants possess lawful status, which can be revoked more easily than TPS. Parole is also considered a lawful status but can be terminated at DHS's discretion. The term \"lawful immigration status\" describes privileges and protections under the INA for major statuses like LPR, asylee, and refugee. Aliens who receive discretionary reprieves do not have lawful immigration status, meaning they lack privileges and protections granted to LPRs, refugees, and asylees. They generally cannot work legally, have no prospects of permanent residency, are subject to removal, and cannot facilitate the admission of immediate relatives into the United States. Aliens granted discretionary reprieves lack lawful immigration status, face restrictions on federal benefits, and cannot travel abroad without advance parole. While they have some statutory protections, their legal situation ranks low in the spectrum of immigration. Recipients of discretionary reprieves from removal lack lawful immigration status and face restrictions on federal benefits. They do not possess the protections of LPR, refugee, asylee, or nonimmigrant status, and remain technically removable under immigration laws. The glossary categorizes discretionary reprieves from removal into three categories: reprieves based on enforcement discretion or statutory authorization, reprieves granted in connection with the removal process, and reprieves granted before or after removal proceedings. Deferred Action is described as an act of administrative discretion by DHS regulations. Deferred Action is an act of administrative convenience by DHS, giving lower priority to certain cases. It is a generic label for a decision not to remove an inadmissible or deportable alien. Recipients may qualify for work authorization if they demonstrate economic necessity. They are not considered unlawfully present for certain immigration bars. Only a small number of people receive generic deferred action each year compared to DACA. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a specific type of deferred action for aliens who came to the US as children and meet certain criteria. Unlike generic deferred action, DACA recipients must have arrived before a specific date, continuously resided in the US, and be in school or have graduated. DACA grants are subject to periodic review by DHS and can be terminated at any time. DACA was created in 2012 for individuals who arrived in the US as children, meet specific criteria, and are under the age of thirty-one. It has clearer eligibility criteria and application procedures than generic deferred action. A grant of DACA lasts two years and confers benefits such as work authorization. DHS can terminate DACA for specific reasons outlined in its Standard Operating Procedures. The SOP outlines specific reasons for terminating DACA, with ongoing litigation over DHS's authority to rescind DACA grants and the program entirely. Federal courts have halted the rescission of DACA, citing it as likely \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA. Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is a temporary stay of removal for aliens from designated countries, based on the President's constitutional powers. The President has the constitutional power to designate Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for nationals of a specific country through an Executive Order or Presidential Memorandum. DED protects individuals from certain designated countries from removal, based on executive power rather than statutory authority. Eligibility criteria vary depending on the presidential directive, with recipients generally eligible for work authorization and not accruing unlawful presence. Currently, Liberia is the only country designated for DED, but the Trump Administration has decided to terminate that designation effective March 31, 2019. Extended Voluntary Departure (EVD) was an earlier version of DED that fell mostly into disuse with the advent of DED in 1990. Under EVD, the Attorney General designated countries for protection due to unstable conditions. Nonpriority Status was used before 1975 to describe deferred action. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows DHS to grant protection to nationals of designated unsafe countries due to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions. Initial TPS designation is valid for up to 18 months and may be extended with no limit on the number of extensions. The Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows DHS to grant protection to nationals of designated unsafe countries due to armed conflict, natural disaster, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS can be extended indefinitely at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security. Nationals must have resided in the US since a specified date and meet other requirements to qualify for TPS, which provides work authorization and protection from removal. Some courts consider TPS as meeting the lawful entry requirement for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(a), allowing aliens to adjust to LPR status. Parole allows DHS to admit inadmissible aliens into the US for humanitarian reasons or public benefit, but offers limited protection against removal. DHS grants parole for a fixed period with discretion to terminate it. Paroled aliens can work and do not accrue unlawful presence. Parole in place allows parole for aliens already in the US after surreptitious entry. Parole in place and advance parole are forms of executive parole authority that allow certain aliens to obtain LPR status without leaving the US. Administrative closure may occur when ICE decides to discontinue enforcement actions. When ICE decides to temporarily discontinue a removal proceeding against an alien, they may request administrative closure from the immigration judge. This suspends the proceedings but does not terminate them, allowing ICE to reactivate the case at any time. ICE can request administrative closure to temporarily suspend removal proceedings, allowing them to be reactivated at any time. Administrative closure does not grant additional rights or protections, but may be granted alongside other discretionary reprieves like DACA, which provides work authorization and eliminates unlawful presence. The INA also allows for voluntary departure for aliens who agree to leave the US at their own expense. Voluntary departure can be granted either before or after removal proceedings, with a maximum period of 120 days for aliens not yet in proceedings and 60 days at the conclusion of proceedings. It does not provide work authorization but suspends unlawful presence accumulation. Failure to depart within the specified time results in fines and ineligibility for certain forms of relief from removal. A stay of removal may be granted by DHS, an immigration judge, or the Board of Immigration Appeals to allow an alien to pursue relief or for humanitarian reasons. It does not grant work authorization, but an order of supervision may provide eligibility in some cases. Unlawful presence does not accumulate during a stay of removal. If DHS does not remove an alien within ninety days of a final removal order, they may be placed under an order of supervision, requiring periodic check-ins with DHS. An Order of Supervision (OSUP) requires aliens to check in periodically with DHS and may include work authorization, with stricter criteria than other reprieves. It does not stop the accumulation of unlawful presence for the three- and ten-year bars on admission, and DHS revocation is limited by due process principles."
