    "content": "Unemployment Compensation (UC) is funded by federal and state payroll taxes, deposited into the Unemployment Trust Fund. The program aims to counter economic fluctuations by collecting more taxes during economic growth and building a reserve fund for recessions. During economic slowdowns, UC tax revenue decreases, and UC program spending increases to support unemployed workers. States fund UC benefits through their own payroll taxes (SUTA) and federal guidelines. SUTA revenue is deposited into the state's account within the UTF to finance UC benefits. Reserves within the UTF grow during economic growth but decrease during recessions and early recovery periods. During economic recessions, states may face insufficient funds to pay for UC benefits due to decreased SUTA revenue. Federal law provides a loan mechanism within the UTF framework for insolvent states to meet UC benefit payment obligations. Failure to repay these loans promptly may result in interest charges and increased net FUTA rates for employers. Many states struggled with insufficient SUTA revenue and UTF account balances to pay UC benefits after the most recent recession. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) revenue is deposited into the Employment Security Administration Account (ESAA) within the UTF to pay for UC benefits. FUTA imposes a 6.0% tax rate on the first $7,000 paid annually by employers to each employee, with a minimum net federal unemployment tax rate of 0.6%. Employers in states with approved programs and no federal loans outstanding can credit up to 5.4 percentage points of state unemployment taxes against the 6.0% tax rate. This results in a FUTA tax of $42 per worker per year, or just over 2 cents per hour for a full-time, year-round employee. States have autonomy in running their unemployment insurance programs, but federal laws require prompt payment of benefits. UC benefits are funded by a tax on employers and are considered an entitlement. During a recession, states must continue paying benefits even if trust funds are depleted, potentially borrowing from the UTF. Repayment of borrowed funds, plus interest, is required. States have autonomy in running their unemployment insurance programs, but federal laws require prompt payment of benefits. UC benefits are funded by a tax on employers and are considered an entitlement. During a recession, states may need to borrow from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) within the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF). Repayment of borrowed funds, plus interest, is required within a few years, which may lead to tax increases or benefit reductions. Keeping adequate funds in trust fund accounts is crucial to avoid these consequences. Borrowing from sources outside the UTF would subject the state to different loan terms. The FUA may borrow funds from other federal accounts within the UTF or from the U.S. Treasury's general fund. Revenue from additional FUTA taxes paid by employers due to reduced credit against federal unemployment taxes is deposited into the FUA. Federal law allows borrowing from EUCA and ESAA accounts within the UTF, with appropriations as loans from the U.S. Treasury if account balances are insufficient. The federal accounts may borrow funds if balances are insufficient. States can request loans from the UTF to cover UC benefits. Loans must be repaid within 22 months to avoid federal tax increase. The state may have 22 to 34 months to repay a federal UTF loan without facing a tax increase. Approximately $68.3 million in federal UTF loans to states were outstanding as of January 29, 2019. Failure to repay the loan by November 10 of the second year results in a reduction in state unemployment tax credit. More details can be found on the Department of Labor's website. During the period after the 2011 recession, 20 states and the Virgin Islands faced increased FUTA rates due to outstanding UTF loans. The credit reduction starts at 0.3 percentage points and increases by 0.3 percentage points each year with an outstanding loan. This results in a higher federal tax rate for each employee. Beginning in the third year, a statutory formula is used to calculate a 2.7 add-on based on average annual wages and employment contribution rate. In the fifth year, the 2.7 add-on is replaced by the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) add-on, which considers the five-year benefit-cost rate and average wages. The reductions in FUTA tax faced by state employers due to unpaid loans are shown in Table 1. If a state has no outstanding balance on January 1, the year count restarts with the next loan. States with delinquent loans have the option to repay a portion of the outstanding amount each year by November 9. From 2011 through 2014, South Carolina avoided a state tax credit reduction in FUTA taxes by meeting specific requirements, including repaying all loans, having sufficient funds in the state account, and increasing the net solvency of its account with the UTF. This resulted in employers in South Carolina not facing a state tax credit reduction during those years. South Carolina avoided a state tax credit reduction in FUTA taxes by meeting specific requirements, including repaying all loans, having sufficient funds in the state account, and increasing the net solvency of its account with the UTF. To cap reductions, the state must meet criteria such as maintaining unemployment tax revenue, trust fund solvency, and loan balance levels. As of September 30, the balance must not exceed the balance three years prior. The BCR add-on can be waived if the state did not take actions to decrease solvency. The 2.7 add-on replaces the BCR add-on. Additional federal taxes from credit reduction pay off state debt. Employers pay these taxes by January 31 of the following year. States have been charged interest on new loans since April 1, 1982. The interest rate for loans made in calendar year 2019 is 2.3081%. States are not allowed to pay the interest from SUTA revenue or funds in their state account within the UTF. Failure to repay the interest may result in DOL refusing to certify the state's program as compliant with federal law. States must repay interest-free loans from the UTF by September 30 to maintain compliance with federal law. Failure to repay may result in DOL refusing to certify the state's program. Loans made in the last quarter of the year will retroactively accrue interest charges on previous interest-free loans. Funding goals must be met by the states. States must meet funding goals in the UTF and adhere to specific requirements, including the Average High Cost Multiple (AHCM) criteria and maintenance-of-tax effort standards. These requirements were phased in starting in 2014 and fully implemented in 2019. The table lists outstanding state loans, including information on accrued interest payments for FY2019 and whether the state was subject to a credit reduction for tax year 2018. It also provides the net FUTA tax faced by employers in each state with an outstanding loan."
