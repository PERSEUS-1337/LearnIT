    "content": "The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska has been a focal point of the energy debate due to its potential oil resources and diverse wildlife habitat. President Trump signed a law in 2017 allowing for oil and gas development in the Refuge's Coastal Plain, managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The law signed by President Trump in 2017 allows for oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain. It mandates at least two lease sales within 10 years, with revenues split between the State of Alaska and the federal government. Drilling in ANWR is challenging and costly, with bid amounts dependent on oil prices. The law signed by President Trump in 2017 allows for oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain. Companies acquiring a lease must analyze seismic data and drill exploratory wells to determine oil locations and estimate revenues. Infrastructure like new pipelines will be needed to transport oil to refineries. The oil and gas program mandated by P.L. 115-97 is similar to other proposed programs in Congress, with various provisions not included in the final legislation. The law signed by President Trump in 2017 allows for oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain. Congress could address issues related to environmental compliance, judicial review, and special management areas within the Coastal Plain in future legislation. Bills in the 115th Congress would establish the Coastal Plain as wilderness, prohibiting commercial development. This report discusses the Refuge's legislative history. The report discusses the legislative history of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), energy resources, Native interests, and biological resources. ANWR, established in 1980, consists of 19 million acres in northeast Alaska and is administered by FWS within DOI. The Coastal Plain, a 1.57-million-acre area within ANWR, is seen as a promising oil prospect with an estimated 7.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) contains an estimated 7.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil on federal lands. The amount that can be recovered depends on the economics of the oil market, with higher prices making more oil economic to produce. Oil prices have dropped by almost 40% since January 2014, affecting the potential recovery of oil in the area. The federal lands in the 1002 Area of ANWR have 7.1 billion bbl of recoverable oil, with a possibility of up to 10.7 billion bbl. Development would involve multiple smaller fields, increasing costs and potential environmental impacts. Opening ANWR to energy development also affects Native lands on the Coastal Plain. Opening ANWR's Coastal Plain to energy development may also impact Native lands, state lands, and federal lands with potential oil fields. The mean estimate of economically recoverable oil increases from 7.1 billion bbl to 9.7 billion bbl when considering all ownership areas, with a small chance of containing more than 14.6 billion bbl. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has an estimated 9.7 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil, with potential for more than 14.6 billion bbl across Native, state, and federal lands. The refuge is home to diverse wildlife, including caribou, polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, and migratory birds, leading some to refer to it as \"America's Serengeti.\" International treaties protect species like polar bears, caribou, migratory birds, and whales in the area. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has significant oil reserves, prompting debates on balancing oil development with environmental preservation. Legislation has protected lands in the region since 1943, with ongoing issues for Congress. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) was established in 1960 to benefit wildlife and migratory birds, with some lands reserved for oil and gas development. Despite federal ownership, not all of the Refuge is owned by the government. The history of ANWR is linked to congressional efforts to settle land claims of Native Alaskans, with some property transferred to Native corporations. Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971 to resolve these issues. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 distributed land to Native corporations, with village corporations receiving surface estate and regional corporations receiving subsurface estate, including mineral rights. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 distributed land to Native corporations, with village corporations receiving surface estate and regional corporations receiving subsurface estate. ANCSA Section 22(g) limited Native claims regarding oil development. In 1980, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act expanded the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and designated 8 million acres as a wilderness area. The Coastal Plain, constituting 1.57 million acres, was not included in the wilderness designation. The debate over the use of the 1.57 million-acre Coastal Plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was intense, with one group favoring wilderness designation and another group (led by Alaska's two Senators at the time) favoring energy development. Congress postponed decisions on development or protection of the area, directing a study of all its resources in Section 1002 of ANILCA. The 1987 DOI study, known as the 1002 report, recommended full energy development. Section 1003 of ANILCA prohibited oil and gas production in the Refuge unless specified conditions were met. In 1983, complications arose in energy development in ANWR due to land selections by Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation (KIC) and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC). KIC selected surface estate of lands near the northern boundary, totaling over 92,000 acres, while ASRC was prohibited from taking title to the subsurface estate. ANILCA excluded three townships from the 1002 Area, allowing KIC to select more lands totaling approximately 19,588 acres. In 1983, an agreement between the United States and ASRC gave ASRC title to the subsurface estate beneath KIC surface lands in ANWR. The 1983 Agreement prohibited development of the ASRC lands in ANWR unless Congress opened ANWR, which happened in December 2017. The opening of ANWR for energy development could impact both subsurface and surface Native lands. The Native lands in ANWR are not subject to limitations on surface acre development. The 109th Congress debated bills for opening ANWR to energy development, but no changes were enacted. In the 110th Congress, a resolution to designate the area as wilderness was rejected. In the 110th Congress, a resolution to designate the ANWR area as wilderness was rejected. In the following Congresses, various bills were introduced regarding the Arctic Refuge, including one (H.R. 3407) that proposed opening the Coastal Plain to energy leasing under BLM administration. H.R. 3407 proposed opening the Coastal Plain to energy leasing under BLM administration, with provisions for environmental protection, fair market value, limited surface area coverage, mitigation requirements, legal challenge limits, revenue allocation to the U.S. Treasury, and other restrictions on public access and transportation. During the 114th Congress, the Obama Administration approved the recommendation to designate the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as wilderness. Amendments were approved by the House to prohibit the use of funds for this purpose. During the 114th Congress, the Obama Administration approved the recommendation to designate the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) as wilderness. An amendment to designate the Coastal Plain as wilderness failed in a recorded vote. President Trump signed into law P.L. 115-97, directing the Secretary of the Interior to establish a competitive program for oil and gas development in ANWR's Coastal Plain. P.L. 115-97 directs BLM to manage the oil and gas program on the Coastal Plain in a manner similar to the administration of lease sales under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. The law requires at least two area-wide lease sales in the Coastal Plain, with an initial lease sale required within four years of enactment and a second lease sale within seven years. The law mandates two lease sales in the Coastal Plain of ANWR within 10 years of enactment. Each sale must offer 400,000 acres with high hydrocarbon potential. Royalty rate for leases is set at 16.67%, with 50% of revenues going to Alaska and 50% to the U.S. Treasury. This revenue split differs from the standard arrangement under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. H.Rept. 115-97 authorizes up to 2,000 surface acres of federal land on the Coastal Plain for production facilities. Bills promoting development in the 1002 Area have been introduced in Congress, along with bills designating the area as wilderness. Alaska's North Slope shows promise for energy prospects in ANWR, with petroleum-bearing strata extending into the 1002 Area. Changing prices and costs impact oil and gas prospects. The North Slope in Alaska holds promise for oil and gas prospects in ANWR, but production issues have raised doubts. New technologies may help address environmental concerns, but developing ANWR's resources would be costly due to location and infrastructure needs. The United States consumes around 19.8 million barrels of oil per day, with 10.6 million barrels imported and 9.2 million barrels produced domestically. Alaskan oil production contributes about 0.49 million barrels per day, or 2.4% of U.S. consumption. Alaskan oil production, mainly from the North Slope, has been declining since 1989, contributing 0.49 million bbl/day, or 2.4% of U.S. consumption. Oil prices are influenced by global markets, with demand increasing from 2010 due to economic growth and political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. However, since May 2014, world oil prices have dropped significantly, leading to companies cutting back on expenditures and delaying projects. This has impacted interest in ANWR for some oil companies. Interest in ANWR for oil companies may decrease as oil prices are low, making development of more expensive oil resources less economically feasible. The outlook of sustained low oil prices prompts companies to reconsider resource development plans and capital budgets. Estimates of ANWR's oil potential are based on limited data and assumptions. Shift in interest towards parts of the 1002 Area west and north of the Marsh Creek anticline has been driven by reevaluation. The shift in interest towards parts of the 1002 Area was mainly driven by a reevaluation of geological data from nearby formations. USGS estimated that at certain oil prices, there is a chance to economically recover billions of barrels of oil on federal lands. However, sustained low oil prices could result in less economically recoverable oil than previously estimated. Additionally, there may be more oil under adjacent state waters and Native lands than in the 1002 Area alone. The adjacent state waters and Native lands near the 1002 Area may hold more oil and gas than the 1002 Area alone. However, current prices may make production uneconomic. Onshore development under P.L. 115-97 could benefit state waters leases with infrastructure support, making them more attractive to industry. Lifting the ban on oil and gas development in the Refuge could also benefit Native lands by allowing shared facilities or preferred support locations with fewer restrictions on surface development. The USGS projects large quantities of natural gas in the Coastal Plain, but current North American prices may not support building the necessary infrastructure for transportation. Global natural gas prices are linked to oil prices, which have fallen, making additional U.S. exports of LNG less economically attractive. The State of Alaska is leading a project to export North Slope natural gas, with estimated costs between $45 billion and $60 billion. Operating oil and gas facilities in Arctic conditions is more expensive than in other parts of the U.S. due to low natural gas prices. The cost of operating oil and gas facilities in Alaska is 38% higher than in other parts of the United States, mainly due to the remote location. Developing oil and gas resources in Arctic conditions is challenging and costly, with companies reducing their footprint to minimize environmental impacts and costs. Oil field operators in North Slope developed less environmentally intrusive ways to extract Arctic oil through technological innovations, including advanced drilling techniques like extended reach and horizontal wells. Ice-based transportation infrastructure in the 1002 Area may be limited due to safety concerns on rolling terrain. During exploration, drilling pads made of ice are used, while production phase pads are built of gravel and can double in size. During oil and natural gas production in Alaska, pads are built of gravel and can double in size. They are linked to larger pads providing worker housing, equipment storage, and maintenance facilities. Ice roads and pads are becoming more important for development, but warming trends have shortened heavy equipment winter access by over 50%. Industry is adapting by creating new technologies for earlier ice road construction. The heavy reliance on ice technology in Alaska's oil and gas production could be reduced, leading to greater reliance on gravel structures with longer-lasting impacts and higher costs. Companies are adapting to changing conditions by using multiple drilling rigs, starting ice road construction from both ends simultaneously, and prepositioning equipment and materials for quicker tasks during the shorter winter season. Projects like the development of ANWR may need to adjust to a shorter development and maintenance season. New technologies could help reduce environmental impacts of petroleum operations. Advocates of wilderness protection believe that even with efforts to reduce environmental impacts, industrial sites in the Coastal Plain will change its character. The Native community is divided on energy development in the Refuge, with Alaska Natives along the North Slope generally supporting ANWR development, while Natives of interior Alaska oppose it due to reliance on the caribou herd in the 1002 Area. The Gwich'in tribe opposes drilling in the Refuge due to concerns about the safety of the caribou herds during calving season. Native groups supporting ANWR development include ASRC, Doyon Limited, and the Native Village of Kaktovik, citing increased employment and business revenues. Chevron Texaco and BP hold leases in the ANWR coastal plain. BP currently holds leases for all ASRC/KIC acreage in the ANWR coastal plain. Native supporters believe development can be done without harming caribou that calve in the area. The 1002 report from 1987 praised the biological richness of the Arctic Refuge, especially the 1002 area, which is crucial for wildlife activity. Caribou are a focal point in the debate over the impact of development on the Refuge's biology. The biological impacts of Refuge development have been a center of debate, with species like polar bears, musk oxen, and migratory birds being mentioned. The effects of energy development on marine mammals could also be a concern. A 2002 assessment by the USGS concluded that development would have significant impacts on wildlife in the coastal plain of the Refuge. A 2017 update of the 2002 report analyzed new research on caribou, polar bears, musk oxen, and environmental conditions. Research in the last 15 years has shown a continued warming trend with associated effects on wildlife, though no significant changes in vegetation quality and quantity. Specific species research indicated polar bears have become more dependent on onshore habitat for denning, and musk oxen numbers have decreased in the 1002 Area. Caribou herds, including the Porcupine and Central Arctic herds, have continued to be documented. Caribou herds, including the Porcupine and Central Arctic herds, have been documented using the calving grounds in the 1002 Area, with variable use between years. A 2003 report by the National Research Council (NRC) highlighted harmful environmental impacts of existing development at Prudhoe Bay on Arctic ecosystems, such as changes in migration patterns of bowhead whales and caribou, as well as impacts on predator and scavenger populations. The report also mentioned some beneficial economic and social effects of oil development in northern Alaska, but did not determine if these outweighed the harmful effects. Industry supporters argue that wildlife impacts can be reduced. Industry supporters argue that impacts on wildlife from oil and gas activities in the 1002 Area can be mitigated through various measures, such as restricting activities to the winter season, careful placement of infrastructure to minimize disturbance, waste re-injection below permafrost, limiting human access, managing garbage, reducing development footprint, and utilizing improved production technology. They believe these measures will significantly reduce environmental impacts and that current regulations, including NEPA, will still apply. The 2008 listing of polar bears as threatened under the ESA due to climate change effects and oil development could impact energy development in ANWR. The 1002 report highlighted the importance of the area for pregnant female polar bears, as disturbance could lead to den abandonment, risking the survival of cubs. Arguments against listing included population increases in some Arctic regions. In 2010, the FWS designated a wide area in northern Alaska as critical habitat for polar bears under the ESA. This designation could impact federal agency activities, such as energy development, in the area. Federal agencies must consult with FWS to avoid actions that jeopardize the species or their critical habitat. The action agency must consult with FWS to determine if jeopardy or destruction to polar bear habitat might occur, and modify actions to reduce risks. Changing sea ice conditions have led female polar bears to move dens closer to the Refuge, increasing the importance of the coastal plain for the polar bear population. The main ANWR question for Congress is whether to permit energy development in the area. The most contentious issue for Congress regarding ANWR is whether to allow energy development in the Coastal Plain. P.L. 115-97 established an oil and gas program for this area. Congress may be interested in key aspects of the ANWR debate, such as limits on development footprint, environmental protections, NEPA compliance, legal challenges, and treatment of special areas within the Coastal Plain. Congress may address issues related to the development footprint and environmental impacts of energy leasing in the Coastal Plain, with newer technologies allowing for greater consolidation of leasing operations. The debate has focused on limiting the acreage of surface disturbance, with proposals for a 2,000-acre limit to preserve the area. Development proponents argue that a 2,000-acre limit on surface disturbance in the Coastal Plain will protect the environment and wildlife, while opponents fear adverse impacts from drilling infrastructure. The limit does not apply to Native-owned lands, and includes airstrips and support facilities. Uncertainty remains regarding other potential disturbances. The 2,000-acre limit for surface disturbance in the Coastal Plain of ANWR may require development facilities to be dispersed due to drilling limitations. Lateral drilling costs more but allows for full development. Some marginal fields may become uneconomic under the limit, leading to a potential policy choice between not developing them or expanding the development footprint. The proposed bills in the 115th Congress aim to expand environmental protections for oil and gas activities in the Coastal Plain of ANWR, including requirements for site-specific environmental analyses, mitigation plans, and the use of best available technology. These provisions were not included in the previous legislation. The 1002 report completed in 1987 examined the effects of development in ANWR. Some bills aim to expedite the NEPA review process for development in ANWR, while others do not address NEPA review explicitly. P.L. 115-97 addressed the compatibility of oil and gas activities with refuge purposes, allowing activities in a refuge only if compatible. It amended ANILCA to include \"to provide for an oil and gas program on the Coastal Plain\" as a purpose of the Refuge. The bill did not include provisions for expediting NEPA review. The expediting, curtailing, or prohibiting of judicial review could help achieve the goal of implementing an ANWR leasing program promptly. H.R. 49 and S. 49 in the 115th Congress aim to expedite judicial review by reducing time limits for filing suits and limiting the venue and scope of review. Export of North Slope oil, including ANWR oil, has been a contentious issue since the authorization of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System. In the mid-1990s, Alaskan oil exports to the West Coast led to falling oil prices. Congress amended the Mineral Leasing Act to allow oil exports unless deemed against national interest. North Slope oil exports peaked in 1999 but ceased in 2000 due to competition with foreign buyers. In 2014, Alaskan crude oil exports resumed, with cargos being sent to various destinations. Since 2014, Alaskan crude oil exports have resumed, with total exports in 2016 reaching about 3 million barrels. Legislation in the 115th Congress, H.R. 49, would prohibit the export of oil and gas produced under ANWR leases. The 1002 report identified special areas totaling more than 52,000 acres, with H.R. 49 and S. 49 authorizing the Secretary to designate up to 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as special areas. The 1002 report identified special areas totaling more than 52,000 acres, with H.R. 49 and S. 49 authorizing the Secretary to designate up to 45,000 acres of the Coastal Plain as special areas that could be excluded from leasing. P.L. 115-97 authorizes an oil and gas program for the 1002 Area, while other bills in the 115th Congress would designate the area as wilderness, prohibiting commercial activities. Some groups have also sought to preserve the 1002 Area as a national monument. Congressional opponents of ANWR development have indicated concerns. The enactment of P.L. 115-97 in December 2017 ended a long debate over oil and gas development in ANWR in northeastern Alaska. The law established an oil and gas program for the Refuge's Coastal Plain, with lease sales required in the next 10 years. Proponents argue that it will boost the economy and energy security, while opponents fear it will harm the Refuge's unique biological resources. Congressional opponents aim to reverse the policy and advocate for protective designations to prohibit oil and gas exploitation in the area. Activities preparatory to the first ANWR lease sale under P.L. 115-97 include identifying lands, conducting environmental reviews, and conducting geological surveys to determine hydrocarbon resources. Congress may take further action related to ANWR oil and gas leasing through legislation or oversight of DOI's implementation. Some development issues not addressed in P.L. 115-97 could be addressed in future legislation. Congress may decide to amend the oil and gas program in future legislation or end the program by designating the Refuge's Coastal Plain as wilderness. The Congressional Budget Office estimated revenue from the first two lease sales in ANWR at approximately $2.2 billion over 10 years, with actual bids depending on market conditions. Development and transportation of oil in the Refuge is challenging and costly, with industry bids influenced by the price of oil."
