    "content": "The term prosecutorial discretion refers to the wide latitude prosecutors have in deciding when, whom, how, and whether to prosecute violations of the law. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), later the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its components have historically exercised prosecutorial discretion in enforcing federal immigration law. Some argue that DHS primarily deals with civil violations and not traditional law enforcement, but agencies without law enforcement powers still have enforcement discretion in deciding which violations to pursue. Prosecutorial discretion, also known as enforcement discretion, has been used by immigration officers for decades to decide whether to enforce certain violations. Examples include granting extended voluntary departure to Cuban nationals in 1960 and suspending employer sanctions after Hurricane Katrina. Recent interest in prosecutorial discretion in immigration enforcement was sparked by initiatives of the Obama Administration. John Morton, former Director of ICE, issued memoranda in 2011 outlining ICE's priorities for apprehension. ICE's prosecutorial discretion initiatives include setting priorities for apprehension, detention, and removal of aliens, as well as allowing discretion for enforcement consistent with these priorities. Secretary Napolitano's 2012 memorandum introduced DACA for young immigrants. ICE now focuses on not disrupting parental rights during immigration enforcement. Some Members of Congress and commentators challenge initiatives like DACA, claiming they grant \"amnesty\" to unauthorized aliens and exceed the President's authority. Lawsuits have been filed alleging that DACA violates statutory requirements and encroaches on Congress's legislative powers. This report discusses federal power over immigration regulation and the ongoing legal challenges to DACA. The report discusses federal power to regulate immigration, the allocation of power between Congress and the President, and the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion in the immigration context. It also addresses potential constraints on prosecutorial discretion. The Constitution does not directly address the regulation of non-U.S. nationals entering and remaining in the United States. The federal government has the power to regulate immigration in the United States, with key powers such as naturalization and commerce regulation being commonly cited. The Supreme Court has suggested that federal regulation of immigration is based on the government's inherent power to control foreign relations. Congress is seen as preeminent in the field of immigration, with some powers exclusively belonging to them. Congress is considered preeminent in immigration, with plenary power over the subject. The executive branch's authority in immigration may stem from a delegation of congressional power. In Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., the Supreme Court upheld the executive branch's procedures for screening Haitian migrants at sea, citing statutory and treaty-based protections. The Supreme Court has upheld the executive branch's authority in immigration, citing delegated legislative power and the enforcement of laws assigned to the Attorney General by Congress. The separation of powers between Congress and the President in immigration has not been extensively addressed, with some suggesting shared plenary power between the political branches. The Supreme Court has upheld the executive branch's authority in immigration, citing delegated legislative power and the enforcement of laws assigned to the Attorney General by Congress. The President has inherent authority over some immigration-related matters, as seen in cases like United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy and Hampton v. Mow Sung Wong. The Court has recognized the executive power to control foreign affairs and exclude aliens as a fundamental act of sovereignty. In Hampton v. Mow Sung Wong, the Court ruled that rules barring resident aliens from federal civil service jobs violated due process unless mandated by Congress or the President. The discussion highlighted the President's power to limit alien eligibility, possibly referring to authority delegated by Congress. The Court also considered the President's treaty negotiation power as a basis for excluding noncitizens from civil service. The executive branch may have independent authority over immigration, which could justify certain actions. Courts historically do not require specific statutory authorization for prosecutorial discretion. Immigration officials could potentially grant deferred action to removable aliens. The executive branch may have independent authority over immigration, allowing for actions like deferred action for removable aliens. Section 103(a)(3) of the INA grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in enforcing immigration laws, as seen in the DACA initiative lawsuit. This authority is distinct from the President's constitutional duty to enforce laws, and Congress could potentially limit this discretion. The INA grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in enforcing immigration laws, including specific determinations like waiving the bar on admissibility for certain individuals. Congress could potentially limit this discretion, but may not directly limit the President's constitutional authority to enforce laws. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion in determining which aliens are granted employment authorization. This discretion could potentially be limited by Congress. The judicial branch traditionally gives federal prosecutors broad latitude in making investigatory and prosecutorial determinations. The doctrine of prosecutorial discretion allows prosecutors to decide when and whom to prosecute for federal law violations. This concept has historical roots dating back to English common law, where the nolle prosequi allowed the government to intervene and terminate criminal actions deemed frivolous or against royal interests. In modern times, prosecutors use this discretion to end unwarranted prosecutions or cases they choose not to pursue. The modern doctrine of prosecutorial discretion is based on our constitutional structure rather than English common law. Courts have characterized prosecutorial discretion as a function of the separation of powers, the Take Care Clause, or the duties of a prosecutor appointed by the President. Both federal and state courts have ruled that prosecutorial discretion is necessary for the proper administration of justice, making it a constitutionally based doctrine. Courts generally do not review or question prosecutorial decisions, nor can they force the executive branch to initiate a specific prosecution. The executive branch has exclusive authority to initiate and prosecute actions to enforce laws, as the decision to prosecute is not suitable for judicial review due to factors like evidence strength and deterrence value. Enforcement actions in the administrative context resemble prosecutorial decisions in the executive branch. The executive branch has exclusive authority to initiate and prosecute actions to enforce laws, as the decision to prosecute is not suitable for judicial review due to factors like evidence strength and deterrence value. In the criminal context, courts are hesitant to question a prosecutor's decision to bring a prosecution, similar to how they are cautious in reviewing an agency's decision not to bring an enforcement action. The Supreme Court in Heckler v. Cheney established that agency enforcement decisions, like prosecution decisions, involve a \"complicated balancing\" of agency interests and resources, which the agency is better equipped to evaluate than the courts. An \"agency's decision not to take enforcement action should be presumed\" unreviewable. In Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Supreme Court found that deference to prosecutorial discretion in deportation cases is greater due to civil proceedings. The Court indicated that agency decisions not to take enforcement action are generally immune from judicial review, but this presumption can be overcome in certain cases where guidelines are provided by the substantive statute. The Supreme Court has affirmed the executive branch's authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in deportation cases, emphasizing the broad discretion entrusted to immigration officials. This discretion may consider factors such as immediate human concerns, individual equities, and policy considerations, including ties to the community or family in the United States. The executive branch has broad prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases, including decisions on parole, removal proceedings, deferred action, appeals, and motions to reopen. Deferred action is an act of prosecutorial discretion to suspend action against an individual for a specific timeframe, granted on a case-by-case basis. Extended voluntary departure provides blanket relief from removal to specific countries. Judicial and administrative tribunals have noted actions within the prosecutorial discretion of immigration officers. The prosecutorial discretion of immigration officers has been noted in guidance issued since 1976, allowing them to make decisions on detainers, notices to appear, resource allocation, detentions, expedited removal, and other actions. The executive branch guidance on prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases includes settling or dismissing proceedings, granting deferred action, staying removal orders, voluntary departure, pursuing appeals, executing removal orders, and responding to motions to reopen proceedings or grant relief. This guidance emphasizes resource constraints and humanitarian considerations, with decisions based on the \"totality of the circumstances\" and a \"substantial federal interest.\" Prosecutorial discretion in immigration cases involves considering factors like minors, elderly individuals, and known gang members for favorable or unfavorable treatment. While broad, discretion is not unlimited and can be subject to constitutional, statutory, or agency checks. Standing to challenge abuses of discretion may be limited to those directly affected by immigration laws. Standing in immigration cases is generally limited to individuals who can show a personal injury directly linked to the defendant's unlawful conduct and can be remedied by the requested relief. Government officers and employees may lack standing if their only injury is being forced to violate their oaths by implementing an unlawful policy. They must demonstrate a separate adverse consequence resulting from violating their oath, such as the possibility of disciplinary action for obeying or refusing to obey unlawful orders. Courts have differing views on whether the risk of discipline is sufficient for standing or if it is too speculative. Courts have imposed limitations on standing in immigration cases, requiring a personal injury directly linked to the defendant's conduct that can be remedied by relief. Even if standing exists, obtaining relief may be difficult due to a narrow standard of review for actions by Congress or the President, especially in cases involving foreign affairs or national security. In Arizona v. United States, the Supreme Court noted that some discretionary decisions impact the nation's international relations. The Supreme Court has emphasized the broad discretion immigration officers have in making decisions that can affect the nation's international relations. Challenges to immigration enforcement may involve nonjusticiable political questions due to disagreements on enforcement extent. The U.S. Constitution limits the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion, especially in cases involving discrimination based on race or religion. The executive branch's prosecutorial discretion is limited by the U.S. Constitution, especially in cases involving discrimination based on race or religion. Courts have ruled that prosecutions based on unjustifiable standards like race or religion are impermissible. For example, in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court found that enforcing laws only against individuals of a certain race violated the Equal Protection clause. In cases of selective prosecution, defendants face challenges in proving discriminatory intent by the government. Courts require clear evidence to displace the presumption of lawful prosecution, including showing they were singled out based on impermissible factors and that the government had a discriminatory policy. Maintaining claims of selective prosecution is even more difficult in immigration cases due to deference to the executive branch's determinations on prosecution. In immigration cases, concerns about deference to the executive branch's determinations on prosecution are heightened. The Supreme Court has limited claims of selective prosecution in removal proceedings, stating that aliens unlawfully in the country have no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against deportation. This was exemplified in Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, where petitioners alleged they were targeted for deportation due to their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court has limited claims of selective prosecution in removal proceedings, stating that aliens unlawfully in the country have no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against deportation. The Reno Court did leave open the possibility that a decision to remove an alien could potentially be struck down in a \"rare case in which the alleged basis of discrimination is so outrageous that the foregoing considerations can be overcome.\" Subsequent cases continue to recognize the possibility of selective prosecution claims in the immigration context. Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution could also potentially constrain the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion in certain cases. Some courts have suggested that the executive branch could exceed its prosecutorial discretion by implementing a blanket ban on enforcing a statute, potentially violating the duty to faithfully execute laws. However, no court has invalidated non-enforcement policies based on prosecutorial discretion for violating the Take Care Clause. One federal appellate court stated that inadequate enforcement does not constitute an abdication of duty unless plaintiffs can prove it. According to some courts, the Executive must either be \"doing nothing to enforce the laws\" or consciously decide to abdicate its enforcement responsibilities to prove a violation of the Take Care Clause. Some commentators argue that prosecutorial discretion policies not enforcing the law against many individuals could be seen as an abdication of duty. However, even if the INA imposes a duty to remove all unauthorized aliens, a large number of people benefiting from prosecutorial discretion may not necessarily violate the Take Care Clause. Courts may also consider the total population affected by the policy. Courts may consider the size of the population affected by a law and the resources available for enforcement in relation to the President's duty to faithfully execute laws. In the case of DACA, for example, the limited resources of ICE to remove unauthorized aliens may impact the analysis of the President's discretion in enforcing the law. The exercise of discretion by the executive branch in delaying or not taking enforcement actions may be considered by a reviewing court when determining if there has been an abdication of a statutory duty. This includes distinguishing between delaying enforcement actions and not taking any actions at all, as well as considering whether discretion is exercised on a case-by-case basis or if certain offenses are not enforced at all. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has established specific criteria for granting deferred action under the DACA initiative, including eligibility for individuals who arrived in the US before the age of 16 and are either in school or have graduated. The existence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, enforcement mandates from Congress may influence a court's assessment of nonenforcement policies as potentially constituting an abdication of duty. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has specific criteria for granting deferred action under the DACA initiative, focusing on individuals who arrived in the US before age 16 and are in school or have graduated. The analysis considers whether nonenforcement policies may be seen as neglecting duty, especially when prioritizing removal of criminal aliens over unauthorized aliens. Congressional mandates, such as the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), directing DHS to prioritize removal of \"criminal aliens,\" may impact enforcement decisions. The Supreme Court's decision in Heckler v. Cheney suggests that agency decisions not to take enforcement action, including prosecutorial discretion, are generally immune from judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act. This presumption of nonreviewability can be rebutted if the substantive statute provides guidelines for the agency to follow. Determining if a statute provides guidelines for agency enforcement actions to be reviewable involves statutory interpretation. Some argue that the executive branch cannot grant deferred action to DACA beneficiaries due to INA provisions. These provisions deem any alien present in the US without admission as an applicant for admission. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provisions state that any alien present in the US without admission shall be deemed an applicant for admission. Applicants for admission must be inspected by immigration officers, and those not clearly entitled to admission may be detained for removal proceedings. Some interpret these provisions as mandating the removal of unlawfully present aliens, with \"shall\" indicating mandatory agency action. The court found that the plaintiffs' case falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) due to their alleged injury of being compelled to violate a federal statute. No other court has addressed the construction of these provisions of the INA as a whole, leaving room for potential alternate interpretations. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States could also be cited to support a different construction. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States could potentially support an alternate construction regarding the discretion of immigration officials in the removal process, suggesting that the Court does not legally compel immigration officers to place all unlawfully entered aliens in removal proceedings. This contrasts with the district court's interpretation of the INA provisions challenged by ICE officers. The INA requires aliens who unlawfully entered the US to be placed in removal proceedings based on the use of \"shall\" in Section 235, indicating mandatory agency action. However, the use of \"shall\" does not always require specific actions as agencies may retain discretion. The Supreme Court's decision in Arizona v. United States suggests that immigration officers are not legally compelled to place all unlawfully entered aliens in removal proceedings. The INA uses \"shall\" to indicate mandatory agency action for aliens who unlawfully entered the US, but this does not always require specific actions as agencies may have discretion. The Supreme Court and the Board of Immigration Appeals have interpreted \"shall\" as permissive, allowing immigration officials flexibility in deciding on removal proceedings. The use of \"shall\" in statutes does not always mandate enforcement against every individual, as agencies may have discretion. Courts consider the overall statutory scheme and objectives, as seen in cases like Dunlop v. Bachowski, where nonenforcement was reviewable despite the use of \"shall\" in the statute. The Court emphasized that the statute directed the Secretary of Labor to investigate complaints challenging union elections and take civil action within 60 days if a violation is found. The Secretary's discretion is limited to determining probable cause. The use of \"shall\" in statutes does not always mandate enforcement against every individual, as agencies may have discretion. When interpreting agency action in statutory provisions, courts consider whether the agency's interpretation aligns with the statute's purpose, following the Chevron two-part test. If Congress has clearly addressed the issue, the court must adhere to its intent. Otherwise, the agency's interpretation is upheld if it is reasonable and based on a permissible construction of the statute. The agency's interpretation of statutory provisions must align with the statute's purpose. In the case of Section 235 of the INA, the DOJ and DHS have interpreted the provisions differently from those who argue that DHS lacks discretion in removing aliens. Both sides agree on the first two provisions applying to arriving aliens and those present without inspection. However, they differ on the third provision regarding detention of certain aliens seeking admission. The district court reviewing ICE agents' challenge to the DACA initiative declined to grant deference to DHS's interpretation of the provision regarding detention of certain aliens seeking admission. The court found that the INA provisions apply to both arriving aliens at ports of entry and aliens present in the United States without admission, and that DHS regulations did not support DHS's proposed interpretation. The court did not grant deference to DHS's interpretation of the INA provisions regarding detention of certain aliens, as the regulations did not support DHS's proposed interpretation. Other courts may not reach the same conclusion on how much deference should be given to DHS's interpretation of these provisions. Additionally, immigration authorities have interpreted other INA provisions differently, limiting their discretion in certain determinations. The court's decision on DHS's interpretation of INA provisions limits immigration authorities' discretion in certain determinations, potentially through regulations or guidelines that are binding. For example, the Ninth Circuit found an INS Operations Instruction to be binding due to its purpose and effect resembling a substantive provision for relief. The court found an INS Operations Instruction to be binding as it required district directors to recommend deferred action in certain cases, with effects similar to a Congressional statute. This decision limited immigration authorities' discretion in certain determinations. The 1979 case shows that constraints on an agency's prosecutorial discretion in immigration could be seen as a legislative rule. DHS's guidance emphasizes no right to favorable discretion and allows for apprehension, detention, and removal of unlawfully present aliens. Challenges to DACA suggest DHS has enforced its policies as binding despite claiming otherwise. The DACA initiative has been implemented by DHS as if it were a rule, with concerns raised about judicial scrutiny over ICE's exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The Ninth Circuit ordered ICE to clarify its plans in pending cases, highlighting potential future oversight of ICE's decision-making process. Immigration officers have wide discretion in enforcing violations of the INA, similar to prosecutors in criminal law. Congressional members have debated on how to limit this discretion, especially in light of the DACA initiative and DHS memorandum on prosecutorial discretion. Some support DACA and expanded discretion, while others seek to restrict DHS from granting deferred action to removable aliens. Congress may have limited authority to restrict the President's exercise of constitutionally based discretion in the DACA context, depending on how the program's authority is characterized. The degree of intrusion into executive enforcement decisions could impact a court's review of any congressional response. Legal precedent suggests that Congress probably cannot directly limit the President's discretion in this regard. The executive branch can be limited in enforcement actions against individuals, while Congress has more flexibility in setting guidelines for immigration officials. Statutory guidelines must be clear and specific for judicial review, and the use of \"shall\" in the INA may not be enough for enforceable guidelines. Congress can influence the implementation of DACA and other discretion-based policies by overseeing the DHS program or using its power of the purse to restrict funding for policies not supported by Congress."
