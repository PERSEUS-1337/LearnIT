The Community Economic Adjustment Act of 2000 acknowledges that communities facing job losses due to various reasons can experience sudden economic distress. Federal departments and agencies provide assistance to support workers and communities in their recovery efforts. These departments include Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and Education. The Federal Government lacks a central authority to coordinate efforts across departments in response to sudden economic distress in communities, unlike agencies for disaster or base closures. The Federal Government lacks a central authority to coordinate efforts across departments in response to sudden economic distress in communities. The Office of Economic Adjustment of the Department of Defense has successfully provided coordination for communities experiencing defense base closures, serving as a model for government-wide coordination efforts. The Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce helps States and local areas implement strategies to address economic changes causing structural damage. The Federal Government lacks central coordination for responding to sudden economic distress in communities. An Office of Community Economic Adjustment, modeled after the Defense Department's successful program for base closures, aims to provide targeted federal responses and increase funding for community adjustment programs. The Economic Development Administration's community adjustment programs aim to provide grant assistance for communities to develop strategies restoring economic activity and creating new jobs. The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to include the Office of Community Economic Adjustment under Title V.

The Office of Community Economic Adjustment coordinates federal resources to support communities facing economic distress, providing technical assistance and grants to help them develop and implement economic adjustment strategies. The Office of Community Economic Adjustment coordinates federal resources to support communities facing economic distress by providing assistance in replacing lost or threatened industry and jobs, helping applicants with other assistance applications, and performing additional duties as needed.

Authorized appropriations of $35,000,000 annually from 2001 to 2005 for community adjustment assistance under the Economic Development Administration, with $10,000,000 allocated to the Office of Community Economic Adjustment and $25,000,000 for additional economic development program funds.
