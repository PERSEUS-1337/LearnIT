    "content": "The \"Seasoned Customer CTR Exemption Act of 2006\" provides an exception from currency transaction reports for seasoned customers. The Congress acknowledges that filing currency transaction reports poses a burden on the financial industry. Some reports may not be relevant to detecting financial crimes, but the data can still be valuable for analysis and investigations to combat money laundering and other financial crimes. An exemption process for certain currency transactions can help reduce the compliance burden on financial institutions while still providing valuable information to combat financial crimes. The Secretary of the Treasury has implemented a process for institutions to seek exemptions. The financial industry has not fully utilized exemptions for filing currency transaction reports, citing them as burdensome. Providing notice to the Secretary of the Treasury of exemptions gives law enforcement valuable information on exempt customers and helps locate relevant records for investigations. The designation of exemption does not affect the anti-money laundering controls required for depository institutions under US law. Federal banking agencies and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have issued guidance on this matter. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently provided guidance on due diligence and identifying suspicious activity for cash-intensive businesses subject to exemption. The Seasoned Customer Exemption Act of 2006 amended Section 5313(e) of title 31, exempting depository institutions from filing reports for certain transactions involving United States coins. The Seasoned Customer Exemption Act of 2006 amended Section 5313(e) of title 31, exempting depository institutions from filing reports for transactions involving United States coins with qualified customers defined by the Secretary of the Treasury.

The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring a depository institution to file a 1-time notice of designation of exemption for each qualified customer who has maintained a deposit account for at least 12 months and engaged in multiple currency transactions subject to reporting requirements.

The Secretary can establish conditions for exempt qualified customers of merged or acquired depository institutions. Before the end of the 3-year period, the Secretary of the Treasury will evaluate the effects of the provisions of the amendment and make recommendations to Congress. SEC. 3.
