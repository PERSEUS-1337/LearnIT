It aimed to address concerns about violent crime, especially violence against women, by enhancing investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses, mandating restitution to victims, and providing grants to law enforcement agencies. The passage of VAWA was influenced by decades of unease over rising violent crime rates and a focus on women as crime victims. In the 1980s, researchers and grassroots organizations addressed the issue of violence against women, leading to a change in attitude towards family violence as a crime rather than a private matter. Congress enacted the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act in 1984 to prevent incidents of family violence and provide assistance to victims. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 created programs to help law enforcement fight violent crime and provide services to victims. The Violence Against Women Act highlighted the weak response to violence against women by police and prosecutors, emphasizing the need for a change in attitudes towards violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was passed in response to the shortcomings of legal responses and the need for a shift in attitudes towards violence against women. Since its enactment in 1994, VAWA has been reauthorized three times, with the most recent reauthorization in 2013 (P.L. 113-4) expanding programs and provisions to combat trafficking, enhance tribal authority, address rape kit backlogs, and establish nondiscrimination measures for grant programs. The report discusses new provisions to address the rape kit backlog in states as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) in 2013. VAWA was originally passed in 1994 to enhance investigations and prosecutions of sex offenses and provide grant programs to address violence against women. VAWA, passed in 1994, impacted federal investigations and prosecutions of violence against women by establishing new offenses and penalties for protection order violations and stalking across state lines. It required states to enforce protection orders from other jurisdictions and allowed for enhanced sentencing of repeat federal sex offenders. VAWA also authorized funding for training programs for probation and parole officers working with released sex offenders and mandated pretrial detention in federal sex offense cases. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 established new requirements for pretrial detention in federal sex offense cases and modified rules regarding the admissibility of a victim's past sexual behavior in federal criminal and civil cases of sexual misconduct. It also mandated restitution for victims of specified federal sex offenses and created provisions for civil remedies and HIV testing for rape victims. Additionally, VAWA included measures to ensure confidentiality between sexual assault or domestic violence victims and their counselors, as well as grant programs for various activities. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 established grant programs for activities related to preventing domestic violence, encouraging collaboration among law enforcement, investigating and prosecuting domestic violence, and addressing the needs of special population groups. VAWA grants are administered by various government departments. Grants were also authorized for capital improvements to prevent crime in public transportation systems. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 expanded grants for youth education on domestic violence, community intervention programs, and bolstered investigations and prosecutions in rural areas. It also authorized grants for education and training for judges and court personnel on crimes of violence motivated by gender. VAWA expanded grants for youth education on domestic violence, community intervention programs, and investigations in rural areas. It authorized grants for data entry on stalking and domestic violence, rape prevention education, and funding for youth at risk of sexual abuse. VAWA also reauthorized programs like the Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program and established the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Funding was provided for battered women's shelters and special protections for nonimmigrant women and children. VAWA included provisions for various activities such as ensuring confidentiality of domestic violence shelters, federal research on violence against women, and special studies on campus sexual assault. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was created to administer grants under VAWA, awarding over $6 billion in grants since its inception. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) administers VAWA grants for various organizations. VAWA grant programs address domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, with a focus on victim demographics. Data on victimization is available from national surveys and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program describes crimes reported to law enforcement, while survey data describe self-reported crimes. VAWA legislation initially focused on violence against women but now aims to meet the needs of all victims. Domestic violence, labeled as family or intimate partner violence, is interpreted under VAWA as intimate partner violence. This includes crimes committed by spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends, ex-boyfriends, or ex-girlfriends. Domestic violence, as defined under VAWA, includes crimes committed by current or former intimate partners, those with whom the victim shares a child, or cohabitants. The rate of serious intimate partner violence against females decreased by 63% from 1993 to 2013. Intimate partner victimization rates have declined significantly for both females and males from 1993 to 2013. Rates vary by age and race, with higher rates for females aged 18 or older and historically higher rates for black females. A CDC survey in 2011 found that 22.3% of women and 14.0% of men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Overall violent and property crime rates have decreased since the early 1990s, including homicide rates and intimate partner homicide rates. Overall, homicide rates and intimate partner homicide rates have declined. Researchers attribute the decrease in intimate partner homicide rates to factors such as the decline in marriage rates among young adults and the increase in divorce and separation rates. Males are predominantly the offenders in homicides, but females are more likely to be victims of intimate partner homicide. Females are more likely than males to be victims of intimate partner homicide, with female victims being six times more likely than male victims from 1980 to 2008. 63% of all intimate partner homicide victims are female. Sexual assault, a separate category under VAWA, includes crimes like rape and assault with intent to rape. Sexual assault is defined as any nonconsensual sexual act under VAWA and federal criminal law. According to NCVS statistics, there were 300,170 sexual assaults reported. According to the Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), there were 300,170 sexual assaults reported in 2013, with 1.1 per 1,000 aged 12 and older. These self-reported data are not comparable to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program data. The FBI's UCR Program reported 79,770 forcible rapes to law enforcement in 2013, showing a decline since 1990. The revised FBI definition of rape includes male victims and reported 108,672 forcible rapes in 2013. The definition of forcible rape has evolved over the years to be broader and more inclusive. The FBI revised its definition of forcible rape in 2012 to include male victims. Current UCR reports include rape statistics for both male and female victims. Under VAWA, dating violence refers to violence in romantic or intimate relationships. Reports on dating violence often involve teenagers, with approximately 10.3% of high school students experiencing violence from a dating partner according to a 2013 survey. Physical dating violence is more prevalent among female students than male students. Stalking is defined as a course of conduct causing fear in a specific person. Federal law prohibits traveling across state lines with the intent to injure or harass another. In 2006, 3.3 million individuals aged 18 and older were victims of stalking, with females at greater risk than males. In 2006, females aged 18-24 were at greater risk of stalking victimization. 15.2% of women and 5.7% of men have been stalked by an intimate partner. Congress reauthorized VAWA three times, with bipartisan support in 2000 and 2005, while facing adversity in 2013. Reauthorizations included additional protections for battered nonimmigrants and funds for rape prevention programs. VAWA 2000 expanded laws to include interstate stalking and domestic violence, addressing various scenarios involving travel and violence against spouses or intimate partners. It also allocated funds for rape prevention and education programs, specifically for disabled women and victims of dating violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2000 expanded laws to include interstate stalking and domestic violence, adding protections for battered nonimmigrants and enhancing penalties for repeat stalking offenders. It emphasized collaboration among law enforcement, health professionals, and community initiatives to address domestic violence. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 2013 reauthorized most grant programs at a lower level, consolidated some programs, and created new grant programs. Authorization for VAWA programs expired in 2011, but continued to receive appropriations in FY2012 and FY2013. In 2013, VAWA was reauthorized through the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA 2013; P.L. 113-4), with grants reauthorized from FY2014 through FY2018. The Violence Against Women Act of 2013 reauthorized and consolidated grant programs, creating new programs to support families in the justice system and children and youth affected by domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The CHOOSE Children & Youth program aims to enhance safety for youth and children affected by violence, while also preventing future violence. The SMART Prevention program combines existing programs to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking through awareness, education, and support for children exposed to violence. Additionally, the program involves engaging men as leaders to prevent violence. Three previously unfunded programs were eliminated and their purpose areas were included in a new program called Grants to Strengthen the Healthcare System's Response to Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking. The purpose is to improve training for health professionals in preventing and responding to these types of violence. VAWA 2013 established new provisions for all VAWA grant programs, including a nondiscrimination provision to ensure victims are not denied services based on race, color, or religion. The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA enhanced protection for victims, specified information sharing guidelines for grantees, and added, modified, or expanded definitions of terms. For example, it revised the definition of \"domestic violence\" to include \"intimate partners\" and amended the definition of \"culturally specific services\" to address the needs of specific communities. The 2013 reauthorization of VAWA expanded definitions and added terms like \"population specific services\" and \"rape crisis center.\" It redefined \"underserved populations\" to include discrimination based on religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity. The definition of cyberstalking was broadened to include electronic communication devices. VAWA 2013 expanded definitions and added terms like \"individual in later life\" and \"youth.\" It imposed new accountability provisions, including an audit requirement and mandatory exclusion for unresolved audit findings. The Office on Violence Against Women was required to establish a biennial conferral process with grantees and stakeholders. VAWA 2013 also strengthened audit requirements for sexual assault evidence backlogs and mandated that at least 75% of Debbie Smith grant amounts be used for DNA analyses. VAWA 2013 allocated 75% of Debbie Smith grant amounts for DNA analyses of crime scene samples and to enhance state/local lab capacities. It also expanded VAWA grant purposes to aid sexual assault survivors, reduce rape kit backlogs, and directed funds towards sexual assault programs. Additionally, it amended the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to combat trafficking in persons. VAWA 2013 expanded grant purposes to aid sexual assault survivors, combat trafficking in persons, and included provisions for American Indian tribes to exercise special domestic violence jurisdiction. VAWA 2013 established a pilot program for Indian tribes to have special criminal jurisdiction over domestic violence cases, with the Attorney General granting requests based on safeguards for defendants' rights. It also expanded grant purposes to include sex trafficking and legislation development for responding to violent crimes against Indian women. The most recent reauthorization of VAWA extended coverage to derivative children of self-petitioning parents who died during the petition process. It also exempted certain petitioners from being classified as inadmissible for legal permanent resident status based on financial circumstances. Additionally, it expanded the definition of the nonimmigrant U visa to include victims of stalking. VAWA 2013 added new purpose areas for Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies. VAWA 2013 expanded grant provisions to address the needs of underserved populations, including immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. It required demographic data on underserved populations in STOP implementation plans and allocated funding for Grants for Outreach to Underserved Populations. VAWA 2013 allocated 2% of funding for the Arrest and STOP programs to the Grants for Outreach to Underserved Populations program. It added housing rights for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, ensuring they are not denied public housing assistance. The Transitional Housing Assistance Grant program removed the requirement for victims to be \"fleeing\" to receive assistance and prohibited background checks for eligibility. VAWA 2013 mandated transitional housing assistance for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. It also required emergency transfer plans for victims in covered housing programs and allowed victims to receive Section 8 assistance. Additionally, it established grant guidelines for higher education institutions to address incidents of violence. VAWA 2013 addressed various forms of violence including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence. It also amended rules for sexual acts in federal custodial facilities and enhanced criminal penalties for assaulting a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner. The primary goals of VAWA are to prevent violent crime. The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) aims to prevent violent crime, support crime victims, raise awareness about violence against women, and change public attitudes towards domestic violence. It involves collaboration between various organizations and is primarily funded through federal grant programs. VAWA 2013 authorized appropriations for programs from FY2014-FY2018, with FY2011-FY2015 funding history available. The funding for the Violence Against Women Act programs is provided by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015."
