    "content": "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to provide health care coverage to low-income, uninsured children. CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million children and 335,000 adults in FY2008, with federal spending totaling $7.0 billion. Congress reauthorized the program in the 111th Congress after the absence of future federal appropriations triggered legislative attention. President Obama signed the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 into law, which included a national appropriation of $68.9 billion over five years for CHIP allotments to states and territories. The law also established a new contingency fund and performance bonus payments for states exceeding certain criteria. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 includes new performance bonus payments, additional grants for outreach and enrollment, provisions to remove barriers to enrollment, a state option to extend coverage to pregnant women under CHIP, provisions to terminate CHIP adult coverage waivers, and establish conditions to continue existing waivers under Medicaid, and a state option to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or SCHIP coverage to pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 includes provisions for coverage to pregnant women and children in the US, alternative verification for citizenship, benefits like dental and mental health, premium assistance for employer-based insurance, quality of care improvements, a Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, program integrity measures, and tobacco tax changes. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) was signed into law as P.L. 111-3 by President Obama on February 4, 2009. It allows using CHIP as the acronym instead of SCHIP and is effective from April 1, 2009. States will have time to comply with CHIPRA requirements based on their legislative sessions. Rescinded FY2009 CHIP allotment amounts will be replaced with funding from this act. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) will replace rescinded FY2009 CHIP allotments with funding from the act. States cannot be denied Medicaid and CHIP payments if they acted in good faith reliance on the provisions of the act. Cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office show that CHIPRA would increase outlays by $32.8 billion over 5 years and by $66.1 billion over 10 years, offset by increases in federal tobacco taxes. CHIPRA aims to increase on-budget revenue by $32.8 billion over 5 years and $66.6 billion over 10 years. In 2007, around 9 million uninsured children were mostly from two-parent families (53%) with full-time working parents (60%). Data shows that most uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP (62%). CBO projects a 6.5 million increase in average monthly Medicaid and CHIP enrollment in FY2013, totaling 37.7 million enrollees. About 80% of the increased enrollment would be from current eligibility groups. Of the 6.5 million increase, 37% would have had private coverage without the legislation, and 63% would be uninsured. The structure of CHIPRA is similar to previous bills. The CHIPRA legislation, similar to previous bills, aims to increase on-budget revenue by $32.8 billion over 5 years and $66.6 billion over 10 years. It builds upon prior laws such as BBA97 and MMSEA, which provided funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to prevent states from running out of federal funds. The CHIP appropriation for original allotments in FY2007 was $5.04 billion, with additional funding provided annually in FY2008 and FY2009. MMSEA also allocated up to $275 million to cover any shortfalls in federal CHIP funds. CHIPRA provides national appropriations for CHIP allotments as follows: $10.562 billion in FY2009; $12.52 billion in FY2010; $13.459 billion in FY2011; $14.982 billion in FY2012; and $2.85 billion for the first half of FY2013 and $2.85 billion for the second half of FY2013. Prior to CHIPRA, the territories received 0.25% of the national appropriation, with the remainder allotted among states based on a formula using survey estimates of low-income uninsured children. CHIPRA calculates state CHIP allotments based on three state-specific amounts: FY2008 federal CHIP spending, FY2008 federal CHIP allotment, and state projections for FY2009. The largest of these amounts determines the state's allotment if it does not exceed the national appropriation. The state's FY2009 federal CHIP allotment is determined by three state-specific amounts, with the largest one increasing by 10%. For FY2010, the allotment is calculated based on four amounts and a growth factor. FY2011 and FY2013 allotments are \"rebased\" on prior year spending. For FY2012, the state's federal CHIP allotment will be calculated based on the prior year's spending, multiplied by the state's growth factor. A Child Enrollment Contingency Fund will be established and funded initially by a separate appropriation of 20% of the available national allotment for CHIP in FY2009. Subsequent appropriations for FY2010 through FY2013 will be based on necessary payments to eligible states, not exceeding 20% of the available national CHIP allotment for each fiscal year. If state spending exceeds available allotments and enrollment surpasses target numbers, payments from the Contingency Fund will cover projected federal CHIP costs for additional enrollees. Bonus payments will be given to states increasing Medicaid enrollment for low-income children above a set baseline, contingent on implementing specific outreach and enrollment activities. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of various options to ease enrollees' renewal processes, presumptive eligibility for children, and premium assistance. Funding for these initiatives would come from an initial appropriation in FY2009 of $3.225 billion, along with transfers from different potential sources. The Medicaid bonus baseline is determined by the state's average monthly number of enrolled Medicaid children in 2007, increased by state child population growth between 2007 and 2008. The Medicaid bonus baseline is determined by the state's average monthly number of enrolled Medicaid children in 2007, increased by state child population growth between 2007 and 2008, and subsequent years see percentage point increases. The first tier of bonus payments is for child Medicaid enrollees representing growth above the baseline less than 10%, with bonus payments equal to 15% of the state share of these enrollees' projected per capita Medicaid expenditures. The Medicaid bonus payments are based on the state's average monthly number of enrolled Medicaid children in 2007, with increases for child population growth. Bonus payments are given for growth above the baseline, with different tiers based on the percentage increase. New Medicaid children must meet eligibility criteria from July 1, 2008, to qualify for bonus payments. If funding is insufficient, payments to states will be reduced proportionally. Presumptive eligibility for Medicaid can be determined by various entities for children. Under CHIPRA, children eligible for Medicaid can be enrolled for up to two months while final eligibility is determined. CHIP allotments under BBA97 were for three years, but under CHIPRA, they are for two years. Unspent funds under CHIPRA are first given to shortfall states and then towards bonus payments. States under BBA97 faced a maintenance of effort, preventing them from using federal CHIP funds for children already covered under Medicaid. Some states saw this as a penalty for expanding Medicaid to higher income children before CHIP. Under CHIPRA, a provision was added to allow 11 early expansion states to use some CHIP funds for Medicaid children above 150% of poverty, with a 20% limit on spending from each allotment. CHIPRA also included a one-time appropriation of $11.706 billion for FY2013 to reduce future allotments assumed by the CBO. States were previously able to cover pregnant women ages 19 and older through waiver authority or by providing. CHIPRA allows states to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment when certain conditions are met. Coverage is limited to prenatal and delivery services, with eligibility restrictions similar to those for CHIP children. The period of coverage is during pregnancy through the postpartum period, roughly 60 days postpartum. States can temporarily enroll pregnant women in CHIP for up to two months until eligibility is determined. Benefits include prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants born to these women eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one. Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows the Secretary of HHS to modify aspects of the programs, expanding eligibility to populations like childless adults and pregnant women age 19 and older. CHIP funds can be used to extend coverage to childless adults, pregnant women age 19 and older, and parents of Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children. Some states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, which are initially effective for five years and subject to renewal every three years. Waiver renewals for adult coverage have not been approved in some states since 2007, leading to transitions out of CHIP coverage for adult populations. As of January 7, 2009, four states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds for childless adult populations, and seven states have authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of calendar year 2009. States with existing childless adult waivers can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage subject to budget neutrality standards. Coverage of parents is allowed, but spending under waivers will be tied to previous fiscal year spending. In FY2012, spending will be subject to a set-aside amount and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting coverage benchmarks will receive an amount between regular and enhanced FMAPs for parents. The provision prohibits waiver spending for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds. Prior SCHIP statute set federal share of costs during presumptive eligibility for Medicaid children at Medicaid matching rate. Entities can make presumptive eligibility determinations for children. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) includes provisions for children's healthcare eligibility, Medicaid coverage for pregnant women, and continuous eligibility for newborns up to age 1. It also addresses the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid service expenditures. The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP reduces the state's share under the regular FMAP by 30%, with a statutory minimum of 65% and maximum of 85%. CHIPRA reduces federal CHIP payments for certain higher-income CHIP children, specifying that the regular FMAP would be used for CHIP enrollees whose effective family income exceeds 300% of poverty. CHIPRA allows states to use Medicaid funds at the regular FMAP for Medicaid-expansion CHIP children, with $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Funds will be allocated for a national enrollment campaign, outreach for Native American children, and initiatives targeting rural areas and underserved populations, including addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIP includes outreach to Native Americans as part of the National Enrollment Campaign. Prior SCHIP law required state plans to ensure child health assistance for American Indian and Alaskan Native children. Non-benefit payments under SCHIP cannot exceed 10% of total expenditures. CHIPRA encourages states to enroll Indians near reservations in Medicaid and CHIP through various outreach and education efforts. The Secretary must facilitate cooperation between states and Indian entities in providing benefits to Indians under Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA creates a state option to rely on \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for medical assistance under Medicaid or CHIP. States will have the option to exclude costs for outreach to potentially eligible Indian children and families from the 10% cap on non-benefit expenditures under CHIP. States have the option to implement automatic enrollment through Express Lane eligibility determination for Medicaid or CHIP. This allows for consent to be obtained in various ways, such as in writing, by telephone, or electronically. CHIPRA eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms under penalty of perjury. Additionally, states can inform families about potential eligibility for lower premiums or more comprehensive coverage under Medicaid based on reported income. Before the DRA, states could accept self-declaration of citizenship for Medicaid, but now nationals must provide proof of citizenship and identity. CHIPRA allows states to use verified Social Security Numbers for eligibility, simplifying the enrollment process. States have implemented various strategies to enroll eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP, making progress in simplifying application and enrollment processes. CHIPRA mandates states to streamline enrollment processes for Medicaid and CHIP by implementing joint application and renewal processes, eliminating face-to-face interviews, and reducing administrative barriers. The Secretary of HHS is required to develop a model process for coordinating enrollment, retention, and coverage for children who frequently change residency. Under prior law, legal immigrants arriving in the United States after August 22, 1996, were ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for their first five years here. Coverage of such persons after the five-year bar was permitted at state option if they met other eligibility requirements for that program. CHIPRA permits states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for children who frequently change their residency due to migration of families, emergency evacuations, educational needs, etc. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States. The provision also includes the option for states to provide assistance for pregnant women under the CHIP state plan. Individuals eligible under this provision will not have the cost of care counted against their sponsor. Redetermination processes will require individuals with expired legal residence documentation to reapply for eligibility. Under prior law, states could pay for group health insurance in CHIP if cost-effective and not substituting for other coverage. States using CHIP funds for employer-based plans had to ensure minimum benefits and cost-sharing limits. In Medicaid, states can implement premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Individuals with expired legal residence documentation must show further evidence of lawful residence. Medicaid requires employer plans to be cost-effective compared to direct Medicaid coverage. States must offer \"wrap-around\" benefits for services not covered by private plans. Most states use waivers for CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for eligible children and parents. Under CHIPRA, states can offer premium assistance to Medicaid and CHIP-eligible families with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy covers the difference in premiums for children's coverage, and a wrap-around is required for plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for private coverage compared to regular CHIP. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance to Medicaid and CHIP-eligible families with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy can cover the entire family's premium if it is more cost-effective than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s). States must conduct outreach and can establish employer-family premium assistance purchasing pools. The new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not CHIP, apply to children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. States are required to include outreach procedures in their CHIP state plans. State plans must include procedures for outreach to inform families of CHIP eligibility and assist with enrollment. Federal spending on CHIP administrative expenses is limited to 10% of state spending on benefit coverage. States must ensure coordination between CHIP and other health insurance coverage. CHIPRA mandates outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for eligible families. The state is required to provide education and enrollment assistance for families eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP. Expenditures for outreach activities are limited to 1.25% of the state's administrative costs for their CHIP program. Group health plans must offer special enrollment opportunities to qualified individuals who have lost eligibility for other coverage. Individuals who have lost eligibility for other group coverage, employer contributions, or added a dependent can enroll in a group health plan without waiting for a late enrollment opportunity. They must still meet the plan's eligibility requirements and have 30 days after the qualifying event to request special enrollment. CHIPRA allows individuals to request employer-sponsored coverage within 60 days of losing Medicaid/CHIP eligibility. Health plan administrators must disclose information to individuals. CHIPRA requires health plan administrators to disclose benefit package information to states for evaluating wraparound coverage needs. Employers must notify families of potential premium assistance eligibility. The law aims to improve care quality in Medicaid and CHIP by developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. Initiatives include grants, contracts, and demonstrations to enhance pediatric care quality. CHIPRA aims to improve children's health care under Medicaid and CHIP by developing a model for reducing child obesity and promoting the use of electronic health records. It also enhances public information on enrollment and requires states to report on eligibility criteria and access to care. The law improves the quality of care by implementing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. CHIPRA requires the Secretary to improve enrollment and eligibility data for Medicaid and CHIP children. GAO must study children's access to primary and specialty care under Medicaid and CHIP, with a report due within two years. Managed care safeguards for Medicaid also apply to CHIP. Under current law, states may provide CHIP coverage under their Medicaid programs or create a separate CHIP program. States can choose from three benefit options: benchmark plan, benchmark-equivalent plan, or Secretary-approved coverage. Benchmark plans include standard options like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, state employee coverage, or largest commercial HMO. Benchmark-equivalent plans must cover basic benefits and at least 75% of the actuarial value of coverage. Under CHIPRA, dental services are now a required benefit under CHIP, including preventive, restorative, and emergency care. States can offer dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages based on existing medical benchmark plans. The law also includes provisions for dental education for parents and services through federally qualified health centers. The Child Health Improvement Activities under CHIPRA include dental services as a required benefit, with provisions for education for parents and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on children receiving dental care, and a study will be conducted on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP. Recommendations for improving access will be included in the study report. CHIPRA allows states to use mid-level providers to improve access to CHIP coverage for children. Children with group health plans or employer-sponsored insurance are not eligible for full CHIP coverage, but Medicaid beneficiaries with private coverage may still qualify. States implementing CHIP Medicaid expansions must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules. For separate CHIP programs, maximum cost-sharing amounts vary by family income, with a cap of 5% of family income per year. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children meeting CHIP criteria but enrolled in group or employer coverage. This provision allows states to provide dental benefits or cost-sharing protections. States may set the upper income level for new dental benchmark benefits plans under CHIP. They are not allowed to offer dental-only supplemental coverage unless certain conditions are met. States cannot provide more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage than for CHIP children eligible for the full range of benefits. States have the option to not impose an eligibility waiting period for children receiving dental-only supplemental coverage under CHIP. Group health plans are prohibited from imposing more restrictive limits or cost-sharing on mental health and substance abuse benefits compared to medical and surgical coverage. Medicaid provides comprehensive screening services for individuals under 21, including dental, vision, and hearing services. EPSDT under CHIPRA guarantees access to a wide range of services, including dental, vision, and hearing, with no more restrictive financial requirements for mental health or substance use disorder benefits compared to medical and surgical coverage. State CHIP plans must adhere to mental health parity requirements, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Coverage of EPSDT services satisfies this requirement. Payments to FQHCs and RHCs are based on a prospective payment system, with per visit payments adjusted annually. Payment for FQHCs and RHCs is determined by the Medicare Economic Index increase for primary care services, with adjustments for service changes. States must provide supplemental payments in managed care contracts. CHIPRA mandates reimbursement based on the Medicaid prospective payment system. $5 million is allocated for states transitioning to this system. The Secretary must report to Congress by October 1, 2011 on the effects. The Secretary is required to report to Congress by October 1, 2011 on the effects of the new prospective payment system on CHIP. No grace period is specified for payment of CHIP premiums, and states must have disenrollment protections in place for non-payment. These protections include giving notice and opportunity to pay past due premiums, allowing for income decline consideration, and providing an impartial review process for disenrollment. CHIPRA requires states to provide CHIP enrollees with a 30-day grace period to make premium payments before coverage may be terminated. Enrollees have the right to challenge termination and continue to be enrolled during the review process. The act lists coverable benefits like clinic services and ambulatory health care. CHIPRA allows states to provide CHIP through school-based health centers, defining them as clinics near schools that offer primary health services to children. CHIPRA establishes the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review program policies affecting children's access to benefits under Medicaid and CHIP. MACPAC will make recommendations to Congress on payment policies, healthcare delivery, transportation, and language barriers. Beginning in 2010, MACPAC will submit annual reports to Congress on access policies for Medicaid and CHIP, including recommendations and examinations of issues affecting healthcare delivery. MACPAC will also create an early warning system to identify provider shortage areas and review reports from the Secretary of HHS related to access policies. MACPAC will submit reports to Congress on access policies for Medicaid and CHIP, including recommendations and examinations of healthcare delivery issues. MACPAC will consult with congressional committees, conduct additional reviews as requested, and make reports available to the public. MACPAC, composed of 17 members appointed by the Comptroller General, must vote on recommendations and include results in reports. Before making recommendations, budget consequences must be examined. Provisions in P.L. 111-3 define qualifications, tenure, compensation, leadership roles, and meeting procedures. The commission can establish a professional staff and obtain necessary data from government agencies. MACPAC must have access to government data for its mission, use existing information or conduct research when needed, and allow outside submissions. The Comptroller General has unrestricted access to MACPAC's work and can conduct audits. MACPAC must request appropriations separately from the Comptroller General. Additional funding may be appropriated as needed for MACPAC's operations. The provision authorizes necessary appropriations for the commission's operations. The Comptroller General must appoint initial members by January 1, 2010. The Secretary of HHS, in consultation with other agencies, must submit annual reports on Medicaid's financial status. Federal agencies must review programs for erroneous payments and report estimates to Congress. CMS issued a final rule for PERM for Medicaid and CHIP on August 21, 2007. CMS issued a final rule for PERM for Medicaid and CHIP on August 21, 2007, which included changes to the interim final rule. Assessments of payment error rates for fee-for-service and managed care services, as well as eligibility determinations, are conducted. The new law requires clearly defined criteria for errors, an appeal process for error determinations, and deadlines for states to implement corrective action plans. The new law requires the Secretary to review and coordinate MEQC and PERM requirements, establish state-specific sample sizes for PERM in CHIP, minimize administrative costs, maintain state flexibility, and apply a 90% federal matching rate for PERM requirements in CHIP administration. The final rule must be promulgated within six months of CHIPRA enactment. The provision in CHIPRA excludes PERM requirements from the 10% cap on administrative expenses for CHIP. Prior law required adjustments to the CPS to gather data on uninsured low-income children. $20 million is provided annually for this purpose starting in FY2009. CHIPRA provides $20 million annually starting in FY2009 for data collection purposes related to CHIP. The Secretary of Commerce is required to make adjustments to the CPS to improve state-specific estimates of children enrolled in CHIP or Medicaid, assess the reliability of ACS estimates for the child population growth factor, and include health insurance survey information for children. The Commerce Secretary will assess the new CHIP financing structure and recommend whether ACS estimates should be used instead of CPS estimates. The HHS Secretary must conduct an independent evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans and submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2001. $10 million was allocated for this purpose in FY2000. The evaluation will focus on states with diverse CHIP coverage approaches, representing various geographic areas and a significant portion of uninsured children. The evaluation under CHIPRA includes surveys of target populations, assessment of outreach strategies, coordination between Medicaid and CHIP, effects of cost-sharing, and retention issues. $10 million was allocated for an independent evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans, to be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2011. The evaluation under CHIPRA includes surveys of target populations, assessment of outreach strategies, coordination between Medicaid and CHIP, effects of cost-sharing, and retention issues. Every third fiscal year, the Secretary must audit states with approved CHIP plans that do not provide health benefits coverage under Medicaid. The Comptroller General must monitor these audits and submit a report to Congress. Access to books, accounts, and records is granted for evaluation and auditing purposes under CHIPRA. Under CHIPRA, the Inspector General and Comptroller General have access to documents related to federal CHIP funds. The law prohibits federal funding for non-lawfully residing individuals and allows for disallowance of erroneous expenditures. EPSDT benefit guarantees comprehensive screening services for individuals under 21, including dental, vision, and hearing services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed states to offer Medicaid through benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage, with exemptions for certain groups like children in foster care. Wrap-around benefits for children under age 19 include EPSDT. The provision in CHIPRA specifies sections of prior Medicaid law to be disregarded for benchmark benefit coverage, ensures EPSDT entitlement remains intact, corrects references for children in foster care, and requires HHS to publish provisions not applicable for benchmark coverage approval. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allowed the Secretary of HHS to establish Health Opportunity Accounts within Medicaid for specified health care expenses. CHIPRA repealed a provision directing the use of \"SCHIP\" and \"State children's health insurance program\" instead of \"CHIP\" and \"children's health insurance program.\" CHIPRA also prohibits the approval of new Health Opportunity Account demonstrations as of February 4, 2009. The federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) is calculated based on a formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average. State and U.S. per capita income amounts used in the formula are based on the average of the three most recent calendar years of data from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). BEA revises its estimates of state per capita personal income annually and undertakes comprehensive data revisions every few years. The BEA periodically revises personal income components, including employer contributions for pensions and insurance funds. A provision in CHIPRA adjusts Medicaid FMAP calculations to exclude extraordinary employer pension contributions. State per capita income for Medicaid FMAP computation will disregard significantly disproportionate employer pension or insurance fund contributions starting from FY2006. The provision in CHIPRA adjusts Medicaid FMAP calculations to exclude employer contributions for pensions and insurance funds that exceed 25% of the total increase in personal income in a state for a calendar year. If a state's total personal income growth is negative, the employer contribution for FMAP calculation purposes cannot exceed 125% of the previous year's contribution. The Secretary must report to Congress on issues with pension and insurance fund contributions in FMAP calculations for Medicaid. States and federal government share Medicaid costs, with hospitals sometimes funding the state share to ensure federal matching funds. Intergovernmental transfers by healthcare providers for Medicaid expenditures are allowed under certain circumstances outlined in federal regulations. CMS has denied federal matching payments when the state share was comprised of payments transferred from out-of-state hospitals. However, a provision in CHIPRA allows federal matching payments when the state share is transferred from a publicly owned regional medical center in another state, meeting specific criteria. This regional center must provide trauma and burn care, neonatal services, serve all patients regardless of ability to pay, be located in an SMSA with at least 3 states, and act as a tertiary care provider. State Medicaid programs must recognize hospitals that provide a disproportionate share of care to low-income patients with special needs, known as \"disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.\" Tennessee and Hawaii have zero allotments due to operating under a Section 1115 waiver. This waiver allows states to waive certain Medicaid provisions, such as the requirement for DSH payments, for research and demonstration purposes. Congress has enacted special DSH provisions for Tennessee and Hawaii, with Tennessee's allotments set at $30 million for FY2007 through FY2009, and Hawaii's at $10 million for the same period. Both states have been allowed to submit state plan amendments for the Secretary's approval. A provision in CHIPRA extends the special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii through a portion of FY2012. Tennessee would receive $30 million for each full fiscal year in 2010 and 2011. The CHIPRA extends special DSH allotment arrangements for Hawaii and Tennessee through FY2012. Hawaii's $10 million allotment is extended for FY2010 and FY2011, with $2.5 million available for the first quarter of FY2012. A report analyzing state payment rates for Medicaid managed care organizations is required by GAO. CHIPRA establishes a task force for education and outreach to small businesses about coverage options for children through private insurance, Medicaid, and CHIP. The campaign aims to educate small businesses about affordable insurance options for children through private insurance, Medicaid, and CHIP. It includes information on tax deductions, employer-sponsored plans, and assistance available through public programs. The task force established will collaborate with SBA partners, chambers of commerce, and health advocacy groups to promote outreach programs. The SBA website will prominently display links to state eligibility requirements for Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA establishes eligibility and enrollment requirements for Medicaid and CHIP, with a report to Congress every two years. The Senate recognizes the need to improve affordability and access to health insurance for all Americans, citing the high number of uninsured individuals and rising health insurance costs. The Senate aims to improve health insurance affordability and access for all Americans by enacting legislation that enhances coverage for small businesses and individuals. This includes pooling mechanisms across state lines and providing financial assistance for private insurance purchases, funded by increased tobacco excise taxes. The federal taxes on tobacco products have specific rates: $0.39 per pack for cigarettes, $.04 per package of 20 for small cigars, 20.719% of sales price for large cigars (up to $48.75 per 1,000 units), $.01 per ounce for chewing tobacco, $.04 per ounce for snuff, and $.07 per ounce for pipe and roll-your-own tobacco. CHIPRA increased taxes on cigarettes and tobacco products, with federal cigarette taxes raised to $1.0066 per pack and small cigars taxed at the same level as cigarettes. The taxes on tobacco products under CHIPRA would increase significantly: large cigars to 52.75% of sales price with a maximum of $0.4026 per cigar, chewing tobacco to approximately $.03 per ounce, snuff to $.09 per ounce, pipe tobacco to $.18 per ounce, roll-your-own tobacco to $1.55 per ounce, cigarette papers to $3.15, and cigarette tubes to $6.30. CHIPRA also includes provisions for floor stock taxes applicable to items sold after April 1, 2009, with a $500 credit per person for liability. The floor stock tax under CHIPRA applies to tobacco products in a foreign trade zone to prevent stockpiling before April 1, 2009. CHIPRA imposes regulatory requirements on manufacturers of processed tobacco and expands penalties for not paying tobacco-related taxes. Quarterly estimated corporate tax payments in July, August, and September 2013 are 120% of the normal required payment. During the 110th Congress, CHIP bills saw legislative action, with provisions adding appropriations to CHIP but no major substantive changes. Certain states' shortfalls in FY2007 federal CHIP funding were addressed, and temporary FY2008 appropriations were provided through continuing resolutions. During the 110th Congress, CHIP bills received legislative attention, with temporary appropriations extended through December 31, 2007, and additional funding through March 31, 2009. Reauthorization legislation was considered, but two bills (H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963) were vetoed by President Bush. The bills aimed to increase national allotment appropriations to $61.4 billion over five years, with changes to Medicaid and CHIP. The 110th Congress considered CHIP reauthorization bills with temporary appropriations extended. The proposed legislation included increased national allotment appropriations, a new formula for distributing funds to states, a contingency fund for shortfalls, performance bonus payments, grants for outreach and enrollment, and provisions to remove barriers to enrollment and enhance benefits. The 110th Congress considered CHIP reauthorization bills with provisions for increased national allotment appropriations, new fund distribution formula, contingency fund, performance bonuses, outreach grants, and enrollment enhancements. H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963 aimed to improve children's healthcare by providing premium assistance, strengthening quality of care, and increasing federal tobacco tax to offset costs. Congressional Budget Office estimates showed an increase in outlays by $34.9 billion over 5 years and $71.5 billion over 10 years for H.R. 976, and $35.4 billion over 5 years and $71.5 billion over 10 years for H.R. 3963. Joint Committee on Taxation estimated an increase in on-budget revenue by $35.5 billion over 5 years and $71.7 billion over 10 years. The vetoed CHIPRA bills would have increased Medicaid and CHIP enrollment by 5.8 million over 10 years, with 80% of the increase among current eligibility groups. Total projected enrollees would reach 34.1 million according to the Congressional Budget Office."
