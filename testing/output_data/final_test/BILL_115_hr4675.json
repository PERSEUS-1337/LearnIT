    "content": "The \"Low-Dose Radiation Research Act of 2018\" is a new program established under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 for low-dose radiation research. The Secretary is mandated to conduct a basic research program on low-dose radiation to enhance scientific understanding, reduce uncertainties, and improve risk assessment and management methods. This includes formulating scientific goals, identifying challenges, and developing a strategic research agenda in coordination with other efforts. The Secretary is required to conduct a basic research program on low-dose radiation to enhance scientific understanding, reduce uncertainties, and improve risk assessment and management methods. This includes identifying potential benefits, leveraging existing knowledge, and engaging with other Federal agencies and research communities. Coordination with the Physical Science Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council is also mandated. The Science and Technology Council supports directives under the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, ensures consultation between the Department of Energy's Office of Science and other agencies, advises on radiation biology policies, and identifies international opportunities. The Secretary is required to develop a 4-year research plan on low-dose radiation, incorporating international cooperation and research from sources outside the US. Low-dose radiation is defined as a dose of less than 100 millisieverts. This plan must prioritize basic research needs and be submitted to specific committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary is authorized to allocate funds from the Biological and Environmental Research Program for research purposes, with specific amounts allocated for fiscal years 2018 to 2021. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Act authorizes a low-dose radiation research program. No additional funds are authorized for this Act, and existing funds will be used."
