    "content": "Senate Amendment 5662, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2008, includes nearly 150 public lands and natural resources bills. It is a combination of two packages of bills, with the majority of the language coming from S. 3213 and the rest from 53 bills approved by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The report aims to provide an overview of policy issues and controversies associated with each title and highlight specific provisions that have sparked controversy among stakeholders. The document provides an overview of Senate Amendment 5662, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2008, which includes various public lands and natural resources bills. The majority of the provisions focus on wilderness areas and federal land management agencies. Stakeholders have differing views on the federal government's role in land management, particularly regarding energy development and land use designations. Some stakeholders praise protection of natural resources and funding for programs in Senate Amendment 5662. Others express concerns about limitations on energy development on federal lands. Ideological controversies surround land use priorities and commercial activities. The report discusses ideological controversies surrounding commercial activities in relation to Senate Amendment 5662. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on energy exploration and production, particularly in relation to Title I provisions. The amendment includes assurances to protect private property rights near federal lands affected by the amendment. The report addresses concerns about the impact on energy exploration and production related to Senate Amendment 5662. Some private landowners may still have reservations about federal funding authorization, citing concerns about the value of the program. The funding associated with S.Amdt. 5662 is for appropriations, not direct Treasury outlays, following a two-step appropriations process. The enactment of appropriations provides funds for authorized agencies or programs, with funding figures in amendments indicating recommendations. Direct spending occurs when appropriations are made outside of the appropriations act. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes pending legislation for direct spending provisions. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is defined as entitlement or budget authority provided by law. Direct spending, also known as mandatory spending, is defined as entitlement or budget authority provided by law other than appropriation acts. It allows Congress to control spending indirectly by defining eligibility and setting benefit rules. Another issue is the appropriateness of divesting federal ownership in federal lands, with many provisions surrendering federal ownership to states, local interests, or private entities. Federal policy has generally been against divestiture, with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 formally ending previous practices. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) ended the previous disposal policy, stating that public lands should generally be retained in federal ownership unless determined otherwise through land use planning. The Act includes 12 titles addressing policy issues and controversial provisions identified by stakeholders. The 1964 Wilderness Act established the National Wilderness Preservation System, allowing only Congress to designate federal lands as part of the system. Congress can designate federal lands as part of the national system for protection from development. These areas provide high-quality water, habitat for rare wildlife, and recreational opportunities. Restrictions on commercial activities in wilderness areas are debated for their impact on local economies. The Wilderness Act allows for continued livestock grazing and some commercial recreational services in designated wilderness areas. The Wilderness Act allows for the designation of federal lands for protection from development, adding to the National Wilderness Preservation System. Congress has continuously expanded the System, with the latest addition in the 110th Congress adding 106,000 acres of wilderness in Washington. Currently, the System includes 107.55 million acres in 44 states, with the latest proposal adding 1,775,275 acres in 8 states through 35 new areas and additions to existing wilderness areas. Title II of S.Amdt. 5662 proposes adding 66,280 acres in a new wilderness area in Colorado, along with designating lands for other purposes and directing land exchanges. The provisions related to the Bureau of Land Management include establishing the National Landscape Conservation System. While there is some opposition to these provisions, they have not generated substantial controversy. The National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) was created by the BLM in 2000 to focus on specially protected conservation areas. It aims to conserve, protect, and restore nationally significant landscapes with various values. The System covers about 27 million acres of land with federally recognized units, including national monuments, conservation areas, wilderness areas, and historic trails. There are differing opinions on whether the NLCS should be established legislatively. Supporters of establishing the NLCS legislatively argue it would provide legislative support and direction to the BLM, formalize and strengthen conservation efforts, and create new national monuments, conservation areas, and wilderness areas. Opponents fear standardized requirements could limit multiple uses like oil and gas development, motorized recreation, and livestock grazing in these areas. The proposed legislation addresses federal water rights in a designated area of Colorado, stating that the federal government would acquire necessary water rights through state law. If existing water rights are insufficient, the Secretary would pursue additional rights under state law to fulfill the purposes of designation. The proposed legislation does not reserve federal water rights for the designated area in Colorado, making it difficult for the Secretary to acquire sufficient water rights. Other provisions allow for the disposal of federal lands to various entities, including land exchanges between the federal government and non-federal landowners under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) can sell or exchange public land that meets specific criteria, such as fair market value and public interest. Legislative proposals like S.Amdt. 5622 are considered by Congress for land disposals and exchanges to expedite transactions not being accomplished by BLM within desired time frames. Some support land disposals to reduce federal land ownership, advocating for conveyance to other entities. The federal government owns and manages a significant amount of land, with proposals to transfer ownership to states or private entities. Opposition to these proposals is based on concerns about the public interest and the federal government's adherence to laws, such as obtaining fair market value for land sales. Specific instances, like the Southern Nevada Limited Transition Area Conveyance, raise questions about potential misuse of land and lack of clarity on timelines for enforcement actions. The Forest Service administers federal land for multiple uses, with boundaries determined by presidential proclamations and changes requiring an act of Congress. Agency authority to dispose of lands is limited, with permanent and temporary authorities for land management. Disputes may arise over conflicting land uses or exclusions. Subtitle A of Title III makes permanent the authority to reach agreements with other entities for watershed restoration and habitat enhancement on Forest Service lands. Subtitle B requires an annual report to Congress on wildland firefighter safety. Subtitle C withdraws certain lands in the Wyoming Range from mining claims, allowing for donations of valid existing rights. Subtitle D involves land conveyances. Subtitle D of Title III involves land conveyances for public purposes and directs land exchanges. Subtitle E directs a study on maintaining open space characteristics in the Rocky Mountains. Severe wildfires on Forest Service lands have increased, with high fuel loads contributing to the threat. Restoring forests to natural conditions is seen as desirable to reduce wildfire risks. Subtitle IV of S.Amdt. 5662 establishes a collaborative program for large-scale forest landscape restoration to reduce wildfire threats and utilize biomass. It authorizes $40 million annually for 10 years, with multi-party monitoring and reporting requirements. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act established a System to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for present and future generations. River units are classified as wild, scenic, or recreational based on various factors. The act prohibits federal dams and water projects that would harm river values, protects natural and cultural values, ensures water quality, and requires a comprehensive river management plan. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act established a System to preserve designated free-flowing rivers for present and future generations. Designation and management of lands within river corridors have been controversial in some cases. Since 1968, 166 rivers with 11,434 miles in 38 states and Puerto Rico have been designated. Three rivers are designated under Subtitle A, totaling 461 miles. The proposed designation of the Snake River Headwaters in Wyoming proved to be a controversial addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Subtitle C focuses on additions to the National Trails System, which was established by the National Trails System Act in 1968 to provide recreation opportunities and preserve access to outdoor areas and historic resources. Six additional trails are designated under Subtitle C, expanding the system which now includes 26 national trails. The proposed designation under S.Amdt. 5662 for the Wild and Scenic Rivers System would not affect existing water rights or the management of Jackson Lake and Jackson Lake Dam. Subtitle C designates six additional trails to the National Trails System and directs the National Park Service to update feasibility studies for certain historic trails. Controversy surrounds land acquisition for resource protection, with proposed legislation to allow federal agencies to purchase land from willing sellers. Subtitle D proposes amending the National Trails System Act to provide authority for land acquisition for designated trails lacking such authority, without committing the federal government to purchase land or spend money. Subtitle A of the legislation covers various issues related to national trails, including watershed management and livestock predation control. Subtitles B, C, D, and F are not controversial, but Subtitle E has sparked considerable controversy. Subtitle B clarifies the employment status of federal employees in Alaska, while Subtitle C aims to preserve historic water rights at a Colorado national wildlife refuge. Legislation involving water rights on federal lands can be contentious due to potential impacts on water usage. Subtitle D increases penalties for damage to and illegal collection of paleontological resources on federal lands. Subtitle F establishes a federal matching program for non-lethal wolf control and compensation for livestock loss. Subtitle A creates a cooperative watershed grant program in the Department of the Interior, with some concerns over its funding and possible duplication of other federal programs. Subtitle A of the program for FY2008-FY2020 authorizes grants for a cooperative planning group to create a conservation plan for watersheds, with criteria for implementation grants. It may be controversial due to differing opinions on environmental planning and management. Subtitle E addresses the transfer of federal lands in Alaska in exchange for state lands and lands owned by an Alaska Native Corporation. The transfer of federal lands in Alaska for state lands and lands owned by an Alaska Native Corporation aims to build a road from King Cove to Cold Bay for medical access. Controversies include the ecological value of the lands and the necessity of the road compared to existing access options. There are concerns about potential restrictions on environmental review under NEPA in the proposed amendment. Enacting stand-alone parks and recreation bills can be challenging, especially during times of fiscal constraints and competing national priorities. While new park units may benefit local economies, some oppose the loss of taxable land from federal purchases. Concerns also arise about adding to the National Park System when existing units may already struggle with maintenance due to fiscal limitations. The National Park Service (NPS) operates with insufficient funding, facing a shortfall of approximately $600 million annually. Title VII of S.Amdt. 5662 includes provisions for new national park units, changes to existing units, and studies for potential additions to the System. It also reauthorizes programs like the American Battlefield Protection Program and the NPS Advisory Board. The Save America's Treasures Program has faced criticism for lack of geographic diversity. Legislation enacted in FY2001 required project recommendations to be approved by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations before funds are distributed. Projects under this program require a 50% cost share and no single project can receive more than one grant. Section 7303 maintains notification requirements for Committees prior to grant disbursement. S.Amdt. 5662 would authorize the program at $50 million annually, with funds available until expended. The Preserve America Program, established to complement Save America's Treasures grants, also requires a 50% match from nonfederal funds for grants provided for research, documentation, interpretation, planning, marketing, and training. The National Heritage Areas program supports community preservation of cultural, historic, and natural heritage through education and heritage tourism. There are 40 NHAs established by Congress to conserve important resources in partnership with the NPS, states, and local communities. NHAs are not part of the National Park System and lands within heritage areas typically remain in state, local, or private ownership. The National Heritage Areas program supports community preservation of cultural, historic, and natural heritage through education and heritage tourism. NHAs are established by Congress to conserve important resources in partnership with the NPS, states, and local communities. NHAs are not part of the National Park System and lands within heritage areas typically remain in state, local, or private ownership. There is no comprehensive statute that establishes criteria for designating NHAs or provides standards for their funding and management. NHAs might receive funding from various sources, including through the NPS. Title VIII of S.Amdt. 5662 seeks to establish ten new NHAs, study two areas for possible heritage designation, and amend four existing heritage areas in 8 states. The amendment contains provisions to address concerns about potential loss of, and restrictions on use of, private property as a result of NHA designation. The amendment requires the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate new National Heritage Areas within three years of federal funding termination. Supporters believe NHAs are important for protecting lands, traditions, promoting cooperation, and fostering community revitalization and economic development. Some proponents view National Heritage Areas (NHAs) as more desirable than federal areas like the National Park System due to lower costs and local administration. NHAs are seen as flexible and able to attract funding from various sources. However, opponents argue that NHAs pose challenges, including potential federal control over nonfederal lands and lack of local support in some areas. Property rights advocates are leading the opposition to NHAs. The lack of a general statute for heritage area management has led to concerns about inconsistent processes and fragmented funding. The Bush Administration opposes designating new areas until systemic legislation is in place, fearing increased administrative and financial burdens for the NPS. Some caution against creating NHAs due to challenges in providing necessary infrastructure for tourism. The Reclamation Act of 1902 authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to construct dams, canals, and power facilities in the West to provide water for irrigation. Recent projects focus on M&I water supply, Indian water rights, water reuse, and ecosystem restoration. Feasibility studies require congressional authorization since the mid-1960s. Subtitle A and C of Title IX authorize feasibility studies for water projects in AZ, CO, and ID, with a total estimated cost of $7.3 million. Subtitle A includes a study for a water tie-in system for four local reservoirs in California. Subtitle C authorizes title transfers for two Reclamation projects and clears title for lands related to a third project. Subtitle B provisions authorize Reclamation to participate in 14 water projects in four western states, as well as an endangered fish recovery program. The major exception is the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water System, estimated to cost $384 million over five years. The Bush Administration could not support due to its high cost. Subtitle D of the legislation requires a 35% nonfederal matching requirement for federal funds for water quality projects in the San Gabriel Basin and Central Basin Municipal Water District. The authorization for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund has been increased to $146.2 million, with a 35% nonfederal matching requirement. The Central Basin Water Quality Project is limited in total appropriations. The Executive Branch has not budgeted for the San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund in the past and does not support an increased cost ceiling. Reclamation Commissioner Robert Johnson believes resources should be allocated to other priorities and Reclamation's role should be limited to assisting concerned parties in groundwater cleanup. Subtitle E discusses the Lower Colorado Multi-Species Conservation Program, aiming to conserve 26 species along the Lower Colorado River while maintaining water and power supplies. The Lower Colorado Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP) aims to conserve 26 species along the Lower Colorado River while maintaining water and power supplies. The program has a 50-year term with an estimated total cost of $626 million, split 50-50 between federal and nonfederal entities. S.Amdt. 5662 would authorize appropriations for the federal share of costs and waive sovereign immunity for non-federal parties to enforce program documents, a controversial issue since the program's inception. Subtitle F of Title IX authorizes appropriations for the federal share of costs and waives sovereign immunity for non-federal parties to enforce program documents under the Lower Colorado Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP). This legislation is seen as crucial for ensuring water supplies and compliance with the Endangered Species Act, although some argue it may be unnecessary due to existing federal participation in the project. Nonfederal parties would be able to sue to enforce the agreement but not for monetary damages. Subtitle F of Title IX covers the impact of climate change on hydropower, endangered species, and stream flow data collection. However, it lacks an overall strategy for addressing climate change's effects on water availability and agency responses. The omission of water quality and EPA activities limits the bill's application to water issues, potentially leading to duplicative or non-complementary actions. Programmatic provisions altering agency authority, like \u00a7 9503(d), can be contentious, especially regarding climate change mitigation strategies. Subtitle G addresses the programmatic feasibility authority for climate change mitigation strategies, including the study of new water infrastructure. This authority may be controversial due to conflicts over water storage and transport systems, stakeholder interests, and a reversal of a congressional decision from 1965. It also requires annual inspections of Reclamation-owned facilities and the development of a national priorities list for infrastructure maintenance. Subtitle G focuses on developing a national priorities list for infrastructure maintenance needs and establishing standards for asset management. The approach outlined in this subtitle, along with cost-sharing requirements, repayment terms, and other provisions, highlights the need for a more transparent and standardized approach to addressing Reclamation's infrastructure needs. Some provisions, such as \u00a7 9106(d), may not require contributions from project beneficiaries or the state, indicating a potential lack of consistency in cost-sharing requirements. Subtitle A, regarding the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement, authorizes implementing a settlement in a long-standing dispute over water management in the San Joaquin River Basin in California. The legislation is controversial for its direct spending provisions, potential impacts on downstream interests, loss of agricultural water, and effects on Delta and ocean fisheries. S.Amdt. 5662 reduces conflicts that may arise due to aging infrastructure and costly recapitalization projects. Subtitle A authorizes the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement, which aims to resolve water management disputes in California. S.Amdt. 5662 reduces direct spending and addresses concerns about impacts on downstream interests, agriculture, and fisheries. Settlement opponents fear inadequate funding for project implementation, while proponents argue for securing additional funds to avoid delays and potential legal challenges. Total restoration costs are estimated between $250 million to $1.1 billion. Subtitle B involves rural water projects with the Navajo Nation in New Mexico. The federal government has a trust responsibility to protect Indian water rights, with settlements requiring federal approval and funding. Congress has enacted 20 Indian water rights settlements in the past three decades, but funding remains a recurring issue. Administrations have opposed settlements due to cost concerns, while tribes argue that funding is insufficient, especially for water infrastructure. Discretionary appropriations add uncertainties to the funding process. The proposal suggests a dedicated funding source for Indian water rights settlements to address uncertainties caused by discretionary appropriations. It aims to use the Reclamation Fund to finance water infrastructure costs in specific settlements, setting aside $120 million annually for a new \"Reclamation Water Settlements Fund\" without further appropriation. This fund would support Reclamation activities for approved Indian water rights settlements in a prioritized order, including the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. The Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project is a priority for Indian water rights settlements, with funding from the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund. The Bush Administration opposed this provision due to concerns about excluding expenditures from the appropriations process. Additionally, the settlement between the Navajo Nation and New Mexico was approved, but faced opposition from the Bush Administration for various reasons. The settlement for the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project faced opposition from the Bush Administration due to concerns about costs and legal liabilities. The reauthorization of the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 and the New Mexico Water Resources Study are also discussed in the legislation. The USGS, in coordination with the State of New Mexico, is conducting a study on groundwater resources in several basins. The study will analyze salinity, recharge potential, groundwater-surface water interaction, aquifer contamination susceptibility, and water availability for human use. Concerns include cost and duplication of federal efforts, particularly in the middle Rio Grande Basin. The title contains provisions on North Dakota trust funds management, amendments to the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000. The curr_chunk discusses various legislative amendments and authorizations, including funding for projects, personnel matters, land conveyance, and trust fund management. The controversy surrounding altering trust fund provisions established by enabling acts is highlighted, as states are limited in how they can manage these funds. Any modifications require action by both the state and federal government. The curr_chunk discusses Section 12001, Management and Distribution of North Dakota Trust Funds, which would provide the state with more flexibility in managing its trust funds. While other provisions in the legislation may have supporters and opponents, this particular section addresses the necessary federal and state changes for altering trust funds."
