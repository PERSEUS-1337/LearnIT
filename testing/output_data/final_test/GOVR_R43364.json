    "content": "The consumer retail payments system allows for transactions to purchase goods and services, pay bills, obtain cash, and make person-to-person payments using cash, checks, credit cards, and debit cards. Debit cards provide electronic access to checking account services and are primarily offered by depository institutions. According to the Federal Reserve Payments Study, electronic payments in the United States have seen continued growth, with debit cards and ACH payments being popular options. Checking account holders prefer electronic payment methods over writing checks, with debit cards and ACH payments accounting for a significant portion of noncash transactions. In 2012, debit cards were used in 38% of noncash payment transactions. Since 2009, consumers have seen a shift towards electronic payments like debit cards and ACH, with a decline in paper check usage. Retail services from regulated depository institutions offer benefits like consumer protection laws. However, some consumers have faced higher charges or limited availability of these services post-recession. After the 2007-2009 recession, the demand for consumer loans declined, leading to historically low U.S. interest rates. This resulted in decreased lending volumes and squeezed profit margins for depository institutions, prompting them to increase fees on products and services. Capital requirements for non-performing loans also rose, making traditional retail services more expensive. To offset these challenges, depository institutions began seeking profits from new business lines instead of waiting for traditional profitability to return. Congress passed legislation in 2009 and 2010 that placed limitations on fee pricing practices for credit and debit cards, impacting the profitability of depository institutions. Disclosure requirements for remittances may result in increased costs for smaller institutions, affecting the provision of retail payment services. Congressional interest lies in how recent legislative actions have changed the costs and availability of consumer retail payment services. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 and the Durbin Amendment in the Dodd-Frank Act may have influenced changes in the consumer retail payment services market. Evidence suggests segmentation in the market, with some customers experiencing little change in cost or availability of traditional retail payment services. Some customers may face increased fees and limited access to traditional retail payment services, while others are offered alternative payment options with lower risks. The CARD Act was passed in response to concerns about hidden fees on credit cards, with full implementation by August 2010. The CARD Act, implemented between 2009 and August 2010, aimed to address hidden fees on credit cards. It eliminated risky billing practices like double-cycle billing and limited rate increases without notice to customers. While it made risk-based pricing through fees more challenging, there were no caps placed on credit card interest rates. Card issuers can manage default risk by reducing credit limits and increasing rates for all borrowers, including those with delinquency. They may also target higher-risk borrowers by further increasing rates and reducing limits, or limiting product availability. Subprime credit card lending still exists, but data on \"fee harvester\" cards is scarce. Secured credit cards are an alternative for risky borrowers, requiring collateral or links to checking/savings accounts. Secured credit cards require collateral or links to checking/savings accounts, serving as a way for risky borrowers to build or repair creditworthiness. Payment activity is reported to credit bureaus, and the security deposit is refunded if payments are made on time. Availability of secured credit card lending has increased due to regulations on subprime credit card lending, but official data sources distinguishing between unsecured and secured credit card lending are scarce. The availability and usage of revolving credit for consumers have declined, with varying estimates depending on the time interval chosen. Household credit limits decreased by 28.2% between 2008 and 2010, and by 11.0% between 2006 and 2012. Credit card debt outstanding also decreased, by 16.4% between 2008 and 2010, and by 8.6% between 2006 and 2012. The decline in credit card usage was more pronounced in the period immediately before and after the CARD Act in 2008, compared to the period following the 2007-2009 recession. In 2010, credit costs increased for accounts with carrying balances, but declined over the longer 2006-2012 period. Credit terms spiked for borrowers with impaired credit after rising defaults during the 2007-2009 recession, reflecting a split in the credit card market. Lenders reacted to the recession and the CARD Act, leading to conflicting reports on credit card market activity. The CARD Act reduced borrowing costs for consumers without increasing interest charges or reducing credit access from 2008 to 2011, according to an academic study. However, industry reports suggest new and impaired credit card users faced higher costs and less availability of credit. Small and regional banks have shown renewed interest in credit card lending due to low interest rates and decreased demand for consumer loans. The decline in outstanding consumer credit post-recession has led to lower credit card usage, possibly due to decreased demand and stricter lending standards. The impact of the 2007-2009 recession and the CARD Act on the credit card market is complex, with a decrease in revolving credit demand and an increase in credit card defaults. Without the CARD Act, outstanding credit balances and credit costs for most borrowers would likely have decreased. The cost of credit for most borrowers is expected to decline due to reduced demand for revolving credit in a severe recession. Without the CARD Act, credit card defaults would increase, leading to lower credit card limits and higher rates for riskier borrowers. Checking accounts are used for deposits and payments, with depository institutions incurring costs to provide services. Interest is paid to depositors for using their funds to originate new loans. Recent developments in the cost and availability of checking account services are examined in this section, as overdraft and debit card fees are tied to this financial product. The CARD Act regulated overdraft fees, requiring customer permission before enrolling in overdraft protection programs that charge fees for covering shortages. The Dodd-Frank Act required depository institutions to obtain customer permission for automatic enrollment in overdraft protection programs. The Durbin Amendment mandated that interchange fees for debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to costs incurred by banks. The Federal Reserve considers authorization, clearance, and settlement costs when setting interchange fees for debit card transactions under the Durbin Amendment. The legislation does not regulate interchange fees for reloadable prepayment cards or government-administered debit cards. Free or low-cost checking at depository institutions has decreased, especially at large institutions, due to new fee strategies implemented since 2007. Since 2007, financial institutions have had to adapt their fee strategies due to declining fee income from mortgage securitization and decreased customer demand for traditional banking services. New regulations on credit card fees and overdraft fees further limited fee generating activities. As a result, institutions are exploring new fee pricing strategies, potentially shifting more costs onto customers. Many financial institutions are considering new fee pricing strategies for checking account services, aiming to shift more costs onto customers. Depositors may need to maintain larger balances or use multiple financial services to avoid increased fees. Small banks are less aggressive than large banks in raising checking account fees, but both are exploring ways to replace lost revenue without alienating profitable customers. Many financial institutions are adjusting checking account fees to offset losses without alienating profitable customers. Overdraft protection services are becoming less available as they are costly to maintain, leading to reduced overdraft limits. The economic downturn has forced banks to treat unpaid overdrafts as charge-offs, impacting profits amid low interest rates and fee restrictions. Involuntary checking account closures have increased as institutions set aside more income to cover losses. Involuntary checking account closures have allegedly increased, leading to more reporting of overdraft and insufficient funds activity to banking history bureaus. This may hinder low-income individuals from accessing traditional checking account services for years. Banks affected by the Durbin Amendment have eliminated debit card rewards programs, impacting their ability to attract deposits for loans. Offering checking accounts with direct deposit, bill paying, and debit card services helps banks attract customers who are likely to use other financial products. The ability of depository institutions to cross-subsidize costs and financial risks is enhanced by offering a variety of financial products and services. Partnerships with merchants for customer reward programs incentivize shopping with electronic payment cards associated with specific banks. Capital buffers for non-performing loans increased due to enhanced capital requirements, leading to less tolerance for less profitable customers. Depository institutions may separate customers into two categories based on fee income generation. Depository institutions can serve unbanked populations by offering a different set of financial services, including those who generate fee income using various financial products. Unlike traditional relationship banking, depository institutions provide a limited range of retail services with less information about customers' financial management. Financial products popular among those unable to qualify for traditional banking are being offered, especially to those who have defaulted on loans. Alternative financial services for unbanked populations include upfront fees, expensive short-term cash advances, lack of credit bureau reporting, and no need for a traditional banking relationship. These services are evolving, with products like subprime credit cards and direct deposit cash advances serving as substitutes for payday loans. Direct deposit cash advances are a substitute for fee harvester credit cards and overdraft coverage products. Customers must be employed and set up direct deposit with their checking accounts. The fees charged for this product are not considered overdraft fees and are not associated with a credit card. Regulations for credit cards and checking accounts do not directly apply to direct deposit cash advances. This product allows institutions to serve the 'overdraft' market segment and generate new revenue streams. Payment is due in approximately 30 days, unlike credit card loans. The APR for direct deposit cash advances is likely to be significantly lower. The APR for direct deposit cash advances is higher than for long-term loans. Customer payment histories are not reported to credit bureaus, making it an option for those unable to qualify for traditional credit cards. Data on payday lending by financial institutions is limited, with federal regulators closely monitoring the activity. The CFPB conducted a study on depository institutions offering direct deposit account advances with a $500 loan limit. The OCC and FDIC issued final guidance on payday lending by banking institutions, expressing concerns about high costs and credit risks for consumers. Offering deposit advances allows banks to serve this market segment without increasing ALLL, but regulators worry about default risks. Banks are reminded of potential risks and compliance violations. The OCC and FDIC issued guidance on payday lending, expressing concerns about risks and compliance violations. The guidance recommended policies for loan classification, underwriting, and customer credit histories. Banks may choose to discontinue offering deposit advances due to these guidelines. Usage of non-cash prepayment cards as an alternative to traditional checking accounts has increased since 2009. Prepayment cards can be closed-loop or open-loop, allowing customers to use them with specific merchants or anywhere that accepts Visa or MasterCard. They can be obtained online or in retail stores, with the option to load cash onto the cards. Some cards can have account and routing numbers for direct deposit. However, they are not perfect substitutes for checking accounts due to limited functionality and charges for reloading. Prepayment cards have limited functionality and charges for reloading. They are not attached to checking accounts, cannot be used for credit repair, and lack federal insurance on deposits. Financial institutions cannot access funds on prepayment cards for loans. Prepayment cards do not have historical usage records reported to credit bureaus and do not require a long-term relationship with a financial institution. They are used by individuals who cannot or do not want to establish a relationship with mainstream banks. According to a study, 68.8% of U.S. households were fully banked in 2011. In 2011, 68.8% of U.S. households were fully banked, meaning they had a bank account and did not use alternative financial services. However, many still need electronic payment cards for transactions. Some banks are aggressively entering this market to serve customers ineligible for traditional banking products and offset fee limitations. Federal regulators have noted the rapid growth of banks in the prepayment card industry, with the OCC issuing guidance on risk management for national banks on June 28, 2011. On June 28, 2011, the OCC issued guidance on risk management for national banks, emphasizing monitoring risks like electronic funds transfer and fraud. The CFPB noted the rapid growth of prepayment cards in the U.S., intending to extend consumer protections for electronic funds transfer activities to prepayment cards."
