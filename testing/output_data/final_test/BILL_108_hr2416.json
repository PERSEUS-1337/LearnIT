    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\". The Congress finds that paleontological resources on Federal lands are nonrenewable and offer significant educational opportunities. There is a need for a unified national policy to manage these resources, improve scientific understanding, promote responsible stewardship, and facilitate responsible collecting activities on Federal lands. Access to paleontological resources on Federal lands should be provided in accordance with existing laws. Paleontological resources on Federal lands should be provided for scientific, educational, and recreational purposes. The purpose of this Act is to establish a national policy for preserving and managing paleontological resources on Federal lands. The Act defines terms like \"casual collecting\" as collecting common paleontological resources with minimal disturbance, and \"Secretary\" as the head of Interior or Agriculture for Federal lands. The term \"paleontological resource\" refers to fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding certain types of fossils. The term \"paleontological resource\" refers to fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources or cultural items. Common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources are fossils that are not significant, while significant fossils meet scientific criteria determined by the Secretary. The term \"qualified applicant\" refers to someone with a graduate degree in paleontology or equivalent experience as determined by the Secretary for the promulgation of rules under this Act. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT. The Secretary manages and protects paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific principles and expertise, developing plans for inventory, monitoring, and use of resources. Emphasis is on interagency coordination and collaboration with non-Federal partners, the scientific community, and the public. Coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture is encouraged. \n\nSEC. 6. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAM. The Secretary establishes a program to increase public awareness about the significance of paleontological resources.\n\nSEC. 7. COLLECTION OF PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES. (a) Permit Requirement. A permit is required to collect paleontological resources from Federal lands, except for casual collecting on certain lands without a permit. Previous permits issued before the enactment of this Act are not affected. (b) Criteria for Issuance of a Permit. The Secretary may issue a permit for collection if certain criteria are met. A permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands is issued by the Secretary if the activity is carried out by a qualified applicant, for the purpose of furthering knowledge or education, consistent with management plans, and without threatening natural or cultural resources. The permit specifies that collected resources remain the property of the United States. The permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands ensures that the resources remain the property of the United States, are preserved for public access and research, and prohibits the release of specific locality data without permission. The Secretary has the authority to modify, suspend, or revoke permits for various reasons, including violations of terms or conditions. The permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands can be revoked if a person working under the permit is convicted under section 9 or assessed a civil penalty under section 10. SEC. 8. CURATION OF RESOURCES: Paleontological resources collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation.\n\nSEC. 9. PROHIBITED ACTS; PENALTIES: Details the prohibited acts and penalties related to paleontological resources. (a) Prohibits excavation, removal, damage, or alteration of paleontological resources on Federal lands without following the Act's guidelines. \n(b) Restricts the exchange, transport, export, receipt, sale, or purchase of such resources if obtained unlawfully from Federal lands. The Act prohibits the excavation, removal, or alteration of paleontological resources on Federal lands without following guidelines. It also restricts the exchange, transport, sale, or purchase of such resources if obtained unlawfully. Violations can result in a class A misdemeanor. The Act prohibits unauthorized excavation, removal, or alteration of paleontological resources on Federal lands. Violations can lead to felony charges, with a second offense resulting in a higher felony class. There is an exception for individuals who lawfully possessed the resource before the Act's enactment. Civil penalties may be imposed for violations of regulations or permit conditions. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permit conditions under this Act, with factors considered including the value of the paleontological resource and the cost of response and restoration. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations under this Act, considering factors like the value of the resource and site, and any other relevant factors. For multiple offenses, the penalty amount may double. The maximum penalty for a violation is double the cost of response and restoration plus double the value of resources damaged. Any person can petition for judicial review of the penalty. The penalty assessed under this Act can be challenged in Federal court within 30 days. The court will review the Secretary's action based on substantial evidence. Hearings will follow the procedures outlined in title 5, United States Code. Penalties collected will be used to protect and restore paleontological resources and sites. The Act allows for the acquisition, protection, monitoring, and study of paleontological resources and sites, along with providing educational materials to the public and offering rewards as specified in section 11. SEC. 11. REWARDS FORFEITURE. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected for information leading to finding a violation. Forfeiture of paleontological resources and related items may occur for violations under sections 9 or 10. Officers or employees in official duties are not eligible for rewards. Forfeiture to the United States may occur upon conviction, civil penalty assessment, or court determination that paleontological resources, vehicles, or equipment were involved in a violation under section 9 or 10. SEC. 12. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nInformation about paleontological resources requiring a permit will be kept confidential unless disclosure furthers the Act's purposes, poses no risk to the resource, and complies with other laws.\n\nSEC. 13. REGULATIONS.\n\nThe Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act, allowing for public input.\n\nSEC. 14. ROCK COLLECTING ON NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LANDS. Casual rock and mineral collecting on National Forest System lands is allowed without a permit, except as required by other laws or regulations. The Act does not affect activities permitted under existing mining, leasing, disposal, or management laws, including the Federal Land Policy Management Act and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Act does not affect existing laws and authorities related to reclamation and multiple uses of public lands. It also does not require a permit for amateur collecting of certain rock, mineral, or plant fossils. Additionally, it does not impact non-Federal lands or the recovery of paleontological resources from those lands. The Act does not diminish the authority of Federal agencies to protect paleontological resources on Federal lands beyond what is provided in the Act. It also does not create any rights or benefits for individuals who are not officers or employees of the United States. No person who is not an officer or employee of the United States acting in that capacity shall have standing to file any civil action in a court of the United States to enforce any provision or amendment made by this Act. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out this Act is granted."
