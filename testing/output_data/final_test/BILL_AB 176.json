    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 66027.1 of the Education Code requires California educational institutions to use specific demographic categories for reporting student data on ancestry or ethnic origin, following the United States Census Bureau's guidelines for Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups. California educational institutions must use specific demographic categories for reporting student data on ancestry or ethnic origin, including additional major Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander groups. They must comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and ensure statistical significance of collected data. Entities such as California educational institutions must publicly share specified demographic data, excluding personal identifying information, on their websites annually starting from July 1, 2016. The definition of \"entity\" includes the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Trustees of the California State University, and the Regents of the University of California. Graduate or professional schools of the University of California are exempt from this requirement. The University of California is subject to this section only if the Regents make it applicable. Section 8310.7 of the Government Code applies to specific state agencies for collecting demographic data. State agencies in California, in addition to their duties under Section 8310.5, are required to collect demographic data on additional Asian and Pacific Islander groups, including Bangladeshi, Hmong, Indonesian, Malaysian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Taiwanese, Thai, Fijian, and Tongan residents. State agencies in California must make collected data publicly available on their websites, excluding personal identifying information. They are also required to update data collection to include additional Asian and Pacific Islander groups after each decennial United States Census. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by this act, as per the Government Code."
