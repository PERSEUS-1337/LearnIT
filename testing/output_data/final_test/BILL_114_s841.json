    "content": "The Act titled \"Prioritizing Veterans Access to Mental Health Care Act of 2015\" expands eligibility for certain veterans to seek mental health care from non-Department of Veterans Affairs entities. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 is amended to include a provision for veterans seeking mental health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Act allows veterans to seek mental health care from non-Department of Veterans Affairs entities. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop procedures for veterans to submit statements electronically or in person/fax to Non-VA Care Communication Offices. Veterans must include the earliest date of care provided by the Department in their statement. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 mandates veterans to provide the Department with the earliest date of care received for mental health services, whether from a VA facility or non-Department provider. Veterans can also certify their need for immediate mental health care and provide feedback on their experience. The Department must confirm receipt of a veteran's written statement regarding mental health care timeliness and adequacy. Confirmation is provided immediately in electronic or written form. A conforming amendment to the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 is made. Public Law 113-146 is amended to include eligible veterans described in subsection (b)(2)(E). In prioritizing hiring incentives for health professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary shall focus on roles with the greatest need, such as psychiatrists and psychologists. Funding for this initiative will be sourced from the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. The Act and its amendments will become effective 90 days after enactment."
