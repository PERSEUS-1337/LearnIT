    "content": "DEPENDENT CARE TAX CREDIT: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on Dependent Care Services. The Dependent Care Tax Credit allows individuals with qualifying household members to claim a credit for employment-related and respite care expenses paid during the taxable year. The credit amount is determined based on the applicable percentage, which is reduced by 1 percentage point for each full $1,000 amount by which the expenses exceed a certain threshold. The Dependent Care Tax Credit reduces the applicable percentage by 1 point for each full $1,000 of adjusted gross income exceeding $15,000. Adjusted annually for cost-of-living increases after 1994. The Dependent Care Tax Credit reduces the applicable percentage for employment-related expenses incurred to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed for any period with qualifying individuals. If the increase is not a multiple of $10, it will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10. The Dependent Care Tax Credit covers expenses for household services and care of a qualifying individual, excluding services at overnight camps or respite care outside the taxpayer's household. Employment-related expenses for care outside the household are only eligible if incurred for a qualifying individual as defined in subsection (d)(1). The Dependent Care Tax Credit covers expenses for household services and care of a qualifying individual who spends at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household. Expenses for care outside the household are eligible if incurred at a dependent care center that complies with state regulations. The Dependent Care Tax Credit applies to expenses incurred at a dependent care center that provides care for more than 6 individuals and receives payment for their services. The maximum amount of eligible employment-related expenses for the tax credit is $2,400. The Dependent Care Tax Credit allows for a maximum credit of $2,400 for one qualifying individual or $4,800 for two or more qualifying individuals. This amount is reduced by any excludable income under section 129 and by respite care expenses claimed under subsection (a) for the taxable year. The earned income limitation for employment-related expenses incurred during a taxable year is based on the individual's earned income, with special rules for married individuals and spouses who are students. The earned income limitation for employment-related expenses during a taxable year is based on the individual's earned income. Special rules apply for married individuals and spouses who are students or incapable of caring for themselves. The spouse in such a situation is deemed gainfully employed with a minimum earned income requirement if they are a full-time student or a qualifying individual. The term 'respite care expenses' refers to expenses paid for the care of a qualifying individual who is incapable of caring for themselves, during periods when they spend at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household. The tax code allows for respite care expenses up to $1,200 for one qualifying individual or $2,400 for two or more individuals in a taxable year. A qualifying individual is defined as someone who cannot care for themselves and does not spend at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household. The term \"qualifying individual\" includes a dependent under 13 years old, a dependent physically or mentally incapable of self-care, or a spouse unable to care for themselves. Special rules apply, such as the individual must cover over half the household costs and married couples must file a joint return. Married couples must file a joint return for the tax credit to be allowed. Legal separation or filing separate returns may affect marital status for tax purposes. If a married individual maintains a household for a qualifying individual, certain conditions must be met. If an individual furnishes over half the cost of maintaining a household during the taxable year and their spouse is not a member of the household for the last 6 months of the year, they shall not be considered as married. A special dependency test applies to children under certain conditions, where they may be treated as qualifying individuals with respect to the custodial parent. Payments to related individuals are not eligible for the tax credit if they are a dependent of the taxpayer or their spouse, or if they are the taxpayer's child under 19 years old. The term 'student' is defined as an individual who is a full-time student at an educational organization for 5 calendar months during the taxable year. An 'educational organization' refers to an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). To claim the credit, identifying information of the service provider must be included on the tax return. The taxpayer must include the name and address of the service provider on the tax return to claim the credit. If the information is not provided, the taxpayer must show due diligence in attempting to provide it. The Secretary will prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Conforming amendments are made to other sections of the Code. Subsection (e) of section 213 of the Code is amended to replace \"section 21\" with \"section 35\". The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 is also updated accordingly. The amendments made by this section relate to dependent care services and overpayments of tax. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years starting after December 31, 1993."
