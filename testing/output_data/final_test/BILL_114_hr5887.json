    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"RCAF/RAF-Americans Congressional Gold Medal Act\". Congress finds that during World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) in Canada played a crucial role in training aircrew. Around 8,864 Americans volunteered to join the RCAF, with many serving as flying instructors. Additionally, approximately 750 Americans, including 244 in the Eagle Squadrons, served in Great Britain. During World War II, the Eagle Squadrons provided relief to the RAF from losing combat pilots. President Roosevelt called the BCATP the \"Aerodrome Of Democracy\" and expressed gratitude to those who participated. Around 3,794 Americans transferred to the USAAF after Pearl Harbor, with the Eagle Squadrons joining the 4th Fighter Group in September 1942. During World War II, courageous RCAF/RAF-American pilots transferred to the USAAF, preventing a shortage of experienced airmen after America's entry into the war. They served as flight instructors and many became highly accomplished combat pilots. Some of these pilots were part of the highly decorated American Fighter Aces group, showcasing exceptional courage in defense of Freedom. Over 800 of these brave Americans lost their lives while serving.

The Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate will arrange for the presentation of a gold medal to honor U.S. nationals who served in the Royal Canadian Air Force or the Royal Air Force during World War II. The medal will be designed and struck by the Secretary of the Treasury, and after the award ceremony, it will be given to the Smithsonian Institution. The gold medal awarded to U.S. nationals who served in the Royal Canadian Air Force or the Royal Air Force during World War II will be given to the Smithsonian Institution for display and research. Congress suggests that the medal should also be displayed at other appropriate locations associated with the recipients, with a preference for Smithsonian-affiliated sites. The Secretary is authorized to produce and sell bronze duplicates of the gold medal at a price covering all costs. The medals are considered national medals and numismatic items under specific codes."
