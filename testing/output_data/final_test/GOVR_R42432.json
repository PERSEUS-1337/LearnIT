    "content": "In 2016, oil prices averaged $41 per barrel, down from $92 in 2014. Prices have been rising since OPEC announced production cuts. The EIA projects prices to average $65 per barrel in 2018, dropping to $63 in 2019. Currently, prices fluctuate between $75-$80 per barrel. Legislative proposals aim to increase domestic energy supply and amend environmental statutes. The Trump Administration focuses on \"energy dominance.\" The Trump Administration's \"energy dominance\" theme has led to various initiatives, including opening ANWR, streamlining permitting for energy projects on federal land, and authorizing more leasing in the Outer Continental Shelf. Congressional proposals like S. 750 / H.R. 2242 aim to restrict fossil fuel leasing on federal land, while H.R. 4426 promotes renewable energy development. The discussion focuses on promoting renewable energy development and reforming fossil fuel leasing on federal land. It addresses the increase in oil production on nonfederal lands due to improved technology and favorable geology, leading to a decrease in the federal share of total U.S. crude oil production. Natural gas prices have remained low due to the shale gas boom, resulting in increased gas supplies. The shale gas boom has led to a rise in natural gas supplies, making it more competitive with coal for power generation. U.S. natural gas production increased by 7.5 trillion cubic feet since 2008, with a significant portion coming from nonfederal lands. Federal lands saw a decrease in production by 2.0 tcf, while nonfederal lands experienced a 50% increase. The federal share of natural gas production dropped from 25% in 2008 to 13% in 2017. This report discusses Congress's considerations on U.S. oil and natural gas production data for federal and nonfederal areas over the past decade. Crude oil production on federal lands surged from under 20% to over 30% in the early 2000s, reaching nearly 36% in 2009. There are 5.3 billion barrels of proved oil reserves on federal onshore acreage and 3.9 billion barrels offshore, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. federal oil reserves account for about 26% of all U.S. crude oil reserves. Higher prices can lead to higher reserve estimates. Federal lands, especially offshore, are expected to continue making a significant contribution to U.S. oil production. Federal lands, particularly offshore, are expected to continue contributing significantly to the U.S. energy supply. There is interest in Congress to open more federal lands for oil and gas development, but increased accessibility may not necessarily lead to higher production levels. Some lawmakers advocate for discontinuing fossil fuel leasing on federal lands or considering climate and environmental impacts in energy leasing evaluations. Crude oil production has seen significant increases in states like New Mexico and North Dakota. The selected states in Table 2 have shown significant increases in oil production in New Mexico and North Dakota, with moderate increases in Colorado and Wyoming. California and Utah have experienced declines in production. Onshore oil production on federal land is mainly concentrated in these six states, accounting for 96% of production. While overall natural gas production in the United States has been increasing since 2008, production on federal lands has been declining annually since 2009. Offshore production has seen a significant decrease of over 55%, while onshore production declines have been less dramatic since FY2010. Federal natural gas production as a percentage of total U.S. production has been steadily declining since the early 2000s, dropping from 25% in 2008 to 13% in 2017. U.S. natural gas production on federal lands has declined, accounting for 13% of total production in 2017. The majority of growth in production is on nonfederal lands, especially in shale plays. Federal natural gas reserves are estimated at 22% of total reserves, with offshore reserves making up a small portion. The offshore proved reserves are mainly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado are the top natural gas producing states on federal land. Short-term estimates show an increase in oil production in federal offshore areas, while long-term estimates predict a decline in oil production. Overall, U.S. oil production is projected to reach 11.70 mbd in 2019 and could rise to 11.90 mbd by 2040. U.S. oil production is projected to reach 11.90 mbd by 2040, with federal lower 48 offshore production accounting for 12% of total U.S. crude oil production. Offshore dry natural gas production is expected to peak in 2019 at 1.36 tcf, dropping to 1.15 tcf by 2040. Onshore federal lands have 113 million acres open for oil and gas development, while 166 million acres are off-limits. In 2017, 38% of onshore federal leases and 71% of offshore leases were not in production. In offshore areas, 73% of leased acreage is not in production, but may have an approved exploration or development plan. 97 million acres of federal water are available for leasing under the current schedule. The draft proposed program (DPP) for 2019-2024 suggests 47 lease sales, increasing available acreage to over 90% of total OCS acreage. The current Five-Year Leasing Program offers about 50% of undiscovered oil and 40% of gas resources. In the previous program, 78% of OCS resources were available for lease. Alaskan resources were removed, eliminating 25 billion barrels of oil and 104 tcf of gas from the current program. Over 41 million acres of oil and gas leases were in federal areas, with 12.8 million onshore and 4.1 million offshore acres in production. Onshore federal land lease acreage decreased from 34.6 million acres in 2014 to 25.7 million acres. The amount of federal land under lease decreased by 25% from 2014 to 2017, while oil production increased by 16%. Natural gas production onshore declined by 9% during the same period. The President has the authority to withdraw federal lands from mineral entry using executive orders and statutory authorities like the Antiquities Act. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 governs modern executive withdrawals. The President has the authority to declare national monuments on federal land and reserve parcels of land for their protection. This reservation limits land use under the multiple use management framework for 20 years, subject to renewal. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 governs executive withdrawals of federal lands. FLPMA allows for land use planning based on a multiple-use approach with public and congressional input. It outlines procedures for sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges of public lands. Withdrawals can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval. The Secretary of the Interior can make, modify, extend, or revoke withdrawals, with detailed reports required for proposed withdrawals. Mineral industry representatives argue that federal land withdrawals hinder mineral exploration and limit reserves, leading to higher production costs. They believe that without new reserves or technological advancements, costs may rise, increasing import dependence. Critics of mineral development argue that mining can lead to exclusive land use, potentially harming other land values and uses. They highlight unreclaimed areas from past mining, Superfund sites, and the potential destruction of scenic, historic, and cultural resources on public land. Congressional debate continues over the balance between energy development and conservation on federal lands, with recent controversy over revoking or modifying previously withdrawn areas. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) was opened to oil and gas development under the 2017 tax revision. The law directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish an oil and gas leasing program in ANWR's coastal plain (1002 Area). Estimates show 7.3 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the coastal plain, with low gas prospects. Opponents argue for protecting the environment for caribou migration, polar bear habitat, and biological diversity, citing concerns over climate change. The Trump Administration recommended reducing the size of National Monuments like Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante. This decision could lead to increased mineral entry and development in these areas. Legal challenges are ongoing regarding the President's authority to modify National Monuments under the Antiquities Act. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) allows the President to withdraw unleased lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. The Trump Administration's Executive Order 13795 modified the Obama Administration's withdrawal of certain areas in Alaska and reviewed National Marine Sanctuaries. There is a concern about the President's authority to make this modification under OCSLA. The President's authority to modify withdrawals under OCSLA is unresolved. Congress may consider streamlining permit processing for onshore federal lands to boost energy production. After obtaining an oil and gas lease, a permit to drill must be approved for each well. The Mineral Leasing Act requires approval of a plan of operations for drilling on federal lands. The application must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced new timelines and a pilot program to streamline the permitting process for oil and gas on federal lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a pilot program at seven BLM field offices to streamline the permitting process for oil and gas leases on federal lands. The pilot project reduced processing times for APDs and increased environmental inspections. NEPA processing time fell from 81 to 61 days due to \"colocation\" of agency staff. Funding for the pilot program was made permanent. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a pilot program at seven BLM field offices to streamline the permitting process for oil and gas leases on federal lands. Funding for the pilot program was made permanent under the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act. The Trump Administration introduced an initiative in Secretarial Order 3354 to improve the oil and gas leasing system and clear up the backlog of permit applications. Congressional action includes bills to shorten timelines for energy development permitting processes. H.R. 6106 and S. 2151 aim to expedite oil and gas permitting by clarifying categorical exclusions and streamlining the process. H.R. 6088 allows for a notification of permit to drill in certain circumstances. Critics argue that proposals to shorten review timelines for oil and gas permitting could limit public input and overlook environmental impacts. Prior to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, concerns about lengthy permit processing times were attributed to outdated Resource Management Plans. The BLM implemented new strategies in 2003 to expedite the process, including analyzing multiple permit applications with similar characteristics. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced new timelines for BLM to process APDs, addressing a backlog by processing more APDs than received from 2009 to 2017. Despite a decrease in pending applications from 2008 to 2013, the ratio of APDs pending to processed remained high. The BLM processed more APDs than received from 2009 to 2017, but the ratio of pending to processed APDs remained high. In 2018, BLM expects to process 4,300 APDs. As of 2016, there were 7,000 approved APDs not yet drilled. Processing time for APDs decreased from 307 days in FY2011 to 257 days in FY2016. Critics note faster processing on private and state lands due to different regulatory frameworks. State agencies permit drilling on private lands with faster approval rates, but negotiations between producers and landowners differ from federal land permitting. Legislative proposals aim to expedite energy leasing on federal land to align with the Administration's energy dominance strategy. The legislative proposals aim to expedite energy leasing on federal land to align with the Administration's energy dominance strategy. The bills would allow states to manage federal leases once certain criteria are met, exempting state actions from federal regulations like the Endangered Species Act and NEPA. The proposed legislation (S. 316 and S. 2319) would prevent the Secretary of the Interior from enforcing federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing in states with their own regulations. Supporters argue that state processes would expedite energy development on federal lands, while critics are concerned about the loss of public input and environmental review without NEPA. State agencies may require permits for mineral developers on federal land, and the BLM can delegate regulatory roles to states if they meet or exceed federal policy. The MLA grants BLM discretionary power to impose conditions on mineral leases. The MLA grants BLM discretionary power to attach conditions to mineral leases for protection of US interests, without conflicting with state laws. FLPMA requires BLM's land use plans to comply with pollution control laws and be consistent with state and local plans. States have input on energy development off their coastlines under federal acts. The number of federal producing acres may not correlate with leased acres. Some Members of Congress proposed a $4/acre lease fee for nonproducing leases to promote more oil and gas drilling on public land and water. Higher rents for offshore leases were imposed in 2009 to discourage holding unused leases and move more leases into production. The Interior imposed higher rents for offshore leases in 2009 to discourage holding unused leases and promote production. Rents escalate significantly over time, with rates increasing based on water depths. A nonproducing fee or rent escalation may lead to fewer idle leases and more active leases, as some leaseholders may relinquish their leases rather than pay the fee. The BLM can re-lease acreage that has been relinquished or passed over at a future lease sale."
