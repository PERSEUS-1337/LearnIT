This report summarizes key changes in the reauthorization of IHCIA and other ACA provisions related to American Indians and Alaska Natives enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. It also discusses ACA changes to private health insurance coverage for these populations. Enacted by the ACA: Detailed Summary and Timeline, by [author name scrubbed], provides a section-by-section summary of the IHCIA Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2009. The report outlines the amendments made by the ACA to the eight titles of IHCIA and other changes that may impact American Indians and Alaska Natives. It aims to offer context for better understanding the intent of ACA's reauthorization of IHCIA at the time of enactment. This report does not cover ongoing ACA-related regulatory activities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides healthcare for eligible American Indians/Alaska Natives through programs and facilities on reservations and in urban areas. IHS operates in 35 states, divided into 12 Areas, each with an Area Office overseeing service units and facilities. Indian tribes or tribal organizations may also run IHS facilities through contracts with IHS. Urban Indian health projects are funded by IHS through grants or contracts. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds urban Indian health projects (UIHPs) through grants or contracts to urban Indian organizations (UIOs). IHS provides a variety of medical services, focusing on health conditions prevalent among American Indians and Alaska Natives. This includes mental health, alcohol, and substance abuse services. IHS also funds projects related to health care facilities and sanitation. The Indian Health Service (IHS) funds the construction, equipping, and maintenance of health care facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and water supply systems, to improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS also provides technical assistance for sanitation facilities and solid waste disposal systems to reduce disease incidence. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act authorizes specific IHS activities and aims to improve the health status of indigenous populations. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) aimed to improve the health status of American Indians and Alaska Natives by authorizing direct collections from Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers for services at IHS facilities. It also granted funding to Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) for healthcare services, established substance abuse treatment programs, and health professions recruitment programs. The IHCIA was last fully reauthorized in 1992 and had its appropriations extended through FY2001 before being reauthorized in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) reauthorizes the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) permanently and appropriates necessary funds for FY2010 and beyond. It includes provisions for American Indians and Alaska Natives in SSA health benefit programs and private health insurance exchanges. The ACA reauthorizes the IHCIA indefinitely and appropriates necessary funds. It introduces new Indian-related terms like Indian Health Program and Tribal Health Program. The ACA reauthorizes the IHCIA indefinitely, consolidates authorizations of appropriations, and expands access to UIOs and TOs for grant and contract programs. The ACA expands access to grant and contract programs for UIOs and TOs. It also enhances mental health services, including youth suicide prevention programs, and increases access to grants from SAMHSA. Additionally, it designates IHS as the payor of last resort for all services and extends Medicare payments to hospitals operated by IHS, ITs, or TOs. The ACA includes provisions to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility for American Indian and Alaska Native enrollment. It establishes an Office of Direct Service Tribes for tribes receiving health care directly from IHS. It also requires a plan for a new area office in Nevada and demonstration projects for modular and mobile health facilities. Additionally, IHCIA Title I aims to increase the number of Native health professionals available to IHS, ITs, and TOs. The IHCIA authorized workforce programs to address high vacancy rates in health professions at IHS facilities. Programs included scholarships, loan repayment, continuing education, advanced training, recruitment, and retention initiatives. Title I also established the community health representative program to train American Indians and Alaska Natives as paraprofessionals in healthcare. The ACA expands health professions programs like the CHAP program for Alaska Natives to serve as health aides. It includes requirements for implementing the CHAP dental health aide program and prohibits filling IHS program vacancies for dentists with dental health aide therapists. IHCIA Title II authorized various health programs, including mental health programs and prevention initiatives. The ACA reauthorizes specific health programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including mental health, diabetes, and tuberculosis programs. It also includes provisions for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund, expanding health promotion activities and authorizing hospice care and assisted living. Services are limited to individuals living in defined CHS delivery areas. The ACA reauthorizes health programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including hospice care, assisted living, long-term care, and home- and community-based services. It also includes provisions for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund, as well as funding for health care and sanitation facilities. The ACA reauthorizes health programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including provisions for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund, as well as funding for health care and sanitation facilities operated by IHS and tribes. It also maintains pay rate requirements for facility construction projects funded under IHCIA Title III and establishes a priority system for construction of Indian health care facilities. The ACA reauthorizes health programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives, including provisions for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund and Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund. It establishes a priority system for construction of Indian health care facilities, allows for new facility nominations every three years, and includes an \"area distribution fund\" for innovative approaches to healthcare facility needs. The law also creates a facilities needs assessment workgroup and facilities appropriations advisory board in IHS, authorizes construction of sanitation and water-supply facilities, and grants the Secretary authority to accept renovations or modernizations of Indian health facilities by ITs. The ACA authorizes grants to Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations for construction or upgrading of small ambulatory care facilities. It allows the Secretary to accept funding from other sources for facilities construction and authorizes federal agencies to transfer funds, equipment, or supplies for this purpose. The ACA also establishes construction standards for health and sanitation facilities, creates demonstration grant programs for modular component health care facilities and mobile health stations in Indian communities. Title IV of the IHCIA authorized reimbursements for IHS health care facilities from Medicare and Medicaid programs. It also included provisions for billing and receiving reimbursements from these programs. Additionally, it did not mention funds from the CHIP program prior to the ACA. The IHCIA authorized direct billing of Medicare and Medicaid payments for ITs or TOs under ISDEAA contracts, with reimbursements placed in a special fund for compliance and health service improvements. It specified auditing requirements and mandated federal payment of 100% of Medicaid services. The ACA maintains these provisions and requires the Secretary to report on funds reimbursed and provide grants for Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. The ACA expands direct billing for Medicare and Medicaid payments for ITs or TOs under ISDEAA contracts, includes reimbursements from CHIP, authorizes grants for outreach and enrollment, and allows for recovery of reimbursements from third-party entities. The ACA allows ITs, TOs, and UIOs to use SSA health benefit funds and ISDEAA funds to purchase health care coverage. It also permits them to purchase Federal Employee Health Benefits and Federal Employee Group Life Insurance coverage for their employees. The ACA requires federal health care programs to accept providers operated by IHS, ITs, TOs, or UIOs on the same basis as other qualified providers if they meet licensure requirements. It expands IHS's relationship with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The ACA expands IHS's relationship with the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense by authorizing increased coordination to treat Indian veterans. It also requires a study to determine the feasibility of treating the Navajo Nation as a state for Medicaid purposes. Title V of IHCIA directs the HHS Secretary to make contracts or grants with UIOs for health projects to serve urban Indians, aiming to make health services more accessible to urban Indians. The ACA allows Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) to expand their health programs in urban centers beyond their base location. UIHPs offer various services such as health care, education, immunizations, and behavioral health. Funding for UIHPs comes from various sources including IHS grants, state and private funds, patient fees, Medicaid, and Medicare. The ACA expands programs for Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) by deeming them federal executive agencies, allowing them to receive excess property donations, use HHS facilities, and access various health programs previously limited to IHS facilities. Grants are also authorized for UIOs to develop health information programs. The ACA authorizes grants for UIOs to develop health information programs and infrastructure. IHCIA Title VI established IHS within HHS and required an automated management information system. The ACA maintains IHS in PHS but directs the head of IHS to report directly to the HHS Secretary. It adds new requirements, including establishing an IHS Office of Direct Service Tribes and submitting a plan to Congress for a new Nevada Area. Title VII of the IHCIA authorizes alcohol and substance abuse programs, including grant and contract programs for prevention and treatment services. It requires coordination with the Department of the Interior, services for specific groups, training programs, community education, and projects for fetal alcohol syndrome. Additionally, it includes authorization for substance abuse treatment projects in specified locations in New Mexico and Arizona. The ACA replaces IHCIA Title VII with new language authorizing comprehensive behavioral health prevention and treatment programs in New Mexico, Arizona, and Alaska. It includes programs for training and licensure requirements, specific programs for Indian women and youth, and grants for telehealth technology projects for youth suicide prevention and treatment services. The ACA authorizes appropriations for telehealth technology programs for youth suicide prevention and treatment services, as well as programs for domestic and sexual violence prevention. It also includes requirements for grants from SAMHSA and activities to increase access to mental health services through psychology and psychiatry interns. Additionally, it establishes a demonstration program for a culturally appropriate life skills curriculum to prevent suicide in American Indian and Alaska Native adolescents. The ACA establishes a grant program to prevent suicide in schools serving Indian children in high suicide areas. It includes provisions on reports, regulations, IHCIA implementation plan, abortion, eligibility for IHS services, and funding reductions. The ACA extends IHCIA requirements, limits federal funds for abortions, and makes medical quality assurance records confidential. It also adds new reports on disease prevention and injury prevention. The ACA mandates new reports on disease prevention and injury prevention, coordination of Indian health care services, and the CHS program. It also requires IHS budget requests to reflect inflation and changes in service population, establishes a prescription drug monitoring program at IHP and UIO facilities, permits tribes to charge for services under ISDEAA self-governance compacts, and establishes an IHS Director of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment. The ACA includes reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988, extending authorizations of appropriations through FY2019 and making changes to private health insurance coverage. It mandates individuals to obtain health insurance or face a financial penalty and establishes health insurance exchanges for purchasing private plans. The ACA provisions include special enrollment periods for American Indians and Alaska Natives defined in IHCIA to enroll in private health insurance plans through exchanges. Members of federally recognized Indian Tribes can enroll and change plans monthly. Indian tribe members are exempt from penalties under Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ACA provisions provide special enrollment periods for American Indians and Alaska Natives to enroll in private health insurance plans through exchanges. Members of Indian tribes are exempt from penalties under the Internal Revenue Code for non-compliance with the individual mandate. Certain documentation is required to demonstrate eligibility for this exemption. Additionally, American Indians and Alaska Natives meeting specific criteria are exempt from cost-sharing requirements if enrolled in a private health insurance plan offered through the exchange. The definition of \"Indian\" is based on the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) and the federal poverty level. The value of Indian tribe health benefits is excluded from gross income calculations for tax purposes. IHS eligibility is indicated by tribal membership or residing within an IHS health service delivery area. Other individuals may be eligible if they live on tax-exempt land, are recognized as Indian by their community, actively participate in tribal affairs, or meet other relevant factors. Non-Indian women pregnant with an eligible Indian's child can receive care at an IHS-funded facility during pregnancy and six weeks postpartum. Non-Indian women pregnant with an eligible Indian's child can receive care at an IHS-funded facility during pregnancy and six weeks postpartum. IHS services are intended for federally recognized tribes, but UIOs may also provide services to terminated or state-recognized tribes. HHS provided a hardship exemption for IHS-eligible individuals not members of federally recognized tribes from the individual mandate. American Indians and Alaska Natives eligible for exemption from the individual mandate can claim it through tax filing or apply through a health insurance exchange. The ACA amends the SSA to define Indian terms for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP. Amendments to the SSA are included in Title II, Subtitle K, \"Protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives.\" Subtitle K, \"Protections for American Indians and Alaska Natives,\" designates IHS, ITs, and TOs as payors of last resort, allows them to determine Medicaid and CHIP eligibility, prohibits cost sharing for low-income Indians in qualified health plans, and extends Medicare Part B reimbursements indefinitely from January 1, 2010. This extends services previously expired under the ACA. The ACA amended Medicare Part D to allow IHS costs for prescription drugs to count towards out-of-pocket thresholds for catastrophic protection for beneficiaries. This change ensures that expenses paid by IHS on behalf of beneficiaries contribute to reaching the required out-of-pocket costs for catastrophic protection."
