    "content": "The House of Representatives rules dictate the availability requirements for legislative measures, including reported bills, unreported bills, joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules. Draft committee reports and bills must be publicly available in electronic form designated by the Committee on House Administration. Conference committee reports and joint explanatory statements must also be available electronically. The House rule requires that draft committee reports and bills be available in electronic form designated by the Committee on House Administration. Measures reported by committees cannot be considered on the House floor until the committee report has been available for at least 72 hours. Committee members have two days to submit supplemental views, but the majority can start the 72-hour clock before receiving such views. The House rule requires committee reports and bills to be available electronically. Measures reported by committees must have their reports available for 72 hours before consideration on the House floor. Conference reports must also be available for 72 hours before consideration. The House rule requires committee reports and bills to be available electronically for 72 hours before consideration on the House floor. Conference reports must also be available for 72 hours before consideration, with an exception during the last six days of a session. However, this exception is difficult to implement in practice due to adjournment resolutions being approved shortly before adjournment, making it unclear when the \"last six days\" of a session begin. During the final days of a session, the House may waive the 72-hour availability requirement for conference reports through special rules from the Rules Committee. Special rules can also waive other rules and must be held over for one legislative day. A legislative day starts when the House reconvenes after adjournment and ends when adjourned again. Rule XIII provides exceptions to the layover requirement for special rules in the House. Special rules can be considered the same day if they waive certain rules or if presented in the last three days of a session. The one-day layover requirement can be waived with a two-thirds majority vote. The House can waive special rule requirements by two-thirds vote or a simple majority for availability requirements. The House can vote on a measure the same day it is made available by agreeing to special rules that waive the 72-hour availability requirement. Special rules can also structure the amending process and may require a one legislative day delay unless waived by a two-thirds vote. Special rules can waive the 72-hour availability requirement for a measure, allowing the House to vote on it the same day. Waiving the one-day layover requirement for a special rule can be done by the Rules Committee. The House of Representatives can expedite the process of calling up, debating, and passing a measure in a single day by waiving the 72-hour availability requirement. This can be achieved through a special rule approved by a simple majority vote, allowing for immediate consideration of the measure without prior availability. The House of Representatives can expedite the process of calling up, debating, and passing a measure in a single day by waiving the availability requirements through a special rule. This rule can be considered on the next legislative day regardless of how much time has elapsed. The House can expedite the legislative process by waiving availability requirements through a special rule, which can be considered on the next legislative day regardless of the time elapsed. This allows for the consideration of resolutions, bills, or conference reports without the 72-hour availability requirement. The Rules Committee may report the rule late at night or early in the morning of the next calendar day, and if the House adjourns and reconvenes, the layover requirement is considered met for a new legislative day. In the House, special rules can waive availability requirements for subsequent measures, sometimes known as \"same day rules\" or \"martial law\" rules. The term has been used for at least 15 years but is not consistently applied to one type of rule. It can refer to waiving the one-day layover requirement or triggering certain House rules. Special rules in the House can waive availability requirements for measures, known as \"same day rules\" or \"martial law\" rules. These rules can bypass the one-day layover requirement and trigger specific House rules, allowing for flexibility near the end of a session. Opponents argue that all Representatives should have time to review legislative proposals, even at the end of a session, similar to existing rules that waive availability requirements."
