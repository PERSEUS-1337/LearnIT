    "content": "The Public Health Pesticides Protection Act of 1993, also known as the Act, references the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act for any amendments or repeals. The Act defines various terms related to pesticides. The Administrator must consider the risks and benefits of public health pesticides separately from other pesticides. Regulatory actions for public health pesticides should weigh the risks of the pesticide against health risks like diseases transmitted by the vector. Additionally, a new definition for \"minor use\" is added to the Act for small volume pesticide use that wouldn't justify a full registration. The Act defines terms related to agricultural crop production and public health pesticides, including the definition of a public health pesticide as one used in public health programs for vector control or health protection against viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms. A vector is defined as an animal capable of transmitting human diseases or causing discomfort or injury. SEC. 3. REGISTRATION. Amends Section 3(c)(2)(A) by including the public health and agricultural need for minor pesticide use and changing the focus from potential exposure to potential effects on man and the environment. SEC. 4. REREGISTRATION. Section 4 (7 U.S.C. 136a-1) is amended to exempt public health pesticides from fees if more than 50 percent of their usage is for promoting public health. End use products registered for public health pesticides with at least 50 percent usage for public health promotion are also exempt from fees. Public health pesticides are exempt from fees if over 50% of their usage is for public health promotion. Additionally, end use pesticides registered for public health purposes are also exempt from fees. Amendments include determining volume usage for public health pesticides and proposing registration for public health pesticide use. SEC. 5. CANCELLATION. Amends Section 6(b) to include sending notice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for review for public health pesticides. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will comment on public health pesticides in the same manner as the Secretary of Agriculture for agricultural pesticides. SEC. 6. VIEWS. SEC. 6. VIEWS. The Administrator must seek the views of the Secretary of Health and Human Services before publishing regulations for public health pesticides, similar to how views of the Secretary of Agriculture are sought. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY OF ADMINISTRATOR. Amends Section 25(a)(1) to include public health pesticides in the authority of the Administrator. SEC. 8. IDENTIFICATION OF PESTS. SEC. 8. IDENTIFICATION OF PESTS. The Administrator, in coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall identify pests of significant public health importance and develop programs to combat such pests. SEC. 9. PUBLIC HEALTH PESTICIDES. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act is amended to include regulations for public health pesticides. The Administrator and the Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit an annual report to Congress by March 1 detailing the use of public health pesticides in the US. The report includes an analysis of vector control practices, diseases associated with vectors, the role of IPM in vector control, and the benefits of public health pesticides in disease prevention. The annual report to Congress details the benefits of public health pesticides in disease prevention and the risks of vectored diseases."
