    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Voluntary Protection Program Act\" and establishes the Voluntary Protection Program. The Voluntary Protection Program Act establishes a program for cooperative agreements with employers to promote safety and health management systems, including hazard assessment, prevention programs, employee participation, and training. Additionally, a voluntary protection program will be implemented to encourage excellence in protecting employees from occupational hazards. The Voluntary Protection Program Act requires employers to submit an application demonstrating compliance with safety requirements for employee protection. Onsite evaluations by Labor representatives ensure high levels of employee protection without enforcement actions. The Voluntary Protection Program Act requires employers to assure the Secretary of Labor that safety and health program information is readily available. Periodic reevaluations by the Secretary of Labor are necessary for continued participation in the program. The Secretary of Labor monitors program performance through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health. The Voluntary Protection Program Act requires employers to develop a documentation policy for follow-up actions by regional offices of OSHA in response to fatalities and injuries. Internal controls must ensure compliance with program policies for onsite reviews and monitoring of injury rates. A monitoring system should be established. Establish a monitoring system for the voluntary protection program with specific performance goals and measures. Sites approved for the program are exempt from certain inspections, investigations, and paperwork requirements, except for those related to employee complaints, fatalities, catastrophes, or toxic releases. No payment is required for employers to participate in the program. The Secretary of Labor will oversee the transition to the new voluntary protection program, ensuring it aligns with previous programs. Employers with active agreements before the enactment of this Act will be included in the new program. The Secretary of Labor will issue final regulations for the voluntary protection program within 2 years of the Act's enactment, allowing eligible employers to continue participating in the program. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is provided as necessary."
