    "content": "Witnesses in federal criminal cases may be arrested, held for bail, and sometimes imprisoned until they testify. The Supreme Court has not directly addressed the constitutionality of the federal material witness statute, but has acknowledged its importance. Despite concerns about potential misuse, lower courts have upheld the statute's validity. The federal material witness statute can be used for preventive detention or as an accusation, but lower courts have denied its use as a substitute for a criminal arrest warrant. The statute is often used in immigration offenses involving foreign nationals, but critics argue that it has been abused since September 11, 2001. Arrest warrants for material witnesses can be issued by federal or state judges for grand jury or trial witnesses. Section 3144 allows for arrest of potential trial witnesses and grand jury witnesses. While both the government and defendants can benefit from this section in a criminal trial, its availability is less clear in grand jury proceedings. The purpose of the statute is to preserve evidence for criminal proceedings, with federal prosecutors typically arranging for witness presentations to the grand jury. The courts assume that the government can use section 3144 to arrest grand jury witnesses if necessary. A warrant under this section requires probable cause that the witness has material evidence and it's impracticable to secure their attendance with a subpoena. The term \"material\" evidence means information that can influence the decision of the decision-making body. The government can establish probable cause for a witness providing material evidence through a federal prosecutor's affidavit. A witness can provide material evidence through an affidavit of a federal prosecutor or investigator for the grand jury. The standard for proving this may not be demanding due to the broad power of the grand jury. To obtain a material witness arrest warrant, probable cause must show impracticality in securing the witness with a subpoena, which can be demonstrated by evidence of possible flight, refusal to cooperate, difficulty serving a subpoena, or the witness being a foreign national. Federal bail laws apply to material witnesses arrested under section 3144, with release favored and detention as a last option. A material witness must satisfy the appearance standard to be released on personal recognizance or bond, with the option of counsel during bail proceedings. The appearance standard must be met by a material witness for release, with the court considering factors like deposition, character, health, and community ties. If unable to comply with release conditions, a witness may be detained, but deposition can be used if testimony can be secured that way. The federal deposition rule allows for a detained witness' deposition to be taken upon request. The court has limited discretion to deny this request. The Fifth Circuit has noted that a detained witness can request their deposition for release, showing that further detention is unnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. The \"failure of justice\" limitation applies when releasing the witness would deny the defendant favorable testimony. It does not consider factors like the absence of a judicial officer during the deposition or the witness being an illegal alien. The Fifth Circuit allows a detained witness to request their deposition for release if further detention is unnecessary to prevent a failure of justice. The decision to authorize depositions for detained witnesses must show exceptional circumstances and be in the interest of justice. The court may authorize depositions to be taken sua sponte to release a detained witness, but the admissibility in later criminal proceedings depends on accommodating the defendant's constitutional rights. The government must periodically report to the court on the justification for holding an incarcerated witness. The court must periodically report on the justification for holding an incarcerated material witness, who is entitled to witness fees while in custody. Upon release, the witness may receive transportation and subsistence. Failure to appear after release may result in prosecution, especially if it involves avoiding testifying in a felony case. Critics have raised concerns about the misuse of authority under 18 U.S.C. 3144 to indefinitely detain potential terrorist suspects. The government used the material witness law to detain possible terrorist suspects without constitutional protections, leading to wrongful arrests and apologies for mistaken identities. Witnesses were held in harsh conditions, interrogated without legal representation, and often not brought to testify in court. Federal investigators and attorneys relied on false information, evading the need for probable cause. The government made mistakes by detaining terrorist suspects under the material witness law without proper constitutional protections. Federal investigators and attorneys relied on false information to avoid the need for probable cause, leading to wrongful arrests and apologies for mistaken identities. The Justice Department clarified that the material witness statute is a long-standing law, not a creation of the USA PATRIOT Act, and operates under court supervision with witnesses usually being released after testifying. Section 12 of H.R. 3199 amended the USA PATRIOT Act to include periodic reviews of the authority under section 3144. The Inspector General's designee was tasked with reviewing detentions of persons under section 3144 of title 18, United States Code, advertising availability to receive information on such activity, and reporting twice a year to the Judiciary Committees on implementation of this requirement. The Administration generally supports H.R. 3199 as passed by the House. The Administration generally supports H.R. 3199 but strongly opposes section 12, which would allow the Department of Justice's Inspector General to investigate material witnesses, citing concerns about violating Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This provision was removed from H.R. 3199 before House passage. No similar provision was found in the Senate-approved version or the conference bill. Senator Leahy's S. 1739 revises section 3144 to prioritize postponing arrest until after a material witness has been served with a summons or subpoena and failed to appear. The provision in question pertains to material witnesses who have been served with a summons or subpoena but failed to appear. It allows for arrest by officers not in physical possession of the warrant and requires an initial judicial appearance without delay. Detention is limited to 30 days, with the Attorney General required to report on the use of material witness warrants annually. The existing statute allows for the arrest of material witnesses who fail to appear, with detention limited to 30 days. The proposed amendment does not include a provision for release based on deposition availability. S. 1739 would eliminate the reporting requirement for material witnesses held in custody for more than 10 days pending indictment. The court requires a report listing material witnesses held in custody for over 10 days, with the government attorney stating reasons for their continued detention."
