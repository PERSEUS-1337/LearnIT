It also addresses the disposition of property. The Tennessee Valley Authority is exempt from certain property disposition regulations under the Federal Power Act if they disclose any sale, lease, or disposition of facilities over $50,000 to the Commission and use the proceeds to reduce debt. SEC. 4. FOREIGN OPERATIONS; PROTECTIONS. Section 208 of the Federal Power Act is amended to limit the Tennessee Valley Authority from including costs incurred outside the United States in any rate or charge. The Tennessee Valley Authority must annually report its international activities to the Commission, and any rate or charge incurred outside the United States shall be considered unjust, unreasonable, and unlawful under the Act. This does not limit the Commission's authority to regulate rates for the Tennessee Valley Authority under other laws. The Tennessee Valley Authority must report its international activities annually to the Commission and certify that it has not included the costs of these activities in any filed rates or charges. SEC. 5. TVA POWER SALES. An amendment is made to the Federal Power Act to include a new section regarding TVA power sales. The Tennessee Valley Authority is restricted from selling electric power to a retail customer within a designated distributor service area, unless certain conditions are met. This includes the customer purchasing power directly from TVA, the distributor buying a limited amount of power from TVA, or the distributor agreeing to TVA selling power to the customer. The Tennessee Valley Authority's retail sales of electric power are subject to state regulation under applicable public utilities laws. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, TVA must file all rates, charges, and contracts related to electric energy transmission or sale. No initial review required for timely filings under this section with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. SEC. 6. FILING AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF TVA DOCUMENTS. Amendment to Part III of the Federal Power Act for filing and full disclosure of TVA documents. SEC. 319 of the Tennessee Valley Authority Act requires TVA to file and disclose documents as other public utilities do. The regulation must be issued within a year of enactment, considering practices of the Commission. SEC. 7 addresses the applicability of antitrust laws to TVA. The antitrust laws defined in this section include the Clayton Act, Robinson Patman Act, and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Tennessee Valley Authority is considered a person, not government, for antitrust law purposes. These laws are not modified, impaired, or superseded by this Act. The antitrust laws apply to the Tennessee Valley Authority regardless of its classification as a government entity or engagement in governmental functions. SEC. 8. SAVINGS PROVISION. Defines \"TVA distributor\" as a cooperative or publicly owned electric power system purchasing power from TVA. The Act does not subject TVA distributors to FERC regulation or affect existing laws. The Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933 is amended to restrict the Corporation from renting or selling construction equipment, providing maintenance or repair services, performing contract construction work, or offering construction engineering services to private or public entities, except for electrical contractors engaged in electrical utility work. The Corporation may provide equipment or services to power customers, distributors, or governmental entities engaged in electrical utility projects. Used construction equipment is defined as equipment with over 2,500 hours of service. The Corporation can sell used construction equipment through a public auction to reduce debt."
