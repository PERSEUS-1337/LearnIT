    "content": "The \"Hate Crimes Commission Act of 2017\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The findings section highlights key points related to hate crimes. The Congress finds that hate crimes are criminal offenses motivated by bias against race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia have laws against bias-motivated violence. The Federal Government has had hate crimes statutes since 1968, with the most recent law enacted in 2009. Underreporting impacts hate crimes statistics, hindering prevention efforts. Studies show a sharp increase in hate crimes over the past year. The increase in hate crimes has been significant, with over 900 new incidents reported since November 2016. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights noted a 6.7-percent rise in reported hate crimes in 2016, one of the largest increases in over a decade. White supremacists and rightwing extremist groups were responsible for the most deaths in domestic terror incidents between 2000 and 2016, posing a continuing lethal threat. In February 2017, a White supremacist shot at two Indian men in Kansas. The increase in hate crimes has been significant, with over 900 new incidents reported since November 2016.
