    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nurses for Under-Resourced Schools Everywhere Act\" or the \"NURSE Act\". The National Association of School Nurses and the American Academy of Pediatrics recognize the vital role of school nurses in providing comprehensive health services to students. School nurses act as leaders in promoting wellness, disease prevention, and academic achievement for children. School nurses play a crucial role in improving health outcomes for children by providing early intervention services like vision, hearing, and dental assessments to remove barriers to learning. The American Federation of Teachers advocates for a nurse in every school to address various health needs and enhance student learning. However, national data shows that only 45% of public schools have a full-time nurse, while 30% have a part-time nurse. The National Association of School Nurses highlights medication administration as a common health-related activity in schools. The National Center for Education Statistics reports that 15 to 18 percent of students in school have chronic health conditions, leading to an increased need for preventive services and interventions. School nurses are actively involved in addressing social, emotional, and medical factors to support academic success. In 2013, 7.6% of children under 19, totaling 78 million, were uninsured, leading to lower educational outcomes and health disparities. Over 1.6 million children experience homelessness annually in the US. Homeless children in the US face increased rates of health conditions and developmental challenges, with schools serving as their primary access to healthcare. School nurses play a crucial role in addressing health concerns, reducing school days lost to diseases, and improving immunization rates. A 2011 study highlighted the time-saving impact of having a school nurse on staff. Having a school nurse on staff can save principals, teachers, and clerical staff time each day, totaling about 13 hours in savings for school personnel. Increasing the number of school nurses can save school personnel time each day. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"elementary school\", \"local educational agency\", \"secondary school\", and \"State educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"acuity\" refers to the level of a patient's sickness influencing the need for nursing care. An \"eligible entity\" is defined as a local educational agency with at least 20 percent of children eligible for the school lunch program. The term \"high-need local educational agency\" refers to a local educational agency serving a minimum of 15,000 eligible children or where at least 40 percent of children are eligible for a specific program. A \"nurse\" is defined as a registered nurse according to State law. The Secretary of Education will award demonstration grants to eligible entities to increase the number of school nurses in public elementary and secondary schools. The grants may include hiring a school nurse to serve schools in multiple districts. Workload for a nurse is defined as the time taken to provide care and complete tasks. The Secretary of Education will award demonstration grants to eligible entities to increase the number of school nurses in public elementary and secondary schools. Eligible entities receiving grants must use the funds to award subgrants to local education agencies and reserve up to 10% for statewide health activities. Applications for grants must be submitted to the Secretary with required information. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications from high-need educational agencies or consortia showing the greatest need for additional nursing services in public schools. The Federal share of a grant under this section shall not exceed 75 percent for each year of the grant and shall decrease for each succeeding year to ensure continuity of increased hiring of school nurses using State or local sources. The grant under this section can be funded by State or local sources, private organizations, or a combination. The Secretary may waive the non-Federal share for entities facing economic hardship. A report on the program's effectiveness must be submitted to Congress within 2 years of the grant being awarded to a local educational agency. The program aims to increase the number of school nurses and assess the impact on students' health and academic performance. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2017 through 2021."
