    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Jobs, On-the-Job 'Earn While You Learn' Training, and Apprenticeships for African-American Young Men Act\". Congress finds that African-American young men ages 18 to 39 have an unemployment rate of 41 percent nationally, reaching over 50 percent in some areas. This high unemployment rate negatively impacts family structures and is deemed a national tragedy. The purpose of the Act is to provide jobs, on-the-job training, and apprenticeships for this demographic. The Act aims to provide jobs, training, and apprenticeships for African-American young men aged 18 to 39 to work on rebuilding the Nation's infrastructure in cities and communities. The Act urges employment, on-the-job training, and apprenticeships for unemployed African-American young men to help rebuild the nation's crumbling infrastructure. The Secretary of Labor is required to request labor unions, contractors, and businesses involved in rebuilding infrastructure to actively recruit and provide training to African-American men aged 18 to 39. Assistance will be provided to coordinate recruitment and training efforts. The Secretary of Labor is required to coordinate with labor unions and associations involved in infrastructure rebuilding, including IBEW, UA, Iron Workers Union, Teamsters, NECA, SMART, LIUNA, IUOE, and USW, along with the National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee. The National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee allows apprentices to earn while they learn. Labor unions, general contractors, and businesses are required to recruit African-American young men for jobs and apprenticeships by seeking assistance from various African-American organizations. African-American organizations play a crucial role in recruiting unemployed African-American young men for apprenticeships, helping to improve their lives. The Sense of Congress is that this Act will help rebuild the nation's infrastructure while creating jobs and providing job training for African-American young men, equipping them with technical skills and making them competitive in the job market. It also exemplifies the high nobility of purpose of the nation."
