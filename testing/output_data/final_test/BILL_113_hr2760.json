    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Panama Canal and Pan-Pacific Exhibition Centennial Celebration Act\". The Panama Canal, built between 1890 and 1914, was a significant engineering feat led by President Theodore Roosevelt. It connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, saving sailors a dangerous 8,000-mile journey. The 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco commemorated the completion of the Panama Canal and the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the Pacific Ocean. The event featured the issuance of five different coins by the United States Mint, including the first coins to bear the motto \"In God We Trust\". The Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 featured the issuance of five different coins by the United States Mint, including a silver Panama-Pacific half dollar and four gold coins in various denominations. The largest coin authorized by Congress was a unique $50 octagonal gold piece, marking the centennial of the event and the opening of the Panama Canal. Proceeds from the sale of these commemorative coins supported educational programs of the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
