    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Drug Addiction Treatment Expansion Act of 2003\". The Congress acknowledges the devastating impact of opiate addiction on individuals, families, and society, including health risks like HIV/AIDS. Heroin abuse is increasing among younger populations, with a significant rise in treatment admissions between 1992 and 2000. The percentage of new heroin users under age 25 admitted for treatment grew from 30 to 41 percent between 1992 and 2000. Injection as the route of administration increased from 48 to 63 percent among users aged 18 to 24 during the same period. Between 81 and 86 percent of new heroin users reported daily heroin use since 1992, with many also abusing cocaine and marijuana. Emergency room visits related to narcotic pain medication abuse rose significantly from 2000 to 2002. The Nation aims to reduce drug addiction costs and increase access to treatment through educational efforts and expanding treatment options and capacity. The National Institute on Drug Abuse is focused on developing new therapies for addiction to reach more people and enhance treatment availability. Congress recognizes the importance of expanding addiction treatment options and capacity. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA law) allows qualified practitioners to prescribe addiction treatment medications from their office settings for up to 30 patients. A new treatment option approved by the FDA is now available for practitioners to prescribe, thanks to Congress and the Federal Government's commitment to reducing the impact of drug addiction. The DATA law's 30-patient limit on group practices is impacting practitioners negatively, as it restricts their ability to effectively serve patients. Congress did not intend for the quality of care to decrease in group practices, which are a common mode of healthcare delivery in the US. The DATA law's 30-patient limit on group practices is impacting practitioners negatively, restricting their ability to provide addiction treatment to patients who need it, contrary to the law's intended purpose. The Controlled Substance Act is amended to eliminate the 30-patient limit for group practices providing maintenance or detoxification treatment with certain narcotic drugs."
