The United States has vital interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, maintaining a force of approximately 25,000 military personnel there. The current regime in Iran's policies, including terrorism and pursuit of military hegemony, are against US interests. Iran is aggressively pursuing ballistic missile technology. Iran is acquiring technologies to build ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, posing a threat to US national security. The President declared a state of emergency due to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Iran may have the capability to strike US forces in the Middle East within one to two years. Iran is acquiring missile systems and technology from abroad, developing two ballistic missile systems. The US intelligence community confirms Iran's progress with assistance from nations like Russia. Current missile defenses are not equipped to handle the growing threat posed by Iran's advancing missile production capabilities. The current theater missile defense plans of the Department of Defense are inadequate to counter the evolving Iranian ballistic missile threat. The Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) and Navy Area Defense systems have limited capability, while more advanced systems like THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide are not scheduled for deployment in time to address the imminent threat. The Iranian missile threat is expected to mature, and it is crucial to minimize the vulnerability of US forces, allies, and friends to this threat. The immediate national response to the emerging Iranian missile threat is required in the highest national interest of the United States. Determination of the extent of Russian cooperation with ballistic missile activities of Iran is crucial. The Secretary of Defense will discuss with Russia to obtain information on Russian cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile development. The Secretary must certify to Congress that Russia is cooperating fully before obligating funds for ballistic missile defense projects in Fiscal Year 1998.
