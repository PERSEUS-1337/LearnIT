    "content": "The Y-learner is developed for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. It leverages neural networks to optimize multiple objectives and update continually, improving pooling of feature information between treatment and control groups. The Y-learner is evaluated on three test problems, achieving state-of-the-art results on two tasks and the second-best on the third task. It focuses on estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) in randomized experiments and observational studies. CATE estimation is crucial for understanding causal mechanisms and personalizing treatments at an individual level. It is widely used in various disciplines like political science, medicine, and economics. Recent research has introduced the X-learner and U-learner as meta-learners for CATE estimation, utilizing Random Forests and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees as base learners. This has led to significant advancements in the field. Recent advancements in CATE estimation have introduced the R-learner, which shows excellent performance when parameterized by deep neural networks. The paper also presents a \"quasi-oracle\" regret bound for non-parametric regression problems. The question arises whether a more efficient neural network architecture can be designed for CATE estimation, aiming to improve performance beyond existing constraints. Deep neural networks offer unique advantages for CATE estimation, allowing for continual optimization and asynchronous training with multiple objectives. This approach, exemplified by the Y-learner, achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal data. Code for experiments will be available upon publication. In a randomized experiment, population members with common features respond to treatment. Potential outcomes Y i (0) and Y i (1) represent responses with and without treatment. An example is measuring the impact of college on future income. Individuals who go to college are expected to earn more in the future. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) measures the overall impact of college on future earnings, but it cannot provide personalized recommendations or account for selection bias. To offer more tailored advice, the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is needed, although it is challenging to estimate for each individual. To estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) for individuals, strong assumptions like Ignorability and Overlap are necessary to address selection bias and ensure no unique identifiers determine treatment assignment. These assumptions, though stringent, are crucial for progress in estimating CATE. Assuming individuals under 18 are in the control group, strong assumptions like Ignorability and Overlap are standard in randomized experiments. These assumptions, along with regularity conditions, help identify the CATE. To estimate the CATE, we calculate treatment response functions \u00b5 0 and \u00b5 1 and then subtract them. Different strategies like the T-Learner can be used to estimate the CATE. The T-Learner estimates treatment effects directly with a function approximator. However, it lacks efficiency as it does not share information between treatment and control estimators. In contrast, the S-Learner aims to be more efficient by sharing information across estimators using a single function approximator. The U-Learner considers the main treatment effect function and treatment propensity to estimate the CATE. The R-Learner, an extension of the U-Learner, provides regularization and breaks estimation into a two-step process. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and uses imputed treatment effects to transfer information between treatment and control. The learner utilizes control estimators on treatment data to produce imputed treatment effects. The correct way to impute treatment effect estimates is by using control estimators on treatment data. This method allows for estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Various works focus on developing better CATE estimation strategies and using neural networks for causal effect estimation. Additionally, domain adaptation using causal inference is explored to handle shifts caused by measurements taken in different contexts. In BID9, neural networks and domain adaptation are used for counterfactual inference. BID12 utilizes deep latent variable models to handle confounders. BID0 draws parallels between causal inference and multi-task learning. An Integral Probability Metric based algorithm is developed in ) for measuring the ITE. The Y-learner was developed to address deficiencies in the X-learner, which estimates outcome functions and individual treatment effects. Estimators for the CATE are derived by regressing features X on imputed treatment effects. In the X-learner paper, random forests were used to obtain estimates \u03bc 0 and \u03bc 1. Using neural networks instead, f \u03b80 and f \u03b81 estimate \u00b5 0 and \u00b5 1. Jointly optimizing f \u03c4 and f \u03b8i is recommended when using neural networks for the second stage. Neural networks allow for backpropagation through the network f \u03b80 and f \u03b81. This is not possible with random forests, as they are fixed once trained. The joint optimization strategy involves training imputation networks and CATE estimation networks concurrently on the same data. The Y-learner consistently outperformed the X-learner, attributed to backpropagating through f \u03b81 and f \u03b80. The Y-learner outperformed the X-learner by backpropagating through f \u03b81 and f \u03b80. Continuous co-learning of f \u03b80, f \u03b81, and f \u03c4 may improve training in CATE estimation networks. In co-learning networks, the learning rate is crucial to prevent instability. In certain imitation learning algorithms, a critic network guides the agent while an action network executes the actions. However, training a new action network from a fully trained critic network often fails. An experiment was conducted to test the effect of co-learning on the Y-learner, which involved running 4 learners on a simulated dataset. The Y-learner with full backpropagation outperformed the X-learner, suggesting continuous co-learning may enhance training in CATE estimation networks. The Y-learner experiments involved training multiple learners with different approaches, including Y-learner with no backpropagation, completing training, and no co-learning. The results showed that co-learning is crucial for the Y-learner's performance, with further research needed for definitive conclusions. The Y-learner experiments involved training multiple learners with different approaches to estimate the CATE on synthetic data benchmarks. The Y-learner showed the best performance on certain simulations and required the least data to learn a good CATE estimate. The S-learner is the cheapest option for CATE estimation, requiring half the compute of the T-learner. The R-learner takes significantly longer due to its two-step estimation procedure. The experiment measures the impact of social pressure on voter turnout in US elections using MNIST digits to determine treatment effects. Traditional CATE estimation strategies were not effective in this task. The Y-learner, designed for CATE estimation using neural networks, outperforms other learners on benchmark tasks. It utilizes neural networks' optimization abilities and a co-learning strategy. Results on the MNIST task show the Y-learner's superior performance compared to other learners.
