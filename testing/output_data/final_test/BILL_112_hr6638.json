    "content": "The Act titled \"Supporting Access to Formulated and Effective Compounded Drugs Act of 2012\" or \"S.A.F.E. Compounded Drugs Act of 2012\" enhances requirements for compounded drugs. The \"S.A.F.E. Compounded Drugs Act of 2012\" amends Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include requirements for compounded drugs, such as prescriber notification before providing a prescription order. The \"S.A.F.E. Compounded Drugs Act of 2012\" requires prescribers to inform patients about compounded drugs and provide written information on their availability, safety, and production. Pharmacists must confirm patient awareness when dispensing compounded drugs. Prior to providing a health care service involving a compounded drug, the health care provider must inform the patient about the use of the drug and ensure that the patient understands it is a compounded drug. The drug used during the procedure must be clearly labeled as a 'non-FDA approved compounded drug product'. The Secretary will establish labeling requirements in consultation with a temporary advisory committee. The Secretary will establish a registration process for pharmacies to become compounding pharmacies, in consultation with stakeholders. The registration process for compounding pharmacies will be conducted electronically. Pharmacy owners must submit contact information, state licenses, compounding methods, and any additional information required by the Secretary. The Secretary may require compounding pharmacies to report the quantity of products compounded to prevent drug manufacturing facilities from registering as compounding pharmacies inappropriately. Pharmacies with fewer than 20 full-time employees and operating within a single state are exempt from registration. The Secretary will establish a database for tracking compounding pharmacy information. The Secretary will establish and maintain a database of information on pharmacies compounding drug products in multiple states, including minimum licensing standards, information from state regulatory agencies, and other relevant details. The database will be accessible to state agencies and enable tracking of compounding pharmacy information. The Secretary will establish minimum standards for safe production of compounded drug products, including determining which drugs must meet these standards based on intended route of administration and sterility. The standards will be used to inform federal inspection and oversight of compounding pharmacies. The Secretary will conduct regional training for State agencies on minimum standards, inspection protocol, and recordkeeping for compounding pharmacies. Deadlines for issuing regulations are set at 18 months after enactment of the Act. Advisory committees will be established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will issue regulations to implement sections of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to compounded drug products. An advisory committee on labeling will be established to consult on the development of these regulations, with membership including representatives of patients or consumers. The advisory committee on labeling for compounded drug products will include representatives of patients, healthcare providers, compounding pharmacies, state agencies, and experts in communicating drug information. The committee must hold an initial meeting within 6 months and submit recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish an advisory committee on the database described in section 503A(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The committee will be consulted in the development of regulations for compounded drug products. The advisory committee for compounded drug products will include representatives of patients, healthcare providers, compounding pharmacies, state regulatory agencies, and IT experts. The committee will hold an initial meeting within 6 months of enactment and submit recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services within 12 months. The committee will terminate upon submission of recommendations. The Secretary will convene the Advisory Committee on Pharmacy Compounding to address safety and availability of compounded drug products. The committee will terminate upon submitting recommendations. SEC. 3. REPORTS AND STUDIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to submit biannual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Act's requirements. Additionally, a report on third-party accreditation for compounding pharmacies must be submitted within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress on the structure of State oversight of compounding pharmacies and how it impacts regulations for safe drug products. The Comptroller General will review the extent to which Federal health care programs ensure the safety of compounded drug products. The Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b) requires compounded drug products paid for by Federal health care programs to comply with FDA requirements. It also evaluates reimbursement rates and encourages the use of compounded drugs over marketed ones. SEC. 4. PROHIBITIONS AND PENALTIES. Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit violations of Section 503A and imposes penalties for violations related to compounded drug products, including fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years for intentional fraud or risk of harm."
