    "content": "The \"Access to Complete Education Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by adding a new part for core curriculum development, including grants authorization. The section aims to enhance education reform by strengthening the instruction of various subjects in elementary and secondary schools through grants awarded by the Secretary to local educational agencies. Priority is given to agencies with greater need. The Secretary prioritizes local educational agencies with higher numbers of children from low-income families for grants to enhance instruction in specified subjects. Funds can be used to increase instructional time, align curriculum with state standards, provide materials, partner with organizations for student learning, and offer professional development. The Secretary requires local educational agencies receiving assistance to coordinate projects with cultural agencies and use funds to supplement existing assistance, not replace it. Local educational agencies receiving funds under this section must provide the Secretary with an evaluation at the end of each fiscal year. The evaluation should include a description of programs, data on curriculum and partnerships, time spent on grant subjects, and any other information required by the Secretary. The Secretary may require additional information for evaluations. Evaluations are used for program improvement. The Secretary must consult with relevant agencies and educators. Authorized appropriations for grants are specified for fiscal years 2010-2014. Authorized appropriations for grants are specified for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with $450,000,000 allocated for 2014 and $500,000,000 for 2015. Certain provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 are amended accordingly."
