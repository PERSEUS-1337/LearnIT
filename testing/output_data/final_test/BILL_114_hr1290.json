The volume of crude oil transported by rail has significantly increased, with more than 2.5 million gallons being transported across the country at any given time. In 2013, more oil was spilled from freight traffic than in the previous four decades combined, leading to catastrophes in communities like Minnesota. In various incidents across different locations, significant amounts of crude oil spilled from derailed cars, causing fires, explosions, and evacuations. Notable examples include Lac-Meegantic, Canada in July 2013, North Dakota in December 2013, Virginia in March 2014, and West Virginia in February 2015. The transport derailed, causing fires and explosions, endangering the water supply, and displacing hundreds of residents. Hazardous materials like crude oil must be properly classified for transportation, labeled as either PG I or PG II due to mislabeling practices. The Bakken region's crude oil is more volatile and flammable than other types, classified as PG I or PG II for transportation. The North Dakota Petroleum Council recommends labeling it as PG I hazardous material. Bakken oil accounts for 12% of domestic production. The NTSB is concerned about the risks of transporting large volumes of crude oil or flammable liquids on trains, recommending routes that avoid populated areas for safety and security. Study on impact of diverting certain freight rail to avoid urban areas. The Secretary of Transportation will arrange for a study by the Transportation Research Board on rerouting freight rail traffic with hazardous materials away from urban areas. The study will assess the benefits of using alternate routes and constructing new ones to improve health and safety in urban areas. The Secretary of Transportation will arrange for a study by the Transportation Research Board on rerouting freight rail traffic with hazardous materials away from urban areas. The study will assess the benefits, feasibility, and costs of alternative routes and new constructions to enhance health and safety in urban areas. The Secretary will request a report from the Board to Congress within 21 months of the enactment of the Act. Definitions for hazardous material and urban area are provided, and $850,000 is authorized for carrying out the Act."
