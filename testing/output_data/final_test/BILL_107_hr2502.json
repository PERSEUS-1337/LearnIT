ENVIRONMENTAL TAX CREDIT allows small business refiners to expense 75 percent of qualified costs for complying with Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur regulations.

A small business refiner is defined as a refiner meeting certain criteria. The term 'refiner' refers to a company with less than 1,500 employees and a capacity of less than 155,000 barrels per day. 'Qualified capital costs' include expenses for complying with EPA regulations for producing low sulfur diesel fuel. The term 'applicable EPA regulations' refers to the Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency. The 'applicable period' starts from the enactment of this section and ends one year after complying with the EPA regulations. A credit under this section for qualified capital costs reduces the basis of the property. Certification is required for the credit.

The application for certification should include relevant information for the Secretary to determine compliance. The small business refiner must obtain certification from the Secretary, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, for qualified capital costs necessary for compliance with EPA regulations.

The tax of a refiner under this chapter may be increased by an amount equal to the product of the applicable recapture percentage and the aggregate decrease in credits allowed under section 38 for prior taxable years. The applicable recapture percentage is determined from a specific table. The applicable recapture percentage for recapture events occurring in different years is outlined in a specific table, starting at 100% in Year 1 and decreasing to 0% in Years 6 and thereafter. The recapture event is defined as the failure to comply with EPA regulations, cessation of operation producing low sulfur diesel, or change in ownership of the facility by a small business refiner. The recapture liability can be assumed by the person acquiring an interest in the facility from a small business refiner, making them responsible for any recapture liability as if there had been no change in ownership.

Any increase in tax under this subsection shall not be treated as a tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining the amount of any credit under subpart A, B, or D of this part.
