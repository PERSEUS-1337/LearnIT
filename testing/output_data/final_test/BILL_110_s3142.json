Congress finds that over 25,000 women in the US experience stillbirth annually, with common causes including genetic abnormalities, umbilical cord accidents, infections, and placental problems. Risk factors such as maternal age, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and previous stillbirth are identified. Good prenatal care, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and monitoring fetal activity starting at 28 weeks are recommended strategies to reduce the risk of stillbirth. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the leading cause of sudden, unexpected infant deaths in the United States, accounting for half of the more than 4,500 cases each year. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, determined after ruling out all known causes through a thorough examination of the death scene, clinical history review, and autopsy. Inaccurate classification of cause and manner of death hinders prevention efforts and understanding of related risk factors. Death certificate data is limited in characterizing sudden, unexpected infant deaths and identifying preventable risk factors. Enhancing public health activities related to stillbirth by establishing a national registry and public health programs. The Secretary will develop a standard definition of stillbirth and a protocol for data collection and surveillance, including enhancing the National Vital Statistics System and expanding population-based surveillance efforts. The Secretary will establish a national registry for stillbirths in consultation with various organizations and experts to collect comprehensive epidemiologic information. The Secretary will establish a national registry for stillbirths to collect data on root causes, rates, and trends, and implement public education and prevention programs. The registry will facilitate data collection, analysis, and dissemination, develop protocols for thorough investigation of stillbirth, and identify trends and risk factors for further study. The Secretary will develop public education and prevention programs to increase awareness of stillbirths and identify risk factors for further study. The Secretary will develop public education and prevention programs to increase awareness of stillbirths and identify risk factors for further study. Additionally, there will be tools developed for educating health professionals and pregnant women about early-warning signs of stillbirth, such as monitoring fetal movement. Authorization of appropriations is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2010 through 2013. SEC. 1124. NATIONAL REGISTRY FOR SUDDEN UNEXPECTED INFANT DEATHS.

In this section, the term 'sudden, unexpected infant deaths' (SUID) refers to infant deaths with no obvious cause, not due to chronic disease or known illness, unexpected, and require further examination. The Secretary, in collaboration with health organizations, will establish a population-based SUID case registry. The national registry established under subsection (b) will collect data on infant deaths through thorough investigations and standardized information on various factors. The curr_chunk discusses promoting standardized protocols for investigating SUID deaths, establishing a classification system for SIDS and SUID, supporting infant death reviews, and improving public reporting of SUID data. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out standardized protocols for investigating SUID deaths and improving public reporting of SUID data."
