The election was held two years ahead of schedule due to the collapse of the PiS-led government. The rightist Law and Justice (PiS) party, ruling with smaller parties, dissolved in 2007 after internal issues. PiS called early elections but faced strong opposition, leading to a high voter turnout of 55.3%. Unprecedented voter participation, especially among young people, played a key role in the 2007 elections in Poland. PiS received more votes than in 2005, mainly at the expense of its former coalition partners. The increase in PiS votes was overshadowed by a 15% rise in turnout. Tusk's party won 209 seats, forming a majority in parliament with the Polish Peasants Party. Tusk became Prime Minister in November 2007, but may face resistance from President Lech Kaczynski. The 2007 elections in Poland saw a tug-of-war between the liberal and conservative factions, with PiS focusing on exposing former communist elites. PiS's conduct during the campaign was criticized for abusing power and dominating state media. During the 2007 elections in Poland, PiS resorted to blatant abuse of power by dominating state television and using confidential police files to smear rivals. Tusk criticized the government, stating that Poles feel ashamed for the last two years. The ruling party, PO, is expected to differ in style rather than content from the outgoing regime, with potential disagreements with coalition partner PSL on domestic and international issues. Poland's economy has been successful among transition economies in east central Europe. Poland's economy has seen rapid development with GDP growth of 6.2% in 2006, around 6.6% in 2007, and a predicted rise of 5.2% in 2008. Joblessness has decreased to 11.4% in December 2007, attributed to improved job prospects and emigration of 1-2 million Polish workers. The ruling party, PiS, had somewhat statist economic policies, advocating for the identification and support of \"national champions\" in certain sectors. PiS aims to reverse the previous government's labor code reforms. Economic policy is not a top priority for PiS due to positive indicators. PO is seen as \"business-friendly\" and plans to cut subsidies, focus on education, and reduce tax brackets. They also plan to privatize state-owned enterprises and appoint competent managers. The PO party in Poland will maintain some policies from the previous government, such as reducing dependence on Russian energy supplies. They are also considering privatization in the energy sector and exploring joint nuclear power projects with the Baltic states. Poland has contributed troops to the U.S.-led operation in Iraq, which is providing valuable military experience, but is unpopular at home. Poland's presence in Iraq is unpopular at home, with 85% opposition to the deployment. Despite 21 Polish soldiers dying in Iraq, the government requested to extend the 900-troop presence until October 2008 before withdrawing them. Additionally, Poland has 1200 soldiers in Afghanistan, with plans to dispatch an additional 400 despite public disapproval. Poland has benefited economically from EU membership since 2004, particularly in agriculture, but was assertive in various issues before joining the EU. Poland's assertiveness in various issue areas before and after joining the EU, particularly under the PiS government, led to clashes with fellow EU member states on issues such as energy, banking rules, voting rights, the death penalty, and Russia. Poland's stance during negotiations over the EU reform treaty drew strong criticism, with Jean-Claude Junker calling it 'very near to having been unacceptable.' There was political backlash in Poland as Poles became increasingly aware of the government's behavior. The PiS government faced political backlash in Poland as Poles realized the benefits of EU membership. Prime Minister Tusk plans to consult more with EU members, but Poland will still defend its interests. The new government will negotiate budget reform and seek to maintain subsidies, but will be more cautious in vetoing EU decisions. Poland aims to engage more internationally under the new government. Prime Minister Tusk plans to enhance regional cooperation with the EU, Weimar Triangle, and Visegrad Group. Poland may collaborate on energy with Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. Tusk will also visit South America in 2008. Under the previous government, Poland's relations with Germany and Russia were strained, especially over gas supply issues and the Russo-German gas pipeline agreement. During the 2005 presidential campaign, Lech Kaczynski promised a \"firm but friendly\" relationship with Russia and highlighted the devastation caused by Germany in World War II. In 2006, he canceled a summit meeting after Germany refused to apologize for a satirical article about him. Prime Minister Tusk aimed to improve relations with Germany by meeting with Chancellor Merkel and appointing Wladyslaw Bartoszewski as an advisor. Bilateral issues, including a proposed pipeline, are still unresolved. The new Polish government under Tusk aims to improve relations with Russia through cooperation rather than confrontation. Recent actions, such as dropping objections to Russia joining the OECD and Russia lifting restrictions on Polish meat imports, signal a positive shift. Poland has historically been a close ally of the United States, supporting the global war on terrorism and contributing troops to U.S.-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Poland has cooperated with the United States on various issues such as democratization, nuclear proliferation, and human rights. Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski's visit to Washington was described as friendly, but later Tusk criticized Kaczynski for being too servile towards the US. Tusk expressed hope for better cooperation with the US, particularly in regards to the Iraq conflict and missile defense negotiations with the Bush Administration in 2007. Poland's cooperation with the United States includes discussions on missile defense, with concerns over potential threats from rogue states and terrorist attacks. Former Defense Minister Sikorski sought security guarantees and Patriot missiles for protection. President Kaczynski indicated support for a missile defense agreement, drawing criticism for potentially overlooking Poland's interests. Prime Minister Tusk later showed hesitation towards the plan, suggesting a possible delay in implementation. On February 2, 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Rice expressed support for strengthening Poland's air defenses during a visit by Foreign Minister Sikorski to Washington, D.C. Despite some agreement on missile defense, it is unlikely that a formal accord will be signed during Prime Minister Tusk's upcoming visit to the United States in March. Some Poles feel their loyalty to the U.S. has not been adequately rewarded, hoping for increased military assistance and changes to the visa policy. Poles must pay a $100 fee and undergo an interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate, requirements waived for most western European countries under the Visa Waiver Program."
