Final regulations must be issued within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Nursing Home Staffing Act of 2003 mandates the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish minimum staffing standards for nursing facilities within a year of enactment.

If compliance with these ratios is not feasible within two years, the Secretary has the authority to delay facility compliance.

The HHS minimum nurse staffing ratios must meet standards, with individuals not counted for non-direct nursing care activities. The minimum staffing levels for nurse ratios in nursing homes are outlined in a report to Congress, requiring specific hours of care per resident per day by certified nurse aides and licensed nurses. The minimum staffing levels for nurse ratios in nursing homes are outlined in a report to Congress, requiring 0.55 to 0.75 hours of care per resident per day by a registered nurse.
