    "content": "The \"End Discriminatory State Taxes for Automobile Renters Act of 2007\" aims to prohibit tax discrimination by states or localities against vehicle rental, providing a remedy for such actions. The term \"assessment\" refers to property valuation for tax purposes, while \"assessment jurisdiction\" is the geographical area used for determining property value. \"Commercial and industrial property\" excludes agricultural land and is subject to property tax. A \"discriminatory tax\" includes taxes that discriminate against vehicle rental. The tax on renting motor vehicles is considered discriminatory if it exceeds the tax rate applied to the majority of other tangible personal property rentals in the same state or locality. This tax discrimination applies when the tax is imposed solely on vehicle rental businesses and not on the majority of other commercial and industrial taxpayers within the same area. A tax discriminates against motor vehicle rental property if it exceeds the tax rate applied to the majority of other commercial and industrial taxpayers within the same state or locality. This discrimination also occurs when the assessed value of motor vehicle rental property is higher compared to other commercial and industrial properties in the same assessment jurisdiction. The terms \"Local\" and \"Locality\" refer to a political subdivision with the authority to impose taxes. \"Motor vehicle\" is defined as in title 49 of the United States Code. Other commercial and industrial taxpayers are individuals or entities engaged in business within a state or locality and subject to taxation. The rental of motor vehicles involves the exclusive use of a vehicle for up to 180 days for a fee, including vehicles with or without a driver but excluding taxi cab services. The term \"State\" encompasses states, the District of Columbia, territories, possessions, and governmental entities or representatives. The term \"tax\" refers to any charge required by law to be paid to a State or Locality, excluding charges related to concession agreements at federally-assisted airports or motor vehicle registration, licensing, or inspection. The term \"tax base\" refers to the measure to which a tax rate is applied, while the term \"tax rate generally applicable to other commercial and industrial taxpayers\" means the lower of the rate imposed on the majority or the average rate at which the tax is imposed. SEC. 4 prohibits discriminatory taxes on motor vehicle rentals. SEC. 5 outlines remedies. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to prevent violations of the Act. The burden of proof is on the party seeking relief, and relief against a tax violating the Act involves striking the tax entirely. In cases of violation of Section 4, the court may strike the tax entirely unless it meets specific criteria. The burden of proof lies with the State or Locality imposing the tax. An action to enforce the Act can only be brought by a person who rents motor vehicles to another person. A person engaged in renting motor vehicles can only bring a lawsuit against the State or Locality for discriminatory taxes. The Act does not allow Congress to approve State or Local taxes that would otherwise be prohibited. The provisions of this Act, effective on May 23, 2007, exclude discriminatory taxes unless certain conditions are met."
