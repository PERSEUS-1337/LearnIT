    "content": "China, officially known as the People's Republic of China (PRC), is developing a powerful military with the ability to operate beyond its immediate borders. The United States is grappling with how to respond to China's military modernization, which could impact defense strategy, budgets, and the defense industry. This report offers a brief overview of the Chinese military, omitting some details for brevity. For a more detailed discussion on China's naval modernization, refer to CRS Report RL33153. The curr_chunk provides a detailed discussion of China's naval modernization effort, listing various CRS reports on related topics. China's military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is organized into four services for ground, naval, air, and missile forces, along with the Strategic Support Force responsible for logistics, space, cyber capabilities, and information technology development. The information is based on open-source data from sources like Chinese defense white papers, U.S. Department of Defense reports, and international reference sources. China's PLA is primarily composed of ground forces, with plans to reduce troops by 300,000 which may shift leadership ratios towards naval and air forces. The PLA has limited recent combat experience, with its last major conflict being the short war with Vietnam in 1979. China does not have military allies and also maintains the People's Armed Police Force as a paramilitary police force. China's People's Armed Police Force (PAP) is a paramilitary police force focused on internal security, while a citizen \"militia\" supports the PLA during war. The PLA's allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party is overseen by the Central Military Commission (CMC), chaired by Xi Jinping. The Ministry of National Defense manages PLA interactions with foreign militaries. Major reforms to the PLA's organization were outlined in late 2015 and early 2016. China outlined major reforms to the organization of the PLA in late 2015 and early 2016. The reforms aim to rationalize force structure, improve joint command, centralize administrative authority under the CMC, increase oversight to eliminate corruption, and enhance the military education system. The far-reaching changes indicate a desire to address deep-rooted problems within China's defense system. The timing of the reforms suggests that Chinese leaders view the external security environment as stable enough to allow for internal disorganization during implementation. China divides its territory into five large Theater Commands. The PLA underwent major organizational reforms in late 2015 and early 2016 to improve joint operations and centralize administrative authority. The new Theater Commands, each covering at least three provinces or autonomous regions, focus on integrating inter-service operations and emphasize high-technology, networked forces with naval and air power projection. China's transformation of the PLA reflects a shift towards a more modern and joint operational military structure. The opening and reform of the Chinese economy in 1978 allowed for increased defense spending. Deng Xiaoping prioritized modernization of national defense as one of his \"Four Modernizations.\" China's focus on high-technology military capabilities was influenced by the success of U.S. military operations in Operation Desert Storm. The Taiwan Strait crisis in 1995-1996 highlighted the need for China to develop a modern military. China's military modernization efforts have emphasized quality over quantity, with a focus on upgrading warfighting equipment, personnel systems, and training practices. The PLA is gradually modernizing its forces through a combination of foreign acquisition and indigenous development in all combat domains. China's military modernization efforts in China have focused on quality over quantity, with a decline in total numbers of platforms but an increase in overall capabilities. The ratio of modern to older platforms is steadily increasing, with a significant percentage of fighter aircraft now composed of modern, fourth-generation-and-above fighters. The PLA has also shrunk in personnel size but has made progress in recruiting. The PLA has made progress in recruiting more educated and qualified personnel, aiming to become a modern military capable of securing China's national interests. The main strategic direction of the PLA has been focused on prevailing in military contingencies related to Taiwan since the early 1990s, despite never having controlled the island. China's military modernization is aimed at countering U.S. technological advantages and preventing U.S. military reinforcements in a conflict over Taiwan. The PLA is evolving to improve capabilities in various areas, including information warfare and counterterrorism. China's Military Strategy emphasizes international security cooperation, joint operations, and strategic principles rooted in ancient military strategy and Mao Zedong's teachings. Chinese strategists continue to draw from classic texts like Sun Tzu's The Art of War for guidance in modern warfare. China's Military Strategy emphasizes international security cooperation, joint operations, and strategic principles rooted in ancient military strategy and Mao Zedong's teachings. The principle of \"Active Defense\" guides China's national defense strategy, focusing on not attacking unless provoked but being operationally offensive when under attack. This approach may justify a pre-emptive strike if China's strategic interests are threatened. China's Military Strategy emphasizes international security cooperation and strategic principles rooted in ancient military strategy and Mao Zedong's teachings. The PLA suggests China might carry out a military first strike in response to non-military actions seen as a strategic attack. China asserts a \"no first-use\" doctrine in the nuclear realm but describes its response to a nuclear attack as \"limited nuclear retaliation.\" Observers note this doctrine may change under war pressure, but Chinese leaders appear sincere in promoting it. In 2004, Hu Jintao tasked the military with New Historic Missions, expanding China's security interests to include loyalty to the CCP, defending sovereignty, economic development, and preventing conflict. Xi Jinping is developing a strong military to achieve the \"Chinese Dream\" of a modern and prosperous China, focusing on enhancing the PLA's fighting capabilities. Xi Jinping emphasizes developing the PLA's fighting capabilities as the main goal of military modernization, with a focus on real combat readiness and winning wars. An anti-corruption campaign targets high-level officers to solidify support for Xi's military reform plan, which aims to reinforce loyalty to the CCP. Other reform priorities include accelerating modernization, establishing a joint command system, improving training for real combat conditions, cultivating skilled personnel, and enhancing military oversight through the CMC. China's security is based on global trends and domestic situation. The 2015 defense white paper expects a favorable external environment for several years. Chinese leaders see a \"strategic opportunity\" to increase national strength and influence. However, challenges may arise after 2020, including U.S. attention, threats from Japan, and economic issues. China views the shift towards a multipolar world positively. The 2015 defense white paper highlights China's increasing national strength and international influence, attributing regional instability to the U.S. strategic rebalancing in the Asia-Pacific region. It mentions threats from Japan's remilitarization and offshore neighbors, emphasizing the need for China to safeguard its maritime interests. China's vulnerabilities have grown as its overseas interests expanded, with a focus on energy, sea lines of communication, and assets abroad. Chinese analysts stress the need for a stronger navy to address security challenges, particularly in acquiring natural resources like oil and gas. The 2015 defense white paper highlights the maritime domain as a new focus for military preparation and identifies the proliferation of advanced long-range, precision, smart, unmanned, and stealthy weapons as a continuing security challenge. Outer space and cyberspace are also recognized as decisive battle domains. The white paper emphasizes outer space and cyberspace as crucial battle domains, with China's military modernization efforts raising concerns due to lack of transparency. China's leadership's intentions and strategic goals are key factors in assessing the PLA, which may be influenced by international relations and external pressures. China's military modernization efforts are influenced by international relations and external pressures. The PRC government aims to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity while building a powerful armed forces. Xi Jinping has expressed intentions to increase PLA's international cooperation activities. In a speech at China's 2015 military parade, Jinping emphasized China's peaceful intentions and denial of seeking hegemony or expansion. However, some believe China's security strategy involves military force beyond national defense, with a focus on ensuring the Communist Party's power and defending territorial integrity, particularly regarding Taiwan. China aims for Taiwan to eventually unify with mainland China and seeks to become the leading regional power in East Asia through military modernization. China aims to become the leading regional power in East Asia and defend its economic interests, including shipping lanes. Military modernization is seen as a way to shape the regional strategic environment in China's favor and deter negative outcomes on core interests like Taiwan and Tibet. Friction arises from the gap between Beijing's views of territorial possessions and outsiders' perceptions, leading to distrust of Chinese intentions. China aims to unify with Taiwan and consolidate control over islands in the South China Sea, enhancing the PLA's power projection capabilities. This may lead to friction and conflict as China seeks regional hegemony and potentially excludes the US security role in East Asia. Some analysts believe that China aims to dominate East Asia by minimizing US military presence and intimidating smaller neighbors with the PLA's power. There is debate on whether China will also seek global military power by 2050 or continue to focus narrowly on regional security. China aims to focus on defending Chinese interests in strategically important areas, with doubts on achieving global force projection capabilities before 2030. The PLA has improved its capabilities in various domains of warfare, including air, naval, ground, space, and cyber. Concerns arise from the deployment of new defense equipment and technology by the PLA, despite institutional weaknesses. The PLA's modernization efforts in the air domain focus on improving air defenses and developing advanced fighter aircraft. The PLA Air Force is rapidly closing the gap with western air forces in various capabilities, with a shift towards offense in addition to territorial defense. The PLA Air Force is shifting its focus from territorial air defense to offense, aiming to conduct modern, all-weather operations within joint-forces campaigns. Pilot training has become more complex and realistic, with an emphasis on improvisational exercises and training in adverse weather conditions. Despite advancements, China's struggle to develop reliable jet engines hinders overall progress in modernizing the PLAAF. China's PLA Air Force is modernizing with advanced combat aircraft like the J-10, J-11, and Su-30MKK fighters. They are developing fifth-generation stealth fighters, the J-20 and J-31, to improve strike operations and air superiority. The J-15 fighter on aircraft carriers could enhance PLA power projection capabilities. China's PLA Air Force is enhancing its power projection capabilities by modernizing its aircraft fleet, including introducing new AWACS aircraft and investing in UAV platforms. The development of the Y-20 heavy lift aircraft and various unmanned platforms further strengthens China's emerging power projection capabilities. China's PLA Air Force has modernized its aircraft fleet with the introduction of the Y-20 heavy lift aircraft in 2013. The H-6 bomber, a Cold War-era model, has been upgraded to the H-6K variant with extended range and the capacity to carry six land-attack cruise missiles. China is reportedly developing a new long-range bomber. Additionally, the PLA has invested in improving its air defenses by acquiring the Russian S-400 SAM system, which would significantly enhance China's existing air defense capabilities. The PLA Navy (PLAN) is modernizing its maritime forces to enhance China's defense perimeter and nuclear deterrent. They are focusing on quality over fleet size, investing in submarines, surface vessels, aircraft carriers, and anti-ship cruise missiles. The PLAN is also improving its capabilities in carrier-based aviation and joint operations. China's submarine force is a strength of the PLA, with plans to grow its fleet by 2020. The advanced Shang-class SSNs will replace older attack submarines, and the PLAN is developing the Type 095 SSBN for improved anti-surface warfare capabilities. The surface fleet has decreased in size but increased in quality with new guided missile destroyers and frigates. China has introduced new classes of guided missile destroyers and frigates with advanced weapons and sensors, enhancing the PLAN's air-defense and anti-surface warfare capabilities. The Jiangdao-class corvettes also pose a threat to enemy vessels near China's coast. China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, was built on a refurbished hull purchased from Ukraine. China is constructing its own indigenous aircraft carriers while gaining experience in operating them. The Liaoning is expected to play a significant role in training China's carrier capabilities. China is investing in modern cruise missiles like the YJ-18 with a range of 290 nm to enhance its naval power. Experts predict that by 2020, China will have greater quantities of missiles with greater ranges than those of the U.S. Navy. China is on track to achieve quantitative parity or better in surface-to-air missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. China is focusing on modernizing its ground forces by developing small, mobile, multifunctional units for joint operations. The goal is to enhance force capabilities for multi-dimensional, trans-theater, and sustainable operations, emphasizing mobility. The short-term modernization goal is the basic mechanization of the ground forces by 2020, with complete integration of information technology by 2049. China's ground forces are undergoing modernization with a focus on developing small, mobile units for joint operations. The PLA's planned force reductions are expected to come from ground force units with outdated equipment. The majority of group armies consist of infantry, armored, artillery, reconnaissance, and support units. Army aviation units have been expanded in recent years. The PLA has expanded its army aviation units and may establish separate aviation brigades for each group army. China's defense modernization focuses on producing new equipment like tanks, APCs, artillery systems, and air defense artillery systems. The ZTZ-99A main battle tank is one of the largest globally. Despite increased IFVs and APCs, mobility remains a challenge for China's ground forces. The PLA lacks transport helicopters and heavily relies on trains for transportation. Ground forces are preparing for a Taiwan-related contingency with armed attack helicopters and modern platforms. Improved networks, real-time data transmission, advanced air defense assets, and realistic training exercises have enhanced the PLA's amphibious invasion capabilities. However, China lacks the necessary amphibious lift capacity for a large-scale Taiwan island invasion. The PLA's ballistic missile forces, controlled by the PLARF, have improved range, accuracy, and survivability. China is developing and testing new offensive missiles, including hypersonic glide vehicles. China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) is focused on developing and upgrading ballistic missiles, including intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs). They are also working on ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems, with a focus on countering missile defenses. The PLARF possesses over 1,200 SRBMs with conventional warheads, mostly deployed in southeastern China near Taiwan. Additionally, China is developing new SRBMs and medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs). China is developing new SRBMs and MRBMs to enhance its ability to strike regional targets. The DF-21 MRBM with a range of at least 1,750 km is a key component of the PLARF's extended-range strike capability. The DF-21D variant can target moving ships within 1,500 km of China's coast. The PLA is also reportedly developing boost-glide hypersonic missiles to potentially evade enemy missile defense systems. This development is seen as a challenge to U.S. power projection in the Asia-Pacific region and regional powers' attempts to deny PLA air superiority and control of the seas. China's nuclear force structure aligns with a \"minimum deterrence\" strategy, with an estimated arsenal of 200-300 warheads produced before 1991. The PLARF controls China's nuclear weapons, mainly deployed on ICBMs and MRBMs. China has around 50-60 ICBMs armed with MIRV warheads to evade missile defenses. Efforts to develop a reliable SLBM have been ongoing. China's submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) program has seen success in recent years, with the JL-2 SLBM being described as the PLA's first credible sea-based nuclear deterrent in 2015. The reported range of the JL-2 SLBM is 7,400 km. The PLA's space program is rapidly advancing, with the military playing a significant role in developing space assets and counter-space capabilities. Chinese strategists have learned from the U.S. that military power depends on space. China is developing capabilities to disrupt enemy satellites using directed-energy weapons and jammers. They also continue to test anti-satellite systems. Despite recognizing U.S. vulnerability in space, China sees space assets as a force multiplier for military operations. China has around 70 military satellites for various purposes, including secure communications for the PLA. China is developing a limited satellite navigation system called Beidou, expected to be fully operational by 2020 with capabilities comparable to the U.S. GPS. The system will support target positioning, coordinate precision strike weapons, and provide operational support for the PLAAF, PLAN, and PLARF farther from China's borders. China's satellite series provide remote sensing capabilities and are linked with a data relay satellite system for global coverage. China has developed the Shijian series of satellites to enhance its electronic intelligence capacity globally. The PLA's cyber capabilities are crucial for modernization, including disrupting adversary networks for strategic goals. There are debates about the extent of China's military cyber capabilities. China has three types of cyber forces: specialized military network warfare forces in the PLA, PLA-authorized teams of network warfare specialists in government organizations, and non-governmental forces that may be mobilized for network warfare operations. This includes a cyber militia of private-sector personnel and patriotic hackers that the PRC government could direct loosely. The PLA has employed network warfare units since the 1990s and announced in 2003 that it would incorporate these units in all PLA armies. The PLA has specialized military network warfare forces and authorized teams of network warfare specialists. The General Staff Department Third Department had executive authority over cyber espionage before the 2016 organizational reforms. Responsibility for cyber and space capabilities now resides in the PLA Strategic Support Force. Chinese military and non-military entities have conducted large-scale cyber espionage, including stealing U.S. defense contractor data. The U.S. Department of Justice charged five members of the PLA with cyber espionage for commercial gain. Despite progress, the PLA still has weaknesses and limitations that hinder its effectiveness in complex operations overseas. Chinese military analysts believe the PLA is not yet capable of winning a \"local war under informationized conditions.\" The PLA has weaknesses in training, jointness, administration, human capital, force development, and logistics. PLA officers must study CCP pronouncements and show loyalty to the Party. Historically, training and exercises were scripted, lacking honest self-examination. Corrupt officials diverted military resources for personal gain. The PLA has limitations in training, joint operations, and combat experience. They are focused on improving their ability to project power beyond China's immediate periphery. However, challenges with command and control, logistics, and limited inventories of longer-range weapons may hinder their efforts. China's lack of overseas military facilities motivated them to establish a PLA logistics facility in Djibouti. Analyzing Chinese military weaknesses compared to other global militaries may not always be relevant due to different missions. Despite persistent problems, Chinese leaders may judge the PLA capable of performing assigned missions. Weaknesses in logistics and amphibious lift could hinder PLA missions, like invading Taiwan. Air and sea lift capacity are major shortcomings, limiting power projection. Political and economic issues may also constrain the Chinese military, with domestic unrest and economic challenges affecting defense budget and personnel recruitment. China's one-child policy and aging demographic worsen economic challenges and recruitment difficulties for the PLA. China has the second-largest defense budget globally, increasing annually for over two decades. In 2016, China announced a defense budget of $146 billion, with analysts suggesting actual spending is higher. This growth has allowed the PLA to enhance its capabilities significantly. The PLA's modernization and professionalization efforts are driven by a desire to catch up after years of neglect. China's defense spending, roughly 2% of GDP, is in line with other countries but lower than the US, Russia, and South Korea. Analysts believe defense modernization will continue to be secondary to economic development. If defense spending grows faster than GDP, it may indicate a shift in priorities towards the military. China is increasing military priority over other national concerns. Discrepancies in official defense budget versus actual spending have drawn criticism. In 2014, China's military spending exceeded the official budget by at least 20%. Observers note a decreasing gap between actual and official military spending. In 2013, it was argued that China's official defense budget may not accurately reflect actual PLA funding due to various factors such as the lack of a global standard for measuring defense spending and inconsistencies in what is included in the budget. China's under-reporting of defense spending could be a way to downplay concerns about the growth of its military budget. China's defense spending is difficult to accurately value due to centralized state planning and poor accounting practices. The PLA's profits from commercial assets are not included in the official budget, but this source of funding has decreased since the 1990s. The defense budget is split evenly among personnel, training, maintenance, and equipment, with no further breakdown provided by the PLA. Lower per-capita costs in China amplify the budget's spending power compared to developed countries. China's defense budget in comparison to the U.S. is underestimated due to differences in per-capita personnel costs. China aims to develop a self-sufficient defense industry by 2030, rooted in Soviet assistance but reorganized for efficiency. Progress has been seen in space and missile industries, but overall results are mixed. China's defense industry shows mixed results, with notable progress in space and missile sectors but lagging behind in shipbuilding and aircraft industries. There is a trend of incremental improvements rather than true innovation, seen in the need to acquire foreign products like the Liaoning aircraft carrier frame from Ukraine. China's defense production strategy involves producing affordable arms in large quantities and arms that can match foreign counterparts in quality. Technological and scientific capabilities are lacking in most sectors of the defense industry. China's defense industry in China has made progress in some sectors but lags behind in others. China is a major arms exporter, focusing on low-cost, low-tech armored vehicles and aircraft. Civil-military integration (CMI) is a key strategy to boost production capabilities and technological prowess, leveraging civilian resources for military use. Civil-military integration (CMI) in China aims to enhance defense sector competitiveness by involving private companies, but faces obstacles like lack of implementation guidance and entrenched interests. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have advantages hindering private sector involvement, leading to issues like corruption, limited competition, and an inefficient pricing system. China's defense sector faces challenges such as an inefficient pricing system, bureaucratic fragmentation, and restricted access to advanced technologies. Despite these obstacles, progress is being made in missile production, naval shipbuilding, and ground forces weapon systems. China's defense sector is making progress in developing weapon systems close to world standards, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, air defense artillery systems, and artillery pieces. The aviation industry is producing improved versions of older aircraft, large transport aircraft, fighter aircraft with stealth features, and attack helicopters. China augments its military production capabilities with foreign technologies, including engines, electronics, guidance systems, and control systems. Russia remains a significant source for arms, with China purchasing advanced S-400 SAM systems and Su-35 fighter aircraft. Additionally, China is pursuing deals for a jointly designed diesel-electric submarine and IL-76 transport aircraft. China is shifting towards acquiring military sub-systems and components through trade, open sources, and espionage. Reports suggest that espionage, including cyber espionage and collection by Chinese agents, has been effective in obtaining sensitive U.S. technologies. The PLA has focused on defending claimed territory and maintaining power balance in the vicinity since the founding of the PRC. As PLA modernization progresses, it has become more active in Asia and globally, with limited combat campaigns since the Chinese civil war. The PLA has conducted military campaigns in the Korean War, border war with India, and in Vietnam. The main focus of PLA's military planning has been a potential conflict over Taiwan, with a high concentration of forces near Taiwan. The military balance across the Taiwan Strait has been shifting in favor of the PRC. The PLA's defense spending dwarfs the ROC's, making an invasion of Taiwan daunting. Potential US intervention poses challenges for the PLA. Besides Taiwan, tensions on the Korean Peninsula could involve the PLA in a conflict with implications for China's security. The potential for conflict in East Asia includes North Korean nuclear facilities, U.S. military presence near China's border, and territorial disputes between China and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands. Incidents between Chinese and Japanese militaries have raised concerns about a possible military struggle. China uses civilian ships, not PLAN ships, to assert its maritime territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea. The PLA has seized several islands in the South China Sea using force, causing casualties and destroying enemy vessels. The last lethal force incident in the South China Sea was 20 years ago, but the CCG has gained control of features after confrontations. China has built artificial islands in the South China Sea for civilian and military purposes, enhancing its presence in the region. Airstrips on these islands can support military aircraft, and radar installations have been observed. Fighter aircraft and SAMs have been deployed to facilities on the Paracel Islands. The risks of conflict along China's land borders are lower. China and India have unresolved territorial disputes in the Himalayas region, leading to skirmishes between the PLA and Indian military. Beijing is concerned about terrorism and transnational crime spillover from unstable areas in Central Asia and Southeast Asia. The PLA has increased peacekeeping operations and global security activities in the past 15 years, following President Hu Jintao's instruction in 2004 to prepare for new historic missions. These new tasks include counterterrorism, stability maintenance, and emergency response. The PLA has expanded its global presence through peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism efforts. It has sent over 27,000 military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping missions and provided the most peacekeeping personnel among the U.N. Security Council's permanent members. The PLAN has also contributed vessels to combat piracy in the Gulf of Aden since 2008. The PLA has increased its capability for disaster relief operations overseas, with the PLAN operating a hospital ship called the Peace Ark. They have also expanded their military exercises beyond China's immediate vicinity, conducting exercises in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and South China Sea. China has also participated in multilateral military exercises with Russia and Central Asian states. In 2011, China conducted a large-scale evacuation of over 35,000 Chinese citizens from Libya during the uprising against Muammar al Qadhafi, marking the PLA's first operational deployment to Africa and the Mediterranean. In March 2015, PLA vessels evacuated hundreds of Chinese and foreign nationals from Yemen. The U.S. and Chinese militaries engage in various interactions to pursue security objectives and support bilateral diplomacy. The main U.S. objectives include building sustained dialogue, practical cooperation, and reducing accident risks. The military-to-military relationship between the U.S. and China aims to enhance practical cooperation, reduce risks of accidents, and promote mutual interests. Bilateral exchanges and dialogues occur at various levels, with annual or biennial visits between senior officials. Critics question the benefits of maintaining these relations for the United States. The U.S. and Chinese militaries engage in various exchanges and dialogues, including the U.S.-China Strategic Security Dialogue and bilateral military exercises. They also participate in multilateral conferences and have a defense telephone link for immediate communication. The PLA and DOD have a defense telephone link for direct communication, but it is rarely used. Congress restricted U.S.-China mil-mil contacts in 1999 due to concerns about revealing sensitive information to the PLA. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000 prohibits mil-mil contact if it poses a national security risk in 12 operational areas, with exceptions for specific operations like search and rescue or humanitarian efforts. The FY2000 NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to report any breaches of restrictions on inappropriate exposure in contacts with the PLA. Critics argue that U.S. mil-mil relations with the PLA have aided their modernization efforts without reciprocal benefits for the U.S., potentially compromising U.S. security in future conflicts. High-level dialogues and participation in exercises like RIMPAC are seen as giving unwarranted status to the PLA, which has behaved in destabilizing ways. Some analysts argue that U.S. military relations with the PLA have given unwarranted status to the Chinese military, which has engaged in destabilizing behavior. However, proponents believe that high-level dialogues provide benefits such as delivering deterrent messages and improving operational coordination between the two militaries. The United States and China signed MOUs in 2014 to improve transparency and reduce the risk of accidents. The agreements reaffirm commitments and aim to enhance relations, cooperation, and manage differences through sustained engagements. The MOU on Notification of Major Military Activities focuses on exchanging information about defense policies and strategies, observing military exercises, and creating a mechanism for improved information sharing. The MOU on Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters was signed between the United States and China in 2014 to improve information exchange and outline prescribed behavior in encounters between surface vessels. The U.S. government has responded to China's improved military capabilities with various actions, some of which are believed to be in response to China's assertive behavior in the East and South China Seas. The Obama Administration initiated a policy of \"strategic rebalancing\" to the Asia-Pacific region in 2011 to reassure allies about the U.S. military presence in East Asia and prevent conflict through enhanced deterrence. The State Department and DOD developed frameworks to enhance security relationships with Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea, as well as other countries in the region. In 2014, the United States and China signed an MOU on Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters to improve information exchange and outline prescribed behavior in encounters between surface vessels. In 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced the Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative, a $425 million capacity-building effort focused on improving maritime law enforcement and information sharing in Southeast Asia. The United States has sold arms to Taiwan in response to China's military capabilities. The U.S. military strategy will place increased emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region, with 60% of U.S. Navy vessels based in the Pacific theater by 2020. The U.S. military is shifting focus to the Asia-Pacific region, with 60% of Navy vessels based there by 2020. Additional deployments are planned to allies like Australia, the Philippines, and South Korea. Advanced defense platforms will be deployed in the region, along with investments in high-end warfare capabilities. The Defense Innovation Initiative aims to maintain the U.S. military's technological edge. The DOD is seeking a new \"third offset strategy\" to maintain U.S. military superiority over numerically large forces with precision-guided weapons. Efforts include increasing the lethality of surface-to-surface missiles and developing new operational concepts for joint operations. The AirSea Battle concept aims to counter A2/AD capabilities developed by the PLA. Some U.S. military operations in the Western Pacific may be responses to Chinese activities. The U.S. military focuses on naval and air operations in the Western Pacific, including Freedom of Navigation operations to uphold international legal norms. Surveillance near China's territorial waters provides information on PLA activities. Efforts are made to enhance military-to-military exchanges, promote cooperation on security challenges, and prevent unintended escalation. Calls for China to increase transparency on military matters aim to reduce uncertainty about its military modernization. China's evolving military capability raises policy and oversight concerns. China's changing military capability poses policy and oversight challenges for Congress. Assessing China's military capability involves considering various factors beyond just quantity, such as technological sophistication, networking capabilities, maintenance, logistics, doctrine, and training. China's limited transparency on military matters makes it challenging to assess factors like logistics, personnel training, and exercise realism. U.S. officials urge China to be more transparent, but China provides less military information compared to the U.S. The U.S. military has worldwide responsibilities, including NATO-related duties in Europe and a security role in the Middle East. In contrast, the PLA has limited responsibilities outside China's home region, making more of China's military available for conflicts in its home region. The missions of each country's military can vary significantly, so assessing military capability should consider assigned missions rather than other metrics. The U.S. and Chinese military capabilities differ due to their missions. Key oversight questions for Congress include assessing China's military changes, transparency, surveillance capabilities, resource allocation, and military engagement with China. The U.S. government's assessment of Chinese military capabilities is a key issue for Congress. The reliability of statements from Chinese leaders about their intentions regarding the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is a challenge in assessing China's military intentions. China's leaders make statements about their military intentions, but these may not accurately reflect their true plans. Some statements, like those regarding China's \"core interests,\" may hold genuine views. Assessing China's military capabilities and how they align with stated intentions can help determine the sincerity of their statements. Limited transparency from China adds complexity to understanding their military intentions. Assessing China's leaders' intentions regarding the military is complicated by limited transparency. U.S. officials urge China to be more transparent. Understanding their values and beliefs is crucial as they may differ from Americans'. Mirror imaging, assuming shared values, can lead to misunderstandings. Assessing China's leaders' intentions regarding the military is complicated by limited transparency. U.S. officials urge China to be more transparent. Understanding their values and beliefs is crucial as they may differ from Americans'. Mirror imaging, assuming shared values, can lead to misunderstandings. Military analysts emphasize the importance of accurately assessing capabilities, which change less quickly than intentions. Oversight questions for Congress include assessing PRC leaders' intentions, alignment of Chinese investments in military capabilities with their stated intentions, promoting transparency from China's leaders, and evaluating the impact of U.S.-China military engagement on China's military intentions. The key issue for Congress is assessing China's leaders' intentions for their military and how U.S. actions can influence them. It is important to understand the impact of China's changing military capabilities and whether the U.S. government is responding appropriately. Oversight questions include evaluating alignment of Chinese investments with intentions and promoting transparency from China's leaders. The U.S. government needs to assess China's changing military capabilities and intentions, especially in response to Russian assertiveness and the rise of ISIS. Congress should evaluate if DOD is adequately funding initiatives to address China's military capabilities and if resources are allocated appropriately. Additionally, DOD programs for developing new weapons should be oriented towards responding to China's military advancements. The U.S. government needs to assess China's changing military capabilities and intentions, especially in response to Russian assertiveness and the rise of ISIS. Congress should evaluate if DOD is adequately funding initiatives to address China's military capabilities and if resources are allocated appropriately. Additionally, DOD programs for developing new weapons should be oriented towards responding to China's military advancements. Some key questions include the impact of China's economic growth on its military budget and structural changes in China's military forces. Structural changes in China's military, such as the reduction of PLA forces by 300,000 personnel and reorganization of the command structure, impact resources for defense priorities. How developments in China's military and other Asia-Pacific region militaries affect the overall military balance and U.S. interests. Congress influences U.S. policies towards China through legislation. Congress influences U.S. policies towards China through legislation, budget allocations, hearings, and public statements. Some decisions on budget increases or policy positions are attributed to China's changing military capabilities, but definitive attribution is usually not possible. Several laws, including the Taiwan Relations Act and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1990 and FY1991, have had significant impacts on U.S. policies towards China and the PLA. The Taiwan Relations Act, along with other laws like the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for FY1990 and FY1991, shape U.S. policy towards China and the PLA. The Taiwan Relations Act, enacted in 1979, outlines U.S. policy towards Taiwan in the context of establishing diplomatic relations with the PRC. The Taiwan Relations Act, enacted in 1979, outlines U.S. policy towards Taiwan, emphasizing peaceful means for determining its future, providing defensive arms, and maintaining the capacity to resist coercion. Congress passed legislation after China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 to prohibit certain exports. In response to the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, Congress passed legislation prohibiting the export of defense articles to China, including helicopters and parts. This law was followed by arms embargoes from European countries. There have been calls to lift the U.S. ban on arms exports to China, but policymakers in Washington show little interest in doing so. Additionally, military-to-military exchanges with the PLA were restricted by the NDAA for FY2000 to prevent national security risks. The FY2000 NDAA created requirements for DOD to report on China's military strategy and technological developments. The FY2001 NDAA established the U.S.-China Security Review Commission to produce annual reports on Chinese military matters and hold hearings. Legislative activity in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses directly impacted U.S. policy towards the PLA and security. In 2011, Congress passed a law restricting space cooperation with China, barring NASA and OSTP from collaborating with Chinese entities. Subsequent appropriations bills have maintained this restriction, including prohibiting the export of satellites and components to China without prior notification to Congress. The FY2012 NDAA (P.L. 112-81) directed a review of China's anti-access capabilities compared to the US. The FY2013 NDAA (P.L. 112-239) required reports on US military capabilities against China's underground tunnel network and nuclear weapons program. The FY2015 NDAA (P.L. 113-291) requested a report on Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, including PLA's capabilities in various warfare areas, and prohibited missile defense integration with Chinese systems. Congress also passed the FY2014 NDAA (P.L. 113-66) prohibiting integration of U.S. missile defense systems with PRC systems. The FY2015 NDAA requested a DOD report on maritime security in the Asia-Pacific region and the ability of the U.S. military to deter space aggression. Senate resolutions supported freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea and expressed concerns about China's actions in the Asia-Pacific region. In the 113th and 114th Congress, there were numerous hearings on Chinese military developments and maritime disputes. H.Res. 714 called for peaceful resolution of territorial disputes and urged China to avoid provocative actions in the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. has been closely monitoring Chinese naval and maritime law enforcement activities. The FY2000 NDAA instructed DOD to publish a report on China's military strategy and technological developments, now titled Annual Report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China. Subsequent NDAAs have adjusted the focus and required topics of the report, including assessments of China's cyber activities, electronic warfare capabilities, space programs, nuclear program, and anti-access and area denial capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses the C4ISR modernization program, navy and maritime law enforcement vessels, military relationships with other countries, significant military hardware transfers from China, and assistance to/from states with military-related research programs in China. Section 1271 removes the assessment requirement for damage from China's cyber activities. FY2014 NDAA Section 1248 requests coverage of China's fifth-generation fighter program. FY2015 NDAA Section 1252 requests additional detail on China's military capabilities. China's Strategic Culture Mao Zedong's Principles Chinese strategists view Mao Zedong as a master of warfare, with his military theory serving as a foundation for modern concepts in the PLA. Mao's principles of war as a continuation of politics and the Party's control over the military still guide the PLA. The concept of \"People's War\" is being updated to align with modern warfare, integrating information warfare tactics. The concept of People's War in China is being integrated with modern warfare tactics, including information warfare and maritime disputes. Chinese leaders continue to take this concept seriously, evolving their military thought based on ancient strategists and Mao Zedong's principles. Deng Xiaoping shifted China's military focus from class struggle to hegemony, seeing the Soviet Union as a threat. He believed war could be avoided and advocated for military modernization through personnel cuts. Jiang Zemin took over in 1989 after the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Western countries imposed sanctions on China, leading to diplomatic isolation. However, the 1991 Persian Gulf War showed China the importance of high-tech weaponry in modern warfare. Jiang Zemin supported military budget increases aligned with economic growth, prioritizing quality over quantity in combat effectiveness. He also focused on applying science and technology to enhance military training and logistics, while divesting the military from commercial activities. Jiang divested the military from commercial activities, reducing corruption. Chinese military strategy includes mobilizing civilians for defense. The PLA employs the concept of \"Three Warfares\" - legal, media, and psychological warfare. The PLA prioritizes seizing the initiative in conflict and views cyber and space domains as crucial. They advocate for a preemptive first strike to gain an advantage and maintain a state of perpetual mobilization, using various methods including kinetic and electronic warfare. China may disrupt military satellite networks using kinetic and electronic warfare methods. Since the Sino-Soviet split in 1960, China has avoided treaty alliances and criticized U.S. bilateral alliances as relics of the Cold War. Despite its rejection of overseas bases, the PLA's planned logistics facility in Djibouti suggests a shift in China's foreign policy approach."
