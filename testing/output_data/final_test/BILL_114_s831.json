    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Smarter Approach to Nuclear Expenditures Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the nature of threats to national security has changed since the Cold War, but the US still maintains a large nuclear arsenal. This arsenal includes approximately 5,000 nuclear warheads, with 2,000 deployed across strategic bomber aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The United States maintains a large nuclear arsenal, including 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 14 Ohio-class submarines armed with up to 96 nuclear warheads each. However, this Cold War-based approach to nuclear security is costly, with hundreds of billions of dollars to be spent over the next 10 years. It is suggested that reducing the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems would serve national security interests and be more budget-friendly. The Department of Defense's June 2013 nuclear policy guidance supports reducing the number of deployed nuclear warheads to 1,000 to 1,100, stating that current force levels are more than adequate for national security objectives. This reduction could save the United States tens of billions of dollars. The Government Accountability Office has found significant waste in the construction of nuclear facilities within the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. Admiral Mike Mullen emphasized the link between economic security and national security, stating that the national debt is a major threat to national security. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN NUCLEAR FORCES. Prohibition on new long-range penetrating bomber aircraft, F-35 nuclear mission, and reduction in the B61 life extension program for fiscal years 2015 through 2024. Prohibition on funding for B61 and W78 life extension programs until cost reduction certification is provided. Reduction of nuclear-armed submarines to eight by fiscal year 2021. The Navy is limited to eight ballistic-missile submarines for deployment. No funds can be used for SSBN-X submarine procurement from 2015 to 2024, and no more than eight submarines can be procured from 2025 onwards. Additionally, there is a prohibition on funding for a new intercontinental ballistic missile. The Department of Defense is prohibited from using funds for a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility project, and the Uranium Processing Facility. Prohibition on funding for Uranium Processing Facility and new air-launched cruise missile for Department of Defense and Department of Energy starting from fiscal year 2015. SEC. 4. REPORTS REQUIRED. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy must submit an initial report within 180 days of the Act's enactment outlining their plans for section 3. They must also submit annual reports by March 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, detailing their plans for section 3. Additionally, the President must provide an annual nuclear weapons accounting report by September 30, 2016, and annually thereafter. The Federal Government must report on the funds used for nuclear weapons and related programs during the fiscal year and their entire life cycle. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
