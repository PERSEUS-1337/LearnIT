Their proposal also included a separate director for the CIA, but it was not adopted. In 2002, the Congressional Joint Inquiry recommended creating a new cabinet-level Senate-confirmed NID position to manage the Intelligence Community. They also suggested appointing a separate director for the CIA to improve coherence and efficiency within the IC. The debate over whether the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) should also serve as the National Intelligence Director (NID) revolves around concerns that the DCI's responsibilities are too extensive, leading to a lack of direction and focus in managing the Intelligence Community. The National Security Act of 1947 grants the DCI limited budget authority, raising questions about the effectiveness of current management structures within the IC. More than 85% of the intelligence budget is executed by agencies not under the DCI's control. The DCI can approve budgets for IC agencies but cannot transfer funds without agency head agreement. The appropriation for NFIP agencies, including CIA, is given to the Secretary of Defense who disburses funds to agencies like NSA, NRO, and NGA. The DCI only has budget execution authority over the CIA. Some argue that the Director of Central Intelligence historically focused on managing the CIA rather than overseeing the entire Intelligence Community. Legislation has been introduced to establish a National Intelligence Director (NID) position to head the 15 intelligence agencies, including the CIA, separate from the CIA Director. Supporters believe the NID concept would improve intelligence coordination. Supporters of the NID concept argue that the DCI has too many jobs and that an NID must be established to effectively manage the IC. They believe the NID should have the authority to hire and remove IC agency heads, move funding and personnel within agencies, and set standards for the IC's information infrastructure and personnel. Supporters of the NID concept argue that an empowered NID is necessary to set common goals, establish priorities, and ensure the protection of the American people by effectively managing the IC. They believe the NID should have the authority to hire and remove IC agency heads, move funding and personnel within agencies, and set standards for the IC's information infrastructure and personnel. Opponents of the NID argue that establishing the position may have only a marginal impact and suggest that hiring more capable people throughout the IC would be a more important step. They also contend that an NID could weaken IC management by losing control over the CIA, a natural power base. Critics argue that establishing the position of NID may add unnecessary bureaucracy and risk disrupting efforts to combat terrorism. They believe that without meaningful authority over hiring, firing, and budget, centralized management control will be weakened. Additionally, critics point out that DCIs have historically faced opposition from the DOD, limiting their ability to control IC budgets effectively. Critics express concerns about the 9/11 Commission's recommendations for the NID's office location, fearing politicization of intelligence, increased White House control over covert operations, and blurred lines between foreign and domestic operations. They also worry about Congress facing challenges in overseeing the IC due to the NID's proximity to the White House potentially invoking executive privilege. Additionally, critics argue that the NDI concept could shift too much influence to the Defense Department, giving them more power and influence. Critics of the NID concept fear increased influence of the Defense Department under the commission's proposal. They argue that the Secretary of Defense should control agencies like NSA, NRO, and NGA, as their focus on tactical military operations differs from policymakers' interest in strategic intelligence. The issue of centralized IC leadership has been a longstanding concern since the Second Hoover Commission in 1955. The Second Hoover Commission in 1955 recommended transferring management of the CIA to an \"executive officer\" to allow the DCI to focus on the IC. President Nixon tasked the Office of Budget and Management to suggest changes in the IC's organization, with Deputy OMB Director James R. Schlesinger considering the creation of an NID but ultimately recommending a strong DCI to control intelligence costs and production quality. Schlesinger criticized the IC's lack of resource coordination. The Commission on the Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy criticized the lack of strong central IC leadership and recommended strengthening DCI authorities instead of establishing an NID. The Church Committee did not recommend an NID but suggested enhancing DCI control over intelligence funding. The House Select Committee on Intelligence recommended strengthening DCI authorities by appropriating intelligence dollars directly to the DCI and defining DCI reprogramming authorities. They also suggested that the DCI should manage the entire Intelligence Community, not just the CIA. Additionally, there were proposals for establishing a new position of Director of General Intelligence and having a separate CIA director for managing the CIA. Ray Cline, a former Deputy Director of the CIA, recommended giving the DCI cabinet rank and broad supervisory authorities over the Intelligence Community. Congress considered creating a National Intelligence Director (NID) to manage the IC, with a presidentially selected deputy managing the CIA. President Ford issued E.O. 11905 in 1976, naming the DCI as the President's primary intelligence advisor for developing the NFIP. President Carter issued E.O. 12036 in 1978, defining the DCI's community-wide responsibilities. President Ronald Reagan expanded the DCI's community responsibilities and authorities with E.O. 12333 in 1981, granting the DCI more explicit authority over the NFIP. Admiral Stansfield Turner recommended establishing an NID to oversee the IC, leaving CIA day-to-day operations to a separate director. Senator David Boren and Congressman David McCurdy chaired the SSCI and House Permanent Select on Intelligence. Senator David Boren and Congressman David McCurdy introduced legislation to create the position of National Intelligence Director (NID) with authority over funds and a separate CIA director. The Aspin-Brown Commission recommended giving the DCI more time to manage the Intelligence Community and creating two deputies to assist in managing the IC and the CIA. Senator Arlen Specter and Congressman Larry Combest also proposed reforms in response to the Commission's report. Senator Arlen Specter and Congressman Larry Combest proposed reforms to increase the DCI's influence by giving him more control over defense-related agencies. Despite facing opposition, they settled for creating a deputy DCI for community management and three assistant directors. Only two positions have been Senate confirmed, with the others remaining vacant. The presidential commission recommended giving control of NSA, NRO, and NGA to the DCI, but the report was opposed by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and was never presented to the President. The Congressional Joint Inquiry suggested creating a new Senate-confirmed NID position and a separate director for the CIA, with full budget and personnel authorities. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing a new system. The 9/11 Commission recommended the establishment of a National Intelligence Director with oversight over national intelligence centers and agencies, located in the Executive Office of the President."
