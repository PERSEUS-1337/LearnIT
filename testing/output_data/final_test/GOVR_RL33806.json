    "content": "Natural resource management is a significant issue for the federal government, with energy resources being a key concern. The availability of natural resources presents both opportunities and constraints for human activities. Government policies at various levels define the distribution and use of the nation's natural capital stock. The complexity of resource management has increased due to growing demands and pressures, as well as heightened interest in resource usage. Decisions on resource management have economic, social, and environmental implications at local, national, and international levels, sparking debates on who should decide and how decisions are made. The federal government plays a role in natural resource management. The federal role in natural resource management remains controversial, with debates focusing on specific management tools and principles like multiple use and sustainable yield. The United States, along with Canada, Russia, and a few other countries, possess a vast array of natural resources. The United States, along with Canada, Russia, and Brazil, is one of the few countries with vast natural resources. Early U.S. policy focused on land disposal and resource use for settlement and development, but conservation efforts starting in the 1870s began to shift this vision. Yellowstone was established as the first national park in 1872, and national forests were created in 1891 for watershed protection. Government policies favored regional resource users until the 1960s when questioning of federally supported resource use began. The shift in U.S. resource management policies began in the 1960s due to increased demand for recreation, environmental conservation movements, and judicial rulings favoring protection. Tension between traditional and alternative resource uses persists, with debates focusing on balancing multi-use management, national vs. local benefits, and current vs. future needs. Conflicting views reflect different values and perceptions. Conflicting views on resource management reflect different values and perceptions. Key concerns include the role of the federal government in establishing policies, interagency conflicts, funding sources, the role of science, and coordination of efforts. Congress typically addresses resource issues based on specific categories like lands, oceans, species, or water. Public values regarding federal and Indian lands raise questions about land ownership and management balance. Federal land management involves balancing conflicting uses such as grazing, timber, habitat, and recreation. The controversy over federal land ownership, especially in western states, continues. Congress addresses multi-use land management through legislative proposals and annual appropriations. Recent debates focus on energy production, wildfire protection, range management, and recreation. Indian land issues, including energy rights-of-way across tribal lands, are also significant. Recent reports highlight declines in marine resources and issues with resource protection and management in federal and state waters. Economic activity in coastal areas is increasing due to human population growth, leading to conflicts with ocean energy development. Coastal properties are at risk from natural forces like ocean storms, hurricanes, and tsunamis. The promotion of conflict with ocean energy development and production from Outer Continental Shelf platforms and wind farms is increasing. Rising sea levels will make coastal sites more hazardous in the future. The numbers of animal and plant species facing possible extinction are rising, raising management questions and challenges. Some stakeholders argue for saving all species due to social and economic impacts, while others question the substantial cost of protection with uncertain benefits. Dwindling species are often indicators of habitat loss or alteration caused by development and invasive species. The challenges in species and ecosystem management decisions are influenced by various factors such as development, changes in land and water management practices, competition from invasive species, and economic, political, or social interests. Controversies exist regarding goals for species protection, ecosystem restoration, and invasive species control, with debates on the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of different approaches. For instance, questions arise about the realistic goal of recovering all species listed under the Endangered Species Act and the effectiveness of multi-billion dollar wetlands restoration proposals for coastal Louisiana without significant changes to the management of the Mississippi River. Increasing pressures on water supplies due to population growth and environmental regulations further complicate these challenges. The challenges in water resource management, including conflicts over water use, are exacerbated by factors such as population growth, environmental regulations, agricultural demand, and climate variability. The federal government has a history of involvement in water development and management, with Congress making decisions on planning, construction, and financing of projects within a complex framework of competing objectives and legal decisions. Hurricane Katrina highlighted the trade-offs in water resource management among local, state, and federal entities, raising questions about the federal role. Science plays a crucial role in understanding climate change's impact on resource stocks and conditions. Natural resources management is interconnected with environmental issues and can present both opportunities and hazards like drought and flooding. Natural resources management and environmental protection are interconnected, with issues like groundwater contamination affecting rural water supply. Energy policy debates include access to resources and production impacts on lands. Some energy resource issues are covered, while broader information is in CRS Report RL31720. Natural resource issues on private lands overlap with agricultural topics. For federal conservation programs on agricultural lands, refer to CRS Report RL33556. The 110th Congress will address natural resource issues, including wetlands protection and restoration, through various authorizing committees. Funding adequacy and resource priorities will be evaluated, with issues often crossing party lines and dividing along different interests. The 110th Congress will address 31 natural resource issues, grouped into five categories: Federal and Indian Lands, Natural Hazards, Climate, Ocean and Coastal Affairs, Species Management, and Water Resources. The federal government manages 650 million acres of land, with four agencies administering 95% of federal lands. The federal government manages 650 million acres of land, including lands held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals, covering an additional 56 million acres. Controversy surrounds federal land ownership, with debates on whether to dispose of some lands to state or private ownership, acquire more for conservation, or change management procedures. Policy matters include preserving wildlife habitat, designating wilderness areas, and deciding on land use for development, resource extraction, or recreational purposes. The 110th Congress may need to address controversial issues related to managing federal lands, including wildlife habitat preservation, wilderness designation, energy development, and Indian land management. A key question is whether to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge through a wilderness designation or open it for oil development. The 110th Congress may need to decide whether to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge through a wilderness designation or open it for oil development. Congress has previously debated opening the refuge for development, but funding for federal lands remains contentious. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) receives $900 million annually but can only be spent with Congressional appropriations. Key issues include annual funding amounts for federal land agencies, land acquisition decisions, and alternative uses for LWCF funds. Policy debates often occur within the annual Interior appropriations legislation. Other funding concerns include setting recreation fees and compensating counties for tax-exempt federal lands through programs like Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT). The 110th Congress may address funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program and consider reauthorizing the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Efforts to reduce wildfire threats include the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. The 110th Congress may address oversight and authorization of fire programs, federal firefighting funding levels, and repayment of borrowed funds for fire suppression. Recent severe fire seasons have led to significant borrowing from other Forest Service programs, with implementation effects. The Bush Administration has made regulatory changes related to forest fuel reduction activities. The Bush Administration has made regulatory changes related to forest management, public involvement in planning, environmental impacts, and fuel reduction in FS programs. Changes include categorical exclusions from NEPA analysis, modified review procedures, new rules for national forest uses and planning under NFMA. Substantial uncertainty remains over national forest management. The 110th Congress may oversee regulatory changes and litigation related to national forest management. American Indian reservations and Alaska Native lands cover over 116 million acres in the United States. Indian land issues include energy rights-of-way compensation sought by tribes, as mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates compensation for energy rights-of-way on Indian lands. A draft report was issued in 2006, with concerns that it may recommend amending laws requiring Indian consent. Royalty collection controversies also exist for oil and gas production on Indian lands. Water rights, wildlife resources, and management of sacred sites are significant topics for non-Indian areas. Indian tribes' water rights claims may impact non-Indian water use in western states. Many tribes are involved in water negotiations or adjudications with states. The 110th Congress may consider tribal water rights claims in California, Montana, and New Mexico if settlements are reached. Fish and wildlife management controversies on non-Indian lands involve caribou in ANWR and salmon in the Pacific Ocean and rivers. Indian sacred sites on federal lands have led to unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation for their protection. In the 110th Congress, there may be discussions on increasing federal lands availability for energy and mineral development, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region. The debate includes concerns about environmental impacts, with industry and the Bush Administration advocating for access to these areas for future oil and gas supplies. Opponents argue for energy conservation and exploration in other areas to meet domestic energy needs. The permitting process for drilling is also under scrutiny. The permitting process for drilling on federal lands is under scrutiny, with the need to update Resource Management Plans cited as a major cause for delays. Comprehensive energy legislation aims to streamline the permitting process, with a pilot project established in seven BLM field offices. BLM has implemented new management strategies to expedite the permitting process for oil and gas development on federal lands, resulting in an increase in permit applications. Environmental groups advocate for energy conservation and oppose expedited permitting. The General Mining Law of 1872 grants free access to prospect for minerals on public lands, with the right to stake a claim and develop minerals. Congress has imposed annual moratoriums on mining claim patents since FY2005, raising the question of reforming the law to balance mineral development with competing land uses. Environmental and outdoor groups are concerned that expediting the permitting process may harm hunting, fishing, and wildlife protection. The claim-patent system in the mining industry is supported for mineral development but criticized for being a giveaway of publicly owned resources due to low payments for maintaining claims and obtaining patents. There is debate on reforming the General Mining Law of 1872 to include royalties and improve environmental protection, as current laws are seen as inadequate for reclamation of mined areas. The 110th Congress may oversee implementation of revised park management policies issued in 2006, addressing the adequacy of funds for the National Park System, including general operations, facilities maintenance, and security. NPS continues to define and quantify its maintenance. The 110th Congress oversees NPS efforts in maintenance, security, and funding. Congress also considers park and recreation measures, including designating sites for inclusion in the System and expanding park boundaries. NPS provides assistance to National Heritage Areas designated by Congress. Congress may enact legislation for consistent criteria for NHA designation, management, and funding. Recreation in park units, BLM, FS, and other lands is a key debate over federal land management. Topics include access for recreation, impact of motorized recreation on natural resources, visitor experience, and local economies. NPS conflicts involve snowmobiles in Yellowstone parks, air tour overflights at Grand Canyon, and Colorado River Management Plan for GCNP. Trail designation is popular but poses challenges in quantity, quality, and funding. Recreation issues also arise in reservoirs and waterways managed by Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation. The management of federal rangelands, particularly by the BLM and FS, presents policy matters for Congress, including the controversial federal grazing fee for private livestock grazing. Instances of grazing on federal land without permits or payment of fees have led to agency actions such as fines, jail time, and impounding and selling trespassing cattle. Congress is also concerned about federal rangeland condition, differences over the impact of grazing, and the threat of invasive and noxious weeds. Many view invasive and noxious weeds as a growing threat to rangeland health and productivity. Efforts to restrict grazing on federal land due to environmental concerns face opposition from those supporting ranching for lifestyle, environmental, and economic reasons. Policy issues include compensating grazing permittees who voluntarily give up permits and automatic renewal of expiring permits. Congress may oversee changes made by BLM in 2006 to grazing regulations. In 2006, Congress may oversee changes made by BLM to grazing regulations. There is continued interest in BLM's management of wild horses and burros, with a focus on adoption, sales programs, and efforts to remove them from the range. Proposals may be introduced to overturn BLM's sale authority and foster the sale and adoption of wild horses and burros. Wilderness areas are managed by federal agencies to preserve natural conditions, with restrictions on permanent roads and structures, and use of machines and mechanized travel. Designating new wilderness areas can be controversial. Designating new wilderness areas can be controversial as it prioritizes preservation values over uses requiring roads and motorized equipment. Only Congress can designate units of the Wilderness System. Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs) are managed by BLM to preserve their wilderness characteristics until Congress designates them as wilderness or releases them for other uses. Legal questions have arisen regarding the management of WSAs under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA). Some BLM lands may not include headwaters of water sources, raising water rights issues for congressional consideration. Management of national forest roadless areas is controversial, with Clinton Administration rules protecting inventoried roadless areas. Critics see these rules as de facto wilderness management, while supporters argue they allow more activities than in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Litigation ensued over the Clinton rules, leading to new rules under the Bush Administration that eliminated the nationwide approach. The Bush Administration finalized new rules that returned management of roadless areas to individual forest units, allowing state governors to petition for protection. Litigation over the rules led to reinstatement of the Clinton rules. The 110th Congress may oversee rulemaking and consider legislation on roadless areas management and disaster mitigation policies. The federal government addresses disasters in vulnerable regions impacted by climate change through initiatives like the Flood Map Modernization Initiative and weather forecasts from agencies like FEMA and NOAA. Congress may consider legislation on disaster mitigation policies. The 110th Congress may need to address the impacts of climate change on natural resources and consider centralizing geospatial data for hazard mapping to reduce disaster risks. There is scientific consensus on climate change, with uncertainties remaining on its magnitude, rate, and geographic distribution of impacts. The federal government's decision-making processes regarding resource management may need to account for climate change effects. Climate change may impact natural resource management, affecting federal forests' resistance to pests and susceptibility to fire. Changing growing seasons and hydrologic cycles may impact federal rangelands' productivity and nutritional quality. Rising sea levels could complicate coastal resource management, exacerbating conflicts between human activities and natural resource protection. Warming sea temperatures may also affect coral reefs. Climate change could impact water resources and federal infrastructure operations. Changes in the hydrologic cycle, sea level rise, and other climate-related factors may affect ecosystem restoration efforts like the Florida Everglades project. Congress is considering modifying the federal role in natural disaster mitigation to enhance community sustainability through federal disaster assistance programs. The federal disaster assistance programs, pre- and post-disaster mitigation grant programs, mandates under the National Flood Insurance Program, and flood map modernization efforts are informed by mitigation principles. Hazards result from the interaction between physical and social systems. Implementing policies to mitigate risk can reduce the impact of natural hazards. Recent amendments to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act may affect the role of mitigation in natural disaster management. The 110th Congress may assess the impact of these amendments on mitigation efforts, which can include structural measures like construction of dams and retrofitting buildings to make them more resistant to specific hazards. The 110th Congress may evaluate hazard mitigation options such as reinforcement and nonstructural measures like land use regulation and building codes. They may also review the effectiveness of multi-agency programs for earthquake and windstorm impact reduction. Legislative efforts may focus on Hurricane Katrina recovery and long-term investments in coastal Louisiana. Rapid generation of hazard maps is facilitated by electronic instruments and GIS technology. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) helps in managing spatial data for identifying natural hazard risks and assisting decision-makers. Federal agencies are required to adhere to government-wide standards for data management. The 110th Congress may consider establishing a spatial data clearinghouse for centralized federal mapping data access. The Clinton Administration proposed a \"National Spatial Data Infrastructure,\" while the Bush Administration supports \"Geospatial One-stop\" for centralized access to federal geospatial data. The Administration has not requested funding for the Flood Map Modernization Initiative by FEMA, which aims to identify flood hazard risks and create accurate digital maps for emergency planning and insurance requirements. Recent floods in the Gulf Coast have increased the demand for updated flood maps to assess communities for insurance needs. The 110th Congress may need to assess FEMA's resources and authorities for flood insurance requirements. Congress also needs to consider ensuring continuity of NOAA's weather and climate research, with some Members supporting an organic act for NOAA. NOAA's research supports weather forecasts, warnings, and climate services for the transportation and agricultural sectors. NOAA provides climate services for U.S. transportation and agriculture, supports scientific research validation, and informs national and international climate assessments. They operate instruments to collect environmental data for detecting disasters, assessing risks, and managing resources. The Pew Oceans Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted declines in marine resources and called for bold responses from Congress and the Administration. The 109th Congress considered legislation on ocean and coastal issues, leading to potential attention from the 110th Congress due to new information and recommendations. Coastal counties, comprising 17% of the land area, are crucial for addressing these issues. Coastal counties, covering 17% of the land area, house 50% of the country's population and jobs. Development in these areas can disrupt natural systems, leading to conflicts between human activities and environmental protection. Intensifying hazards like strong winds and flooding pose challenges, especially highlighted by recent hurricane landfalls. Public policy issues in shoreline areas are becoming more prominent as people and jobs concentrate in these regions. The coastal zone management program, a key federal effort for coordinating coastal development with natural resource management, may need reauthorization by Congress. This program provides federal grants to assist states and territories in administering development and protection plans, giving them leverage over federal actions in the coastal zone. Congress may also consider legislation for specific coastal and shoreline areas. Congress may consider legislation for specific coastal and shoreline areas, such as coastal Louisiana and the Great Lakes, and for resources like coastal barrier beaches, wetlands, and estuaries. Federal programs with significant coastal components include resource protection programs for National Park System seashore units and National Wildlife Refuge System refuge units, as well as disaster mitigation response programs like the National Flood Insurance Program. Ocean policy reports have expressed concern over U.S. management of fish and marine mammals, recommending measures to address declining fish stocks, protect marine mammal populations, and improve the sustainability of the commercial fishing industry under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act authorizes federal management of fishing beyond state waters to 200 miles offshore. The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits taking marine mammals without permits. The 110th Congress may focus on oversight of Magnuson-Stevens Act implementation and consider reauthorizing and amending the MMPA to protect marine mammal populations. Topics for debate could include managing commercial fishing interactions and fostering international cooperation on marine mammal populations. Discussions on regulatory changes regarding marine mammals may include subsistence use by Native Americans, effects of underwater noise, and incidental takes. Growing recognition of complex relationships among ocean uses, environmental quality, and resources is noted as human activities expand in marine areas. Policy issues are broad due to numerous causes and impacts, involving local, state, and federal authorities. Impacts range from specific issues like military sonar effects on marine mammals to broader concerns such as oil pollution. The 110th Congress may address marine habitat protection and management issues, including invasive species, oil spills, marine dead zones, chemical weapons disposal, and cruise ship pollution. Key concerns include ballast water management, cruise ship pollution, and wastewater discharges from large passenger vessels. Congress may also review response actions to oil spills despite a decrease in incidents and volume. The 110th Congress may review response actions to oil spills and oversight related to marine protected areas (MPAs) and offshore energy development, including oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and wind energy proposals along the coasts. Congressional oversight may also focus on environmental activities of the Coast Guard. The 110th Congress may examine offshore energy development along the mid-Atlantic, northeast, and Texas coasts, considering its impact on marine and air traffic, radar systems, and the environment. The Gulf of Mexico is seen as a promising region for new additions to U.S. oil reserves, with projections of increased oil and natural gas production by 2011. Congress may also address regulatory responsibilities and potential conflicts between federal and state interests in offshore energy development. The leasing moratoria imposed in response to economic and environmental concerns over drilling near coastal communities may be reconsidered by the 110th Congress. P.L. 109-432 allowed exploration in 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico and provided offshore leasing revenues to selected coastal states. The moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is codified until 2022. The MMS did not collect royalties on oil and gas leases awarded in 1998 and 1999 due to missing price thresholds in the lease agreements. The MMS asserts that price thresholds were omitted from lease agreements by mistake, and discussions are ongoing to include them. The 110th Congress is examining royalty relief and compliance programs. U.S. wind farms are currently onshore, with offshore projects like Cape Wind undergoing permitting. Federal handling of offshore wind projects may impact their viability. NOAA conducts programs related to oceans and coastal areas. NOAA conducts various programs and activities related to oceans, coastal areas, and the Great Lakes, including fishery management, marine species protection, habitat conservation, ocean observation, hazard response, scientific research, and deep ocean exploration. These programs are funded under the Department of Commerce appropriations. Since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, NOAA's National Weather Service has expanded its detection capabilities to protect U.S. shores and assist affected nations. Congress may face implementation issues regarding long-term resources for operations and maintenance. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its related Agreement are pending before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, governing activities on, over, and under the world's oceans, has entered into force with over 150 states parties. The US is not a party, and Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is considering US adherence. The Bush Administration supports US adherence, but opposition may hinder Senate action in the 110th Congress. The Bush Administration supports U.S. adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, citing benefits such as protecting U.S. interests in continental shelf deliberations and enhancing efforts to amend the Convention. Opponents argue that participation would be contrary to U.S. national security interests, especially in light of counter-terrorism programs. Concerns raised by the Reagan Administration in 1982 regarding deep seabed resources remain unresolved. The 1994 Agreement did not address concerns raised by the Reagan Administration regarding jurisdiction, sovereignty, and deep seabed resources. Laws aim to manage, protect, and restore wildlife and habitats, including protecting species facing extinction and conserving water quality. Implementation of these laws can lead to conflicts with social and economic interests, prompting calls for reassessment at national and local levels. The 110th Congress may address challenges in implementing wildlife and ecosystem programs at national and regional levels, balancing interests and multiple resource uses. Issues such as endangered species, invasive species, ecosystem restoration, wetlands protection, and agricultural conservation may be considered. The United States has invested billions in restoring large ecosystems like the Florida Everglades, Chesapeake Bay, and California Bay-Delta. The 110th Congress may address policy issues related to ecosystem restoration, including governance, funding, and science support. Additional activities for restoration efforts in various locations like the Upper Mississippi River System and Great Lakes may be considered. The 110th Congress may consider authorizing a regional strategy for restoring the Great Lakes with a proposed $20 billion investment over five years. Additionally, a Water Resources Development Act may contain provisions for restoration activities in coastal Louisiana and other regional ecosystems. Oversight of ecosystem restoration may also address the potential impact of climate change. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 has been a contentious environmental law due to its strict provisions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 has strict provisions that can impact federal and nonfederal lands. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened, leading to legal tools for recovery and habitat protection. Despite authorization expiring in 1992, ESA requirements remain enforced with annual funding. The 109th Congress considered amending ESA, with ongoing policy debates expected in the 110th Congress regarding the role of science in ESA decisions. The 110th Congress is expected to address changes to the role of science in decision-making, critical habitat designation, protections for private property owners, and incentives for landowner protection of listed species. The United States is involved in conserving foreign species through laws like the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and international treaties like the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which aims to prevent trade from threatening plant and animal survival. ESA has a more comprehensive approach to protecting foreign species than CITES, with criteria to identify threats to survival. The 110th Congress may oversee the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) regarding the protection of foreign threatened and endangered species. Congress may also address international conservation issues such as illegal logging, fisheries management, and the conservation of high-profile species like tigers and elephants through funding from the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. The 110th Congress may consider new legislative authorities and funding to address the impacts of non-native species on economic and ecological aspects. The responsibility for ensuring economic integrity and ecological stability in response to non-native species remains a major question. Legislation could impact various economic interests, including trade and tourism industries. The 110th Congress may consider new legislative authorities and funding to address the impacts of non-native species on economic and ecological aspects, including industries dependent on non-native species. Policy considerations include prevention and response balance, overlapping jurisdiction of congressional committees, and coordination of agencies dealing with invasive species. Congressional response has focused on specific non-native species and pathways, but no current law addresses the general concern over non-native species entering the country. In the 109th Congress, hearings were held on invasive species matters, with committee action focusing on ballast water. The 110th Congress may address invasive species impacts on economic and ecological aspects. Hearings focused on ballast water and invasive carp species. Private land use effects on natural resources, especially in agricultural lands, are a concern. USDA offers voluntary programs to help farmers address resource problems like soil erosion and loss of wildlife habitat. The USDA offers programs to help producers protect resources and environmental conditions, with some conservation programs set to expire in FY2007. The 110th Congress may consider reauthorizing these programs in the farm bill. Congress also faces challenges with rural development impacting habitat and environmental quality, with the potential to influence landowner choices through funding for infrastructure and public facilities. Congress can influence landowner choices by providing federal funds for acquiring easements to maintain habitat, farmland, or other desired uses, and through tax policies that reward conservation actions. Growth can be addressed by designating sites for specific uses or protection, and managing conflicts between private and public ownership. Congress has discussed these topics on a case-by-case basis. The coterminous United States has about 108 million acres of wetlands, less than half of the estimated 220 million acres present when Europeans arrived. Federal policies encouraged wetland conversion to other uses until the late 1970s, but now aim to retain and restore wetlands for their resource values. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have set goals of no-net-loss or net-gain of wetlands. The current Bush Administration prioritizes wetland protection, aiming to restore or improve 3 million acres. The 110th Congress may focus on oversight hearings regarding wetland protection efforts, including permit program implementation, federal acquisition programs, and wetland roles in large-scale restorations like the Florida Everglades. Key issues include changes in wetland acreage, the impact of protection efforts on different wetland types, and the effectiveness of various protection approaches and programs. Ecosystem restoration in coastal Louisiana post-Hurricane Katrina has increased interest in wetlands for storm surge protection. Avian influenza primarily infects birds, with some strains crossing to other animals and humans. Wild birds act as a reservoir for the virus, which is highly contagious in domestic poultry, prompting strict biosecurity measures on farms. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has spread in Asia since 2003, infecting poultry, wild birds, and a limited number of humans. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) has spread in Asia since 2003, infecting poultry, wild birds, and a limited number of humans. The virus has a mortality rate exceeding 50% among infected individuals. Global concerns about the virus mutating to allow human-to-human transmission have prompted a worldwide response. The virus has reached Europe in 2005, the Middle East and Africa in early 2006, and there are fears it may enter North America with the arrival of asymptomatic wild birds. Testing is crucial for detection efforts due to the rarity of deaths among wild birds from avian flu. In 2006, federal agencies and governments increased surveillance for H5N1 virus among wild birds. Low pathogenicity strain of H5N1 was occasionally detected, but the highly pathogenic strain has not been found. Continued testing of wild birds is expected to be a major effort in the future. Funding levels for the federal program and oversight of agency priorities might be issues during the 110th Congress. The 110th Congress faces decisions on water resources management, including federal involvement in surface water allocation and groundwater quality protection. Congress plays a significant role in authorizing and funding regional and site-specific water projects. The 110th Congress is likely to face various water resources issues, including decisions on federal involvement in water allocation and project-specific legislation. Tensions related to water use, river management, flood risk, and existing water projects may be addressed. Bills from the previous Congress, such as the Water Resources Development Act and legislation on San Joaquin River restoration, may receive attention. The 110th Congress may consider authorizing site-specific Army Corps of Engineers projects through WRDA, addressing growing pressures on water supplies and managing regional water resources. Key issues in the debate include independent review requirements for Corps studies and proposals to change project development policies and procedures. The 110th Congress may debate authorizing high-profile, multi-billion dollar projects such as Gulf Coast hurricane protection and Upper Mississippi River navigation lock expansion through WRDA. Policy and program changes to prioritize the Corps' backlog of projects and maintenance activities are also up for discussion. The Bureau of Reclamation's operations of federal dams and water distribution facilities in western states will be a perennial topic for appropriations. Project management and operations efficiency are additional potential topics for the Congress. Possible topics for the 110th Congress include project management and operations, focusing on how project operations and water contract renewals may impact threatened and endangered species. Legislation addressing water and restoration issues in California (CALFED) was enacted in the 108th Congress. Congressional oversight continues on CALFED-related activities, such as progress on storage projects, federal spending, and efforts to increase pumping and renew long-term contracts. Recent disasters have raised concerns about the safety and security of the nation's water infrastructure, including dams and levees. Age, construction deficiencies, inadequate maintenance, and natural disasters may compromise the structural integrity of these projects, falling under dam safety programs. The integrity of aging dams is a growing concern due to the need for increased maintenance and repair. While dams provide benefits like flood control and power generation, approximately 10,000 high-hazard dams in the US pose risks of significant property damage and loss of life. Interest in removing dams for safety, economic, or environmental reasons has been increasing. The 109th Congress authorized continued funding for the National Dam Safety Program. The 110th Congress may reauthorize programs for dam safety, rehabilitation, and removal, with a focus on improving the reliability and protection of flood damage reduction levees. The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA are key federal agencies involved in levee issues, conducting inspections and certification for federal assistance and National Flood Insurance Program eligibility. Post-Katrina inspections are leading to stricter levee certification standards. The 110th Congress may reauthorize programs for dam safety, rehabilitation, and removal, focusing on improving the reliability and protection of flood damage reduction levees. Stricter post-Katrina inspections are leading to decertification of levees, with legislative proposals for a national levee safety program anticipated. River management faces challenges from natural disasters, Indian water rights claims, drought conservation measures, and judicial decisions affecting water allocation. Congressional and public scrutiny of river management is expected during the 110th Congress. The management of multi-purpose rivers involves balancing various uses and infrastructure investments while meeting water rights and contractual obligations, especially during drought. Federal agencies like the Bureau of Reclamation, Corps of Engineers, FERC, and PMAs play key roles in river operations, which often lead to controversies and legal challenges on rivers like the Middle Rio Grande, Colorado, Klamath, Columbia, Snake, Mississippi, and Missouri. Oversight of laws, federal projects, and river management practices is crucial for rivers like the Middle Rio Grande, Colorado, Klamath, Columbia, Snake, Mississippi, and Missouri. Congress may need to address Indian water rights and international cooperation issues for U.S. boundary waters shared with Canada or Mexico. Legal and environmental issues have arisen in Southern California due to litigation over the All-American Canal lining. Legal and environmental issues have halted the All-American Canal lining project in Southern California. Legislation (P.L. 109-432) directed the Secretary of the Interior to carry out the lining project without delay. Concerns for the 110th Congress include water withdrawals from the Great Lakes and their impact on the environment and population. The Great Lakes Governors and Canadian provincial premiers released a final agreement to create uniform water withdrawal standards, facing questions on its effectiveness. The compact requires approval from state legislatures and Congress. Growing population, environmental regulations, and drought have led to conflicts over water use, especially in the West, prompting interest in new water supply development. The 110th Congress is overseeing issues related to water supply development, augmentation, and security. Urban and rural communities are seeking financial assistance for water reuse and supply projects, including desalination, wastewater reclamation, and water transfers. Traditional users of federal water facilities are concerned about competition for funds and reduced deliveries to farms. Issues that may receive oversight in the 110th Congress include water transfers in the West, title transfers to Bureau of Reclamation facilities, climate impacts on reservoir operation, implementation of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act, Reclamation's 2025 Water in the West program, reconsideration of authorization for the Title XVI water reuse program, rural water supply program implementation, federal efforts to assist communities with drought awareness, and municipal water supply activities. The future role of Reclamation and other federal agencies in an urbanizing and drought-prone west, along with existing federal programs to assist communities, may mesh with the historical federal role in municipal water supply. The curr_chunk discusses various reports on topics such as FEMA's Flood Hazard Map Modernization Initiative, Global Climate Change, Fishery Legislation, Outer Continental Shelf Debate, U.N. Law of the Sea Convention, CALFED Bay-Delta Program, Coastal Louisiana Ecosystem Restoration, and Endangered Species. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Endangered Species Act in the 110th Congress, Wetlands issues, Federally Supported Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Programs, Western Water Resource Issues, Water Resources Development Act of 2007."
