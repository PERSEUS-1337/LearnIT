    "content": "Real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks involve processing long sequences of words representing facts and entities. Existing LSTM-based models require many parameters for external memory, leading to poor generalization for long inputs. Memory networks aim to address this by storing information externally, but examining all inputs in memory results in scalability issues for longer sequences, leading to slow inference times and high computation costs. Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) optimize network architecture for lower inference times by dynamically constructing memory banks based on question relevance. This dynamic approach allows the decoder to select a variable number of memory banks, balancing accuracy and speed during answer construction. Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) utilize a novel bank controller and dynamic framework like PyTorch to optimize network architecture for faster inference times. The model constructs varying memory banks based on task complexity, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with 48% fewer entities examined during inference. This is crucial for Question Answering (QA) tasks in commercial applications like chatbots and voice assistants. Consumer device question-answer services like Amazon Alexa have hard timeouts for answering questions, with service APIs wrapped around 8-second limits. Developers are encouraged to provide a list of questions apriori to assist QA processing. Memory networks have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on QA tasks, offering faster inference times compared to LSTMs. Memory networks have been used for QA tasks, providing faster inference times compared to LSTMs. Previous work focused on improving inference by using unsupervised clustering methods to reduce the search space. However, the performance of nearest-neighbor style algorithms is often comparable to a softmax operation over memories. To address the issue of accessing all intermediate memory to answer a question, soft attention-based models compute a softmax over all states, while hard attention models are not differentiable and can be challenging to train over a large state space. Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) construct a memory network dynamically based on input stories. The model computes and stores entities from the input story in memory banks, with entities representing the hidden state of each word. The network learns to create new memory banks and organize entities based on relevance to questions, improving inference for long sequence-based inputs. Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) use dynamic memory banks to improve inference times. The model constructs memory banks based on input, with a novel bank controller making accurate decisions. AMN also models sentence structures on-the-fly and solves 20 bAbI tasks efficiently. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) utilizes a memory bank and a differentiable controller for reading and writing. AMN, on the other hand, uses dynamic memory banks to enhance inference speed and accuracy. AMN constructs memory banks based on input and employs a bank controller for decision-making, efficiently solving 20 bAbI tasks. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) utilizes a discrete bank controller for memory organization, improving performance over Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). AMN's input-specific memory structure reduces inference times by limiting access to specific entities. Graph-based networks like GG-NNs and GGT-NNs use nodes with tied weights for gated-graph state updates. They require strong supervision and teacher forcing for learning the graph structure, making them expensive to build and train. AMN, on the other hand, can solve tasks requiring transitive logic without strong supervision by modeling sentence walks on the fly. EntNet constructs dynamic networks with tied weights for each entity, using a key-value update system to update relevant entities. However, it uses soft-attention during inference, incurring high costs. Memory networks often use softmax over memory nodes, while AMN organizes memory into multiple banks for faster inference. AMN also utilizes conditional computation to improve computational efficiency during inference, similar to gated mixture of experts. Techniques like pruning, low rank approximations, and quantization are explored for faster inference using CNNs. Dynamic neural networks with adaptive computation time and memory networks with dynamic architecture abilities are used to reduce computation costs and inference times. Newer frameworks like Dynet and PyTorch enable dynamic network structures for efficient pruning and processing of variable entities. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) utilizes memory bank depth and dynamic batching to process variable entities. Unlike previous methods, AMN constructs memory slots on-the-fly based on input, inspired by neuroscience's working memory representations. Semantic memory in AMN organizes facts hierarchically, storing relevant entities at lower levels and more complex concepts at higher levels. The memory network architecture in the Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) is designed during inference time for every story, consisting of different memory banks storing entities from the input story. Each memory entity represents the hidden state of each word, while a memory bank is a collection of entities with similar distance scores from the question. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) utilizes memory banks to store entities with similar distance scores from the question. Entities are copied through memory banks to filter out irrelevant nodes, leading to a two-stage pseudo-continuous filtering process. The overall memory consists of multiple memory banks, each representing different levels of relevance. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) uses memory banks to store entities based on their relevance to the question. Entities are gradually moved to higher importance memory banks, and new banks are created if needed to reduce entropy. Operations like creating new memory banks, moving entities, and adding/updating entities are described while maintaining differentiability. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) utilizes memory banks to store entities based on relevance. Operations include adding/updating entities and propagating changes across entities to communicate transitive logic. The model introduces the concept of entropy to create new memory banks and better discretize nodes. The model described in the curr_chunk adopts an encoder-decoder framework with an augmented adaptive memory module. It aims to generate an answer to a question based on a story represented by input sentences. Entities in the model are represented as 3-tuples, and various mathematical notations are used to denote scalars, vectors, matrices, and dot products. The input to the model consists of story-question input pairs. The model utilizes an encoder-decoder framework with an adaptive memory module to process story-question input pairs. It maps words to hidden representations and question relevance strengths, encoding them through an accumulation GRU. The GRU captures entity states over time, with the final output referred to as wN for statements.

The operations \u03a0 ctrl have two instances: \u03a0 new for memory bank creation and \u03a0 move for moving entities across banks. Examples of q as a polymorphic function are given in their respective sections. The model uses a memory bank controller for binary decision making in the adaptive memory module. q is a fully connected layer that learns a continuous decision, later discretized based on entity states. Moving entities through memory banks involves passing relevance scores to determine input H. Each bank cannot contain duplicate nodes, but the same node can exist in different memory banks.

Evaluation in the Appendix examines the behavior of memory banks for specific tasks, as well as the ratio of entities examined to solve the task. The complexity of AMN and other SOTA models is shown in TAB2. AMN is able to successfully reduce the number of nodes examined for tasks where nodes are easily separable, but for tasks requiring more information, such as counting, the model can still obtain the correct answer without using all entities. In transitive logic tasks, the model creates very few banks and uses all nodes to generate an answer. The AMN model creates multiple memory banks for different tasks, with varying numbers of entities required. The model's computation times can vary, but for inference times, AMN's decoder and EntNet's decoder are similar. In Task 1, the number of entities is increased to 100 from 38, with a longer story length to reference new entities. AMN creates 6 memory banks, with a ratio of entities in the final banks versus the overall.

The model can handle multiple questions associated with a story and requires 3 banks for single supporting fact tasks. AMN aims to organize memory adaptively for faster question answering. The Adaptive Memory Network (AMN) utilizes a novel design for memory management, allowing for easier training compared to Neural Turing Machines (NTMs). AMN can reason, construct, and sort memory banks based on question relevance. The architecture is versatile and can be applied to various tasks with input sequences divided into entities. Future plans include evaluating AMN on different tasks and experimenting with larger datasets for scalability. The paper discusses the comparison of computational costs during inference for solving the extended bAbi task using AMN, Entnet, and GGT-NN. It includes comparisons of decode operations, creation of nodes, and wall clock execution times for different tasks within bAbI. The focus is on comparing inference times considering all banks versus only the necessary banks as required by AMN. AMN requires fewer banks and entities, saving inference times. Memory bank behavior is analyzed with examples from bAbI tasks. Variable number of memory banks are created based on task and distance from the question. Entities are copied across memory banks, shown in a heatmap. Propagation occurs after every time step, with nodes representing entities in a sentence forming a directed graph. The path of a sentence includes nodes already in the graph. The model propagates hidden state information among nodes in a directed graph by summing incoming edges' node hidden states. Emphasis is placed on recent nodes, and the graph is raised to a power to reach and update all intermediate nodes."
