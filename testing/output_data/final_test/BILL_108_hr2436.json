    "content": "The \"Ballistic Imaging Evaluation and Study Act of 2003\" aims to conduct a study on ballistic imaging technology, evaluate design parameters for packing and shipping of fired cartridge cases and projectiles, assess the effectiveness of the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) in investigating crimes, and determine the cost and effectiveness of State-mandated ballistic imaging systems. The Attorney General will arrange a study with the National Research Council to determine design parameters for packing fired cartridge cases and projectiles, the most effective method for projectile recovery for ballistic imaging systems, and which countries are using such systems for investigating crimes. The study will investigate the cost of implementing a ballistic imaging system for investigating crimes committed with handguns or rifles in the United States, including startup costs, operating costs, yearly administration costs, and the number of firearms sold annually. The study will examine the cost of implementing a ballistic imaging system for investigating crimes involving handguns or rifles in the United States, including startup and operating costs, yearly administration expenses, and the annual number of firearms sold. It will also analyze the types of firearms used in crimes, comparing manually operated handguns and rifles with semiautomatic ones, and assess any shifts in the use of different firearm categories in countries where ballistic identification is in place. Additionally, the study will provide a list of factors, such as firearm modifications, that can alter identifying marks on cartridge cases and projectiles, affecting the reliability of comparisons between specimens. The study will also address legal issues at the Federal and State levels regarding the information captured and stored in a national ballistic identification program, as well as the integration of redundant database systems and the integrity of stored cartridge cases and projectiles. The study will examine the integrity of ballistic evidence, including the cost and resources needed for ballistic imaging technology, the collection of fired cartridge cases from privately owned firearms, and the effectiveness of State and Federal ballistic imaging systems. The study will assess the cost-effectiveness of using a Federal NIBIN-based approach for ballistic imaging technology compared to State-based initiatives, which can create a centralized list of firearms owners. SEC. 4. CONSULTATION. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences shall consult with various officials and entities involved in budgeting, administering, and using ballistic imaging systems, including law enforcement officials, manufacturers, distributors, and firearms purchasers. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences will consult with experts in ballistics imaging technology, including firearm and tool mark examiners, projectile recovery system manufacturers, ballistic imaging device manufacturers, foreign officials, and individuals with significant expertise in the field. SEC. 5. REPORT.\n\nWithin 30 days of the National Research Council completing the study, a report will be submitted to the Attorney General, who will then present the findings and any legislative recommendations to Congress. \n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms related to ballistic imaging technology, handguns, rifles, and ammunition components. The Act defines terms related to ballistic imaging technology, handguns, rifles, and ammunition components. A semiautomatic handgun is a repeating handgun where the user manipulates all loading, unloading, and reloading of the firing chamber. A semiautomatic handgun uses energy from a firing cartridge to chamber the next round and requires a trigger pull for each shot. A semiautomatic rifle is defined in section 921(a)(28) of title 18, United States Code. The term \"projectile\" refers to the part of ammunition expelled through the barrel by explosive force."
