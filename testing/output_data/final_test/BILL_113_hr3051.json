    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal States Extension Act of 2013\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that the President extended the territorial sea of the United States to 12 nautical miles, but did not address the impact on State jurisdiction. Coastal States typically have jurisdiction over land, air, water, and resources up to 3 nautical miles, while Great Lake States have jurisdiction up to 11-80 nautical miles. Gulf of Mexico States also have jurisdiction over certain areas. Some Gulf of Mexico States have jurisdiction over their offshore areas up to 10.4 nautical miles from the coast line. Coastal States are better equipped than the Federal Government to manage oil and natural gas resources within 12 nautical miles, demonstrating experience in balancing resource conservation and utilization. The text chunk discusses the extension of state jurisdiction over submerged lands. The Submerged Lands Act is amended to extend state jurisdiction over submerged lands up to 12 nautical miles from the coast line of each state, or farther in the case of the Great Lakes. The Submerged Lands Act is amended to extend state jurisdiction over submerged lands up to 12 nautical miles from the coast line of each state. SEC. 4. DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN OIL AND NATURAL GAS LEASES IN STATE SUBMERGED LANDS. Any existing oil and natural gas leases on State submerged lands transferred from the Secretary of the Interior will remain valid until expiration or cancellation. Afterward, the State can issue new leases. However, the State cannot grant new leases until approved by the Secretary of Commerce for coastal zone development. The State must have an approved or developing program under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to issue new leases for coastal zone development. Definitions for \"lease\" and \"coastal zone\" are provided in the Act."
