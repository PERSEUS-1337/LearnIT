    "content": "The Act is titled the \"No Substitute for Quality Teaching Demonstration Act\". The Congress finds a shortage of substitute teachers nationwide, with low salaries and lack of benefits. The problem is exacerbated by increased demand for professional development opportunities for teachers. This shortage is expected to reach crisis levels within the next 10 years. Within the next 10 years, an acute shortage of substitute teachers is expected as an unprecedented number of children enter schools. Schools have relaxed requirements, hiring often underqualified substitutes with no teaching certification in most states. Principals in 28 states can hire anyone with a high school diploma or GED who is 18 or older. Some districts do not require job applications or conduct background checks for substitute teachers. Face-to-face interviews are rare, with over half of districts never meeting potential substitutes. States with lower academic achievement are twice as likely to allow less qualified substitutes in the classroom. Nine out of the ten lowest-ranked States in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) testing allowed substitute teachers with only a high school diploma to teach in their schools. In each of those States, education spending is thousands of dollars below the national average. Of the top 25 States in education spending, 9 require at least a college degree for substitute teachers. In 77 percent of school districts across the country, checks are conducted on applicants for substitute teaching positions, and only half the districts check applicants' references. Alleviating the substitute teacher crisis in 77 percent of school districts nationwide could free up time for professional development programs. The Secretary of Education will establish a grant program to provide funding to local educational agencies or consortia to address the substitute teacher shortage. Grants will be awarded to 50-100 agencies to experiment with solutions. The Secretary of Education will select grant recipients to explore various solutions for the substitute teacher shortage, such as public relations campaigns, permanent substitute teacher pools, addressing administrative issues, and providing training for substitute teachers. The Secretary of Education will submit a report to Congress on the findings of the demonstration program, including the most effective programs for alleviating the substitute teacher shortage and the impact of economic conditions on substitute teacher availability. The Secretary may also create rules for implementing the Act, and $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2003."
