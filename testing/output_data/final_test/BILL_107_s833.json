The applicable amount for each qualifying child is determined based on the taxpayer's taxable year. The applicable amount for the child tax credit increases annually from $600 in 2002 to $1,000 in 2006 and beyond. The credit is limited based on the taxpayer's regular tax liability. The tax code is amended to adjust the calculation of excess tax liability and allowable credits for the taxable year. Amendments include changes to sections 24(d) and 26(a) of the tax code. Amendments are made to sections 24 and 26 of the tax code, including changes to the calculation of excess tax liability and allowable credits for the taxable year. Section 24 is amended to include limitations and adjustments based on adjusted gross income. Section 26 is amended to exclude section 24 from certain provisions. Additionally, a portion of the child credit is treated as refundable under section 24(d). The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the credits for families with 3 or more children.
