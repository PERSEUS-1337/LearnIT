    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature intends to create a Veterans\u2019 Home Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund statewide and at each veterans\u2019 home. The Department of Veterans Affairs will establish rules and regulations for the fund with input from stakeholders. Transparency and resident involvement are key priorities, and uniform policies for the fund will be encouraged at all veterans\u2019 homes. The Veterans\u2019 Home Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Special Fund (MWR Fund) is created in the State Treasury, with funds continuously appropriated to the department for the general welfare of the members of the homes. The administrator of a veterans' home shall deposit all moneys into the Veterans' Home Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Special Fund. Future moneys collected from unreimbursed costs of care determinations will also be deposited into the MWR Fund. Each home must have an MWR Advisory Committee to oversee the MWR Fund processes. The committee will include the administrator or a representative and members of the Veterans\u2019 Home Allied Council or resident council. By July 1, 2018, the department will work with the committees to establish regulations for managing the MWR Fund and MWRO Funds, budget submissions, allocations, and review processes. Moneys in the MWR Fund are exempt from certain Government Code requirements. The department determines annual disbursement amounts to homes based on population share. Allocation decisions consider potential cost savings while meeting home requests. The secretary, in consultation with the home administrator, may increase MWR Fund allocation to veterans' homes based on factors like age, size, and population. MWR Fund cannot be used for medical care, maintenance, or non-recreational activities. General Fund appropriations cannot be reduced to force increased MWR Fund spending. The department must use uniform accounting procedures for the MWR Fund and MWRO Funds, prepare detailed annual reports by December 31, 2018, and submit them to various entities for oversight. The department must maintain a reserve of at least $3,000,000 in the MWR Fund. Funds can be transferred to the Surplus Money Investment Fund for investment or managed by a third-party broker. Investments and earnings will be credited back to the MWR Fund for allocation by the department. The administrator of a home can enter into an agreement with the Veterans\u2019 Home Allied Council to operate facilities and activities authorized by law. Section 1048 of the Military and Veterans Code is repealed and replaced with a new section requiring the maintenance of a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Operating Fund for quality of life activities for members. The annual allocations from the MWR Fund, along with any additional funds provided by the secretary, shall be deposited in a local bank account. Moneys in the MWRO Fund cannot be used for medical treatment, maintenance of the Home's physical plant, or activities unrelated to member morale, welfare, or recreation. Moneys in the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund can be used to establish and operate a canteen and base exchange at each home location, with approval from the secretary. The MWRO Fund of each home includes proceeds from canteen and base exchange operations, as well as revenue from golf course fees and unique activities."
