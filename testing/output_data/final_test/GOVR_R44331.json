Supporters advocate for increased resources to fully utilize big data. The use of administrative data in public big data for agriculture raises questions about compatibility with traditional data sources and the potential benefits of incorporating new big data sources. Concerns about data availability and security have also been highlighted, with a focus on the government's ability to protect its big data sources from breaches. Private big data in agriculture refers to data sets generated on the farm or ranch by the producer to enhance operations. Various players in the industry utilize technology and advanced analytics for data collection, management, and utilization. The focus is on protecting private data from breaches and ensuring its security. Private big data in agriculture involves the collection, management, and use of data to enhance operations on the farm or ranch. The focus is on protecting private data and ensuring its security. The use of big data in agriculture includes creating prescriptive plans for seed and fertilizer application, soil analysis, and localized weather reports. The different stages of the big data cycle, such as collection and management, present challenges for the industry. The number and type of players involved in private agricultural big data are constantly evolving. The collection stage of the big data process in agriculture involves the use of physical technology like sensors, drones, and radar to gather detailed information on soil content, pests, sunlight, nutrients, and moisture. The collectors are typically producers who integrate data collection into their daily activities. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key part of data collection in agriculture, raising concerns about ownership, privacy, and security. Key players in data collection include Equipment Manufacturers and Chemical Companies/Applicators. The agricultural industry is increasingly using technologies from other industries, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) in dairy farming. Chemical companies are involved in developing tools to improve nutrient and pesticide application. Private big data management is important for handling large volumes of data in agriculture. Data management in agriculture involves organization, administration, and governance of large volumes of data to ensure quality and accessibility. It includes storage, processing, and security measures, with key players like private data managers and data banks expanding. Data cooperatives are also emerging as producer-owned solutions for small to mid-sized operations. Some players collect and organize data for a fee, while others act as brokers to trade or sell data. Examples include data management at the farm-level. Data storage and management in agriculture can be conducted at the farm-level, with concerns about security leading producers to store data locally. Data can also be managed by companies offering data collection services, independent agricultural data banks, and producer-owned data cooperatives. These entities store, organize, and analyze data, with additional services like weather information and benchmarking available. Data co-ops are producer-owned cooperatives that aggregate and exchange data for members, pooling data to create value and negotiating power. Members receive proceeds from data sales and infrastructure benefits. The final stage involves analyzing and packaging data into useful products for producers. Private big data products can be categorized into descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive types, offering recommendations and forecasts based on real-time and historical data. Farmers and ranchers are the primary users, but other industries also see the value in utilizing big data for various purposes. Key players in this field include farmers and ranchers who benefit from improved production and cost reduction. Retailers are the creators of big data products, analyzing and selling data to producers. They advocate for big data to increase value for themselves and consumers. Industry groups struggle with defining big data terms and addressing producer concerns about privacy and ownership. Industry groups provide guidance on licensing language and data contracts for producers looking to utilize agricultural big data. Environmental interests are also involved, focusing on the positive environmental impact of reduced inputs and increased efficiencies.
