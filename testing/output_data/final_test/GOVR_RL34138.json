    "content": "Federal courts can order restitution for certain crimes under 18 U.S.C. 3663 and for other crimes under 18 U.S.C. 3663A. Restitution can also be ordered for specific offenses under individual statutes. Restitution may be imposed as a condition of probation or supervised release, with the procedure outlined in Section 3664. Mandatory victim restitution is required for felonies such as crimes of violence, property offenses, drug-related crimes, and various other offenses. Restitution is mandatory for certain crimes like human trafficking, sexual abuse, stalking, and copyright infringement. It can take the form of in-kind, lump sum, or installment payments. Federal courts can order restitution for controlled substance and aviation safety offenses. Restitution is available to victims who have suffered physical injury or financial loss due to the crime. Restitution, a remedy grounded in fairness, aims to restore victims to their pre-loss state. It has been a part of the federal criminal justice system for over a century, initially claimed by judges as part of their authority but later explicitly granted by Congress. This allows courts to order probationers to pay fines and make restitution to victims. In 1982, the Victim and Witness Protection Act granted federal courts the discretion to order restitution in criminal cases, and in 1994, mandatory restitution was established as a consequence of conviction for federal crimes. In 1994, Congress established mandatory restitution for federal crimes of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, and domestic violence. The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 expanded this to most serious federal crimes, leading to constitutional challenges regarding restitution's origins and defendants' rights. The Supreme Court upheld the restitution order based on challenges to the Seventh Amendment. Questions arise about whether restitution is a criminal sanction and if it must adhere to constitutional restrictions. The debate includes considerations of ex post facto laws, excessive fines, and the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in criminal cases. The lower federal appellate courts have differing opinions on the retroactive application of new laws and the ex post facto clause regarding increased restitution liability. The Eighth Amendment sets limits on restitution authority, ensuring it is proportionate to the harm caused. The Supreme Court has ruled that restitution must be precisely proportionate to the offense, and it does not violate the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial or the Fifth Amendment right to conviction only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The Apprendi line of cases established that any fact necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by a guilty plea or jury verdict must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. However, lower federal appellate courts have rejected arguments that this affects the validity of restitution orders, as they do not consider restitution a criminal sanction and do not see Fifth or Sixth Amendment concerns. The federal appellate courts do not consider restitution a criminal sanction, so they do not see Fifth or Sixth Amendment concerns. The various federal restitution statutes address who qualifies as a victim, what crimes trigger restitution authority, and what type of injuries or losses are covered. The Supreme Court narrowly interpreted the statute to only allow restitution for harm attributable to the crime of conviction. Congress later endorsed this view with more explicit statements in the statutes. Sections 3663 and 3663A authorize restitution orders for the benefit of crime victims, defining a victim as someone directly harmed by the offense. Harm must be directly caused by the defendant's misconduct without attenuation between the crime and the harm. The presence of an intervening cause may suggest a lack of direct or proximate causation in relation to misconduct. An intervening cause will defeat a claim of harm unless it is related to the offense or a foreseeable consequence. Proximate cause refers to a sufficient connection between events for one to be considered the cause of another. Proximate cause is a flexible concept that requires a direct relation between injury and alleged conduct, often based on foreseeability. It serves to prevent liability in situations where the causal link is too attenuated. Restitution definitions expand when crimes involve conspiracy or pattern of misconduct, holding defendants accountable for foreseeable harm caused by coconspirators. Restitution may include losses from a different episode of the scheme than mentioned in the indictment, but the scheme must be the same. Courts are divided on which statutes qualify as \"scheme, conspiracy, or pattern\" laws. Some say it must be an element of the crime of conviction, while others disagree. Sections 3663 and 3663A describe these concepts. Sections 3663 and 3663A outline the circumstances in which representatives can act on behalf of victims for restitution orders. Governmental entities can qualify for restitution if they are victims of a crime. It is uncertain if victimization of one family member warrants restitution for others. The Supreme Court ruled that restitution under \u00a72259 is only appropriate if the defendant's offense directly caused a victim's losses. While \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A define victims similarly, they differ in the crimes for which restitution is allowed. Mandatory restitution under \u00a73663A applies to crimes of violence, offenses against property, and certain drug-related offenses. Section 16 of the law defines a crime of violence as an offense involving the use of physical force against another person or property, or any felony that poses a significant risk of using physical force. Courts have determined that certain offenses like threats, extortion, assault, harboring an illegal alien, burglary, and arson qualify as crimes of violence for restitution purposes under \u00a73663A. The Supreme Court has clarified that a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a716 does not include negligent or accidental offenses like DUI. Courts have ruled that possession of a pipe bomb or reckless vehicular assault may not qualify, but unauthorized use of a vehicle does. A controlled substance offense under \u00a73663A involves maintaining a place for drug activities. Property damage/fraud for restitution must be a violation under title 18 of the US Code. Conspiracy under title 18 can lead to mandatory restitution for conspiracy to commit property damage. The mandatory restitution requirements for defendants convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage in violation of federal law outside of title 18 include tampering with products affecting commerce or spreading false rumors of contamination. Section 670 prohibits theft or trafficking of pre-retail medical products. Restitution is required when there is an identifiable victim with physical injury or pecuniary loss, except in cases where the number of victims makes it impractical or introduces complexity into the sentencing process. Restitution requirements in federal law vary depending on the crime committed. Some federal statutes, such as 18 U.S.C. 43 (animal enterprise), 18 U.S.C. 228(d) (restitution child support cases), and others, authorize restitution in specific cases. These statutes apply procedures similar to \u00a7\u00a73663 and 3663A but for a narrower range of crimes and a wider range of losses. Section 3663 authorizes restitution in cases where mandatory restitution statutes do not apply, including certain trafficking offenses under the Controlled Substances Act and air safety prohibitions. Restitution can also be ordered as a condition of probation or supervised release, even for crimes not covered by \u00a7\u00a73663 or 3663A. It is a statutory provision that allows courts to order restitution in certain criminal cases. Restitution is authorized under \u00a7\u00a73663 or 3663A for property losses, bodily injuries, and participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense. The statutes call for property return or compensatory payments for victim restitution. Unlike sentencing guidelines, restitution is based only on actual losses, challenging courts with determining the measure of loss. Restitution under \u00a7\u00a73663 or 3663A covers property losses like salary of a faithless employee, insurance costs of a stolen car, or losses from mortgage fraud. Attorneys' fees may qualify as reimbursable property losses depending on circumstances. Recovery arguments are stronger when scurrilous litigation is integral to the crime. However, courts are less receptive when restitution is sought for civil litigation costs. Section 3663 allows courts to order payment for costs incurred by victims of identity theft. Restitution under \u00a7\u00a73663 or 3663A covers property losses such as salary of a faithless employee, insurance costs of a stolen car, or losses from mortgage fraud. Attorneys' fees may be considered reimbursable depending on circumstances. Section 3663 allows courts to order payment for costs incurred by victims of identity theft or aggravated identity theft. Community restitution may also be awarded to state victim assistance agencies and agencies dedicated to reducing substance abuse. Restitution is capped by the amount of the fine imposed for the offense, and may only be ordered in drug trafficking cases where a fine is imposed. The individual restitution sections focus on property damage or personal injury crimes. The child support restitution section adopts procedures from \u00a73663A for interstate evasion of child support orders, determining restitution based on state court support orders or governing state law, including interest on overdue support. The peonage restitution section, 18 U.S.C. 1593, provides compensation for victims of human trafficking offenses, including economic benefits from the victim's services and compensation for predicate crime-related injuries and losses. The telemarketing fraud restitution statute, 18 U.S.C. 2327, has been amended to align with general restitution provisions for losses caused by predicate crimes. The methamphetamine statute, 21 U.S.C. 853(q), covers cleanup costs for closing down illicit amphetamine operations. The statute 21 U.S.C. 853(q) covers cleanup costs for closing illicit amphetamine and methamphetamine production sites. The USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act expanded the section to include restitution for offenses involving possession, possession with intent to distribute, or manufacture of amphetamine and methamphetamine. Additionally, the animal enterprise interference section 18 U.S.C. 43(c) allows for restitution for specific damages caused by violating its proscriptions. Sections 3663 and 3663A have similar provisions for restitution for personal injuries. Sections 3663 and 3663A, along with 18 U.S.C. 2248, 2259, and 2264, authorize restitution for personal injuries, including medical expenses, lost income, rehabilitation, and funeral expenses. Restitution may also cover psychiatric and psychological treatment for physical injuries. The provisions extend to offenses related to sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, domestic violence, and stalking. The sections 3663 and 3663A, along with 18 U.S.C. 2248, 2259, and 2264, authorize restitution for personal injuries, including medical expenses, lost income, rehabilitation, and funeral expenses. Restitution may also cover psychiatric and psychological treatment for physical injuries related to offenses such as sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children, domestic violence, and stalking. The sections 110, 2259, and 2264 insist on restitution of the full amount of the victim's losses, define victims similarly to sections 3663 and 3663A, list losses for which restitution must be ordered, and do not require bodily injury as a precondition for awarding the cost of psychiatric treatments. They also have a catch-all clause not found in sections 3663 and 3663A, but do not authorize payments to third parties for crime-related victim treatment. The sections 3663 and 3663A authorize restitution for a victim's lost income, child care expenses, transportation costs, and other expenses related to their participation in the investigation and prosecution of a crime. Courts have debated whether private parties can recover investigation costs, including attorneys' fees, as a result of the defendant's wrongful conduct. However, one appellate court ruled that restitution cannot cover the costs of an organization's internal investigation if it was not required or requested by criminal investigators or prosecutors. The courts have clarified that corporations and legal entities are entitled to restitution under the provisions, including relocation expenses, lost wages, and attorneys' fees related to recovery. Governmental entities may receive restitution for qualifying offenses but not for investigating and prosecuting costs. Section 3664 governs the issuance of restitution orders upon a defendant's conviction. The court orders restitution upon a defendant's conviction, with the probation service investigating victims' losses. Prosecutors provide information, victims detail losses, and defendants disclose finances. The court resolves disputes based on evidence, with the prosecution proving losses and defendants addressing compensation. The court orders restitution for victims' losses, considering the defendant's financial situation. Payment can be in various forms, including lump sum, installments, or in-kind services. If necessary, nominal periodic payments may be ordered. The court may order nominal periodic payments for restitution if necessary, emphasizing the importance of a payment schedule. Restitution amount cannot consider victim compensation from insurance or other sources. It can be reduced if compensatory damages are recovered in a civil action. If victim losses are not fully determined within 10 days of sentencing, the government and probation officer must continue their efforts. The court must inform the court if victim losses are not fully determined within 10 days of sentencing. A date must be set within 90 days for the final determination of victim losses. The Supreme Court ruled that restitution can be ordered after the 90-day deadline if the defendant was aware. Victims can assign their right to receive payments to the Crime Victims Fund. There is debate over whether the court can order restitution to be paid to the Fund on its own initiative. The court may order restitution to be paid to the Crime Victims Fund if the victim refuses it, and can apportion restitution among multiple defendants. Joint and several liability may be imposed even if defendants are not co-defendants. The Supreme Court clarified how courts should handle restitution when non-co-defendants are responsible for a significant portion of the victim's losses, as seen in a case involving child pornography. The defendant in the case viewed child pornography involving the victim. The Court suggested that restitution should reflect the defendant's contribution to the harm caused, rather than holding them liable for all losses. Section 3664(i) states that the United States is to be served last for restitution. If the government is not a victim, the defendant cannot offset the restitution award with forfeited property. The government can receive restitution for losses incurred as a victim of an offense, with provisions for third-party compensation and adjustments based on the defendant's economic circumstances. The defendant cannot offset restitution with forfeited property if the government is not a victim. The section provides means to enforce restitution orders, including using collection mechanisms like garnishment and liens on the defendant's property. Restitution can be enforced through probation or supervised release conditions, and failure to pay may lead to revocation. Victims can also secure a lien in their name against the defendant's property for restitution payment. The victims' rights provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3771 ensure full and timely restitution for victims, enforceable through civil litigation against the defendant. The court's restitution order is final but can be corrected or modified later. The district court cannot reduce a restitution order without specific authority. Third parties do not have appellate rights regarding restitution orders. The lower federal courts have differing views on whether a restitution order abates if a defendant dies before final appeal. There is no consensus on this issue. The court may order restitution to victims of certain offenses under specific sections of the law, including Title 49. Restitution can also be ordered to the victim's estate or other parties as agreed upon in a plea agreement. The court considers the amount of loss to each victim and the financial situation of the defendant when determining restitution. The court may order restitution to victims of certain offenses under specific sections of the law, considering the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and their dependents. The court may decline to make an order of restitution if it complicates the sentencing process. The term \"victim\" includes those directly harmed by the offense, including individuals affected by criminal activities. The court may order restitution to victims of certain offenses, with the legal guardian or representative of the victim's estate assuming the victim's rights. The defendant cannot be named as the representative or guardian. Restitution may include returning property to the owner or paying an amount equal to the value of the property. The court may order restitution to victims of certain offenses, including payment for property damage, necessary medical services, therapy, rehabilitation, lost income, and funeral expenses in case of death. The court may order restitution to victims of certain offenses, including payment for property damage, necessary medical services, therapy, rehabilitation, lost income, funeral expenses, and other related costs. Restitution may also include reimbursing the victim for expenses related to participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense. Additionally, restitution can be made in services or money, as consented by the victim or their estate. In cases of specific offenses, the defendant may be required to pay for the time spent by the victim to remediate harm caused by the offense. When sentencing a defendant for certain drug-related offenses without a victim, the court may order restitution based on public harm caused by the offense. The amount of restitution ordered cannot exceed the fine for the offense. 65% of the restitution goes to the State entity for crime victim assistance. The court may order restitution for certain drug-related offenses without a victim, based on public harm caused by the offense. 35% of the restitution goes to the State entity for Federal substance abuse block grant funds. Requests for community restitution may be considered in plea agreements negotiated by the United States. The United States Sentencing Commission will provide guidelines for determining restitution amounts. The court shall order restitution for offenses described in subsection (c), with guidelines from the Sentencing Commission. Restitution must be made to the victim or their estate, and enforced according to Section 3664. The term \"victim\" refers to those directly harmed by the offense. The court orders restitution for offenses, with guidelines from the Sentencing Commission. Restitution must be made to the victim or their estate, including those directly harmed by the offense. Victims under 18, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased can have a legal guardian or representative assume their rights. The court may also order restitution to persons other than the victim if agreed upon in a plea agreement. In cases of offense resulting in damage to property, restitution includes returning the property to the owner or paying the value of the property. For offenses resulting in bodily injury, restitution covers the cost of necessary medical services and devices. Restitution for offenses resulting in bodily injury includes payment for necessary medical services, physical therapy, rehabilitation, lost income, funeral expenses in case of victim's death, and reimbursement for expenses incurred during investigation or prosecution. This applies to all sentencing proceedings for offenses classified as crimes of violence or property offenses. The section outlines conditions for restitution in cases involving specific offenses under the Controlled Substances Act, tampering with consumer products, or theft of medical products, where victims have suffered physical injury or financial loss. It also specifies requirements for plea agreements and exceptions for cases with a large number of victims or complex factual issues. The court shall order the probation officer to provide information for restitution orders, including victim losses and economic circumstances of defendants. Restitution orders are issued and enforced in accordance with Section 3664. The probation officer must inform the court if the number or identity of victims is unknown or if circumstances make it impracticable to ascertain. The court must disclose relevant report portions to the defendant and the Government's attorney. Restitution amounts must be provided by the Government's attorney, in consultation with victims, at least 60 days before sentencing. The only applicable rules for these proceedings are specified in this chapter and related rules. Prior to submitting the presentence report, the probation officer must notify identified victims of the offense, restitution amounts, and sentencing details. Victims have the opportunity to provide information on their losses and file an affidavit with the probation officer. Each defendant must submit a detailed affidavit to the probation officer. Each defendant must submit a detailed affidavit to the probation officer describing their financial resources, assets, financial needs, and earning ability. The court may request additional documentation or testimony after reviewing the probation officer's report. Victim's losses must be reported 10 days prior to sentencing. The court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing. If further losses are discovered, the victim has 60 days to petition for an amended restitution order. Any dispute on the amount of restitution will be resolved by the court based on the preponderance of evidence. The burden of proving the victim's loss lies with the Government attorney, while the defendant must demonstrate their financial resources and needs. The court must order full restitution to each victim without considering the defendant's economic circumstances or compensation from other sources. The court determines the amount of restitution owed to each victim and specifies the payment schedule based on the defendant's financial resources, earnings, and obligations. The restitution order may include single lump-sum payments, partial payments, in-kind payments, or a combination of these. If the defendant's economic circumstances do not allow for payment, nominal periodic payments may be ordered. The court may order restitution payments based on the defendant's financial situation, including in-kind payments or assigning payments to the Crime Victims Fund. Victims are not required to participate in the restitution process, and liability for restitution may be apportioned among multiple defendants. The court may order restitution payments based on the defendant's financial situation, including in-kind payments or assigning payments to the Crime Victims Fund. Restitution may be apportioned among multiple defendants based on their level of contribution to the victim's loss and economic circumstances. Different payment schedules may be provided for each victim, taking into account the type and amount of each victim's loss and their economic circumstances. If a victim has received compensation from insurance or another source, restitution must be paid to that provider before any restitution is paid to the victims. The restitution order mandates that victims receive payment before any compensation provider. Any restitution paid to a victim will be reduced by later compensatory damages recovered in federal or state civil proceedings. Defendants must inform the court and Attorney General of any significant economic changes affecting their ability to pay restitution. The Attorney General must certify that victims are notified of these changes. Upon notification of significant economic changes affecting restitution payment, the court may adjust the schedule or require immediate full payment. A conviction for an offense related to restitution estops the defendant from denying allegations in civil proceedings. Restitution orders can be enforced by the United States through various means, including issuing an abstract of judgment upon victim request. The clerk of the court issues an abstract of judgment certifying a restitution order in favor of the victim. The abstract becomes a lien on the defendant's property in the state, similar to a court judgment. In-kind restitution in the form of services is enforced by the probation officer. If a person obligated to pay restitution receives substantial resources during incarceration, they must apply the value to the restitution. A restitution order is considered a final judgment, even though it can be corrected, appealed, or adjusted. This section does not create a cause of action against the United States or its employees."
