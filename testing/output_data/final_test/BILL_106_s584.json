    "content": "The Act titled \"Children's Smoking Prevention, Health, and Learning Trust Fund Act of 1999\" allows for the waiver of recoupment under the Medicaid program of tobacco-related funds. The Act \"Children's Smoking Prevention, Health, and Learning Trust Fund Act of 1999\" amends Section 1903(d)(3) of the Social Security Act to exempt tobacco-related funds recovered by States from manufacturers from certain Medicaid requirements if specific conditions are met. The Act \"Children's Smoking Prevention, Health, and Learning Trust Fund Act of 1999\" requires that 50 percent of recovered tobacco-related funds be spent on tobacco use prevention programs and health care/early learning programs. The State must ensure that the level of funds expended for a program using the Federal share is not less than the State's previous fiscal year expenditure. The Federal share should supplement, not supplant, the State's funds for the program. The State must submit an annual report detailing the use of Federal funds. The State must submit an annual report detailing how the Federal share of recovered or paid amounts has been spent, including additional expenditures, number of participants, and services provided for each program funded. If a State can show that the Federal share supplements rather than supplants their funds, they can receive Federal funding. The Federal share of funds for treating tobacco-induced illnesses is less than 50 percent of the total amount recovered from settlements or judgments. Tobacco use prevention programs include counter-advertising, smoking cessation, school-based and community-based programs, enforcement of tobacco sale prohibitions to youth, and other State-initiated deterrent programs. Other State-initiated programs to deter tobacco use and assist individuals with nicotine addiction or smoking-induced disease include community health centers, prescription drug assistance for seniors, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, maternal and child health services, child care programs, and safe schools initiatives. State-initiated programs approved by the Secretary include making health insurance available to the uninsured, providing health services to the underserved or uninsured, reducing public health risks, supporting medical research, expanding access to clinical trials for individuals with serious illnesses, and awarding grants to communities for early childhood education opportunities. The State may use a portion of the Federal share for programs to assist tobacco farmers and workers affected by settlements or judgments. Amounts provided under certain laws shall not be reduced due to recovered funds. The text discusses the conditions under which federal funds can be offset from a state if they are not spent as required. It also prohibits the use of funds for administrative expenses related to pursuing tobacco litigation. The amendments apply to amounts recovered or paid to a State before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act for tobacco products manufacturers."
