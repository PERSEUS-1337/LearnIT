The \"Catalyst to Better Diabetes Care Act of 2007\" includes provisions for a Medicare diabetes screening program, an advisory group on employee wellness, a National Diabetes Report Card, vital statistics improvement, and a study on diabetes medical education. Congress recognizes diabetes as a growing public health issue in the US, with alarming statistics on its prevalence. In 2005, 1.5 million new cases of diabetes were diagnosed in adults, with 20.8 million Americans having diabetes, 7% of the US population. 6.2 million Americans are undiagnosed, and certain demographics are at higher risk for diabetes. Diabetes carries staggering costs, with $132 billion estimated in direct and indirect costs in 2002. 18% of Medicare population has diabetes, consuming 32% of the budget. In 2002, diabetes contributed to 224,092 deaths, likely underreported. Diabetes complications are underreported on death certificates, with only 35-40% of decedents having it listed and 10-15% as the underlying cause of death. Diabetes contributes to over 224,000 deaths annually, with risks of stroke and blindness being significantly higher among those with diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in America, with 44% of new cases in 2002 attributed to diabetes. In the same year, 44,400 Americans with diabetes started treatment for end-stage kidney disease, and 82,000 amputations were performed on individuals with diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can lead to birth defects and spontaneous abortions. Diabetes complications and costs can be prevented through early detection, education on self-management, and improved medical treatment. Primary care for diabetes complications could have saved $2.5 billion in hospital costs in 2001. Lifestyle interventions for prediabetes reduced diabetes development by 58%, especially among Americans aged 60 and over. Research shows lifestyle interventions for Americans aged 60 and over can reduce diabetes by 71%. Additionally, early detection and treatment of diabetic eye disease can decrease severe vision loss by 50-60%, comprehensive foot care programs can lower amputation rates by 45-85%, and managing diabetic kidney disease can reduce kidney function decline by 30-70%. The Medicare Diabetes Screening Collaboration and Outreach Program is established. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will review and address issues with diabetes screening benefit utilization and data collection. They will also establish an outreach program to identify existing efforts in various sectors to improve diabetes screening in the Medicare program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will collaborate to increase awareness of the diabetes screening benefit among Medicare beneficiaries and providers. They will also consult with various government units and entities interested in diabetes to maximize cost effectiveness and resource allocation in increasing utilization of the benefit. Advisory group established for diabetes and chronic illness employee wellness incentives and disease management best practices. The Secretary of Commerce establishes an advisory group with representatives from various sectors to examine and recommend best practices for chronic illness employee wellness programs. The group aims to provide improved information on the role of these programs in saving money and enhancing quality of life for patients with chronic illnesses. The advisory group established by the Secretary of Commerce will submit a report to key stakeholders one year after the enactment of the Act, detailing the results of their examination on effective chronic illness employee wellness programs. SEC. 4. NATIONAL DIABETES REPORT CARD. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, prepares a national diabetes report card biennially for the Nation and each State. The report includes health outcomes for individuals with diabetes and prediabetes, covering preventative care practices, quality of care, risk factors, and outcomes, with trend analysis in updated reports. The Secretary, in collaboration with the Director, prepares a national diabetes report card biennially for the Nation and each State. The report includes trend analysis for tracking progress in meeting national goals and informing policy development. The Report Card is made publicly available, including online. Improvement of vital statistics collection. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with relevant agencies and States, aims to promote physician education on birth and death certificate data, encourage adoption of updated certificate standards, and enhance vital statistics systems for accurate data collection. Additionally, the Secretary may advocate for additional language on death certificates. The Secretary may advocate for adding language to death certificates to improve collection of diabetes mortality data, including a question about whether the deceased had diabetes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study with the Institute of Medicine on the impact of diabetes on medical practice in the US and the required level of diabetes education for licensure. A report will be submitted to relevant committees within 2 years."
