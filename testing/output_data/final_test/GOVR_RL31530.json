    "content": "The U.S. Congress has long been concerned about the potential harm of hazardous chemical releases. The 1984 incident in Bhopal, India, led to legislative proposals to reduce chemical accident risks in the United States. Federal laws enacted in 1986 and 1990 aimed to mitigate accidental releases from manufacturing facilities and storage tanks. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 was also passed to protect the public during chemical transportation. Other laws coordinate response to chemical spills. The threat of terrorism after 9/11 prompted Congress to address chemical facility security through legislation establishing the Department of Homeland Security. Laws like the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act and Maritime Transportation Security Act require vulnerability assessments and security plans for some chemical facilities. Many other chemical facilities remain unregulated. The 109th Congress discussed the risks of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities and federal actions to prevent them. This report addresses existing and proposed requirements to reduce public exposure to hazardous chemicals from terrorist acts at U.S. facilities. It considers the potential harm from attacks on chemical facilities and the illicit use of these facilities to access hazardous chemicals. Federal requirements for emergency planning and response are also discussed. The report focuses on terrorist threats to chemical facilities, including recent trends in terrorist activity and vulnerability assessments. It also discusses federal mandates and incentives for reducing risks of accidental releases from chemical facilities, as well as recent initiatives to improve chemical site security and relevant legislation in the 109th Congress. Potential terrorist acts against chemical facilities can be categorized into direct attacks on facilities or chemicals, or efforts to gain access to harmful materials using business contacts. Terrorists, whether employees or outsiders, may use traditional or nontraditional weapons like explosives, firearms, or computer programs. They may aim to use chemicals as weapons or to make explosives, poisons, or caustics. Access to chemicals can be obtained by physically entering a facility and stealing supplies or using legitimate or fraudulent credentials. According to FBI testimony, there were 353 known or suspected acts of terrorism in the US between 1980 and 2001, with only a few involving chemical facilities. Attacks in the 1990s resulted in 182 deaths and over 1,932 injuries, showing an increase in casualties compared to the 1980s. This trend of declining terrorist acts but increasing casualties was also seen internationally. In 2001, there were 2,689 people killed in the US due to international terrorism, marking a dramatic escalation in destructive attacks. The trend towards more indiscriminate targeting among international terrorists was evident, with the September 11 attack reflecting this shift. The September 11 attack was the first known case of suicide attacks by international terrorists in the US, marking a significant escalation in destructive attacks. Intelligence agencies noted an increase in activity by loosely affiliated extremists, with a focus on producing mass casualties. Chemical and biological terrorism attempts increased in the 1990s, with a growing interest in chemical weapons by terrorist groups. Explosives remained the most frequently employed weapons by both international and domestic terrorists. During the 1990s, terrorists attempted to use explosives to release chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities, both internationally and domestically. Attacks occurred in war zones like Croatia and the United States, targeting facilities close to population centers. Evidence suggests that U.S. chemical facilities could be used by terrorists to access chemicals. Nidal Ayyad, a naturalized U.S. citizen and chemical engineer, used company stationery to order bomb ingredients. Some suppliers raised concerns, but others did not. The bombers stole cyanide and planned to introduce it into office buildings' ventilation systems. Chemical trade publications were found in al Qaeda hideaways, highlighting the importance of risk assessment in understanding hazards and adverse effects. The risk of terrorist activity targeting chemical facilities is challenging to assess due to limited prior examples, numerous factors influencing risks, and dynamic interactions among these factors. Most experts have not quantified the dynamic and changing risks of terrorism, especially in relation to chemical terrorism. Existing analyses are speculative and qualitative, with a focus on the acquisition and use of chemical weapons. Reports suggest a high likelihood of future terrorist use of chemical agents, with increasing risks according to some experts. Experts believe that the proliferation and use of chemical weapons is increasing due to eroding inhibiting factors. The combination of chemical and strategic skills needed to create these weapons no longer limits terrorists, as they can affiliate with others possessing complementary skills. The rising global education level and ease of communication through the Internet have made it easier for terrorist groups to acquire the necessary training in chemical engineering. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report from 1999 highlighted conflicting statements on the ease of terrorists disseminating chemical or biological agents on U.S. soil to cause mass casualties. The report concluded that the difficulty for terrorists to cause over 1,000 casualties depends on the selected agent. Experts from various fields stated that terrorists do not need sophisticated knowledge to use toxic industrial chemicals like chlorine, but would require more sophistication to cause mass casualties with other chemicals or biological agents. Less sophisticated terrorists could still create and disseminate chemical or biological weapons, but these would be less likely to result in mass casualties. Some factors that may have deterred chemical use by terrorists in the past may not apply to loosely affiliated groups. For instance, terrorists supported by nation-states have been hesitant to use chemical weapons due to fear of offending other nations, especially if their sponsors are part of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Experts believe that the risk of terrorism involving chemical weapons is small, as terrorists may not be deterred by factors such as fear of retaliation or environmental damage. Occupational safety is also not a concern for terrorists who are willing to sacrifice their lives for a cause. The risk of chemical or biological weapons in terrorist attacks is low, with few fatalities compared to conventional explosives. An analysis of 105 U.S. incidents from 1900 to 1998 showed only one fatality from such an attack. Chemical agents are considered the least lethal of weapons of mass destruction due to difficulties in production and delivery. Chemical facilities in the United States store large quantities of industrial chemicals and pesticides, posing a potential risk for terrorist attacks. Hazard assessments and accident reports are used to estimate the damage terrorists could cause using existing chemical facilities. Publicly available data is used for these estimates, focusing on accidental releases rather than intentional attacks. The report \"Too Close to Home: Chemical Accident Risks in the United States\" by US PIRG and the National Environmental Law Center highlighted that over 41 million Americans live near chemical facilities with potential toxic cloud risks. These facilities have \"vulnerable zones\" extending over three miles from them, putting residents at risk. The estimate may actually be higher due to conservative assumptions used in the study. The study author used EPA methodology and data from the Toxics Release Inventory to estimate the distance of vulnerable zones around chemical facilities. Belke's analysis found median distances of 1.6 miles for toxic worst case scenarios and 0.4 miles for flammable worst case scenarios, with some facilities reporting zones extending up to 14 miles. Belke analyzed vulnerable zones around chemical facilities, with distances up to 25 miles for chlorine stored in rail tank cars. Other chemicals with vulnerable zones exceeding 25 miles include anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, sulfur dioxide, and more. The median population \"affected\" in worst-case accidents was 15 for flammable substances and 1,500 for toxic substances. EPA further analyzed risk management plans submitted. The EPA analyzed risk management plans from facilities handling chemicals covered by the CAA Section 112, revealing that over 123 plants had worst-case scenarios with vulnerability zones affecting more than a million people. Additionally, more than 700 plants could threaten 100,000 people, and at least 3,000 facilities could threaten 10,000 people. The DOJ found that over 7,000 facilities projected worst-case scenarios for toxic substances affecting over 1,000 people, while almost 1,700 facilities reported less extreme accidents potentially affecting the same number of people. The Center for Risk Management at the Wharton School summarized accidents reported by 1,145 facilities between 1994 and 1999. Half of the chemicals required for risk management planning were involved in accidents, resulting in 1,897 injuries and 33 deaths to employees. Over 200,000 residents were affected by evacuations and shelter-in-place incidents. The Wharton group found that larger facilities had increased risks of chemical releases and worker injuries. Facilities handling more chemicals had higher accident rates, with the largest manufacturers having almost 100% probability of experiencing a chemical accident. Toxic chemicals were linked to worker injuries, while flammable chemicals were linked to property damage. No regional trends in accident rates were observed. Risk management plans submitted to the EPA report worst-case potentially affected populations. Risk management plans submitted to the EPA may underestimate the potentially affected population in the event of a terrorist attack. Around 70% of RMP facilities have chemicals in quantities greater than a single process, with some facilities having 100 times more chemical on-site than in the worst-case scenario calculation. This could lead to an understatement of the consequences of a terrorist attack compared to accidental releases. The U.S. Army Surgeon General conducted a classified study on the potential casualties of a terrorist attack involving a chemical release in a densely populated area. The study estimated that such an attack could injure or kill as many as 2.4 million people, with even middle-range casualty estimates reaching 903,400 people. This estimate was lower than the casualties expected from a biological weapons attack. The Department of Homeland Security estimated potential fatalities from a chemical release at industrial plants to prioritize inspections. DHS identified facilities threatening over a million people downwind and selected 360 sites for attention based on casualty estimates. In July 2004, the Homeland Security Council issued 15 national planning scenarios for homeland security preparedness, including scenarios on a terrorist attack on a petroleum refinery and a chlorine release from an industrial facility. Initial estimates for the refinery attack included 350 fatalities and 1,000 casualties, while the chlorine release scenario predicted 17,500 fatalities, 10,000 severe injuries, and 100,000 additional casualties. Recent DHS calculations have revised these estimates, with the highest-risk facility in the US now projected to have under 10,000 potential fatalities and less than 40,000 affected individuals. Prior to September 11, an assessment of chemical plant site security by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) was considered the most comprehensive analysis publicly available. ATSDR researchers reviewed national statistics on domestic terrorism compiled by the FBI in 1995 and interviewed security staff from facilities and potential targets. Selected newspaper accounts and investigative reports indicate that reporters have been able to visit various facilities without supervision. The ATSDR conducted a comprehensive analysis of chemical plant security, finding that security ranged from fair to very poor. Security managers were pessimistic about deterring sabotage by employees and had not implemented background checks. Corporate security staff were not trained to identify common chemicals that could be used as explosives. DOJ report noted that chemical manufacturing plants were identified as potential terrorist targets. The DOJ released a study in April 2000, warning of the real and credible risk of terrorism targeting chemical plants due to lax security measures. An investigation in 2002 found that over two dozen potentially dangerous plants in western Pennsylvania had inadequate security. The security at 30 sites in western Pennsylvania was found to be so lax that a reporter could easily access key targets for terrorists. These sites were among the 123 nationwide with potential risks to over 1,000,000 residents in case of an accident or attack. The investigation also included plants in Houston, Baltimore, and Chicago, highlighting the need for improved security measures at chemical plants. The investigation of 30 additional plants in Houston, Baltimore, and Chicago revealed lax security measures, allowing easy access to sensitive areas. Employees and contractors were found to provide directions to critical areas, and access was granted due to various vulnerabilities. While some companies have improved security recently, the president emphasized that ensuring complete security will take time. The president of the Pennsylvania Chemical Industry Council acknowledges that ensuring security at chemical facilities is a gradual process that can be costly. Companies like U.S. Steel and members of the American Chemistry Council have invested significant amounts in equipping response teams and enhancing security measures since 9/11. Despite efforts to improve security, there are still vulnerabilities in some facilities, as highlighted by Robert Full's testimony before a government committee in 2004. In 2004, surveys were conducted at 189 U.S. chemical facilities where workers expressed concerns about inadequate security measures, with 125 facilities having hazardous materials that could cause catastrophic events if released. Workers believed that most plants had improved security systems and conducted drills to respond to terrorist threats. According to surveys, many U.S. chemical facilities lack proper communication, training, and equipment for emergency response to terrorist threats. Most plants have not discussed terrorist concerns with neighbors. The risk of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities in the U.S. is historically low compared to other hazards. The risk of terrorist attacks on chemical facilities in the U.S. is historically low. However, overall risks to chemical facilities may be increasing. Limited evidence suggests that chemical facilities may be vulnerable to criminal and terrorist attacks. Federal laws like EPCRA and the Clean Air Act aim to reduce risks associated with hazardous chemical releases. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (P.L. 99-499) mandated the establishment of State Emergency Response Commissions (SERCs) and Local Emergency Response Committees (LEPCs) to coordinate planning and response to large releases of hazardous substances. Facility operators are required to prepare contingency plans and provide information to local officials and emergency responders about chemicals present at facilities. EPCRA also requires local officials to inform the public about emergency plans and chemical hazards. Facility managers may reduce the use of toxic materials to avoid reporting requirements under EPCRA. The act encourages risk reduction but does not mandate facilities to assess or reduce chemical release risks. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to address catastrophic chemical releases. The Clean Air Act was amended in 1990 to mandate EPA oversight of risk management planning at facilities handling hazardous substances. The act defined hazardous substances and directed EPA to designate chemicals posing the greatest risks based on specific criteria. EPA promulgated a list of acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, volatile flammable liquids, and high explosive substances. The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandated EPA oversight of risk management planning for facilities handling hazardous substances. EPA designated chemicals with the greatest risks, including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, volatile flammable liquids, and high explosive substances. The act imposes a general duty on facility owners to prevent accidental releases and provide emergency response to protect human health and the environment. The Clean Air Act of 1990 requires owners of facilities handling hazardous substances to prepare Risk Management Plans (RMPs) to prevent releases and mitigate damage. Plans must be submitted to EPA every five years, with updates required by June 2004. EPA delegates review responsibilities to some states and localities. In October 1996, the Accident Prevention Subcommittee of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee created the Electronic Submission Workgroup to address issues with an electronic database of risk management plans. In spring 1997, the workgroup agreed that EPA should provide full access to most RMP information online, but there were concerns about access to OCA data due to security risks. A security study was recommended to assess the potential risks of putting OCA data on the Internet. The security study conducted by Aegis Research Corporation, ICF Incorporated, and Science Applications International Corporation for the EPA concluded that the risk of terrorist attacks was slightly higher with unrestricted availability of RMP with OCA data on the Internet. National security concerns led to discussions with the FBI and other federal agencies, resulting in an agreement in October 1998 that OCA data would not be included in RMP. An interagency agreement in late October 1998 determined that OCA data would not be included in RMP information on the Internet. Instead, limited access to OCA data would be available upon request, with restrictions on anonymity. Concerns about OCA data distribution via the Internet led to draft legislation submitted to Congress in May 1999, amending the CAA to exempt OCA data from FOIA disclosure and restrict public availability until further guidance from EPA and DOJ. The final RMP regulation on data access was published in August 2000, allowing public access to sensitive OCA information through federal reading rooms and online for data elements with low criminal risk. State and local agencies are encouraged to provide read-only access to OCA information on local facilities. Public access is limited to 10 facilities per month at federal reading rooms and all facilities with potential effects in the jurisdiction of the local emergency planning committee. Sharing OCA information is allowed as long as it does not include sensitive portions of the RMP or electronic databases developed by EPA. The Clinton Administration proposed a rule allowing public access to facility plans outside local areas and for qualified researchers. The draft plan was rescinded by the Bush Administration. The 1999 Act directed GAO to report on the adequacy of chemical information submitted to emergency response personnel. GAO found that industries are generally complying with reporting requirements. The 1999 Act directed GAO to report on the adequacy of chemical information submitted to emergency response personnel. GAO found that industries are generally complying with reporting requirements. DOJ was directed to report to Congress on the effectiveness of RMP regulations in detecting and preventing criminal activity, facility vulnerability, industry practices regarding site security, and transportation security of regulated substances. The DOJ missed deadlines for reporting to Congress on RMP regulations. NRDC filed a lawsuit for the delay, but later dismissed it. A GAO study found DOJ failed to complete the mandated study despite having funds. After the events of September 11, 2001, the EPA restricted Internet access to \"sensitive\" facility data to prevent vulnerability to terrorist attacks. This included removing facility-specific information from its website, which was later made available through OMB Watch's Right-to-Know Network after a complaint was filed in court. After September 11, 2001, EPA restricted access to sensitive facility data online. OMB Watch filed a complaint, leading to the release of an electronic database in July 2005. EPA then limited access to Envirofacts in March 2002. President Bush later granted the EPA Administrator authority to classify information as \"secret\" for national security reasons. Increased communication among government officials and facility owners followed the 9/11 attacks. After 9/11, increased communication among government officials and facility owners led to EPA advising pesticide companies and drinking water utilities on enhancing security measures. The White House released a national strategy for protecting critical infrastructures and assets in 2003. The national strategy released in 2003 focused on securing critical infrastructures like chemical facilities in connection with the chemical industry, water, and energy sectors. EPA and DOE were designated as lead agencies for different sectors to protect public health, safety, and economic stability from potential threats. The 2003 national strategy aimed to secure critical infrastructures, including chemical facilities, to prevent malicious use of hazardous chemicals. It highlighted the lack of clear federal authority for uniform security standards and proposed legislation for vulnerability assessments and risk reduction at chemical facilities. EPA and DHS were suggested to review laws on toxic pesticides. The 2003 national strategy focused on securing critical infrastructures, including chemical facilities, to prevent malicious use of hazardous chemicals. It proposed legislation for vulnerability assessments and risk reduction at chemical facilities, emphasizing the need for clear federal authority for uniform security standards. The Strategy also highlighted the importance of water security against terrorism post-9/11 and the challenges facing the water sector in protecting against intentional release of toxic chemicals. EPA and DHS were recommended to improve monitoring, information exchange, and contingency planning to enhance security. The Strategy proposed that DHS and DOE collaborate with state and local governments and industry to enhance energy sector reliability and redundancy. They were to work with oil and natural gas industry representatives to establish consistent criteria for criticality, vulnerability assessments, and physical security training. An advisory task force would be convened to identify planning requirements, and regional and national programs for industry development. The Strategy proposed collaboration between DHS, DOE, and industry to develop regional and national programs for identifying spare parts in emergencies. Operation Liberty Shield was launched for additional security, focusing on critical infrastructure like chemical plants. HSPD 7 transferred EPA authority to DHS for overseeing security. Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 7 transferred EPA authority to DHS for overseeing the security of chemical facilities, designating DHS as the lead agency for the chemical sector. DHS is required to identify, prioritize, and coordinate protection efforts for critical infrastructure and key resources in the chemical sector to prevent catastrophic health effects or mass casualties. Vulnerability assessments and risk management strategies are also encouraged to mitigate the effects of potential attacks. The American Chemistry Council, the Chlorine Institute, Inc., and the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association issued Site Security Guidelines for the U.S. Chemical Industry on October 23, 2001, in response to Security Presidential Directive 7. The guidelines aim to reduce the consequences of catastrophic failures not caused by terrorism and enhance site security measures. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued Responsible Care\u00ae Employee Health and Safety Code in response to public concerns about chemical manufacturing. ACC members commit to improving health, safety, and environmental performance, listening to public concerns, and reporting progress. ACC has about 130 corporate members with 2,000 chemical facilities, covering almost 90% of U.S. chemical capacity. Half of ACC facilities comply with CAA Section 112(r) for risk management planning. ACC's site security guidelines are general and must be customized by chemical companies. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued a Security Code of Management Practices in April 2002 to improve security performance for chemical companies. The code, approved by the ACC Board of Directors in June 2002, requires members to assess vulnerabilities and implement security enhancements based on risk assessments conducted using specific methodologies. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued a Security Code of Management Practices in April 2002 to improve security performance for chemical companies. Members are required to assess vulnerabilities and implement security enhancements based on risk assessments. ACC members completed site vulnerability assessments for their highest priority facilities by the end of 2002 and implemented security measures at all facilities by early 2005. The American Chemistry Council (ACC) and other chemical trade organizations have spent over $2 billion since September 11 to enhance security measures at their facilities. They have developed guidelines, a management code, and a risk-based methodology to reduce the risks of chemical terrorism. ACC has also collaborated with the Association of American Railroads to ensure the safety of communities near chemical and rail facilities. The Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) has developed a vulnerability assessment methodology for smaller chemical producers, while pesticide and fertilizer distributors have tailored a methodology for rural facilities. The American Petroleum Institute has also published security guidelines in consultation with the Department of Energy. GAO examined these voluntary initiatives in a report released in March 2003. The extent of security preparedness at U.S. chemical facilities is unknown due to the lack of federal requirements for vulnerability assessments and oversight. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates vulnerability assessments for community water systems. The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 mandates vulnerability assessments for community water systems and authorizes funding to assist in compliance. EPA is directed to review methods to prevent, detect, and respond to threats to water safety and infrastructure security, with funding provided to enhance the security of drinking water treatment facilities. The Maritime Transportation Security Act requires port facilities to develop security and incident response plans to prevent transportation security incidents. The Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) mandates security plans for port facilities to prevent security incidents, align with national security plans, and meet U.S. Coast Guard requirements. DHS must approve each plan and there is a grant program for security upgrades. While P.L. 107-296 establishing DHS does not directly address chemical plant security, it requires vulnerability analysis and security enhancement recommendations for critical infrastructure, including chemical facilities. Chemical facilities are considered part of critical infrastructure in the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets. The law exempts chemical facilities from public disclosure requirements regarding physical and cyber security if information is voluntarily submitted to DHS for the security of critical infrastructure. Unauthorized disclosure is punishable by imprisonment, fines, and removal from office. The 108th Congress amended the MTSA in 2004 to require DHS to submit a plan for a maritime security grant program. The 109th Congress enacted security provisions for high-risk chemical facilities, giving DHS authority to issue regulations, establish security standards, and order compliance. Noncompliance may result in civil penalties, with the possibility of ceasing operations for repeated failures. Criminal penalties are authorized for unauthorized disclosure of protected information. The 109th Congress enacted security provisions for high-risk chemical facilities, giving DHS authority to issue regulations and establish security standards. Noncompliance may lead to civil penalties or ceasing operations. Policy makers reconsidered federal policy options post-9/11 regarding potential terrorist threats to chemical facilities, with various strategies proposed. Congress could rely on existing mechanisms to continuously evaluate and improve site security. The events of September 11, 2001, have prompted increased efforts by government officials and facility operators to prevent chemical hazards. Some state and local governments have implemented additional security requirements, while trade associations have developed vulnerability assessment methodologies. The establishment of DHS and security directives ensure a federal role in chemical facility security planning. The DHS plays a key role in chemical facility security planning by identifying high-risk facilities, requiring vulnerability assessments, and overseeing compliance with security plans. However, there are concerns about the limited authority of DHS and the need for additional information before addressing security measures. Congress could consider establishing a Blue Ribbon Panel or requesting a study by the National Academy of Sciences to gather more insights on terrorism risks, accident risks, public interest group perspectives, and the effectiveness of public disclosure in reducing risks. Congress could provide additional resources or increase oversight for implementing existing statutes to address chemical releases from criminal or terrorist acts. EPA has the authority to encourage facilities to enhance their security against terrorists, with more resources potentially aiding in the review of facility risk management plans. EPA had only reviewed 15% of submitted plans by September 2001, as reported by GAO. The EPA has reviewed only 15% of submitted plans, with public interest groups urging for more interpretation of risk management planning requirements. Suggestions include requiring companies to identify safer technologies and providing technical assistance or incentives for risk reduction. EPA is considering revisions to the risk management planning rule to encourage chemical facility owners to assess their vulnerability. The EPA is considering revisions to the risk management planning rule to encourage chemical facility owners to assess their vulnerability to terrorists and correct any significant weaknesses. However, EPA's authority to regulate chemical site security is unclear, and President Bush does not envision a large role for EPA in security from terrorism. Congress may need to clarify EPA authority through legislation. The EPA is considering revisions to the risk management planning rule to encourage chemical facility owners to assess vulnerability to terrorists. Congress may need to clarify EPA authority through legislation or provide oversight and guidance for DHS implementation of chemical security provisions. The EPA is considering revisions to the risk management planning rule to encourage chemical facility owners to assess vulnerability to terrorists. Congress may need to enact legislation requiring chemical facilities to assess vulnerability and take corrective action. If needed, proposals might focus on preventing terrorism in general or specifically targeting chemical plants. Interested readers can refer to CRS Report RL33600 for more information. A focus on chemical plants could incentivize private sector initiatives or new regulations to reduce risks. Economists suggest a blended approach of performance-based regulation and insurance coverage against terrorist acts. Stakeholder views on voluntary versus mandatory approaches are discussed. Legislation in the 109th Congress is described. Strategies for improving site security, such as \"hardening\" defenses, are common. Improving site security involves \"hardening\" defenses to make sites less vulnerable to terrorists. This includes tactics like increasing security patrols, strengthening fences, installing better locks, and conducting background checks on employees. Congress has adopted similar tactics in other contexts, such as requiring background checks for licenses to transport hazardous materials. Improving site security involves \"hardening\" defenses to make sites less vulnerable to terrorists by adding layers of protection and adapting to various security needs. However, a potential weakness of this strategy is that determined terrorist organizations could still disable or overwhelm even the most effective security measures. Environmental groups advocate for reducing risk by decreasing the hazardous characteristics of facilities, such as by reducing production, processing, storage, and use of dangerous chemicals. Advocates promote improving site safety by using inherently safer technologies (IST) to reduce the risks associated with hazardous chemicals. This approach focuses on redesigning production systems, reducing chemical inventories, and substituting hazardous chemicals to prevent accidents and mitigate the consequences of terrorism. Currently, there is no federal U.S. law explicitly promoting the use of IST in the chemical industry. Efforts to promote inherent safety in production could address gaps in current laws and reduce accidental chemical releases. The chemical industry has embraced the concept of inherent safety, leading to the adoption of safer technologies by facility operators. For example, a utility in Ohio opted for a urea-based pollution control system over one requiring large ammonia storage, while the Blue Plains wastewater treatment facility in Washington D.C. switched from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite bleach after September 11. Some water and wastewater treatment plants are transitioning from chlorine to sodium hypochlorite bleach for safety reasons. However, this shift may lead to higher production costs, delays in security implementation, and potential feasibility issues. Advocates argue that safer technologies could reduce overall costs by lessening regulatory burdens and waste disposal expenses. Nonetheless, there is a concern that these \"safer\" tactics may simply transfer risks to other locations or populations, or introduce new risks in the process. The third approach to reducing risks involves making dangerous chemicals less attractive to criminals by using taggants or storing antidotes. Taggants may impede chemical processes and are only useful in end products. Deterrents are still in the development stage and not readily available. The 106th Congress amended CAA Section 112(r) to prevent Internet posting of risk management plans for chemical facilities to reduce terrorism risk. P.L. 107-296 established DHS to limit access to sensitive information useful to terrorists. Some argue that restricting information goes against American values and reduces public oversight of chemical facilities. Restricting access to information on chemical facilities is controversial as it goes against American values, reduces public oversight, and may not deter determined terrorist groups. Policymakers face political issues regarding public disclosure, risk importance, and accountability in reducing terrorist risks at chemical plants. Chemical industry and trade groups oppose releasing information on facility vulnerability to terrorism and off-site consequences, citing security concerns. Environmental advocates argue for public disclosure to inform communities and ensure facility accountability. Citizens need information to assess compliance and seek enforcement if necessary. Advocates push for public disclosure of unsafe practices and risk management plans to empower communities to pressure plant managers for safety improvements. They also seek access to information on similar facilities nationwide to compare safety measures and accident rates. This transparency is supported by Congress and investment groups for informed decision-making. The GAO reported in 2004 that the clarity of environmental disclosure requirements by the SEC is disputed. Stakeholders disagree on the definition, extent of disclosure by companies, and adequacy of SEC enforcement. Public disclosure of chemical hazards is argued to motivate operators to reduce risks, benefiting public health and reducing the risk of terrorist attacks. The public disclosure of chemical hazards is debated for its impact on public health and the environment, with questions on the effectiveness of disclosure in reducing risks from accidents and terrorism. Federal laws may preempt state and local disclosure laws, limiting the release of information related to critical infrastructure security. The diverse goals in discussions of chemical site security enhancement include addressing risks, prioritizing the \"greatest risks,\" and deciding on resource allocation for preventive measures or emergency response services. There is a lack of consensus on which risks are the most significant and how to target them effectively. The discussion revolves around the risks posed by explosions or firearms, the need to reduce terrorist risks while preparing for other disasters, and the trade-offs between sacrificing privacy and government accountability for risk reduction. Value judgments will determine policy approaches and decisions on allocating federal resources to DHS for terrorism threat reduction. The efficiency of federal expenditures is debated, with arguments for allocating more funding to programs targeting higher risks and risk reduction opportunities. Relatively more federal funding should be allocated to programs addressing greater and well-documented risks, such as smoking and motor vehicle accidents, rather than small, hypothetical risks like pesticide residues. The discussion questions the allocation of resources for chemical terrorism, highlighting the vulnerability of some facilities to attack. The debate includes considerations of worst-case scenarios and the cost-benefit analysis of investing in additional security measures. Some argue that federal resources should focus on preventing catastrophic terrorist acts, such as nuclear, chemical, or biological attacks at key locations like airports and stadiums. This approach prioritizes avoiding large-scale disasters that can overwhelm local resources, as seen in events like the World Trade Center attack and Hurricane season of 2005. President Bush has directed the DHS Secretary to set priorities for critical infrastructure protection with an emphasis on infrastructure and resources that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. DHS is developing a vulnerability-assessment tool starting with the nuclear energy and chemical sectors, followed by others with top-tier consequences, vulnerabilities, and threats. Some object to using cost-benefit analysis for public health. Some object to using cost-benefit analysis for public health and environmental risk management, as it may not consider important risk factors and management options. Quantitative analysis may be biased against preventive measures, estimating high short-term costs and uncertain long-term benefits. The responsibility for achieving results in public health and environmental risk management involves various factors such as statutory authority, resource availability, technical competence, and moral constraints. It may be shared among private and public entities, with decisions on distribution made by policymakers. In the case of chemical plant safety, responsibility is likely divided among owners/operators, insurers, and government units. The federal government is generally seen as responsible for protecting citizens and the homeland, while business owners also have a role. Different views exist on who should be accountable for the consequences of terrorism acts, the level of risk protection needed, and the role of the private sector in achieving safety. These views are influenced by political philosophies and attitudes towards government and industry. Some argue that terrorism risks for chemical facilities are minimal, leading to doubts about facility managers' preparedness. Some argue that federal standards for risk management should be mandated for chemical facilities to ensure greater safety, as voluntary security measures are deemed insufficient. This is because federally mandated standards allow for public comments and accountability by the government. Some chemical facilities lack standards, timelines, hazard reduction policies, measurable goals, and accountability. Approximately 20% of hazardous facilities are not covered by industry security codes or MTSA, raising concerns about their security against terrorist acts. Operators may be willing to reduce risks for various reasons, as well-managed businesses prioritize and manage all kinds of risks, including those from hazardous chemicals and potential terrorist acts. Business incentives for good chemical risk management include reduced legal liability, insurance costs, enhanced reputation, improved employee relations, and reduced remediation and victim compensation costs. Some oppose new legislation that may delay security enhancements, while others believe it could shift liability to the government and discourage diverse regulatory strategies. Industry representatives acknowledge the need for guidance, training, and financial assistance for threat assessment and risk management, especially for small businesses. Trade associations and industrial research centers have been working to address risks to small businesses by advocating a flexible, risk-based approach to securing facilities. Some business groups argue against one-size-fits-all regulations and recommend a safety certification process for assurance. The Bush Administration recommended legislation to enhance security measures at chemical facilities in the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets. The Bush Administration recommended legislation to enhance security measures at chemical facilities, with financial responsibility assigned to owners. Some pesticide trade groups seek government funding for education. Despite news reports suggesting a change in policy, the Administration remains willing to work with Congress for new regulatory authority. The Bush Administration recommended legislation to enhance security at chemical facilities, with financial responsibility on owners. The Administration supports risk-based regulation of chemical security. The 109th Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 109-295) authorizing DHS to oversee facility vulnerability studies and set performance standards. Others preferred legislation (H.R. 2237) requiring submission of assessments and plans to EPA. Legislation to enhance security at chemical facilities was introduced in previous Congresses, but none were enacted. The fate of legislation in the 109th Congress was affected by a shift in committee structure. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs led the development of legislation in the Senate, while concerns about coverage of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities led to a hold on the bill by Senator Inhofe. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance security at chemical facilities. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs led the Senate's development of the bill, while concerns about coverage of drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities led to a hold on the bill by Senator Inhofe. The Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce supported an amendment to the DHS FY2007 appropriations bill, which became law in October 2006. P.L. 109-295 provides DHS with authority to issue regulations for high-risk chemical facilities for three years. In the 109th Congress, legislation was introduced to enhance security at chemical facilities. Senator Collins introduced S. 2145, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act, in December 2005. The bill was co-sponsored by Senator Lieberman and amended by the HSGAC in June 2006. S. 2145 would direct the Secretary of DHS to designate chemical sources for regulation. The DHS would promulgate rules for designating chemical sources for regulation based on risk tiers and security standards. Facilities producing, using, or storing substances triggering risk management planning requirements would be considered for listing. Designated facilities would submit vulnerability assessments, security plans, and emergency response plans to DHS. S. 2145 would require facilities to submit vulnerability assessments, security plans, and emergency response plans to DHS for review. Facilities in higher risk tiers would need DHS approval within 21 months. Reporting to DHS is mandatory for facilities handling designated substances, with plans needing to coordinate security measures with government officials. Plans must aim to deter terrorist incidents to the maximum extent possible. S. 2145 aims to prevent terrorist incidents at chemical facilities by requiring vulnerability assessments and security plans to be submitted to DHS. The bill includes penalties for noncompliance, whistleblower protection, and coordination with existing security and emergency response planning. Regional security offices and area security committees would be established under the bill. S. 2145 establishes regional security offices and area security committees and plans. State and local laws would not be preempted unless in \"actual conflict\" with federal law. The bill prohibits the release of vulnerability assessments and security plans to the public. It also requires public disclosure of compliance certifications by facility owners/operators and DHS certificates of compliance, unless it poses a security risk. S. 2145 was modified to prohibit disclosure of certain documents to prevent security risks. It also specifies judicial review procedures for final agency actions, allowing challenges to final rules in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and challenges to other final actions in district courts. S. 2145 authorizes judicial review of final regulations, with only owners or operators of chemical sources allowed to file petitions. Senator Lautenberg introduced the Chemical Security and Safety Act of 2006 (S. 2486) addressing security at \"stationary sources\" under CAA Section 112(r)(2) and other designated facilities. S. 2486, the Chemical Security and Safety Act of 2006, establishes a general duty for stationary sources to identify and reduce hazards from criminal releases of substances. Owners or operators must involve employees in ensuring safe facilities, including the use of inherently safer technology to minimize risks to public health and safety. The Chemical Security and Safety Act of 2006 requires facilities to reduce hazards associated with substance releases. The DHS Secretary, in consultation with the EPA Administrator, designates high-priority facilities based on various factors. The Chemical Security and Safety Act of 2006 mandates the identification of the 600 highest priority stationary sources for vulnerability assessments and hazard prevention plans. Owners must submit reports to DHS, including consultation with employees, and comply with DHS regulations for approval. An information clearinghouse would be established to assist in this process. S. 2486 establishes an information clearinghouse to assist facilities in complying with requirements and provides penalties for noncompliance. DHS can issue compliance orders for terrorist attack threats beyond submitted plans, with judicial relief possible for persistent noncompliance. The bill also mandates annual employee training at all stationary sources. S. 2486 establishes Safety and Security Committees at stationary sources with 15 or more employees to address hazards and risks. The bill also includes protections for whistle-blowers and penalties for noncompliance with worker protections. S. 2486 mandates updates for vulnerability assessments and security plans, coordination with the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and protection of DHS information from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Protection is provided for information at federal agencies, while state and local government agencies are exempt from disclosure requirements. H.R. 5695, introduced by Representative Daniel E. Lungren, includes provisions not found in S. 2486 and is described as more \"streamlined.\" H.R. 5695 would amend the Homeland Security Act to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate chemical substances of concern and threshold quantities for regulation based on potential harm from terrorist release. The Secretary would maintain a list of facilities with these substances and designate others as \"significant.\" H.R. 5695 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish risk-based tiers for designated facilities, with regulations for vulnerability assessments and security plans. High-risk facilities must conduct assessments and submit security plans within six months of regulations being prescribed. H.R. 5695 would exempt certain facilities from additional requirements for vulnerability assessments and security plans, unless deemed necessary by the DHS Secretary. Plans and assessments must be reviewed and approved within 180 days, with disapproval for non-compliance or insufficient measures. The Secretary may require high-risk facilities to use inherently safer technology if needed. The bill H.R. 5695 establishes a process for chemical facility owners to incorporate inherently safer technology (IST) if it reduces terrorist consequences, is feasible, and does not harm business operations. Owners can appeal decisions by the Secretary and report vulnerabilities. Employees are protected from retaliation, and penalties are imposed for noncompliance. The bill H.R. 5695 allows chemical facility owners to appeal penalties for violations and ensures that state and local laws are not preempted unless they interfere with the bill's purposes. It also prohibits the disclosure of protected information related to facility security and risk assessments. H.R. 5695 establishes procedures for certifying third-party auditors under the Homeland Security Act and creates an Office of Chemical Facility Security at DHS. The bill includes provisions to reduce conflicts of interest for auditors and prohibits the disclosure of sensitive information that could jeopardize the security of chemical facilities. The law, P.L. 109-295, authorizes DHS to regulate high-risk chemical facilities for three years, requiring them to comply with security performance standards, prepare vulnerability assessments, and facility security plans. DHS can inspect facilities and enforce compliance with civil penalties. Criminal penalties are only for unauthorized disclosure of protected information. The law authorizes DHS to regulate high-risk chemical facilities, requiring compliance with security standards, vulnerability assessments, and security plans. DHS can enforce compliance with civil penalties and may order a facility to cease operations in case of repeated failures. H.R. 1562 proposes DHS as the lead agency for overseeing chemical facility security, with discretionary authority to select facilities for assessments and planning. H.R. 1562 would exempt certain high-priority facilities from vulnerability assessments under the Safe Drinking Water Act and MTSA, focusing on security and emergency measures to prevent and respond to terrorism-related releases. It also protects certification documents from public disclosure. H.R. 1562 would protect information related to vulnerability assessments and security plans from public disclosure and shield facility owners from lawsuits. It authorizes DHS to disapprove assessments or plans that do not comply with regulations and impose civil penalties for non-compliance. Criminal penalties are provided for unauthorized disclosure of protected information by government officials. H.R. 2237, introduced by Representative Pallone, aims to enhance EPA oversight of chemical facilities by requiring consultation with DHS. It would designate high priority categories based on threat severity and proximity to population centers, mandating vulnerability assessments and prevention plans. Plans must include safer technology and be submitted to EPA for review and updates. H.R. 2237 would protect vulnerability assessments and plans from public disclosure under FOIA, allowing disclosure under state or local laws if received independently of DHS. EPA would review and certify compliance, issuing orders if plans are inadequate. DHS could secure relief from a district court for insufficient actions in response to terrorist threats. Several bills have been introduced to address security enhancements for various types of facilities, such as agricultural businesses, wastewater treatment facilities, and community drinking water facilities. These bills aim to provide tax credits for security enhancements, replace hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, and secure supplies of explosive materials. The Senate passed legislation in 2005 and 2006 to establish federal standards for protecting against terrorist attacks on chemical facilities. The Department of Homeland Security was required to submit a report on implementing security requirements and auditing compliance. The conferees directed the Secretary to assess high-risk chemical facilities by December 2006 and develop a national security strategy for the chemical sector by February 10, 2006. The balance between public knowledge of chemical hazards and industry confidentiality is challenged by terrorism threats in the US. Advocates suggest using relative risk analysis to determine the best course of action, but predicting chemical release risks due to terrorism is difficult. There is no universally accepted level of tolerable risk. Terrorism complicates risk prediction and there is no universal standard for acceptable risk levels. Federal policies aim to enhance chemical security, with key issues including evaluating risks versus benefits of disclosure, prioritizing risks, and assigning responsibility. Section 550 of P.L. 109-295 temporarily addressed these issues by granting regulatory authority to DHS for vulnerability assessments and security plans at high-risk chemical facilities. Other legislative proposals were also considered. The 109th Congress considered legislative proposals addressing issues like facilitating congressional oversight of DHS implementation, inherently safer technology, facility risk designation criteria, and preemption of state right-to-know laws by federal provisions. It is uncertain if Congress will address these issues in the future. The 109th Congress considered legislative proposals on DHS oversight, safer technology, facility risk criteria, and preemption of state laws. Uncertain if these issues will be addressed in the future. Terrorism and security concerns in the water infrastructure sector are also highlighted in various CRS reports."
