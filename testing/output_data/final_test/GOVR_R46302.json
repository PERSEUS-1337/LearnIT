    "content": "China has significantly increased its overseas investments since launching its \"Go Global Strategy\" in 1999 to make Chinese firms more globally competitive. This includes acquiring foreign assets and investing in infrastructure development across various regions. The Indo-Pacific region is a major focus, along with the Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013. China's economic activities span across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania. China's growing global economic reach is raising concerns in Congress and the Trump Administration about its impact on U.S. economic and geopolitical interests. Analysts debate whether China's activities are commercial or aimed at challenging U.S. global influence. This report provides an overview of issues and challenges in analyzing Chinese investment, construction, financing, and development assistance worldwide. China's expanding global economic footprint is driven by economic and resource-related imperatives. Analysts believe that China's leaders prioritize domestic economic development to raise living standards, address social disaffection, and maintain regime legitimacy. The country's rapid economic growth has led to a demand for resources, technology, and markets for Chinese goods, driving its integration into the global economy and enthusiasm for international trade and investment agreements. For instance, China's increasing energy needs have prompted the government to pursue bilateral agreements and scientific cooperation. China has sought bilateral agreements, oil and gas contracts, and technological cooperation with energy-rich countries worldwide. The country's economic slowdown has led to excess capacity, prompting Chinese firms to seek overseas markets and employment opportunities. Chinese firms, many state-owned, have become global leaders in sectors like transport infrastructure. Observers suggest that these trends may reflect China's efforts to strengthen its global power and control vital sea-lanes and energy-supply routes. China's overseas investments and loans may offer more attractive and efficient solutions compared to traditional financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank. Many Chinese financial institutions involved in these activities are government-owned or subsidized, raising concerns about China's growing political influence through economic engagement. China's government-owned or subsidized investment, lending, and construction activities may challenge U.S. global leadership by not adhering to international standards and working with undemocratic governments. This has raised concerns about China's growing political influence through economic engagement. The U.S. is concerned about China's increasing international economic engagements and their potential impact on U.S. interests. Unlike China, U.S. global economic activities are driven by the private sector and are more diverse. However, the accuracy of data on global investment projects involving Chinese players is a major challenge due to the lack of transparency in Chinese projects and loans. Comprehensive data on all Chinese overseas economic activities is not readily available. Comprehensive data on Chinese overseas economic activities is limited, with think tanks and research firms using various sources to track investments, loans, and grants. However, publicly announced projects may not always materialize due to changing conditions. Despite limitations, data derived from these sources often influence policy debates. Data trackers play a significant role in driving policy debates by providing varying figures on Chinese investment flows into the United States and outward investment flows from China. These figures, sourced from different databases, highlight the limitations and discrepancies in the data available. For instance, in 2015, reported investment flows into the U.S. ranged from $2.6 billion to $16.4 billion, while outward investment flows from China ranged from $117.9 billion to $174.4 billion. China's official foreign direct investment statistics are compiled by two government agencies with different criteria, leading to comparability issues in differentiating loan, investment, and construction projects. Various datasets may not cover the full range of activity, with reported investment flows into the U.S. ranging from $2.6 billion to $16.4 billion in 2015. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) and the IMF report Balance of Payments (BoP) data for China, with discrepancies in their figures. Chinese firms often route funds through Hong Kong, Cayman Islands, or British Virgin Islands for investments, using holding companies and offshore vehicles. Chinese investors use complex schemes to route funds through countries with favorable tax policies, making it challenging to track investments accurately. Data reliability issues and lack of detailed information hinder the assessment of the size and scope of these investments. Chinese entities involved in overseas infrastructure projects, particularly ports, face challenges not typically encountered in traditional foreign direct investments. Host countries often offer long-term concessions or leases to attract foreign investment and transfer risks to the private sector. This allows the grantee firm the right to use land for both construction and operation, blending phases of acquisition or construction with those of operations. Chinese entities involved in overseas infrastructure projects, particularly ports, face challenges in assessing the extent of Chinese involvement due to the opacity of China's terms and conditions. Data availability limitations may arise as China often finances infrastructure development through its export credit agencies and development banks, without being part of the OECD's transparency procedures for government-backed export credit financing. China's global economic activities are often mislabeled as \"foreign aid\" or \"development assistance,\" but they do not meet OECD standards. China's loans have commercial elements benefiting Chinese actors and lack transparency. China's lending activities abroad are opaque, and the government rarely releases data on them. China is not part of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. China's global economic activities are not considered foreign aid or development assistance by OECD standards. China's opaque lending practices lack transparency and benefit Chinese actors. China is not part of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, which monitors development finance flows and sets ODA standards. Data limitations and lack of transparency in China's foreign economic policy decision-making processes complicate efforts to compare its global economic reach with that of the United States. There is little consensus on China's ultimate foreign economic policy goals within the United States and the international community. Debate continues over whether China's global economic engagements have a strategic plan or are tactical moves to achieve specific goals. Some believe China aims to replace the US as a global power, while others think it focuses on its own economic development. Congress may seek better tracking of Chinese investments to understand China's growing economic role. China's international engagements and economic role raise questions for the United States on assessing and responding to China's competition for influence, the impact of China's global investments on governance, and the advantages for Chinese companies in international business. The US needs policies to address these challenges and expose any violations of global norms by China. The United States must identify where China violates global norms, especially in leadership positions, and use this knowledge to enforce adherence to international standards. This raises questions about how the US and international financial institutions should respond to China's competition as a lender and its potential influence on governance. Should China's leadership be challenged if it undermines organizational goals and principles, including transparency? U.S. policymakers could improve their knowledge base to advance foreign economic interests effectively and promote transparency by China. This includes tracking actual Chinese economic activities, developing a whole-of-government approach, and encouraging disclosure through international financial institutions and the WTO. The U.S. government aims to develop a whole-of-government approach to assess global investment activities, including those of U.S., Chinese, and other major actors. This involves harmonizing information gathering programs, improving data collection and analysis, establishing a statistical office for international capital flows, and enhancing oversight on data collection and transparency commitments. The U.S. government is focusing on assessing global investment activities by examining data collection and transparency commitments in various international institutions. This includes determining if mechanisms are sufficient and adhered to, considering the role of the World Trade Organization in enhancing transparency, and evaluating the need for coordinated efforts to address emerging data requirements. Additionally, supporting training programs for countries is part of the effort. The United States is making efforts to improve data compilation and dissemination practices in countries by providing training courses and technical assistance programs. They are also focusing on Chinese overseas lending and investment practices, suggesting a combination of pressure and collaboration to encourage China to adopt international best practices. The U.S. aims to work with other countries and institutions to enhance data collection accuracy, address deficiencies, and harmonize reporting requirements. Additionally, they seek to encourage China to participate in export credit financing rules and sign on to good governance initiatives. The United States aims to coordinate efforts with other countries to set terms for data transparency and best practices for China to participate in foreign assistance dialogues. They offer to work collaboratively with China to differentiate official grant-based aid from trade subsidization, monitor aid effectiveness, harmonize reporting, and promote transparency and accountability."
