    "content": "The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a key tool in unsupervised machine learning, used for solving Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori estimation problems with latent variables. It is particularly effective for fitting mixture models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models, to unlabelled data points. A quantum version of EM has been defined and utilized in this work to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model, offering similar convergence and precision guarantees as the classical algorithm but with a runtime that is polylogarithmic in the training set size and polynomial in other parameters. Over the last few years, efforts to find real-world applications of quantum computers have intensified, with machine learning being a field where quantum computers are expected to be beneficial. Various quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed, demonstrating potential despite the current limitations in quantum technology. Quantum algorithms, such as Expectation-Maximization (EM), are being explored for unsupervised learning using quantum computers and memory devices. These algorithms aim to fit mixture models and provide maximum likelihood estimates with latent variable models. Generative models are a promising approach for unsupervised problems, learning a probability distribution from training data to optimize parameters for maximum likelihood estimation. Maximum likelihood estimation (ML) reduces a statistical problem to an optimization problem. The likelihood function measures how well a model explains a dataset, with parameters \u03b3. The likelihood is defined as L(\u03b3; V ) := n i=1 p(v i |\u03b3), and the best parameters \u03b3 * are found by maximizing the log-likelihood function (\u03b3; V ) = log L(\u03b3; V ) = n i=1 log p(v i |\u03b3). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used to solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem in models. It is an iterative algorithm that converges to a local optimum of the likelihood function. EM has various applications in fields such as medical imaging, image restoration, and computational biology. In this work, Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) is introduced as a new algorithm for fitting mixture models, specifically Gaussian Mixture Models. The algorithm is extended to other distributions in the exponential family and includes computing the Maximum A Posteriori estimate of a mixture model. MAP estimates are preferred over Maximum Likelihood estimates due to a reduced risk of overfitting. The main result is stated as Result (Quantum Expectation-Maximization), with details provided in Theorem 3.9. Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) fits a Maximum Likelihood estimate of a Gaussian Mixture Model with k components in running time dominated by parameters related to the dataset and algorithm errors. The algorithm runs for a number of iterations until a stopping condition is met, leading to convergence to a local optimum. The Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) algorithm converges to a local optimum with a runtime advantage over classical algorithms. It offers exponential improvement for large training sets but may need optimization for certain parameters. Experimental evidence suggests that datasets with a high number of samples could be processed faster on a quantum computer. The Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) algorithm can be improved for better performance on a wider range of datasets. The number of iterations in the quantum algorithm is proportional to the classical case, as seen in previous experimental evidence. Expectation-Maximization is commonly used for fitting mixture models in machine learning. The EM algorithm is used for fitting mixture models in machine learning, including various distributions like Binomial, Multinomial, log-normal, exponential, Dirichlet multinomial, and others. Quantum algorithms have been proposed for unsupervised learning, with recent advancements in \"dequantizing\" them to obtain classical machine learning algorithms with poly-logarithmic runtime. The new algorithms for Gaussian Mixture Models have impractical polynomial dependencies on rank, error, and condition number, as shown experimentally. Fast classical algorithms exist but with limitations. Miyahara, Aihara, and Lechner extended the q-means algorithm for GMM using a hard-clustering approach, while our work uses a soft clustering approach. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is introduced to fit Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), a popular generative model in machine learning. GMM is used to model complicated distributions by combining simpler distributions. The goal is to model the data by fitting the joint probability distribution that likely generated the samples. GMM is commonly used for unsupervised classification problems. In unsupervised settings, a training set of unlabeled vectors is represented as rows of a matrix. The joint probability distribution of the data in Gaussian Mixture Models is defined by mixing weights and Gaussian distributions. The model assumes data is created by selecting an index and sampling a vector from a Gaussian distribution. Fitting a GMM involves finding parameters that maximize the log-likelihood for a dataset. The algorithm may converge to a local minimum instead of the global optimum. A GMM is expressed as a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions with mixing weights. The responsibility value represents the posterior probability of a sample being assigned to a component. The GMM model parameters are optimized by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The likelihood function for GMM is not convex, leading to potential local minima. The algorithm iteratively estimates missing variables and updates parameters to maximize the log-likelihood. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to optimize the GMM model parameters by estimating latent variables and updating parameters to maximize the log-likelihood. The algorithm iterates between the Expectation step, where responsibilities are calculated, and the Maximization step, where parameters are updated. Convergence is guaranteed, but the algorithm may reach a local optimum. The stopping criterion is usually based on the increment of the log-likelihood between iterations. In optimizing GMM model parameters, a scale-free stopping criterion is preferred in scikit-learn. The criterion is based on the average increment of log-probability, with a tolerance smaller than a certain threshold. Additionally, assumptions on dataset contribution and cluster comparability are made for well-clusterability. In this work, the dataset is assumed to be normalized with the shortest vector having norm 1. The maximum norm squared of a vector in the dataset is denoted as \u03b7. Basic understanding of quantum computing is assumed, with tools like quantum algorithms for computing distances and linear algebraic operations provided in the Supplementary Material section. The section presents a quantum approach. In this section, a quantum Expectation-Maximization algorithm is presented for fitting a GMM. The algorithm can be adapted for other mixture models in the exponential family. A robust version of the EM algorithm is defined, which is used to fit a GMM. The formalization explains the numerical error in the training algorithm and utilizes quantum access to the mixture model. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM has two separate steps for Expectation and Maximization. A subroutine is used to compute responsibilities during the Maximization step, updating model parameters using quantum states and classical estimates. Efficient subroutines require storing GMM values in QRAM data structures. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves steps for Expectation and Maximization. It utilizes QRAM data structures for efficient computations. The process includes estimating parameters such as \u03b8, \u00b5, and \u03a3 using various Lemmas and Theorems to maximize likelihood up to a given tolerance. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves storing \u03b3 t+1 in QRAM and using Lemma 3.1 to estimate determinants. Quantum initialization strategies are described in the Appendix. The responsibilities are computed efficiently as a quantum state, with the determinant of updated covariance matrices calculated using Lemma 3.1. The runtime of Lemma 3.1 is subsumed by finding updated covariance matrices through 3.7 for estimating the GMM. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves storing parameters in QRAM and using a quantum algorithm to estimate determinants efficiently. The responsibilities are computed as a quantum state, with updated covariance matrices calculated using a quantum algorithm for evaluating the exponent of a Gaussian distribution. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves storing parameters in QRAM and efficiently estimating determinants. Controlled operations can extend the algorithm to work with multiple Gaussian distributions. Quantum circuits can calculate responsibilities using arithmetic, rotations, and amplitude amplification. Quantum algorithms can perform mappings with high probability in a specified time. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves storing parameters in QRAM and efficiently estimating determinants. At each iteration, new parameters of the model are recovered as quantum states and updated using tomography, amplitude estimation, or sampling. Quantum linear algebra is used to transform responsibilities into centroids of Gaussian mixtures.

At each iteration, new parameters of the model are recovered as quantum states and updated using tomography, amplitude estimation, or sampling. Quantum linear algebra is used to transform responsibilities into centroids of Gaussian mixtures. The algorithm also computes estimates for the new responsibilities and centroids based on quantum access to a GMM with parameters. The quantum algorithm for fitting a GMM involves storing parameters in QRAM and efficiently estimating determinants. It uses quantum access to a GMM to estimate the log-likelihood and update model parameters. The algorithm computes estimates for responsibilities and centroids, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency. The Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) algorithm for fitting a GMM involves quantum access to estimate parameters and update model components. The running time is dominated by performing tomography on covariance matrices, with the algorithm repeating Estimation and Maximization steps until a log-likelihood threshold is reached. Experiments on real datasets are conducted to bound condition numbers and other runtime parameters. The Quantum Expectation-Maximization (QEM) algorithm for fitting a GMM involves quantum access to estimate parameters and update model components. Thresholding the condition number by discarding small singular values of the matrix, as used in quantum linear algebra, might be advantageous. This is equivalent to limiting the eccentricity of the Gaussians and is a form of regularization. The value of \u00b5(V) will not increase significantly as we add vectors to the training set. Choosing the maximum 1 norm of the rows of V leads to values of \u00b5 around 10, with \u00b5 bounded by the Frobenius norm of V. The Frobenius norm of V is proportional to \u221a k when V can be clustered accurately by k-means. EM, being a more powerful extension of k-means, shows similar observations. The runtime of a single iteration is proportional to d 2, dominating the k 3.5 term in estimating mixing weights. Quantum running time saves a factor dependent on the number of samples and introduces other parameters. When the number of samples is large enough, quantum running time is faster than classical. Setting parameters small in the algorithm ensures minimal perturbation. A quantum version of k-means algorithm has been simulated on real data, showing promising results for well-clusterable datasets. In experiments with clustering algorithms, the parameters \u03b4 \u00b5 and \u03b4 \u03b8 did not decrease with more samples or features. The value of \u03b4 \u00b5 in q-means experiments ranged from 0.2 to 0.5. The values of \u03c4 and \u03b7 were typically 10^-3 and below 11, respectively. Real-world datasets were also analyzed for speaker recognition using the EM algorithm. The task involves recognizing a speaker from a voice sample using a training set of recorded voices. Experiments were conducted to assess the impact of errors on the accuracy of a ML estimate of a GMM by perturbing the trained model. The experiments estimated parameters of the VoxForge dataset and achieved 98.2% accuracy in classifying utterances. The accuracy was measured on 170 samples in the test set after applying a threshold on the eigenvalues of \u03a3. Each model resulted from the best of 3 different initializations of the EM algorithm. The experimental results suggest that extra parameters have a moderate influence on quantum running time. Optimism exists for the usefulness of the algorithm in analyzing large datasets when quantum computers with data access become available. The supplementary material includes useful theorems and claims related to determinant estimation in positive definite matrices. The algorithm outputs log(det(M)) with a small error margin, maximizing the likelihood of a Gaussian Mixture Model locally. The proof involves finding a constant K for Lipschitz continuity in the model's parameters. The text discusses Lipschitz continuity in the model's parameters and the exponential family definition in probability density functions. The text discusses Lipschitz continuity in model parameters and the exponential family definition in probability density functions. A(\u03bd) is the cumulant generating function, h(\u03bd) > 0 is the base measure, and quantum procedures are used to prove results. Theorem 6.6 states that sin 2 (\u03b8) can be estimated with multiplicative error \u03b7 in time \u03b7 sin(\u03b8) and efficient state preparation procedures are needed for encoding vectors into quantum states. The efficient quantum loading of data does not affect the results. The text discusses efficient quantum loading of data and quantum linear algebra algorithms for storing and manipulating data structures efficiently. The algorithms depend on the condition number of the matrix and use subroutines for quantum linear algebra. The text discusses quantum linear algebra algorithms for efficient data manipulation, focusing on storing matrices in QRAM and preparing quantum states. The algorithms guarantee a return state with high probability and have applications for rectangular matrices as well. The final component needed for the q-means algorithm is a linear time algorithm for vector state tomography to recover classical information from quantum states. The tomography algorithm reconstructs a vector x that approximates |x with high probability. The q-means algorithm requires a data matrix V and a centroid matrix C, with unitaries that can be performed in time T. A quantum algorithm can compute with high probability in time O(vi * cj * T * log(1/\u2206). Unlike k-means clustering, initializing a mixture of Gaussian is problem-dependent. Various techniques exist, such as random EM, which selects centroids randomly and estimates the covariance matrix from the dataset. These strategies can be translated into quantum subroutines without affecting the overall running time.

Various techniques exist, such as random EM, which selects centroids randomly and estimates the covariance matrix from the dataset. These strategies can be translated into quantum subroutines without affecting the overall running time. The dataset is used to estimate the covariance matrix of the data, and these estimates are used as the starting configuration of the model. A standard technique borrows the initialization strategy of k-means++ and extends it to make an initial guess for the covariance matrices and mixing weights. The initial guess for the centroids is selected by sampling from a suitable distribution. The initialization of parameters in EM algorithms can be done using various methods, such as k-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), and the CEM algorithm. In CEM, a classification step is included between the E and M steps, while in the small EM initialization method, different initial parameters are used. These methods aim to improve the convergence and accuracy of the EM algorithm. The EM algorithm can be repeated for a few iterations using the best parameters from previous results. Quantum initialization strategies for \u03b3 0 can be similar to classical machine learning, such as using random EM or k-means++ strategies. These strategies aim to provide initial guesses for centroids in the q-means algorithm. The q-means algorithm can estimate centroids \u00b5 0 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b5 0 k, and create a state using the new centroids stored in QRAM. Sampling points from this state allows for estimating parameters \u03b8 0 j and \u03a3. Techniques from previous studies can help in quantizing the CEM algorithm for hard clustering. Faster algorithms benefit random and small EM approaches by allowing more exploration of parameter space. The previous section discussed the q-means algorithm for estimating centroids and creating a state in QRAM. The current section focuses on the general model of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and the soft k-means algorithm, which is a special case of EM for GMM with a softmax assignment function. This algorithm assumes a constant covariance matrix for all clusters, making it a fuzzy version of k-means. The current section discusses different types of covariance matrices in Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): soft or fuzzy k-means clustering, spherical, diagonal, tied, and full covariance matrices. The stiffness parameter \u03b2 determines the probability of a point being assigned to a cluster. The algorithm provides an estimate of the determinant of a covariance matrix with a specified precision. By scaling the matrix, the eigenvalues can be ensured to lie within a certain range. Error estimates in the exponential family are also discussed. The curr_chunk discusses probability distributions in the exponential family and computing responsibilities with error estimates. It also mentions using a softmax function and bounding errors. Additionally, it introduces a Quantum Gaussian Evaluation lemma involving a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The curr_chunk discusses a quantum algorithm for mapping Gaussian distributions with error estimates using quantum linear algebra. It also includes a lemma for calculating responsibilities in the context of probability distributions. The text discusses a quantum algorithm for mapping Gaussian distributions with error estimates using quantum linear algebra. It includes a lemma for calculating responsibilities in the context of probability distributions. The algorithm can perform the mapping efficiently and accurately, with a detailed analysis of the error in the estimation process. The responsibility r_ij is calculated using a softmax function with arguments log(\u03c6(v_i |\u00b5_j , \u03a3_j)). The precision for the estimation is chosen to be 1 / \u221a2k to ensure |r_ij - r_ij| \u2264 1. The total cost of this step is T R1, 1 = k 1.5 T G, 1. The algorithm encodes this information in the amplitudes and estimates the responsibilities to perform a controlled rotation on an ancillary qubit. The precision required to prepare |R_j such that |R_j - |R_j| \u2264 1 is analyzed. The algorithm estimates \u03b8 t+1 \u2208 R k with precision \u03b4 \u03b8 in time T, computes a state |\u00b5 j t+1 with error norm, and estimates the unit vector |\u00b5 j t+1 using tomography. The runtime of the norm estimation is absorbed, resulting in O k complexity. The total error in the estimation of new centroids is analyzed using Claim 6.5. Parameters are chosen to ensure the error is within \u03b4 \u00b5. The errors for norm estimation can be bounded by choosing appropriate parameters. The amplitude estimation step is omitted as it does not depend on d. The quantum algorithm for computing new covariance matrices in a GMM with precision parameter \u03b4 \u00b5 outputs estimates with high probability in time. The update rule for the covariance matrix during the maximization step can be simplified using estimates of centroids. The quantum algorithm for computing new covariance matrices in a GMM with precision parameter \u03b4 \u00b5 outputs estimates with high probability in time. The runtime for this operation is analyzed by considering the error of the procedure, aiming for a matrix \u03a3 j that is \u221a \u03b7\u03b4 \u00b5 -close to the correct one. The error due to matrix multiplication can be minimized, and fixing the error of tomography and norm estimation is crucial. The inequality \u03b7( unit + norms ) < \u221a \u03b7\u03b4 \u00b5 guides the choice of parameters to ensure accuracy in the estimation process. The quantum algorithm estimates new covariance matrices in a GMM with high probability in time, considering error minimization in matrix multiplication and tomography. The choice of parameters ensures accuracy in the estimation process. The quantum algorithm computes the mixture of Gaussians using precision parameters and amplitude estimation, ensuring accuracy in the estimation process. The quantum algorithm computes the mixture of Gaussians using precision parameters and amplitude estimation for accuracy. It involves extracting Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) features and modeling speakers with a mixture of 16 Gaussians. The task is to label unseen utterances with the correct speaker by selecting the model with the highest likelihood. The audio data consists of different datasets with varying numbers of points. In the training process, various values were measured for GMM fitting. Thresholding was applied to discard singular values below a certain threshold, without significantly impacting accuracy. The study found that covariance matrices did not significantly affect accuracy. The MAP estimate had one misclassified element, while ML estimates had two. Perturbations were made to GMM parameters to test resistance to noise, with specific perturbation criteria for each parameter. The study tested the resistance of GMM parameters to noise by perturbing each singular value with random noise, ensuring they remain positive. Thresholding the matrices helped mitigate errors and regularize the model, leading to correct labeling of 167 out of 170 utterances. Further experiments with larger datasets and different noise conditions are planned for the future. The experiments were conducted using scikit-learn, highlighting that Maximum Likelihood is not always the best way to estimate model parameters. In high-dimensional spaces, ML estimates can overfit. Bayesian approach, like MAP estimates, incorporate prior information on parameter distribution. MAP estimates use Bayes' rule on likelihood and prior to derive a posterior distribution. This allows treating model parameters as random variables. The MAP estimate, derived from the ML estimate, avoids overfitting by regularizing the model and incorporating external information. Good prior information is required for MAP estimates, which can be challenging to obtain."
