    "content": "The \"Freight Rail Infrastructure Capacity Expansion Act of 2009\" is also known as the \"Freight Rail Capacity Expansion Credit\" under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Freight Rail Capacity Expansion Credit allows for a 25 percent credit on the cost of new qualified freight rail infrastructure property and qualified locomotive property placed in service during the taxable year. New qualified freight rail infrastructure property refers to construction completed after the effective date of the section. The term 'new qualified freight rail infrastructure property' refers to property completed after the effective date of the section or acquired by the taxpayer after such date, with the original use commencing with the taxpayer. An exception is made for property replacing existing qualified freight rail infrastructure property if it is located at the site of the existing property, except for the replacement or expansion of a bridge or tunnel for capacity enhancement. The term 'qualified freight rail infrastructure property' refers to property used in the movement of freight by rail, with specific criteria regarding its cost and components such as grading, tunnels, track, and related materials. The term 'qualified freight rail infrastructure property' includes bridges, trestles, culverts, terminals, yards, buildings, fuel stations, wharves, docks, railroad signal systems, communication systems, and intermodal transfer facilities. The term 'qualified freight rail infrastructure property' includes intermodal transfer or transload facilities, terminals, and equipment used exclusively therein. Exclusions are land, rolling stock, and property used predominantly outside the United States. The term 'qualified locomotive property' refers to a locomotive meeting specific criteria such as being acquired after a certain date, owned or leased by a taxpayer meeting capacity expansion requirements, and meeting EPA emission standards. The tax code defines 'qualified locomotive property' as a locomotive meeting certain criteria, including being acquired after a specified date, owned or leased by a taxpayer meeting capacity expansion requirements, and meeting EPA emission standards. Additionally, special rules apply for the leasing of locomotives, where total horsepower is determined based on all locomotives owned by or leased to the lessee. The term 'railroad signal, communication, or other operating system' refers to devices used in railroad operations to enhance safety and efficiency. An 'intermodal transfer or transload facility or terminal' is a location for transferring freight between rail and other modes of transportation. The cost of property for the credit under this section cannot be used for any other credit. The basis of qualified freight rail infrastructure or locomotive property is reduced by the credit amount. Sale-leasebacks of such property within 3 months are subject to specific conditions. The credit for qualified locomotive property can be recaptured if the property is sold or disposed of. The property is considered placed in service when it is used under the lease agreement. The credit for qualified locomotive property can be recaptured if the property is sold or disposed of within a 5-year period. This provision does not apply if the property is sold and leased back to the taxpayer. The section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2015. The freight rail capacity expansion credit is added as a business credit under Section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment to Section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code adds a new clause for the credit determined under section 45R for taxable years ending after the effective date. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. The amendment adds a new section for expensing qualified freight rail infrastructure property, effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2009. Taxpayers can elect to deduct amounts paid for qualified freight rail infrastructure property as an expense in the year the property is placed in service. The election must be made for each class of property annually, following regulations set by the Secretary. This provision coordinates with any basis reduction under section 45R(d)(3). Taxpayers can elect to deduct qualified freight rail infrastructure property expenses in the year it is placed in service, following regulations. The deduction applies to all property in the same class for that taxable year and does not affect property character for section 45R purposes. The deduction is allowed in computing minimum tax under section 55 without adjustments under section 56. This provision does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2015. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow deductions for expenditures under section 179F. Various technical and clerical amendments are made to different sections of the Code to include references to section 179F. Section 179F allows for the election to expense qualified freight rail infrastructure property. The amendments apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2009. The taxpayer must certify in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury that all laborers and mechanics working on qualified freight rail infrastructure projects were paid prevailing wages before claiming tax credits or deductions."
