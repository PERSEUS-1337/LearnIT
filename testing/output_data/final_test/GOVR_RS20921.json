The Netherlands has a tradition of selling semipostals with a 50% surcharge for children's welfare. In the US, semipostals are a recent innovation opposed by USPS due to a tradition of private philanthropy. USPS opposed semipostal stamps due to the tradition of private philanthropy in the US. They argued that it would be difficult to single out specific organizations to receive the revenue and that administrative costs would outweigh the surcharge revenues. Philatelic groups also opposed semipostals, viewing them as a departure from the tradition that stamps are for postage and as a tax on stamp collectors. Despite opposition, Congress authorized a semipostal stamp for a specific cause. In 1997, Congress authorized a semipostal stamp for breast cancer research despite USPS opposition. The Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act directed USPS to establish a special rate with a differential of up to 25%. The Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act authorized a semipostal stamp for breast cancer research with a surcharge of up to 25%. USPS was directed to issue the stamp within a year, deduct reasonable costs, and pay the remainder to NIH and DOD. Sales were limited to two years, and GAO evaluated the program's effectiveness. The USPS had challenges tracking costs for the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal Stamp (BCRS). Over 785 million BCRSs were sold by December 31, 2007. $60.1 million was transferred to NIH and DOD for breast cancer research. GAO and USPSOIG had disagreements with USPS over costs charged for the stamp. USPS decided to deduct less than 9% of BCRS costs. The USPS deducted less than 9% of the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal Stamp (BCRS) costs before turning over the proceeds to NIH and DOD. The stamp was considered a success, leading to interest in issuing more semipostals for various causes. The USPS successfully issued the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal Stamp (BCRS), with less than 9% of costs deducted before proceeds were given to NIH and DOD. Interest grew in issuing new semipostals for causes like emergency food relief, AIDS research, a World War II memorial, wildlife protection, and child literacy. A Senate hearing on extending the BCRS and authorizing other semipostals took place on May 25, 2000. USPS did not favor issuing more semipostals, citing fundraising as a diversion from its core mission and concerns about diluting stamp quality and choosing among worthy causes for revenue. The Semipostal Authorization Act (P.L. 106-253) was signed into law on July 28, 2000, extending the Breast Cancer Research Semipostal Stamp for two more years and granting USPS authority to issue and sell semipostals for 10 years for causes deemed in the national public interest. USPS had discretion in selecting future semipostals, with funds raised going to federal agencies. The act also required USPS to use a notice-and-comment regulatory process for proposing and issuing semipostals. The Semipostal Authorization Act (P.L. 106-253) granted USPS the authority to issue and sell semipostals for causes in the national public interest. USPS published a regulation outlining the selection criteria and procedures for the semipostal program, including inviting public nominations every two years and limiting one semipostal in circulation at a time. Submissions must demonstrate broad national appeal and further human welfare, with recommendations from the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee. The Semipostal Authorization Act (P.L. 106-253) allowed USPS to issue semipostals for national public interest causes. Proposals required official agency certification and careful planning. 37 nominations were received by USPS for semipostals supporting various causes like medical research, childhood abuse, and wildlife conservation. Former President Jimmy Carter proposed a semipostal for Habitat for Humanity under the Semipostal Authorization Act of 2000. USPS will not issue other semipostals until after the sales period of the current stamp has ended. The Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations Act for 2002 extended the expiration date of the current semipostal stamp and authorized a price increase. Congress has enacted more semipostal stamp legislation to support various causes. The USPS announced the issuance of the \"Heroes of 2001\" semipostal stamp to assist families of rescue workers affected by the 9/11 attacks. Another semipostal stamp, \"Stop Family Violence,\" was also issued to support programs of the Department of Health and Human Services. Over 45 million of these stamps were sold, raising about $3 million. The USPS issued semipostal stamps to raise funds for various causes, but there is concern about public interest waning. Sales of semipostals peaked in FY2000 but declined in subsequent years, indicating a potential decrease in public interest. Sales of the \"Heroes of 2001\" semipostal stamp declined in FY2006 and FY2007. The stamp did not have the same level of support as the breast cancer stamp, leading to lower sales. The Heroes stamp was withdrawn in 2004, with proceeds transferred to FEMA. FEMA published plans to distribute the funds in 2005. The 9/11 Heroes Stamp Act of 2001 assistance program application period started on December 2, 2005, and ended on March 29, 2006. The BCRS was extended by the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congress until December 31, 2011. The House Committee on Government Reform amended its Rule 19 on February 9, 2005, to discourage new semipostal legislation. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will not consider legislative proposals for commemorative stamps and semi-postal issues. Recommendations for such stamps should be submitted to the Postmaster General. This rule, now Rule 20, was retained in the 110th Congress."
