    "content": "The Obama Administration has requested $7.8 billion in bilateral foreign assistance for Africa in FY2012, with five U.S. policy priorities identified for the continent. Over three-quarters of the budget is allocated towards implementing three global aid initiatives. The U.S. policy objectives for Africa encompass a wide range of initiatives, reflecting the continent's size and diversity. Foreign aid serves both to help recipient countries achieve prosperity and governance capacity and to advance U.S. national and strategic interests. Bilateral aid packages aim to meet recipient countries' needs while also furthering U.S. interests. The design of U.S. aid to Africa poses a challenge for policy makers in balancing priorities and achieving strategic focus. There is debate on whether poor performance by recipient governments justifies terminating or continuing aid, with some arguing that governance concerns justify cutting aid while others believe aid can improve areas of poor performance and provide leverage to change ineffective policies. Security assistance programs in Africa are debated for their impact on undemocratic regimes and national security interests of the United States. These programs also aim to enhance the professionalism and human rights record of African military and police forces. U.S. aid to Africa primarily focuses on health assistance, representing a significant portion of total bilateral aid to the continent. The Obama Administration and recent Congresses have shown strong support for global health assistance in Africa. The proposed FY2012 budget for Africa includes increases in health, governance, and agriculture aid, with a 10% increase compared to FY2010 levels. Assistance for Governing Justly and Democratically would increase by 19%, Investing in People by 12%, and Economic Growth by 14%, while Peace and Security assistance would decrease by 1%. The Administration has also requested $24 million for the African Development Foundation. The proposed FY2012 budget for the African Development Foundation is $24 million, which is $6 million less than FY2010. The budget would provide bilateral aid to 46 African countries, with the top 10 aid recipients being Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda, Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Each country's aid package reflects country-specific assistance and policy priorities. These 10 countries represent about 68% of the total Africa bilateral aid request. The proposed FY2012 budget for the African Development Foundation would result in significant increases in bilateral aid packages for several African countries, including Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. However, some countries would see cuts in aid, such as Angola and Sierra Leone. Aid to the African Union would decrease, while funding for regional assistance would increase. The proposed FY2012 budget includes significant increases in regional assistance allocations for specific countries, allowing for more flexible decision-making. This funding would support State Department-led initiatives like the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership and programs to address human trafficking. The FY2012 budget includes funding for the Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative, programs to combat human trafficking and conflict minerals trade, and the West Africa Regional Security Initiative (WARSI). The proposed bilateral aid budget for Africa in FY2012 represents 27% of the global bilateral aid request. The FY2012 budget includes funding for various initiatives in Africa, including the Women's Justice and Empowerment Initiative, programs to combat human trafficking and conflict minerals trade, and the West Africa Regional Security Initiative (WARSI). The global budget for the GHCS account, 40% of the DA account, 10% of the ESF account, and 4% of the State Department-administered security assistance budget are allocated for bilateral and multilateral aid in Africa. The United States contributes to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Africa through the State Department's CIPA account and provides international debt relief for poor countries. Bilateral aid to African countries increased significantly over the past decade, with a focus on global health spending, particularly HIV/AIDS. Foreign assistance funding is considered vulnerable in federal budget debates. The Obama Administration strongly supports foreign aid as a pillar of foreign policy, but faces debate over funding levels amid concerns about the federal budget deficit. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defends the FY2012 global foreign aid request as essential for U.S. national security. State Hillary Clinton defends the FY2012 global foreign aid request as crucial for U.S. policy priorities, while some Members support this view. House leaders propose significant cuts to appropriations for the International Affairs account, criticizing the Administration's proposed budget as expensive and ineffective. The FY2011 foreign aid budget included increases in aid to Africa and decreases in other areas. Congress appropriated funds for foreign operations for the first half of FY2011, maintaining global foreign assistance at FY2010 levels. Analysts, development practitioners, and aid advocates have debated the value and design of aid programs in Africa. Critics in the 1990s argued that foreign assistance in Africa had achieved little, with development indicators declining in many countries since decolonization. Some claimed that humanitarian aid had prolonged conflicts and empowered undemocratic regimes and rebel groups. Critics argue that foreign aid in Africa has prolonged conflicts and empowered undemocratic regimes and rebel groups. Aid advocates believe aid should be better designed or scaled up, not terminated, to achieve desired objectives. Some policymakers increased funding for Africa post-9/11, citing national security concerns. By President George W. Bush's second term, bipartisan support for a sizable aid budget for Africa emerged. Critics highlight neo-colonial aspects of aid programs and potential negative effects. Methods and metrics for evaluating aid's effectiveness and impact are debated. Congress oversees U.S. foreign assistance programs, with potential issues including balance, prioritization, and the focus on global health programming in Africa. Ethiopia is identified as a priority country. Ethiopia is a priority country for advancing regional security and economic growth, with the majority of aid focused on health and economic growth. Questions arise about the justification of aid allocation, donor coordination, impact of proposed cuts and increases, and the capacity of countries to absorb new programming. The Administration's aid budget request for Africa raises questions about transparency, country ownership, and aid effectiveness. It is important to assess if African countries are taking responsibility for their development and if U.S. aid programs support this goal effectively. The evaluation of aid programs' effectiveness and the criteria for foreign assistance allocation are crucial considerations. The United States is the largest bilateral donor to Africa, but other donors also provide substantial assistance. Questions arise about the unintended consequences of aid programs, such as contributing to corruption or market distortions. Donor coordination and potential impacts on U.S. policy goals in different areas are also important considerations. Other bilateral and multilateral donors also provide significant assistance to Africa, with OECD countries contributing $13.8 billion in 2009, and the European Union adding $4.6 billion. Coordination among donors and Congressional decisions on foreign aid can impact aid effectiveness in Africa. The U.S. imposes strict conditions on bilateral aid to Africa based on factors like human rights, weapons proliferation, and terrorism. The foreign operations appropriations act restricts aid to governments that overthrow democracies, lack budget transparency, support terrorism, or have unpaid debts. The President must notify Congress before providing security assistance to certain countries. Sudan and Zimbabwe have additional conditions for receiving foreign aid. The U.S. imposes strict conditions on foreign aid to Sudan and Zimbabwe, including restrictions on supporting military operations with child soldiers. Congress has reinforced these restrictions in authorization acts, requiring consideration of recipient countries' records on various issues like human rights and terrorism. The U.S. imposes strict conditions on foreign aid to Sudan and Zimbabwe, including restrictions on supporting military operations with child soldiers. Congress leads U.S. foreign policy, allocating aid for health, food security, and climate change initiatives in African countries. President Obama created the Global Health Initiative in 2009 to coordinate health programs globally and in Africa. President Obama established the Global Health Initiative (GHI) in 2009 to coordinate global health programs, including PEPFAR, PMI, and NTD. The GHI, led by the State Department initially, aims to increase investments in maternal and child health, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning. It is projected to cost $63 billion globally from FY2009 to FY2013. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) focuses on increasing investments in maternal and child health, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning. The Obama Administration has maintained support for health priorities set by the Bush Administration, with requests for higher spending in these areas made in proportion to other budgetary increases. Critics argue that the GHI's goals are vague and do not fundamentally change the nature of U.S. global health programs. Some skeptics question if the GHI's interagency approach may slow global health program implementation. Concerns include a potential shift of attention and resources from PEPFAR, jeopardizing gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Greater transparency and consultation with Congress are deemed necessary for GHI implementation. The high allocation of global health funds for Africa reflects the heavy disease burden on African populations and the limited capacity of African governments to respond. Africa faces significant global health challenges, accounting for a large portion of disease burden worldwide. The continent struggles with high rates of malnutrition, infant mortality, and poor maternal and child health. It is home to the majority of global malaria deaths, two-thirds of people living with HIV, and one-third of all tuberculosis cases. Health issues in Africa not only have humanitarian implications but also hinder economic development. Decreasing budgets for health assistance programs could lead to the termination of HIV/AIDS treatment programs, potentially causing viral resistance to medications. African countries face significant health challenges with under-resourced public health sectors and inadequate facilities. International assistance is needed to address disease burdens, but critics argue for African countries to take on more responsibility. International donors, including the United States, are criticized for prioritizing health over other aid areas. Congress allocates global health funding through various appropriations, with a focus on the Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) account. The Administration has requested $5.4 billion for global health programs in Africa in FY2012, a 12.5% increase from the previous year. The FY2012 budget proposes a 12.5% increase in funding for global health programs in Africa, with significant increases in nutrition, maternal and child health, and family planning. There are also slight increases in funding for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs in Africa. The budget calls for shifts in the allocation of global funds for combating certain diseases. The budget proposal for FY2012 includes a 12.5% increase in funding for global health programs in Africa, with a focus on nutrition, maternal and child health, and family planning. There are also shifts in the allocation of global funds for combating diseases, such as increasing TB funds in Africa while decreasing malaria funds. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a global initiative to address hunger and poverty, part of a larger global pledge of over $22 billion. The State Department launched Feed the Future in May 2010 to address global hunger and food security, with USAID coordinating implementation. Feed the Future initiative aims to promote agricultural sector growth and improve nutritional status in developing countries, particularly for women and children. It focuses on enhancing productivity, expanding markets, and increasing economic resilience in rural communities. The program aligns with principles for sustainable food security and coordinates with the Global Health Initiative. The Feed the Future initiative received funding primarily from USAID's DA account, as well as other accounts like ESF, AEECA, and GHCS. The FY2011 budget requested $1.84 billion for Feed the Future activities, marking the first time funds were specifically requested for the initiative. The FY2012 budget requested $1.56 billion for Feed the Future, with a significant portion allocated for Africa. The impact of the FY2011 continuing resolution on Feed the Future funding levels remains uncertain. The Administration has requested $1.56 billion for the Feed the Future initiative, with one-third allocated for Africa. 20 focus countries have been selected, including 12 in Africa. Policy makers believe agricultural development is crucial for Africa's socioeconomic growth due to factors like food insecurity, agriculture's importance to African economies, and farmers' limited access to technology. Africa's agriculture sector is vital, representing 26.2% of the continent's GDP, with the highest proportion of rural residents and agriculture workers. However, arable land in Africa lacks key inputs like fertilizer and machinery. This contributes to food insecurity and poverty, with Africa having the lowest per-person food consumption and receiving the highest amount of food aid. High population growth is expected to worsen these challenges, with five of the top 10 countries receiving international food aid located in Africa. The Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) aims to enhance social resilience and adaptation in developing countries in Africa to extreme weather events, promote clean energy technologies, and support environmental conservation. The FY2012 budget request includes $650.6 million for the GCCI to prevent damage, loss of life, and instability caused by climate change. Failure to lead in these areas could undermine U.S. standing and influence globally. The FY2012 budget request allocates $650.6 million for the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI), with $452 million from the DA account. $126 million in DA funding for Africa is included, with allocations for adaptation programs, clean energy technology, and sustainable landscapes. Congressional directives have focused aid resources on global health, food security, and climate change. The FY2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funding for programs to address climate change, protect forests, and support biodiversity. Congress also increased support for foreign aid programs to combat HIV/AIDS starting in 2004. President Bush and President Obama both prioritized global health initiatives, with a focus on combating HIV/AIDS through programs like PEPFAR and the Global Health Initiative. These efforts also extended to other health issues in Africa, such as anti-tuberculosis efforts, the President's Malaria Initiative, and neglected tropical diseases. The motivation behind these initiatives was driven by humanitarian concerns and the potential security threats posed by infectious diseases and epidemics. Global health programs have strategic value for the United States and are recognized as diplomatic tools to improve relations with recipient countries. Congress authorized $48 billion for global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria programs in the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde U.S. Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008. In FY2009 and FY2010, Congress provided $14.5 billion for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs, including contributions to the Global Fund. Current spending trends indicate that authorized levels may not be met without increased funding in FY2012 and FY2013. The Obama Administration requested $6.0 billion for HIV/AIDS, $236 million for TB, and $691 million for malaria in FY2012. Thirteen priority African countries have been identified for aid programming. Thirteen priority African countries have been identified for non-initiative aid programming in FY2012, totaling $5.14 billion, or just under 66% of the total Africa aid request. The designations aim to strategically focus foreign aid resources, with some countries receiving higher overall funding than priority countries due to large costs. In FY2012, Uganda, Zambia, and Rwanda received significant aid funding despite not being designated as priority countries. The US has also initiated strategic partnerships with Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa. Supporting Governing Justly and Democratically (GJD) programs is a top foreign assistance priority in Africa, reflecting concerns about democracy and governance trends in the region. The Administration has requested $371 million in FY2012 funding for GJD programs in Africa, representing a 19.1% increase over FY2010 levels. GJD programs cover activities such as strengthening government institutions, supporting civil society, political party development, and independent media. The FY2012 budget request would increase GJD funding in key countries like Tanzania, Ghana, Mali, and Mozambique, while decreasing it in others. This reflects the US's commitment to democracy and good governance in Africa. The Administration has proposed increased funding for democracy support in priority countries like Mozambique, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, DRC, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, and Liberia. However, funding would be eliminated or decreased in countries with troubled democracy records like Angola, Djibouti, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Zambia, and Somalia. This includes significant cuts in funding for countries like Niger and Guinea, despite their recent transitions to civilian-led governments. Africa has high poverty rates but has seen strong economic growth in recent years. Despite being affected by the global recession, African economies are recovering and have the potential for increased growth. However, there are significant disparities among countries in the region. The largest shares of proposed FY2012 economic growth funding are allocated for agricultural development and environmental assistance, linked to initiatives like Feed the Future and Global Climate Change. Funding for infrastructure has decreased, reflecting a reallocation of funds for Southern Sudan. The Obama Administration has requested approximately $431 million for programs related to \"Peace and Security.\" Funding for \"Peace and Security\" in Africa focuses on military professionalization, conflict mitigation, counterterrorism, narcotics trafficking, maritime security, and peacekeeping operations. Aid also promotes respect for human rights among African security forces, including support through the ACOTA program for African troops in international peacekeeping missions. The U.S. provides funding for peace and security in Africa through various programs, including contributions to U.N. peacekeeping costs and the Complex Crises Fund. The FY2012 budget includes a significant increase in funding for rule of law and counternarcotics programs in Africa, with a focus on supporting the development of the police service in Southern Sudan. The FY2012 budget includes increased funding for peace and security in Africa, with a focus on supporting the development of the police service in Southern Sudan. Decreased funding for counterterrorism programs is also noted, with cuts to the NADR account and PKO account. The largest intended NADR recipients are Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, and Mozambique. PKO funding is declining, partly due to the United Nations assuming logistical support for the AU peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Significant \"Peace and Security\" assistance is requested for Africa Regional programs. The State Department is requesting roughly $57.9 million for Africa Regional programs. This includes funding for the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership, Partnership for Regional East Africa Counterterrorism, and Africa Conflict Stabilization and Border Security program. USAID's West Africa Regional allocation also includes funding for countering extremist ideologies. Funding levels for these programs are difficult to compare to previous years. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 with a unique approach to foreign economic assistance, focusing on reducing poverty through economic growth. It works with a select few nations that show potential for success, based on performance indicators related to \"ruling justly,\" \"investing in people,\" and \"economic freedom.\" This differs from traditional aid efforts and the work of USAID. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) focuses on reducing poverty through economic growth by working with select nations based on performance indicators like \"ruling justly,\" \"investing in people,\" and \"economic freedom.\" Recipient countries are expected to \"own\" their projects, with compacts lasting five years and including infrastructure projects, land titling, financial sector reform, and more. About $4.8 billion of the $8.3 billion in compact funding has been committed to African countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation provides threshold funding to assist candidate countries in addressing performance indicators, with a focus on corruption concerns. Africa has received $161 million out of $495 million in threshold program funding. In FY2011, Malawi signed a $351 million compact focusing on the electricity sector, while Zambia and Cape Verde are expected to receive compacts focusing on tourism, clean water supply, and water sanitation and property rights, respectively. The Administration's FY2012 request includes funding for a second compact with Ghana, but a project proposal is still in development."
