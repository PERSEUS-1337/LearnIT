In 2006, Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact with the MCC, but it was terminated in 2009 due to political rights violations. Daniel Ortega bypassed the National Assembly to change presidential term limits. The Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing where it was stated that Daniel Ortega's candidacy was illegal and the elections were marred by fraud. The Department of State found Nicaragua did not meet fiscal transparency standards from 2012 until the enactment of the Act. The Department of State found that Nicaragua's recent elections did not meet international standards of transparency, leading to a setback for democracy in the country. Additionally, the government does not publicly account for significant off-budget assistance from Venezuela, which is not subject to audit or legislative oversight. Nicaragua's fiscal transparency could be improved by including all off-budget revenue and expenditure in the budget, auditing state-owned enterprises, and conducting a full audit of the government's annual financial statements. The Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2015 highlighted concerns about the re-election of President Daniel Ortega Saavedra not meeting international standards of transparency. The 2011 elections in Nicaragua were deemed seriously flawed by observers, raising concerns about the constitutional legitimacy of Ortega's re-election. The ruling party gained a supermajority in the National Assembly, leading to changes in the constitution that expanded executive branch power and removed restrictions on re-election. Serious flaws were also noted in the 2012 municipal and 2014 regional elections. The 2015 report highlighted obstacles to freedom of speech and press, government intimidation of journalists, increased restrictions on public information access, and harassment of NGOs. The report also mentioned biased policies promoting single-party dominance, arbitrary arrests, harsh prison conditions, discrimination against ethnic minorities, and indigenous communities. In February 2016, the Ortega regime detained individuals. After expelling Freedom House's Latin America Director in February 2016, the Nicaraguan political opposition raised concerns about anomalies in the electoral calendar for the 2016 presidential elections, including the lack of national and international observations, public precincts results, and transparent purging of electoral registration rolls. Nicaragua's constitution mandates 5-year terms for municipal authorities. On June 3, 2016, the Nicaraguan Supreme Court, controlled by Ortega, instructed the Electoral Council not to swear in opposition members to electoral councils. On June 5, 2016, Ortega rejected international observers for the presidential elections. On June 7, 2016, the US expressed disappointment as Nicaragua denied electoral observers requested by citizens and the church. On June 8, 2016, the Supreme Electoral Council, controlled by Ortega, changed the leadership structure of the opposition party, barring existing opposition candidates. On June 14, 2016, Ortega expelled 3 US officials from Nicaragua. On June 22, 2016, a Global Fellow left Nicaragua due to fear. The media report highlighted a fellow's fear of being followed by the police in Nicaragua while conducting academic research. The Department of State issued a travel alert warning U.S. citizens about increased government scrutiny of foreigners' activities in Nicaragua. Foreigners have been denied entry, detained, questioned, or expelled by Nicaraguan authorities. On June 30, 2016, the Human Rights Foundation issued a press release criticizing Daniel Ortega for manipulating constitutional reforms to extend his power indefinitely. The foundation warned that upcoming elections in Nicaragua may not be free and fair if the opposition is not allowed to compete meaningfully. The Inter-American Democratic Charter should be applied to the Sandinista regime.
