    "content": "The Energy Security Tax Act, also known as the \"Fee on Imported Crude Oil or Refined Petroleum Products,\" introduces a new chapter in the Internal Revenue Code imposing taxes on imported crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstocks or derivatives. This includes provisions for tax imposition, definitions, registration, procedures, penalties, and adjustments for inflation. An excise tax is imposed on the first sale and use within the United States of imported crude oil, refined petroleum products, or petrochemical feedstocks or derivatives if no prior tax has been imposed. The rate of tax varies for crude oil. The excise tax rates for crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstocks or derivatives are based on the excess of a set amount per barrel over the average price of internationally traded oil. The excise tax rates for crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstocks or derivatives are determined based on the average price of internationally traded oil for each week, as determined by the Secretary and published in the Federal Register. Fractional parts of barrels are taxed accordingly. The Secretary determines the average price of internationally traded oil for the preceding 4 weeks to calculate excise tax rates. The taxes are paid by the first seller for sales and by the user for consumption within the United States. The excise taxes are paid by the user who uses crude oil, refined petroleum products, petrochemical feedstock, or petrochemical derivatives. The section defines key terms like crude oil, barrel, refined petroleum product, and export. It also outlines the requirement for registration and procedures for those subject to tax under section 5886. SEC. 5889 outlines procedures, returns, and penalties related to the tax imposed by section 5886. SEC. 5890 addresses adjustments for inflation in the prices referred to in section 5886(b)(1) and (b)(2) based on the Consumer Price Index changes. Chapter 55 amends section 164(a) to allow for deductions of imported oil taxes imposed by section 5886. These amendments apply to sales and uses of imported crude oil, refined petroleum products, petrochemical feedstocks, or derivatives after the enactment of the Act."
