The \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2001\" mandates regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes, specifically focusing on ballast water discharge from vessels. The regulations under the \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2001\" require vessels entering the Great Lakes to discharge or exchange ballast water before entry, use environmentally sound treatment methods, and consider different operating conditions. The regulations under the \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2001\" require vessels entering the Great Lakes to certify compliance, ensure sampling procedures, inspection of records, and sanctions for non-compliance based on scientific information. These regulations do not override any requirements related to ballast water discharge under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2001\" regulations mandate vessels entering the Great Lakes to certify compliance, ensure sampling procedures, inspect records, and impose sanctions for non-compliance based on scientific information.

Treatment methods for ballast water tanks involve removing or destroying living organisms through filtration, biocides, ultraviolet light, thermal methods, or other approved techniques. The Secretary of Transportation will maximize public participation in issuing regulations for the \"Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act of 2001\" by publishing advance notices, making texts available electronically, allowing 120 days for public comments, and setting an effective date of not less than 120 days. The proposed rule includes an effective date not less than 30 days after publication and allows for other appropriate means as determined by the Secretary.

The Secretary must issue final regulations within 270 days of enactment for the implementation of treatment methods and innovative technologies. Innovative treatment methods must be implemented within 720 days of the enactment of the Act, as per the timetable established by the Secretary within 270 days."
