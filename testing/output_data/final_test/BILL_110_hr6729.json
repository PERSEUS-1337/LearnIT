    "content": "Section 1 of the Energy Conservation and Production Act is amended to update state building energy efficiency codes. The Secretary is required to update national model building energy codes every 3 years to achieve energy savings of at least 30% for editions after 2010 and 50% for editions after 2020. Targets are set in advance for maximum energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Whenever IECC or ASHRAE standards are revised, the Secretary must comply. The Secretary must make determinations on revised building energy codes within specific timeframes to assess energy efficiency improvements and target compliance. If codes do not meet targets or are not updated, the Secretary must establish modified codes that achieve maximum energy savings. The Secretary must determine energy codes based on IECC or ASHRAE standards, with public comment opportunities. States must certify updated building codes within 2 years of enactment. The Secretary must determine energy codes based on IECC or ASHRAE standards, with public comment opportunities. States must certify updated building codes within 2 years of enactment, demonstrating compliance with energy efficiency standards. Each State must certify within 2 years that it has updated its building code to meet or exceed energy efficiency standards. Additionally, within 3 years of certification, States must demonstrate compliance with the certified building energy code or show significant progress towards it. The State must certify progress towards achieving compliance with the building energy code each year until full compliance is achieved. Certification includes documentation of compliance rates through inspections of new and renovated buildings. Compliance is achieved if at least 90 percent of building space meets energy code requirements. The code requires buildings to meet energy efficiency standards or show equivalent savings. Renovations with permits must comply, and if targets are not achievable, they can be reduced. States must show progress towards compliance by certifying rates of building code adherence. The code requires states to develop and implement a plan for achieving compliance with energy efficiency standards within 8 years with adequate funding. Progress must be demonstrated after 1 year of funding, meeting specific requirements after 5 years, and not exceeding 8 years of funding. Adequate funding is defined as at least $50,000,000 provided by the Federal Government annually. The code mandates states to receive $50,000,000 annually for developing and enforcing building energy codes. States failing to meet certification deadlines must report their status and submit a plan for compliance. Non-compliant states allow local governments to meet certification requirements. The Secretary is required to submit an annual report to Congress and the Federal Register on the status of national building energy codes, code adoption in states, and the impacts of past and potential actions. Technical assistance must be provided to code-setting organizations for evaluating proposals, building energy analysis, demonstrations, design assistance, and training. The Secretary must submit code amendment proposals to meet energy targets. Technical assistance is provided to States for code implementation and achieving energy savings. Incentive funding is available for States to improve residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes. The Secretary considers State actions to improve residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes and compliance. Additional funding is available for States to achieve a 90 percent compliance rate with energy efficiency codes. In states with no statewide energy code, local governments must adopt and implement residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes that meet certain standards. The local government must adopt and implement residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes, with funding available for training officials. The International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) is defined in the Energy Conservation and Production Act. Funding is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, with additional appropriations for subsequent years."
