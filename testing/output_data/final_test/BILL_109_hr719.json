    "content": "The \"Agricultural Export Facilitation Act of 2005\" is the short title of this Act, which aims to facilitate agricultural exports. Congress finds that the export sector of United States agriculture contributes positively to the country's trade balance. Since 2000, Cuba has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of agricultural products from the US, ranking at the bottom of 226 agricultural export markets. Cuba is an important market for US agriculture, ranking low in agricultural export markets. To be competitive, US exporters need reliable access to Cuba, which is currently uncertain due to regulations requiring special licenses for travel. The issuance of special Treasury Department licenses for travel to Cuba for sales-related activities faces administrative delays and periodic denials. A blanket statutory authorization for sales and transport-related travel to Cuba by US exporters would remove bureaucratic impediments endorsed by Congress in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. US visas have been delayed or denied to Cuban purchasers authorized under the same Act, affecting family farmers and small producers lacking resources for sales. The Department of State should issue visas to Cuban nationals for meetings with US exporters of authorized agricultural products. Visas should also be given to Cuban inspectors for on-site inspections in the US. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 requires cash in advance for US agricultural exports to Cuba. Some Federal agencies implementing the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 believe that \"cash in advance\" means payment must be received before shipment to Cuba. Payments to US exporters from Cuban purchasers were frozen in US banks, causing commercial uncertainty and hindering agricultural sales to Cuba under the Act. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 requires payment to be received before a Cuban purchaser takes possession of the product. Cuban purchasers must use third-country banks for payments due to US policy prohibiting direct payments between Cuban and US financial institutions. Direct payments between Cuban and United States financial institutions will allow US exporters to receive payment directly within hours, eliminating unnecessary transactional fees. This will enable Cuban purchasers to buy more US agricultural products. Additionally, trademarks and trade names are crucial assets for US companies exporting branded food products to Cuba, ensuring exclusive rights to use them when the US trade embargo is lifted. Following the lifting of the trade embargo on Cuba, many US companies are exporting branded food products to establish their brands with Cuban purchasers. Sales of these products contribute to American workers and businesses, relying on the security of US trademarks protected in Cuba. The United States District Court ruled that section 211 of the Department of Commerce Appropriations Act abrogates the Inter-American Convention on Trademarks with respect to Cuba. Cuba's international remedy for this breach is to suspend or revoke the convention. The United States must repeal section 211 of the Department of Commerce Appropriations Act to preserve trademark rights in Cuba and comply with treaty obligations. The purpose of this Act is to facilitate sales of US agricultural products to Cuba under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Travel to Cuba in connection with authorized sales activities. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 is amended to authorize travel-related transactions for sales and marketing activities in Cuba, including product exhibitions and transportation of products by sea or air. In this subsection, \"sales and marketing activities\" refer to any activity related to exploring the Cuban market for product sales or engaging in sales activities. Authorized travelers include employees, executives, sales agents, and consultants of companies involved in selling products authorized under this Act. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish regulations for sales and marketing activities in Cuba, involving exhibitors, representatives, and trade organizations promoting the interests of producers and distributors. Sense of Congress that visas should be issued. The Sense of Congress is that the Secretary of State should issue visas for temporary entry into the US for Cuban nationals conducting activities related to purchasing agricultural goods. The Secretary of State must submit reports on visa issuance every 3 months to specific Senate and House committees. Each report must detail applications from Cuban nationals to travel to the US for purchasing activities under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, including the outcome of each application. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 clarifies the term 'payment of cash in advance' for agricultural commodities. It also authorizes direct transfers between Cuban and US financial institutions. The President cannot restrict direct transfers from a Cuban financial institution to a US financial institution for authorized product sales under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Additionally, adherence to international agreements for intellectual property protection is required, including the repeal of Section 211. The repeal of Section 211 of the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 is being carried out by the Secretary of the Treasury through necessary regulations. This includes removing any prohibitions on transactions or payments previously covered by this section. Additionally, amendments to the Cuban Assets Control Regulations will be made to authorize certain actions. The general license under title 31, Code of Federal Regulations authorizes the transfer or receipt of trademarks or trade names subject to United States law involving designated nationals. This includes filing and prosecuting opposition and infringement proceedings related to such trademarks or trade names."
