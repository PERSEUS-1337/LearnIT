    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1996\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. Congress finds that forest stands in the Sierra Nevada, specifically in the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest in California, have been significantly altered by fire suppression and an over-accumulation of natural fuels. This has led to the development of dense understories, increasing the risk of disease, insect infestations, and high-intensity fires. Enhanced resource management activities like thinning, logging, prescribed fire, and timber stand management are necessary in these areas. Enhanced resource management activities like thinning, logging, prescribed fire, and timber stand management are necessary in the Sierra Nevada national forests to mitigate tree mortality, reduce fuel loads, break up fuel continuity, and promote long-term forest health. Communities in northern California depend on revenues from forest products for education, infrastructure, and economic stability. The Quincy Library Group aims to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in a way that maximizes forest health and cost-efficiency. The Quincy Library Group Proposal of 1993 recommended a localized, adaptive management strategy for designated lands in the Sierra Nevada national forests to reduce fire risk, enhance forest health, and provide economic stability to forest-dependent communities. This pilot project aims to demonstrate the implementation of resource management activities for these national forests. A pilot project on national forests aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of locally-developed adaptive management strategies recommended in the Quincy Library Group Proposal of 1993. The project will be conducted in the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest in California. The Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal of 1993 designates certain areas in the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest in California for a pilot project. Timber harvesting is deferred in spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers within the pilot project area, except in designated catastrophic event areas. The Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal designates certain areas for a pilot project in California's national forests. Timber harvesting is deferred in spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers, except in designated catastrophic event areas where resource management activities can be applied to prevent environmental degradation. The Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register upon completion of the draft environmental impact statement, proposing to designate a catastrophic event area based on forest health conditions and resource management activities. During the pilot project, the Secretary will allow a 45-day public comment period on a draft environmental impact statement for designating a catastrophic event area. A hearing will be held in a community near the proposed area. The Secretary will implement resource management activities on Federal lands within the pilot project area, including constructing fuelbreaks and utilizing forest management prescriptions. Cost-effectiveness will be prioritized, and multiple use activities will not be affected. The Secretary will use specific funds for resource management activities on Federal lands within the pilot project area, without limiting other multiple use activities. The Secretary will conduct a pilot project in the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest, using specific funds allocated for resource management activities. The project will last for five years or until the completion of forest plan amendments. The Secretary will initiate a process to amend the land and resource management plans for the Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Tahoe National Forest to incorporate the pilot project, area designations, and resource management activities. Reporting requirements include submitting an annual report to Congress on the pilot project's status. The annual report to Congress on the pilot project must include an accounting of fund usage, details on acres treated, forest health improvements, fire risk reductions, water yield increases, and other natural resources benefits achieved. It should also describe the economic benefits to local communities and compare revenues and costs of resource management activities with timber management on Federal lands from 1992 to 1996. The annual report to Congress on the pilot project must include a schedule for resource management activities in the pilot project area for the next fiscal year."
