    "content": "The \"Unemployment Insurance Solvency Act of 2011\" includes provisions such as extension of assistance for states with advances, reduction in employer taxes, modifications of employer credit reductions, increase in taxable wage base, voluntary state agreements to abate federal loans, and rewards for solvent states and employers. Extension of assistance for states with advances under the Social Security Act is amended to extend until 2012. The amendment will take effect as if included in the Assistance for Unemployed Workers and Struggling Families Act. Additionally, there will be a reduction in the rate of employer taxes. SEC. 3. REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF EMPLOYER TAXES. Amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 reduces employer taxes effective July 1, 2011 or upon enactment of the Act to 5.78 percent for calendar year 2014. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 reduces employer taxes to 5.4 percent of total wages paid for employment in the calendar year. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 reduces employer taxes to 0.3 percent of total wages paid for employment in the calendar year. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 reduces employer taxes to 0.3 percent of total wages paid for employment in the calendar year, effective from January 1, 2011. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 adjusts taxable years starting from January 1, 2013, and eliminates credit reductions for years 2011 and 2012. Definitions and special rules are also revised in the code. The effective date for these changes is specified. The amendments made by this section will be effective as of January 1, 2011. SEC. 5. INCREASE IN THE TAXABLE WAGE BASE. Section 3306 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to change the applicable wage base amount for different calendar years. Before 2014, it was $7,000, in 2014 it became $15,000, and from 2015 onwards, it is determined by a specific formula. The amount determined for a calendar year under paragraph (1)(C) is based on the product of average wage growth for the year and the applicable wage base amount from the previous year, rounded to the next higher multiple of $100. The annual wage growth for a calendar year is calculated by dividing the average annual wage in the United States for two 12-month periods and rounding the ratio to the fifth decimal place. This calculation is used to determine the amount for a calendar year under paragraph (1)(C), which is based on the product of average wage growth and the previous year's applicable wage base amount, rounded to the next higher multiple of $100. The average annual wage for a 12-month period is determined by dividing total covered wages by average covered employment under State unemployment compensation laws, rounding to the nearest whole dollar. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. VOLUNTARY STATE AGREEMENTS TO ABATE PRINCIPAL ON FEDERAL LOANS. Section 1203 of the Social Security Act is amended to allow governors to apply for voluntary abatement agreements with the Secretary of Labor to repay outstanding advances from the Federal unemployment account. The application must include a plan for repayment of the principal amount within a reasonable period of time. The amended Section 1203 of the Social Security Act allows governors to apply for voluntary abatement agreements with the Secretary of Labor to repay outstanding advances from the Federal unemployment account. The application must include a plan to repay the principal amount and restore the solvency of the State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The plan should be based on the existing unemployment compensation law of the State and may consider any upcoming changes in the law. Upon approval of the application, the Secretary of Labor ensures that the State's plan meets the repayment and solvency goals. The Secretary of Labor may enter into a principal abatement agreement with the State for a period of no more than 7 years. The amount of principal abatement is calculated based on the State's repayable advances multiplied by a loan forgiveness multiplier. The State's loan forgiveness multiplier is determined similarly to the temporary increase of Medicaid FMAP. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allows States to receive principal abatement based on their FMAP tier. The loan multiplier varies depending on specific criteria, with the annual amount of principal abatement equaling one-seventh of the total amount. Certification is required for voluntary abatement agreements. Under voluntary abatement agreements, States must certify that the method for calculating regular unemployment compensation will not be changed to reduce benefits below the current level. State laws cannot be modified to disadvantage unemployed individuals. Under voluntary abatement agreements, State laws cannot be modified to reduce regular unemployment compensation below the current level for eligible individuals. Under voluntary abatement agreements, State laws cannot be modified to reduce regular unemployment compensation below the current level for eligible individuals. The agreement will be less than the maximum amount of regular unemployment compensation that the individual would have been eligible to receive under the State law in effect on the date of enactment. If the State fails to comply with certifications required by the agreement, they will be liable for any previously abated principal. The State's annual principal abatement amount is transferred to the Unemployment Trust Fund on December 31st if the State complies with the agreement. Subsequent compliance results in the amount being credited to the State's loan balance. Any remaining abatement amount after the loan balance reaches zero is transferred to the State's Trust Fund. The Secretary of Labor will create necessary regulations for implementation. The regulations necessary for implementing this subsection include standards for State plans to achieve solvency levels and guidelines for progress towards solvency. The amendments made by this section will take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act. Rewards and incentives are provided for solvent states and employers in those states. Increased interest and tax benefits are provided for solvent states under the Social Security Act and Internal Revenue Code. States with reserves exceeding a certain threshold can receive additional funds for administration purposes. The amendment to the Social Security Act and Internal Revenue Code provides increased interest and tax benefits for solvent states with reserves exceeding a certain threshold. The amendment, effective on the earlier of the enactment of the Act or July 1, 2011, adjusts the percentages for states with reserves meeting specific criteria."
