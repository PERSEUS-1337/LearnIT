    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Fairness in Prescription Drug Prices Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The Congress finds that senior citizens in the US pay high prices for prescription drugs due to discriminatory pricing practices by major manufacturers. Medicare beneficiaries without coverage are the most vulnerable, and providing drugs at lower prices would lower healthcare costs and benefit taxpayers. The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and make prescription drugs available at reduced prices through the Federal Supply Schedule. This includes authorizing wholesale purchase of drugs at lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries and extending benefits to those with terminal illnesses through hospice programs. SEC. 3. PARTICIPATING PHARMACIES. Participating pharmacies can enter agreements with the Secretary to sell covered outpatient drugs to Medicare beneficiaries at reduced prices. These agreements allow pharmacies to purchase drugs listed on the Federal Supply Schedule at a discount price and buy as much of a drug as they sell to Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary determines the participating pharmacy discount price. The Secretary determines participating pharmacy discount prices for covered outpatient drugs by adding the Federal Supply Schedule price and administrative costs. Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a hospice program have a special rule. The Act allows hospice programs to partner with pharmacies to provide covered outpatient drugs at reduced prices to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the program. The Secretary will administer the Act using existing methods for drug distribution efficiently. Regulations will be issued as needed. Reports on the Act's effectiveness will be submitted to Congress. SEC. 5. REPORTS TO CONGRESS REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF ACT.\n\nThe Secretary will report to Congress on the Act's effectiveness in protecting Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory drug pricing and providing reduced prices for prescription drugs. Consultation with experts and stakeholders will inform these reports, which may also include recommendations for further cost reductions.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.
