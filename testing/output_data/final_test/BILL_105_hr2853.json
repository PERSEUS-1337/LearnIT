    "content": "The Act titled \"National Park Bonds and Capital Improvements Act of 1997\" includes definitions for key terms. The \"National Park Capital Improvement Fund\" is established to contain revenues collected by the National Park Service for paying debt service on National Park Capital Improvement bonds. These bonds are sold to generate capital for various projects, including physical construction and resource inventories. The National Park System includes various projects such as resource inventories, monitoring activities, educational programs, and transportation systems. It also involves data gathering and planning for projects aimed at protecting park resources. The term is defined in the Act of August 8, 1953. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that our Nation's parks are a vital part of our national heritage, but they have not been properly cared for in recent years. Despite increasing visitor numbers, there is a lack of funding to protect the resources within the parks. Congress must allocate adequate funds to address the backlog of natural and cultural resource protection needs. The urgent need to protect the cultural, historic, and natural resources in parks is crucial for attracting visitors. Projects to prevent ongoing harm and rehabilitate past damage to park resources should have the highest funding priority. In prioritizing park needs, emphasis should be on minimizing private car use and traffic issues while providing safe transportation alternatives. Non-construction activities like educational programs are essential investments for parks. SEC. 4. A National Park Capital Improvement Fund is established in the Treasury to deposit revenues collected by the National Park Service for debt service on bonds issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. The bonds' interest will be paid from the Fund. The Secretary of the Interior will enter a memorandum of agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to manage the National Park Capital Improvement Fund and issue bonds. The agreement will specify the bond amount, maturity not exceeding 20 years, per capita amount for bond payments, and types of projects funded. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to credit funds collected from various sources to the National Park Capital Improvement Fund. This fund will be managed by the Secretary of the Treasury for specified projects. The Secretary of the Treasury will use funds to amortize bond issue, pay interest, and maintain a reserve. Any excess funds will be held for future National Park Capital Improvement bonds. SEC. 7. USE OF BOND PROCEEDS. Bond proceeds under this Act may be used for projects that protect park resources, provide educational programs, and rehabilitate or construct park facilities. The Act allows the use of bond proceeds for projects in national park units, with limitations to ensure protection of park resources and visitor experience. Projects must comply with laws governing the park system, specific park laws, the park's management plan, and prioritize projects to prevent ongoing resource harm and rehabilitate past damage. The Act prioritizes projects in national park units to prevent ongoing resource harm and rehabilitate past damage. Emphasis is placed on protecting resources, enhancing visitor experience, and minimizing private car use in transportation systems. Interest earned on bond proceeds is transferred to the National Park Capital Improvement Fund. The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury will jointly issue regulations for the implementation of the Act. The Secretary of the Interior will prioritize projects to be funded under the Act."
