    "content": "The Act titled \"World Bank International Development Association Replenishment Act of 2009\" defines terms like \"greenhouse gas\" and \"multilateral development bank.\" It expands climate change mitigation activities and greenhouse gas accounting for multilateral development banks. The Act expands climate change mitigation activities and greenhouse gas accounting for multilateral development banks. The Secretary of the Treasury will ensure multilateral development banks adopt greenhouse gas accounting for projects seeking funding, including calculating net greenhouse gas flows, establishing uniform techniques, making calculations public, measuring project emissions, and considering global social costs. The Secretary of the Treasury will work to expand climate change mitigation activities at multilateral development banks by supporting energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, integrating energy efficiency measures into infrastructure projects, and engaging with developing countries on analysis and policy measures for low emissions. The Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress on efforts to implement measures for low carbon emission economic development, promoting private sector engagement in renewable energy investments, and integrating these objectives into multilateral development bank strategies. SEC. 4. ANTI-CORRUPTION CAPACITY BUILDING. The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States Executive Director at the World Bank to urge the World Bank to help countries build capacity to investigate, adjudicate, and punish corruption and all crimes in a manner consistent with law enforcement and judicial norms. Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance programs that improve recipient countries' ability to prevent, investigate, and prosecute fraud and corruption through initiatives aimed at building institutional capacity, improving transparency, and promoting public education on the costs of corruption. The World Bank is urged to promote public education on corruption costs, encourage enforceable sanctions, support the judicial sector in low-income countries, and develop tools for fraud detection in projects. SEC. 5. REPORTS ON PROCESS TO ADDRESS INSPECTION FUNCTIONS WITHIN MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS. The Secretary of the Treasury directs the US Executive Director at multilateral development banks to urge various accountability mechanisms to include assessments of completed inspection processes in their publications. The level of participation of requesters and affected individuals in compliance investigations and problem-solving processes, as well as their involvement in creating action plans to address violations and outstanding issues, is crucial for accountability in banks. To enhance accountability in banks, it is important to involve requesters and affected individuals in compliance investigations and problem-solving processes, and to strengthen inspection mechanisms in development banks with identified weaknesses. SEC. 6. EVALUATION. The Secretary of the Treasury must ensure that multilateral development banks rigorously evaluate the development impact of their projects and programs, using random assignment when possible. Congress believes that these evaluations should focus on research-proven approaches with significant and lasting impacts on development outcomes. Multilateral development banks should issue an annual report with details on the questions addressed, rationale for project selection, evaluation methodologies, and findings. Random assignment should be used for evaluations to ensure rigor in assessing development impact. The International Development Association Act is amended to authorize the United States to contribute $3,705,000,000 to the fifteenth replenishment of the resources of the Association, subject to necessary appropriations. Additionally, $3,705,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for this contribution by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to contribute $356,000,000 on behalf of the United States to the International Development Association for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. This contribution is subject to appropriations and without prejudice to existing funding arrangements. The term 'Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative' refers to the proposal outlined in the G8 Finance Ministers' Communique. The G8 Heads of State reaffirmed the Communique entitled `Conclusions on Development' at the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005. SEC. 8. COORDINATION OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY. The Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with other Federal agencies, will conduct a study on the roles each agency plays in US policy concerning the World Bank Group. A report with the study results must be submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Financial Services Committee within 1 year. The report will evaluate interagency coordination in US policy on World Bank Group development activities."
