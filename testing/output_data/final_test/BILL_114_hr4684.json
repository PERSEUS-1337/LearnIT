    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act\" expands initial and urgent mental health care for certain former members of the Armed Forces. The \"Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act\" amends Chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, to provide initial and urgent mental health care for former members of the Armed Forces not otherwise eligible for care. This includes an initial mental health assessment and necessary health care services to address urgent mental health needs, such as risk of suicide or harming others. Former members eligible for this program meet specific criteria outlined in the Act. The \"Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act\" provides initial and urgent mental health care for former members of the Armed Forces who do not meet the eligibility criteria for regular care. This includes individuals who were discharged under conditions that are not honorable, have applied for a character of service determination, and are not eligible for the health care system established by section 1705 of this title. The Secretary may provide mental health care services to veterans under a contract with a qualified professional if Department facilities are clinically inadvisable or economically inaccessible. Training programs for mental health care will be established. In establishing a program for mental health care services, the Secretary will provide training for professionals, ensure appropriate therapeutic settings, and offer referral services for former members not eligible for care. The Secretary will also provide information on available mental health services. The Secretary will provide information on mental health care services, including a toll-free telephone number, updated information at Department facilities, and coordination with the Secretary of Defense for members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary shall submit an annual report to Congress on mental health care services provided, including data on the number of individuals receiving services disaggregated by gender. Additionally, the table of sections in title 38, United States Code, will be amended to include this new item. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a study on the impact of combat service on suicide rates and mental health issues among veterans, comparing those who received mental health care from the Veterans Health Administration with those who did not. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will conduct a study comparing suicide rates and mental health issues among combat and non-combat veterans, with a report due to Congress within a year of the Act's enactment."
