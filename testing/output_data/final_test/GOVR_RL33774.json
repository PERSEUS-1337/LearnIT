    "content": "The General Services Administration (GSA) manages federal real property and assets, including 8,847 buildings and structures worth $68.8 billion in FY2006. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) was established in 1972 to finance operating and capital costs for federal buildings through rental charges from tenant agencies. GSA determines rental rates based on appraisals of comparable properties and includes operating expenses and tenant improvements. The GSA conducts property appraisals every five years to determine commercial market rates for its facilities. If no comparable buildings are available, they use a \"return on investment (ROI)\" method to calculate rates. The GSA Administrator sets regulations for tenant agencies' rental rates, which may include charges for additional improvements or remodeling. Tenant agencies are responsible for paying shell rent for as long as they occupy GSA facilities. The GSA charges tenant agencies for leasing and operating costs through occupancy agreements. Congress allocates funds from the Federal Buildings Fund for building expenses, construction, repairs, and renovations. Concerns exist about insufficient revenues for capital improvements. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) was established to finance capital costs of federal facilities through rent assessments. Prior to this, construction authority for federal buildings was approved in separate legislation until the Omnibus Public Building Act of 1902. The acquisition of federal property was suspended during World War I and reinstated with the Public Buildings Act of 1926, providing authority for construction by congressional authorizations and appropriations. The Public Buildings Act of 1949 authorized the acquisition of sites and design plans for federal buildings outside Washington, DC. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 established the General Services Administration (GSA) to administer federal real property. In 1954, the Public Buildings Act was amended to allow the GSA Administrator to acquire titles to real property and construct federal buildings through lease-purchase contracts. The Public Buildings Act of 1959 re-established requirements for federal building construction, giving the Administrator of General Services authority to acquire, construct, and renovate federal buildings. The act replaced lease-purchase contracts with direct federal construction funded through congressional authorizations. In the decade following the 1959 Public Buildings Act, Congress appropriated $115 million annually to GSA for new construction projects. By 1972, 63 authorized building projects lacked funding due to fiscal constraints. An additional $1 billion was needed for completion, as stated by the House Committee on Public Works in April 1972. The committee emphasized the need for a consolidated appropriation for construction projects to expedite the Federal building program. A proposed buildings fund, financed by rental charges from tenant agencies, was suggested for one-time project funding. The creation of the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) in 1971 aimed to make tenant agencies directly accountable for their office space needs, leading to more efficient utilization of federal office space. Congress believed this would result in greater oversight of the federal buildings program. Two methods were considered for establishing agency rental charges: the cost-recovery method and the rent-equivalent method. The cost-recovery method for agency rental charges was rejected by Congress due to insufficient revenue generation, estimated needing $150 million in additional appropriations annually. The rent-equivalent method, based on commercial rates, was ultimately adopted into law. GSA officials projected $800 million in rental charges with $300 million available for capital expenditures. The Senate Committee on Public Works endorsed GSA's use of commercial charges but advised against setting rates too high to create a surplus. P.L. 92-313 established a real property management financing fund to receive revenues from tenant agencies for GSA-owned-and-leased space. Revenues were to be used for real property management and related activities as specified in annual appropriations Acts. The Federal Buildings Fund, established in FY1975, replaced two existing funds and received unexpended balances. It authorized appropriations for the first two fiscal years and additional appropriations as needed. Purchase contract authority was reinstated for three years to fund construction projects. The GSA Administrator was authorized to enter into purchase contracts not exceeding 30 years with title reverting to the federal government. The 1972 legislation required GSA to pay local property taxes and charge tenants for space, maintenance, and repairs. The Federal Buildings Fund was established to generate revenue for new construction and capital improvements. However, it did not generate sufficient revenues as expected. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) was created in FY1975 to fund capital expenditures for federal facilities. However, due to statutory obligations and limitations, the FBF did not generate enough revenue. GAO estimated that half of GSA's federal building inventory was over 30 years old, requiring $1.1 billion in repairs. Despite having $442 million available for new construction in the first six years, funds for alterations often exceeded rental income. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) faced revenue losses due to limited funding sources and GSA's use of purchase contracts for construction financing. GSA borrowed $1.3 billion through participation certificates to private investors for building projects, leading to financial strain on the FBF. The Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) faced financial strain due to high expenditures on real estate taxes for federal facilities. GAO reported in 1979 that FBF expenditures exceeded rental income for newly constructed buildings. By FY1980, FBF resources were used to pay $100 million for principal, interest, and taxes on 68 buildings. Annual purchase contract payments increased from $51 million in 1976 to $156 million in 1982. Maintenance and other services costs also rose from $414 million in FY1975 to nearly $571 million in FY1980, impacting FBF reserves and revenue generation for capital investment. The Federal Buildings Fund faced financial strain due to high expenditures on real estate taxes for federal facilities. Congress and the Office of Management and Budget periodically restricted rent payments that GSA could charge tenant agencies, reducing available revenues by nearly $4 billion between 1975 and 1988. GSA established rental charges based on composite commercial rates in different locations, with quality ratings influencing building rental charges. The GAO criticized GSA's quality ratings as subjective and not based on adequate criteria. Tenant agencies also disagreed with GSA's methodology for determining fees. Congress reduced GSA's rent charges by 10% in FY1975, leading to a decrease in rental income to the Federal Buildings Fund. In FY1976 and FY1977, Congress reduced agency rental payments to GSA by 10% and authorized excess revenues to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury. GSA also granted length-of-occupancy discounts to agency tenants, further reducing rental income. An internal audit criticized GSA's method of calculating rental rates. In response to GAO recommendations, GSA began conducting individual surveys and appraisals for each owned and leased building to determine rental rates equivalent to commercial rates. GSA's new appraisal method provided documented justifications for rental rates, leading Congress to require excess income to be deposited in the U.S. Treasury. The GAO reported that GSA transferred $7 million from the Federal Buildings Fund to the U.S. Treasury, reducing funds for building repairs. Aging federal facilities urgently need costly repairs, with many vacant or no longer needed. GAO highlighted mismanagement risks and the need for modernization or disposal of these facilities. The GAO reported that GSA has long-standing problems managing its real property inventory, with significant restoration, repair, and maintenance backlogs in federal facilities due to ineffective stewardship. Significant repairs and alterations are needed for deteriorating federal buildings with health and safety issues, including inadequate ventilation and fire safety systems, unsafe water supplies, and structural deteriorations from plumbing leaks. The GSA faces challenges in maintaining federal facilities due to aging infrastructure, including outdated cooling/heating systems and obsolete electrical systems. This impacts employee recruitment, retention, and productivity. Limited FBF revenues exacerbate the demands for repairs on deteriorating buildings, with GSA authorized $580 million annually for repairs from FY1994 to FY1999. In 1999, GSA estimated that nearly $4 billion was needed to complete repairs and alterations to 903 federal buildings, with some facilities requiring major repairs exceeding $20 million each. Despite substantial work completed, some repairs identified over five years ago remained unfinished due to inadequate funding. In 2003, GAO reported that GSA's estimated backlog of repairs and alterations would require $5.7 billion in federal funding. By 2007, GSA reported a $6.6 billion backlog of repairs for federal facilities, leading to serious cost implications and underutilization of government buildings. GAO investigations revealed that many federal properties are not financially self-sustaining and no longer relevant to agency missions, suggesting that identifying and disposing of unneeded properties could free up funding for necessary repairs. GSA struggles to fully assess its vast real property portfolio for needed repairs due to unreliable data, causing delays in maintenance. Inventory reports submitted by agencies lack accuracy and timeliness, with no legal requirement for submission. GAO highlighted the lack of a systematic approach in managing the inventory, leading to further delays in building repairs. In July 2000, GAO reported to Congress that federal agencies lack accurate and timely data on their real property holdings, hindering effective management. GAO found that GSA and other agencies had poor data on the market value of their properties. Agency compliance with proposed inventory requirements was deemed challenging due to the lack of standards for reliable information. GSA's limited success in property identification, maintenance, and disposal was attributed to the absence of a comprehensive property listing. In response to GAO's criticisms, GSA started conducting systematic reviews of facilities, prioritizing projects with higher rent revenues and disposing of properties with no federal purpose. The Federal Real Property Council issued new reporting requirements in FY2005, replacing GSA's old requirements. GSA has faced challenges with its building portfolio not being financially self-sustaining, leading to a reliance on leasing for space needs. The GSA's inventory of leased space increased from 87.4 million square feet in FY1975 to 91.2 million square feet in FY1981, with rental costs rising from $364 million to nearly $677 million during the same period. GSA has entered into lease agreements due to insufficient funding for construction or repairs, resulting in higher costs for the federal government compared to total construction expenses. In a 1999 investigation, GAO auditors found that construction would have been more economical than leasing in eight out of nine cases, saving an estimated $126 million for the federal government. Despite this, GSA heavily relies on operating leases, with $4.6 billion spent on leasing 168.8 million square feet of office space in 2006. The congressional appropriations process tends to favor operating leases over construction or purchasing agreements, even though operating leases are more expensive over a 10-year period. The current budget process favors operating leases over construction or purchasing agreements, despite being more expensive over a 10-year period. GAO studies show that this approach leads to an \"over-reliance\" on leasing for meeting government space needs. While agency rental payments have increased, they are not sufficient to cover growing capital investment needs and leased space costs. Between FY1995 and FY2001, $5.3 billion in rent revenues was deposited annually into the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The majority of this revenue was used for operating costs, rental payments, and new construction, leaving only $606 million each year for repairs and renovations. In FY2007, $7.5 billion in FBF revenue came from federal tenant agencies, with $4.4 billion allocated for rental space and $733 million for repairs and alterations. Despite increased funding authorized by Congress, the funds have not been sufficient to maintain GSA's building inventory. In FY2006, Congress approved $1.1 billion in FBF revenues for repairs, exceeding GSA's request by 104%. GAO reported that GSA is exploring new ways to generate additional FBF revenues for capital improvements in GSA-owned facilities. This includes prioritizing maintenance projects that generate more rent revenue and reducing operating costs to redirect funds to repair and alteration projects. Legislation in the 108th Congress authorized the GSA Administrator to convey real property by sale, lease, or other means. In the 108th Congress, the GSA Administrator was authorized to convey real property through sale, lease, or exchange agreements, with net proceeds deposited into the FBF for future capital acquisitions and improvements. An additional $50.4 million in net proceeds was achieved in FY2006. The FBF faced revenue challenges due to rent restrictions imposed by Congress and OMB, limiting GSA's ability to finance repair and alteration requirements. GAO recommended the removal of these rent restrictions and advised against authorizing new ones. The GSA Administrator also has the authority to exempt tenant agencies from rent payments for occupying GSA space. In 2005, GSA granted 14 rent exemptions totaling $169.6 million in forgone annual rent. GSA and the federal judiciary collaborated on courthouse construction projects, with $4.5 billion in funding from FY1993 to FY2005. Over the past 30 years, the judicial branch has increased GSA space occupancy by 310%. The Judicial Conference requested a $483 million rent exemption from GSA, which would bankrupt the FBF according to GSA testimony. Two bills were introduced in Congress for rent relief, including the \"Judiciary Rent Reform Act of 2006\" to limit rent charges for GSA-owned-and-leased space. The proposed legislation aimed to require the judiciary to reimburse GSA for courthouse construction and maintenance costs. Two bills were introduced in Congress for rent relief, including one that would limit rent charges for GSA-owned and leased space. The bill was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 15, 2006, reported favorably on April 27, 2006, and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar the same day. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed disappointment with the federal judiciary's attempt to relieve budget problems by challenging courthouse rent costs. The committee supports the Federal Buildings Fund's mission and opposes transferring courthouses to the judicial branch with debt forgiveness. The Judicial Conference's rent exemption request has raised concerns about costly courthouse construction, which GAO reported as among the most expensive federal spaces to build. GAO recommended that GSA analyze factors like space increases and security upgrades to explain judiciary rental rates. Resolving issues include courtroom sharing and ensuring future construction agreements between GSA and the judiciary. The GAO recommended that the judiciary create incentives for more efficient space use and establish criteria for courtrooms and chambers. GSA officials face challenges with aging buildings and maintenance needs exceeding available revenues. GAO suggests finding new ways to generate additional revenues for necessary repairs. GAO has recommended that GSA find new ways to generate additional revenues to upgrade federal inventory. Legislative reform initiatives have been introduced in previous Congresses to authorize the agency to convey excess real property for capital acquisitions and improvements. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to revise federal real property management policies, but none have been reported out of committee before adjournment. Two bills introduced in the 108th Congress, H.R. 2548 and H.R. 2573, aimed to revise federal property management policies. H.R. 2548, the Federal Property Asset Management Reform Act, sought to give landholding agencies more flexibility in managing federal properties through various transactions. If enacted, this legislation would have allowed agencies to retain proceeds from real property transactions. H.R. 2548 and H.R. 2573 were bills introduced in the 108th Congress to revise federal property management policies. H.R. 2548 aimed to give agencies flexibility in managing federal properties by allowing them to retain proceeds from transactions. H.R. 2573 focused on public-private partnerships to increase funding for the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) through agreements with non-federal entities for property transactions. Transactions have been deposited into the FBF. H.R. 2573 was favorably reported from the House Government Reform Committee to the full House on June 25, 2003. The 108th Congress revised GSA's property management policies with the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act on December 8, 2004, authorizing the GSA Administrator to convey real property for future acquisitions and improvements. President George W. Bush implemented new federal property guidelines with Executive Order 13327 on February 4, 2004. Earlier administrative initiatives under E.O. 13327 established the Senior Real Property Officer position in executive branch agencies to enhance accountability for real property asset management. The Federal Real Property Council within OMB was also created to provide guidance and oversight for the executive branch's real property inventory. The Executive Order 13327 required the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide policy oversight and manage selected properties for executive branch agencies. GSA could delegate operational responsibilities to agencies with proven ability. It also mandated the establishment of a comprehensive database of real property inventory and publication of asset management measures by the Federal Real Property Council. The Federal Real Property Council, under E.O. 13327, collaborated with OMB and landholding agencies to develop legislative initiatives for real property management. H.R. 3134 proposed a pilot program for expedited disposal of surplus federal properties to generate revenue for capital improvements. The OMB Director would select properties based on disposal cost and time, aiming to sell unneeded properties. H.R. 3134 aimed to expedite the disposal of surplus federal properties to generate revenue for capital improvements. The bill would have authorized the sale of selected federal properties at or above fair market value, with agencies retaining a portion of the proceeds. Amendments included notifying local governments of property disposal and excluding properties for homeless groups from the pilot program. The amendment required the OMB Director to submit an annual report on the Federal Real Property Disposal Pilot Program to specific committees. H.R. 3134 was approved by the House Committee on Government Reform in 2005. H.R. 2829, the FY2008 appropriations bill, allocated additional funds to the Federal Buildings Fund. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 authorized further deposits to address rent repairs and resource limitations. GSA is conducting a financial analysis to identify GSA-owned facilities not generating enough income to cover expenses and future repairs. Capital reinvestment funds will be used on these facilities to potentially increase rental income. Nonperforming buildings may be disposed of or undergo property exchanges, outleasing, or public-private partnerships. Legislation allows GSA to convey real property for future capital in the Federal Buildings Fund. In FY2006, $50.4 million in net proceeds for the Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) was achieved through property exchanges. GSA faces challenges in funding repairs due to insufficient rent revenues and a lack of detailed property information. Existing real property laws restrict agencies' ability to generate additional revenues or dispose of buildings no longer in use, hindering effective federal property management. The 108th Congress revised GSA's property management policies with the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, allowing the GSA Administrator to convey real property for capital acquisitions. H.R. 3134 proposed a pilot program for expedited disposal of surplus federal properties. Certain private sector transactions will continue to be encouraged. Certain types of transactions with the private sector will be encouraged to restore federal properties and dispose of unneeded government properties. Real property reform initiatives, like H.R. 3134, could change existing law to incentivize agencies to manage and dispose of their property inventories. GSA's reliance on leased property is a major obstacle to a sustainable federal property portfolio. The current budget process favors lease agreements that may not be the most cost-effective option. The budget process favors lease agreements that may not be the most cost-effective option. Congress could consider including total lease agreement costs in annual appropriations to reflect long-term expenses. President Bush's creation of the Federal Real Property Council aims to improve government property management. GAO reports positive progress in developing performance measures and a property inventory database. Funding limitations remain a challenge for GSA. Funding limitations are a major obstacle for GSA in completing urgent repairs and renovations to federal facilities. Addressing long-standing issues with the real property portfolio will require a reconsideration of funding priorities due to budget constraints. Without effective incentives, top management accountability, and transparency, real property problems will persist and potentially worsen. Congress remains concerned about the size and efficiency of GSA-managed space, leasing program costs, and capital investments. Various stakeholders, including Congress, the executive branch, local and foreign governments, the private sector, and advocacy groups, have a vested interest in how GSA manages its real property. A diversity of views could be expected if Congress decides to further address this issue."
