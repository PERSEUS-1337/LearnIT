    "content": "The Americans with Disabilities Act provides protections against discrimination for individuals with disabilities, including those with serious contagious diseases. However, individuals with contagious diseases may not be hired or given access to public places if it poses a significant risk to others. Determinations are based on specific facts. The Americans with Disabilities Act protects individuals with disabilities, including those with contagious diseases. Determinations of risk are fact-specific, considering the transmission patterns of diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. The ADA defines disability as a limitation in major life activities. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 expanded the definition of disability. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008, P.L. 110-325, broadened the interpretation of disability, emphasizing broad coverage and new rules of construction. It states that an impairment need not limit multiple major life activities to be considered a disability, and even episodic or remission impairments can qualify if they would substantially limit a major life activity when active. The determination of disability should not consider the ameliorative effects of treatments. The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 broadened the definition of disability, stating that impairments need not limit multiple major life activities to qualify. The ameliorative effects of mitigating measures should not be considered, except for ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. Individuals with serious contagious diseases may be considered disabled, but the severity of the disease is fact-specific. The EEOC has indicated that individuals infected with the 2009 H1N1 virus may not be considered disabled under the ADA, unless the disease becomes more severe. The guidance does not specify when a contagious disease would be serious enough to be covered by the ADA. If an infected individual poses a direct threat to others, they may not be protected under the ADA. The ADA allows for individuals with disabilities to be protected from discrimination, but if they pose a direct threat to others, they may not be hired or given access to public accommodations. The ADA also requires the Secretary of HHS to publish a list of infectious diseases that may be transmitted through handling food. Title III of the ADA states that entities are not required to permit individuals to participate in goods or services if they pose a threat to others. The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities but allows for exclusion if they pose a direct threat to others. Title III states that entities are not required to permit participation if there is a significant risk to health or safety that cannot be eliminated. Standards for employment under title I may include a requirement that individuals with contagious diseases do not pose a direct threat to others in the workplace, referencing the Supreme Court decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline. The Department of Justice issued amended regulations for titles II and III of the ADA in 2010, which included revised language concerning the direct threat exception. The direct threat exception in title II and title III regulations of the ADA allows public entities or places of public accommodations to deny services to individuals who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. An individualized assessment based on current medical knowledge is required to determine the severity of the risk and the probability of injury occurring. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in federally funded programs. The ADA and Section 504 both aim to prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs receiving federal financial assistance. The ADA drew inspiration from Section 504, including the concept of determining if a person with a contagious disease is qualified for a job. The ADA's legislative history referenced a Supreme Court case that highlighted the importance of assessing the risk of transmitting infectious diseases in the workplace. The Court emphasized the need for an individualized inquiry to protect individuals with disabilities from discrimination based on prejudice or stereotypes. It adopted the test from the AMA brief, considering factors like the nature and duration of the risk, severity, and probabilities of disease transmission.

It adopted the test from the AMA brief, considering factors like the nature and duration of the risk, severity, and probabilities of disease transmission. The Court also addressed the ADA definition of individual with a disability, ruling that asymptomatic HIV infection qualifies as a disability under the ADA. The Supreme Court in Bragdon v. Abbott addressed the issue of direct threat in the context of ADA compliance. The plaintiff, Ms. Abbott, with asymptomatic HIV infection, sought dental treatment but was told she could only be treated in a hospital. The Court emphasized the need for a risk assessment based on objective evidence and the perspective of the individual refusing treatment. Dr. Bragdon had a duty to assess the risk of infection. Dr. Bragdon had the duty to assess the risk of infection based on objective, scientific information. The first circuit court of appeals found that his evidence was too speculative for summary judgment. The Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal held that the ADA does not require an employer to hire an individual with a disability if the job would endanger their health. The ADA allows employers to impose qualification standards to ensure the health and safety of other individuals in the workplace. The Supreme Court upheld a regulation allowing employers to defend against discrimination allegations if the threat is only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation. The Supreme Court upheld a regulation allowing employers to defend against discrimination allegations if the threat is only to the health or safety of the individual making the allegation. Justice Souter found that the EEOC regulations were not workplace paternalism that the ADA seeks to outlaw, emphasizing that a direct threat defense must be based on current medical knowledge. Lower courts have dealt with various direct threat cases under the ADA involving different disabilities and accommodations. Various occupations involved in direct threat cases under the ADA have included public health care workers, public safety officers, transportation operators, food handlers, and industrial workers, with conditions such as AIDS, HIV infection, mental illness, and hepatitis being factors."
