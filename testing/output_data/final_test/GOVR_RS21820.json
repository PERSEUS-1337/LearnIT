    "content": "The Bush Administration set a deadline for the end of the U.S. occupation in Iraq, contingent on completing a new constitution and holding national elections by 2005. Political infighting and insurgency delayed progress, leading to a plan for Iraqi sovereignty by June 30, 2004, with a Transitional Administrative Law and local caucuses to select a national assembly. The agreement to form a national assembly by May 31, 2004 faced opposition from Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, leading to a UN assessment that elections could not be held before late 2004 or early 2005. The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) was signed on March 8, 2004, outlining the formation of a transition government chosen by a 250-seat National Assembly by January 31, 2005, with a presidency council expected to consist of a Shiite president and two Sunni Arab deputies. The transition government in Iraq, post-January 31, 2005, is expected to have a Shiite president, with Sunni Arab and Kurd deputies. The election law aims for gender diversity in the National Assembly. The Kurds maintain their autonomous region but do not control Kirkuk. Kurdish militias can still operate. The government is tasked with drafting a constitution by August 15, 2005, for a national vote by October 15, 2005. The voters in three Iraqi provinces have the power to veto the constitution, giving the Kurds a significant influence. If approved, elections for a new government are to be held by December 15, 2005. The constitution recognizes Islam as the official religion but also upholds fundamental rights such as freedom of expression and equality. If the constitution is not approved, it will be redrafted and resubmitted for approval. The interim government in Iraq, to be in office from July 1, 2004, until January 31, 2005, was chosen by U.N. envoy Brahimi due to ongoing violence. It was envisioned to consist of technocrats, but political maneuvering led to the inclusion of IGC and cabinet members or their allies. The interim government in Iraq, formed on June 1, 2004, includes non-political figures alongside political allies in key positions. U.N. envoy Brahimi faced pressure to finalize the government on time, resulting in the inclusion of various political figures. The government structure includes a ceremonial president, two deputy presidents, a prime minister, deputy prime minister, ministers, and ministers of state. The interim government in Iraq, formed on June 1, 2004, includes a deputy prime minister, 26 ministers, two ministers of state with portfolio, and three ministers of state without portfolio. The prime minister holds executive power, and six members of the government are women. Some ministers were retained from the occupation period. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546 outlines the powers and responsibilities of the interim government, endorsing the handover of sovereignty and limiting U.S. authority on non-security issues. The interim government in Iraq, formed on June 1, 2004, includes a deputy prime minister, 26 ministers, two ministers of state with portfolio, and three ministers of state without portfolio. The United States and United Nations intend for the interim government to run ministries and prepare for national elections, with limited authority on non-security issues. The Kurds are concerned about potential changes to laws protecting them from the Arab majority, as Resolution 1546 omitted mention of these protections. Prime Minister Allawi has assured that relevant provisions of the laws will not be undone. The interim government in Iraq, formed on June 1, 2004, includes a 100-seat advisory council (\"Interim National Council\") with veto power over executive decisions. Resolution 1546 outlines the operational relationship between coalition forces and the Iraqi government, with a review of the coalition's mandate after twelve months. Resolution 1546 outlines the operational relationship between coalition forces and the Iraqi government, with a review of the coalition's mandate after twelve months. The mandate would expire when a permanent government is sworn in at the end of 2005, and the interim government has control over Iraq's oil revenues and the Development Fund for Iraq. Other preparations for handover included Bremer departing Iraq, the CPA ceasing to exist, and the opening of a large U.S. embassy headed by Ambassador John Negroponte. A large U.S. embassy opened in Iraq on June 30, 2004, staffed with about 1,000 U.S. personnel, including 160 officials serving as advisers to the interim government. Some CPA functions were retained at the embassy as an \"Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office (IRMO).\" U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad became a multinational headquarters led by Gen. George Casey. U.S. forces are expected to number around 140,000 into 2005 due to ongoing violence. U.S. and coalition forces are working on building Iraq's security institutions. The U.S. and coalition forces are working on building Iraq's security institutions, but Iraqi forces are struggling to maintain security on their own. The Program Management Office (PMO) will be replaced by a \"Project and Contracting Office.\" Reconstruction funds have been slow to be obligated, with $8 billion out of $23 billion already spent by July 2004. Legal issues may arise regarding the interim government's sovereignty and the validity of legal contracts and property interests. The validity of legal contracts and property interests in Iraq is in doubt due to changes in the status of coalition forces. International law governing the occupation of Iraq includes U.N. Security Council resolutions and treaties like the Hague Regulations and the Fourth Geneva Convention. While international law requires maintaining existing laws and governmental structure during occupation, U.N. Resolution 1483 suggests potential changes to Iraqi institutions. Resolution 1546 recognizes the temporary and limited power of the Iraqi interim government, substituting it for the CPA as the temporary governing authority until an internationally recognized, representative government is established. Some obligations and authority of the CPA will remain with the United States as head of the MNF. The interim government in Iraq has obligations under UN approval, including the Oil-for-Food program and the DFI. Despite limited sovereignty, the interim government could potentially amend the TAL. CPA laws remain in force unless amended during the transitional period, with the United States not retaining authority to interpret or enforce them. Resolution 1546 advises the interim government to refrain from actions affecting Iraq's future, but it's unclear if CPA temporary laws are protected. The interim government could choose to rescind these laws, impacting foreign investors. The MNF operates with Iraqi consent under a UN mandate, not as occupying forces, to maintain security until elections. The UN mandate under Resolution 1546 allows for combat operations against insurgents and internment for security reasons in Iraq until elections are held. The mandate can be ended at the request of the Iraqi government, but the MNF is still committed to promoting security and stability in accordance with international law. The application of international humanitarian law post-occupation remains ambiguous. Iraq remains under a de facto occupation, with coalition forces immune from Iraqi legal process. A status of forces agreement will only be possible during the second phase of the transition under the authority of the Iraqi Transitional Government. The immunity granted to coalition forces could be revoked by a sovereign Iraq, even under an interim government."
