    "title": "AB 2304",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature recognizes the importance of improving water transfer processes and increasing transparency in the water market to address water shortage impacts on the state's economy. This is in line with the California Water Action Plan's goal of enhancing the water transfer process as part of a long-term water management policy. Despite current participation in the water market, complexities exist, and information may not be readily available to the public. Greater transparency and access to water marketing are essential to leverage investments made in the past two decades to increase water supply reliability. An enhanced water market, along with investments in conveyance, water use efficiency, and other strategies, will help the state during droughts and protect economic and environmental water uses. Voluntary water transfers have been effective in meeting California's water needs. Water markets can improve efficiency, pricing, and supply for consumptive uses, stream flows, and environmental resources, especially during prolonged droughts. Improving water transfer processes and access to water markets can protect investments, enhance coordination among water agencies, incentivize efficiency projects, increase water supply reliability for users, benefit the environment, and communities. Chapter 7.5 is added to the Water Code to address these issues. Chapter 7.5 (Section 485) of the Water Code establishes the California Water Market Clearinghouse Act of 2016. It aims to promote efficient water markets, benefit disadvantaged communities and the environment, and enhance agency coordination and decision-making capacity. Increase agency coordination, transparency, and decision-making capacity to facilitate water transfers and user access to exchanges. Establish a centralized market information platform and streamline review and approval processes without increasing transaction costs. Encourage investments in water efficiency, promote water transfers as sustainable resource management tools, and protect environmental resources in compliance with the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. The California Water Market Clearinghouse, operating independently within the Natural Resources Agency since July 1, 2018, aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in water transfer and exchange processes. The director of the Clearinghouse is appointed by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. The California Water Market Clearinghouse will create a centralized water market platform on its website by December 31, 2018, providing access to information on water transfer and exchange. The platform will be public and contain all relevant data collected by the Clearinghouse. The California Water Market Clearinghouse will establish administrative procedures by December 31, 2018, prioritizing water transfer projects with environmental benefits. The Clearinghouse will collaborate with state agencies to make necessary changes in rules governing water transfers and exchanges. On January 1, 2020, water transfers across the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta must be submitted to the California Water Market Clearinghouse. The Clearinghouse will work with state and federal agencies to process these transfers. The Natural Resources Agency will appoint a Water Transfer Advocate by December 31, 2018. The Clearinghouse does not have the authority to approve or disapprove water transfers. The California Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force will provide recommendations to improve the water transfer process and increase access to the water market. Recommendations will include aggregating and disclosing information on water transfers, such as buyer and seller names and quantity of water exchanged. The California Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force will provide recommendations to improve the water transfer process. This includes details such as the quantity of water, price, duration, rights, use, conveyance facilities, and third-party impacts. Additionally, information will be provided for tracking the progress of proposed transfers for expedient approval. The California Water Market Clearinghouse should require state or local agencies to submit information on water transfers, including quantity, new use location, parties involved, conveyance facilities, and transfer duration. Procedures and standards should be established for coordinated review and action on transfer applications. The California Water Market Clearinghouse prioritizes projects with environmental benefits, reduces transaction costs, evaluates transfers for expedited review, ensures protection of resources, and prevents adverse effects on groundwater conditions. The Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force may also consider recommendations based on scientific evidence for various aspects of water transfers. The Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force aims to consolidate water use, incentivize efficiency, develop pilot transfers, provide transparency on water loss analysis, establish conveyance access protocols, and create market mechanisms for capital access. It includes representatives from state agencies like the Natural Resources Agency, Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Department of Food and Agriculture. The Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force includes representatives from various entities such as academia, water suppliers, disadvantaged communities, environmental organizations, and federal water agencies. The Water Market Clearinghouse Task Force will hold three public meetings to discuss draft recommendations for the California Water Market Clearinghouse. Meetings will be held in northern, central valley, and southern California, inviting various organizations to participate. Recommendations must be submitted by January 1, 2018. The California Water Market Clearinghouse requires an administrative fee for information submission, deposited in a fund for its operation. This chapter complements existing water transfer laws and aims to promote water sustainability and resilience to drought and climate change. The California Water Market Exchange Act of 2016 aims to create water sustainability, resiliency, and adaptability to drought and climate change. It provides benefits for disadvantaged communities, increases transparency in decision-making, facilitates water transfers through a centralized exchange platform, and encourages investments in water efficiency measures. This act serves as an effective mechanism for sustainable management of surface and groundwater resources in the state. The California Water Market Exchange Act establishes a market exchange governed by a five-member board. Board members are appointed by the Governor for four-year terms, with staggered initial appointments to fill vacancies. The California Water Market Exchange Act requires the market exchange to create a centralized platform by December 31, 2017, providing information on water available for transfer. Before any transfer, data such as buyer/seller names, quantity, price, and duration must be submitted. The California Water Market Exchange Act mandates the submission of data for water transfers, including details on quantity, conveyance, storage facilities, time, and duration. The legislation aims to safeguard environmental and community benefits through water transfers and exchanges. The California Water Market Exchange Act requires the development of procedures to streamline water transfer applications and prioritize projects benefiting the environment and communities by December 31, 2017. The California Water Market Exchange Act establishes standards and procedures to ensure transfers and exchanges protect environmental and community benefits. Administrative fees are required for submitting information, deposited in the California Water Market Exchange Fund for administering the chapter. This chapter applies in addition to other laws related to water transfers and exchanges. This chapter applies to all water transfers and exchanges occurring on or after January 1, 2018, in addition to other laws related to water transfers and exchanges."
