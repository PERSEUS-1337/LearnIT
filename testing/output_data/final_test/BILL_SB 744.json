    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 49414 of the Education Code is amended to require schools to provide emergency epinephrine auto-injectors to trained personnel for anaphylactic reactions. Anaphylaxis is defined as a life-threatening hypersensitivity with symptoms like shortness of breath, hives, and swelling, caused by various factors such as insect stings or food allergies. An epinephrine auto-injector is a disposable device for administering emergency epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. A qualified supervisor of health, such as a school nurse, may be authorized to use it. Private elementary and secondary schools in the state may choose to have emergency epinephrine auto-injectors and trained personnel available on campus. This decision should be based on evaluating the school's emergency medical response time and considering if initiating emergency medical services is a suitable alternative. Schools opting for this provision will not receive state funds specifically for this purpose. Each school in the state can appoint volunteers for training on the storage and use of epinephrine auto-injectors from authorized personnel. The Superintendent reviews minimum training standards for administering epinephrine auto-injectors every five years, consulting with various organizations and experts in the field. Training established under this subdivision includes recognizing anaphylaxis symptoms, storage and use of epinephrine auto-injectors, emergency procedures, CPR certification, determining appropriate injector type based on pupil's age/grade, and providing written materials. A school must provide written materials and training consistent with federal guidelines for managing food allergies and medication administration. The school must retain the written materials and distribute a notice to staff about training volunteers to administer an epinephrine auto-injector for anaphylaxis. A qualified supervisor at a school district, county office of education, or charter school must obtain a prescription for epinephrine auto-injectors for each school, stock them, and restock if used. If a school district, county office of education, or charter school lacks a qualified health supervisor, an administrator must fulfill their duties. A prescription for epinephrine auto-injectors can be filled by local or mail order pharmacies. A school nurse, volunteer, or administrator can administer an epinephrine auto-injector to someone showing signs of anaphylaxis. The auto-injector must be restocked within two weeks of use and before its expiration date. A volunteer must initiate emergency medical services as per training materials. Employees volunteering will receive defense and indemnification for civil liability. This information will be provided in writing and kept in the volunteer's personnel file. A state agency, department, or public school can accept gifts, grants, and donations for supporting public schools, including epinephrine auto-injectors from manufacturers or wholesalers."
