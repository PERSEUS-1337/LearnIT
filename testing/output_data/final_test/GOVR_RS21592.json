    "content": "Iran has had a nuclear program for nearly 50 years, starting with a research reactor purchased from the United States in 1959. The Shah's ambitious plan to build 23 nuclear power reactors by the 1990s was seen as grandiose. Iran's current goal is to construct seven nuclear power plants by 2025, despite having significant oil and gas reserves. The country argues that nuclear power is needed to meet rising domestic energy consumption and generate foreign currency. However, many observers question the necessity of such an ambitious nuclear program. Iran's nuclear program has faced skepticism regarding its necessity and economic viability. Iran asserts that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful and condemns the use of nuclear weapons. Despite this, Iran's leaders have expressed determination to continue uranium enrichment, stating it is essential for their defense. Uranium enrichment can serve both peaceful and military purposes. Iran's uranium enrichment activities have raised concerns about Iran's intentions, with calls for rebuilding world confidence by refraining from enrichment. The National Council of Resistance of Iran exposed Iran's undeclared nuclear activities, including uranium enrichment at Natanz and heavy water production at Arak. Inspections by the IAEA revealed significant undeclared Iranian efforts in uranium enrichment and plutonium separation. Iranian officials have been under scrutiny for their nuclear activities. Iranian officials have delayed inspections, changed explanations for discrepancies, cleaned up facilities, and razed a site. Iran tried to cover up many activities, including uranium conversion experiments and receiving information on nuclear weapons from the Khan network. Iran has enrichment plants at Natanz with pilot-scale and commercial-scale facilities. The pilot-scale plant started in 2003 but shut down, while the commercial-scale plant construction was suspended. Iran tested small cascades with uranium hexafluoride gas under IAEA safeguards, achieving a maximum enrichment of 4.2%. Plans to install 3,000 centrifuges in the commercial plant were not met. Iran was operating two cascades under vacuum in February 2007, with plans to install two more, totaling 656 centrifuges. The IAEA required remote monitoring before 500 centrifuges were operational. Iran claimed HEU particles found in 2003 were from foreign centrifuge assemblies. Iran admitted to enriching uranium to 1.2%, while samples showed 36% to 70% U-235. Iranian officials admitted to testing centrifuges with UF6 at the Kalaye Electric Company between 1998 and. Iran admitted testing centrifuges at the Kalaye Electric Company using UF6 between 1998 and 2002. They also acknowledged pursuing more advanced centrifuge and laser enrichment technology, potentially shortening the time to develop a bomb. Iran received centrifuge components after 1995 and purchased magnets suitable for advanced centrifuge designs. The IAEA is investigating these issues, including Iran's plutonium reprocessing experiments. Iran conducted plutonium reprocessing experiments at the Tehran Nuclear Research Center, initially estimating 200 micrograms separated. The IAEA calculated a higher production amount (about 100g), and Iran later admitted understating the quantity. Additionally, Iran experimented with irradiating bismuth between 1989 and 1993, potentially for Polonium-210 production. The heavy water program also raised concerns about Iran's intentions, initially claiming it would be exported but later stating it would be used for a planned reactor. Iran's IR-40 reactor construction continues despite calls for a halt. The heavy water production plant has been operational since 2004, with plans to double production. Iran is years away from producing weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched uranium. Director of National Intelligence stated in 2006 that Tehran likely does not have a nuclear weapon yet. Iran has pursued different methods of enriching uranium and experimented with separating plutonium, indicating expertise in weapons-relevant areas. The 2005 National Intelligence Estimate suggests it will be 10 years before Iran has a nuclear bomb. DNI Negroponte stated in 2007 that Tehran is determined to develop nuclear weapons and is continuing uranium enrichment. Calculations for nuclear weapons production are based on estimates of fissile material production. Iran's limited experience in enrichment should not be equated with the ability to operate an industrial-scale enrichment plant for peaceful or weapons purposes. Negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program have involved IAEA inspectors, the IAEA Board of Governors, and the EU-3 (Germany, UK, France) since 2003. In 2006, Russia and China joined the EU-3 in these negotiations. Negotiations on Iran's nuclear program involved the EU-3 (Germany, UK, France) and expanded to include Russia, China, and the United States in 2006 due to Iran's noncompliance reported to the UN Security Council. The EU-3's voluntary measures with Iran allowed greater IAEA access but also let Iran dictate terms. The EU-3 failed to secure Iran's agreement to halt uranium enrichment, a key objective. The EU-3's negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program failed to secure Iran's agreement to halt uranium enrichment, despite voluntary measures and increased IAEA access. Iran's continued activities raised doubts about its commitment, leading to noncompliance findings by the IAEA in 2005. Iran's noncompliance with the IAEA in 2005 led to discussions with Russia on uranium enrichment. In 2006, Iran resumed enrichment activities, prompting an emergency Board meeting. The IAEA report linked a Khan network document in Iran's possession to nuclear weapons components fabrication. Iran claims the document was provided by the Khan network, but NPT Article II prohibits receiving assistance in nuclear explosives manufacture. The February Board passed a resolution to report Iran to the Security Council for its nuclear activities. The U.N. Security Council called upon Iran to suspend enrichment, ratify the Additional Protocol, and implement transparency measures. Despite claims of cooperation, Iran continued enrichment activities. The IAEA reported to the Security Council on Iran's lack of progress in providing assurance about its nuclear activities. The EU-3, Russia, China, and the United States were involved in discussions regarding Iran's nuclear program. On June 6, 2006, the EU-3, Russia, China, and the United States offered Iran a new negotiating proposal, including incentives like affirming Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy, assistance in building light water reactors, fuel supply guarantees, and lifting certain U.S. sanctions. In return, Iran would suspend enrichment activities, cooperate with the IAEA, and restore international confidence in its nuclear program's peaceful nature. The proposal outlined measures targeting Iran's nuclear program if Iran did not cooperate, including bans on exports, asset freezes, travel bans, and suspension of technical cooperation with the IAEA. Broader measures could include an arms embargo and freezing assets of Iranian financial institutions. The Security Council adopted UNSCR 1737 in December 2006, requiring states to prevent the supply of equipment and technology that could contribute to Iran's nuclear activities and to freeze funds of involved persons and entities. The Security Council adopted UNSCR 1737 in December 2006, imposing measures on Iran's nuclear program. Iran was given 60 days to comply, but the IAEA reported its inability to verify Iran's nuclear activities. Discussions on further sanctions continue."
