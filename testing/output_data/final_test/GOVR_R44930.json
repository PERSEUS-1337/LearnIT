    "content": "Congress has regularly extended temporary tax provisions known as \"tax extenders.\" 13 business-related tax provisions expired at the end of 2016, with one extended through 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retroactively extended these provisions through 2017. This report discusses the economic impact of the 12 business tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended most business-related tax provisions that expired in 2016, except for one related to qualified zone academy bonds. The tax legislation also ended the domestic production activity deduction but extended it for Puerto Rico for 2017. The limit on rum excise taxes to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was extended through 2021. Congress has various options to consider regarding these provisions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended most business-related tax provisions that expired in 2016, except for one related to qualified zone academy bonds. Congress has various options to consider regarding temporary provisions, including retroactive extensions, short-term, long-term, or permanent extensions. The revenue loss from extending provisions that expired in 2017 is estimated to be small. Another option is to make expired provisions permanent, with the Joint Committee on Taxation estimating the effects of making 10 provisions permanent. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended most business-related tax provisions that expired in 2016, except for one related to qualified zone academy bonds. Congress has various options to consider regarding temporary provisions, including retroactive extensions, short-term, long-term, or permanent extensions. The list excluded the extension of the production activities deduction for Puerto Rico and the lower tax rate for timber gains, which would no longer be relevant given the lower corporate tax rate. According to JCT, making the 10 business provisions that expired at the end of 2016 and were extended through 2017 permanent would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $7.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. Extending the rum cover over for an additional six years would add about $4 billion based on the one-year revenue cost. Depreciation methods vary for different assets, with straight-line depreciation used for structures and accelerated deductions for equipment. Equipment is typically depreciated over 5 or 7 years, while nonresidential structures are depreciated over 39 years. The goal is to align tax depreciation with economic depreciation, allowing for earlier deductions to account for the time value of money. Expensing provisions enable immediate deduction of asset costs when placed in service. Legislation enacted in December 2017 (P.L. 115-97) allows for 100% expensing of equipment for several years going forward, impacting the depreciation of assets like equipment with shorter lives. This change makes some temporary provisions more important, such as benefits for motorsports complexes, while others, like shortening lives for racehorses or Indian reservation property, become less significant. Investments in film and television productions are typically recovered using the income forecast method. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included special rules to allow expensing for film and television production costs to discourage \"runaway\" productions. This provision has been regularly extended since 2008, with the PATH Act of 2015 expanding it to include live theatrical productions. The most recent extension was in the BBA18. The special expensing rules for film, television, and live theatrical productions allow taxpayers to deduct up to $15 million of production costs immediately. Productions must have at least 75% of compensation paid for services in the US. Live theatrical productions must be performed in venues with an audience capacity of not more than 3,000. The special expensing rules for film, television, and live theatrical productions allow taxpayers to deduct up to $15 million of production costs immediately. Productions must have at least 75% of compensation paid for services in the US and be performed in venues with an audience capacity of not more than 3,000. This provision benefits productions by allowing deductions to be taken earlier, thus deferring tax liability, depending on the average lag time from production to earning income. The benefit of accelerating cost recovery deductions by one year is limited, especially for taxpayers with limited or no tax liability. The special expensing rules for film, television, and live theatrical productions aim to prevent productions from moving overseas for lower costs and subsidies. Expensing for live theatrical production costs could encourage investment and provide parity with film and television. An exception exists for the theme and amusement park industry, with a recovery period of seven years for assets. Motorsports racing facilities historically have a 39-year depreciation life. The American Jobs Creation Act mandated a seven-year recovery period for motorsports racing facilities, which was extended through 2017. Without this provision, these facilities would be depreciated over 39 years. The American Jobs Creation Act mandated a seven-year recovery period for motorsports racing facilities, extended through 2017. This provision is seen as a subsidy to the auto racing industry, with supporters arguing it preserves historical treatment and provides a stimulus to business. Taxpayers using racehorses in a trade or business must capitalize the cost of purchasing them, with a recovery period of seven years. A temporary provision extended the three-year recovery period for racehorses placed in service after December 31, 2008. The recovery period for racehorses placed in service after December 31, 2008, was initially three years, extended through 2017 by the BBA18. This change aligns the recovery period with a horse's racing life, but the IRS suggests a longer view due to breeding and resale activities. The provision mainly benefits investors purchasing horses. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 included a provision for accelerated depreciation on Indian reservations to boost investment. This provision has been regularly extended, most recently in the BBA18, to encourage more investment. However, it is unclear if this tax subsidy will effectively improve the economic status of individuals on Indian Reservations, as the subsidies benefit businesses, not workers directly. Capital subsidies received by businesses may not benefit workers, as they could lead to more capital-intensive businesses. Workers may not see higher wages from an employer subsidy if regulated minimum wages are already higher. Taxpayers can expense 50% of advanced mine safety equipment costs, including communication and oxygen devices for miners. The Section 179 tax deduction allows businesses to expense 50% of advanced mine safety equipment costs, such as oxygen devices for miners. The deduction limit in 2017 is up to $510,000, and it is allowed instead of depreciation. Mine safety equipment must be used in a U.S. mine to qualify for the deduction. Taxpayers can expense 50% of advanced mine safety equipment costs exceeding $2,030,000 in 2017. The provision was enacted in 2006 and has been extended multiple times. Federal regulations primarily govern coal mine safety, with tax incentives playing a small role. The deduction was enacted following the Sago Mine accident. The high-profile mining accidents at Sago Mine and Upper Big Branch Mine in 2006 and 2010 respectively resulted in an uptick in coal mining fatalities. However, from 2007 to 2016, coal mining fatalities averaged 21 per year, with a decline in recent years attributed to a decrease in coal production and miners. Tax incentives for expensing advanced mine safety equipment have also contributed to improved safety measures. Since 1993, Congress has authorized three rounds of Empowerment Zones (EZs) to revitalize economically distressed communities. Studies question the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EZs, Enterprise Communities (ECs), and Renewal Communities (RCs) in improving community outcomes. The EZ, EC, and RC programs have not been shown to have caused a general improvement in economic conditions at the community level. Possible reasons for this include the small size of EZ tax incentives and their focus on business owners rather than providing direct benefits to workers in EZs. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended Enterprise Zone (EZ) designations to December 31, 2011. Subsequent legislation extended EZ tax incentives through 2016 with a 10-year revenue cost of $502 million. The American Samoa economy relies on public works, tuna canning, and the private sector. The American Samoa economic development credit offers tax incentives for businesses operating in the region. The Economic Development Credit (EDC) in American Samoa provides tax incentives for U.S. corporations engaged in trade or business activities in the territory. The credit aims to encourage companies to establish, maintain, or expand manufacturing operations in American Samoa, with StarKist being a notable beneficiary. The EDC was initially enacted in 2006 and has since been extended to support eligible businesses. The Economic Development Credit (EDC) in American Samoa was initially enacted in 2006 and has been extended multiple times, most recently through 2017. The EDC provides tax incentives for U.S. corporations in American Samoa, encouraging manufacturing operations with a 50% business tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures. Qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year by eligible taxpayers qualify for a 50% business tax credit. The credit is limited to $3,500 times the number of miles of railroad track owned or leased by an eligible taxpayer, specifically smaller (Class II or Class III) railroads and individuals using these rail facilities. The credit cannot be carried back to years before 2005 and is allowed against the alternative minimum tax. The tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures was enacted in 2004 and expanded in 2006 and 2008. It covers half the costs for eligible smaller railroads and individuals, reducing track maintenance expenses. This provision benefits Class II and III railroads, which play a significant role in transporting agricultural products. The tax credit for qualified railroad track maintenance expenditures was introduced to encourage the rehabilitation of short-line railroads spun off in the deregulation of railroads in the early 1980s. Industry advocates argue that preserving these local lines will reduce local truck traffic and that the tax credit is more achievable than grants. The Federal Railroad Administration also emphasizes the need for rehabilitation and improvement to accommodate heavier cars. The Federal Railroad Administration suggests that firms in the railroad industry have limited access to bank loans. Special subsidies for industries can lead to inefficient investment allocation, but it may be necessary to subsidize rail transportation to reduce congestion and pollution. A tax credit may not be as effective as a direct grant for firms with insufficient tax liability. The Section 199 deduction reduces tax rates for domestic manufacturing activities by 9% of taxable income. The Section 199 deduction reduces the effective tax rate on income from qualified activities by 3.15 percentage points, from 35% to 31.85%. It was repealed by the 2017 tax legislation (P.L. 115-97) and future extensions are unlikely. The deduction was enacted in 2004 and included the 50 states and the District of Columbia for determining eligible domestic activities. Special rules in 2006 allowed Puerto Rico to be considered part of the United States for this deduction. The U.S. tax code treats U.S. possessions as foreign countries, but Puerto Rico has its own tax system. Special rules connect the Puerto Rican and U.S. tax systems. Before 1996, domestic corporations could eliminate U.S. tax liability on foreign-source income from U.S. possessions. From 1996 to 2005, the Puerto Rico economic activity credit was available. Companies with operations in Puerto Rico may now find it advantageous to restructure. Companies with operations in Puerto Rico may benefit from structuring as a controlled foreign corporation to defer U.S. tax on active income. Allowing the Section 199 deduction for activities in Puerto Rico extends a tax benefit designed for domestic corporations to a possession generally treated as a foreign country for tax purposes. This provision aims to provide similar tax treatment to income from manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico and the rest of the United States, preventing U.S.-based manufacturers with operations in Puerto Rico from facing a higher effective tax rate on manufacturing activities. Extending Section 199 to Puerto Rico raises concerns about creating incentives for U.S. companies to adopt a bifurcated structure, potentially providing greater benefits to manufacturers in Puerto Rico. This could be intended to encourage additional manufacturing activity in Puerto Rico. The Indian employment tax credit is a 20% credit claimed by employers for qualified wages and health insurance costs of enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses. The credit is limited to services within an Indian reservation and is incremental to 1993 wages. The Indian employment credit, enacted in 1993, offers a 20% credit for wages and health insurance costs of enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses within an Indian reservation. The credit is incremental to 1993 wages and has been regularly extended without updating the base year. Some propose updating the base year to simplify record-keeping and restore the credit's incremental design. The Indian employment credit, enacted in 1993, offers a 20% credit for wages and health insurance costs of enrolled members of an Indian tribe and their spouses within an Indian reservation. Extending the credit may encourage additional hiring of tribe members. Taxpayers can claim a tax credit for mine rescue team training expenses, limited to 20% of training program costs per employee or $10,000. The credit was enacted in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. The Mine Rescue Team Training Credit was enacted in 2006 following a mining accident at Sago Mine. Coal mining fatalities averaged 21 per year from 2007 to 2016, with the highest in 2010 due to the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster. In 2016, there were 8 fatalities, showing a downward trend over time possibly due to a decline in coal production and miners. The fatality rate in coal mining has declined over time, possibly due to a decrease in coal production and miners. A credit for mine rescue team training can incentivize investment in training and reduce compliance costs with federal regulations. Tax incentives play a small role in coal mine safety compared to federal regulations. Qualified timber gains of C corporations in 2016 are subject to an alternative maximum tax rate of 23.8% for gains from selling timber held for over 15 years. The special rate for timber held over 15 years applies to C corporations, with a maximum capital gains tax rate of 35%. For individuals, the maximum rate on net capital gains is 20%, with an additional 3.8% tax on certain gains. This provision was enacted as part of the PATH Act of 2015. Congress extended the special rate to C corporations in 2016, aligning the tax treatment of timber gains for different organizational forms. The 15% alternative tax rate for C corporation's qualified timber gains, enacted in 2008 but not extended, aimed to align tax treatment of timber gains between different organizational forms. Proponents argue for capital gains treatment, while opponents believe it allows lightly taxed income. The 2017 tax legislation reduced the corporate rate to 21%, making the provision obsolete."
