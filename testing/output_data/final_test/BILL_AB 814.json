    "content": "The people of California enact the following: The Legislature in California acknowledges the challenges and inefficiencies of having three separate state agencies administering and enforcing major taxes. Despite past efforts to improve coordination and cooperation among these agencies, the complex system remains burdensome for taxpayers. The California Tax Service Center aims to simplify tax administration for taxpayers by consolidating three agencies' operations into a unified online platform at www.taxes.ca.gov. This one-stop hub provides resources and educational programs to enhance the taxpayer experience. California aims to develop an Internet-based system that consolidates the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department. The system will provide taxpayers with a single logon for all three agencies, enabling online self-service access and real-time information to help them meet their tax obligations efficiently. The California government plans to create a single Internet portal that combines the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department. This portal will allow taxpayers to file returns, access account information, and manage tax-related tasks online through a single logon. The feasibility study for the single Internet portal combining the State Board of Equalization, the Franchise Tax Board, and the Employment Development Department will be conducted within existing budgets and submitted to the Legislature within six months. Agencies may consolidate forms and documents to improve services if deemed necessary and funded by the Legislature. Section 34 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow the state or its agencies to pay locally administered taxes directly to the city, county, or district entitled to the payment, with notification to the payor. This can only be done if the local government agrees by resolution to treat timely payments to the state as timely payments to the local government."
