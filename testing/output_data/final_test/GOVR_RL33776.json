    "content": "The 110th Congress focused on climate change, with hearings held by multiple committees and 17 bills introduced to cap greenhouse gas emissions. Despite a shift in control from Republicans to Democrats, no legislation was enacted. One bill, S. 2191, was reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee, but Senate debate on a modified version (S. 3036) failed to invoke cloture. The House established a Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, but no bills advanced to markup. In the 110th Congress, climate change legislation was a top priority, with hearings and markup sessions focusing on the issue. While other clean air issues were addressed through oversight of Administration actions, climate change remained a key concern for committees with jurisdiction over air issues. This report provides an overview of climate change and other Clean Air Act issues in the 110th Congress. Climate change has been a topic of interest to Congress for over 30 years, with hearings dating back to 1975. The U.S. ratified the UNFCCC in 1992, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Despite rejecting the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the U.S. focused on research and voluntary emission reduction programs. However, emissions continued to rise, with a 16% increase from 1990 to 2005. Congress has recently shown renewed interest in climate issues. Renewed interest in climate issues has been sparked by the strengthening science linking greenhouse gas emissions to climate changes, such as shrinking glaciers and rising global temperatures. States have formed regional agreements to address the issue, and some industries are changing their attitudes in response to state and foreign requirements. New business coalitions are advocating for action on climate change. In response to growing scientific consensus on the link between human activity and greenhouse gas emissions, Congress has started to address the issue. Business coalitions are pushing for legislative action, with the Senate passing a resolution calling for a market-based program to limit emissions. The McCain-Lieberman bill was a detailed proposal in the 109th Congress to establish mandatory greenhouse gas limits. The bill (S. 1151 in the 109th Congress, S. 139 in the 108th) aimed to establish a mandatory, market-based greenhouse gas reduction program. It was debated in the 109th Congress as an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and defeated. In the 110th Congress, the Senate committees approved a modified version of the bill, but a motion to invoke cloture failed. In the House, there was a call for quick action, but no markup of legislation occurred. The Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings and posted white papers on a possible cap-and-trade program before producing a discussion draft of climate change legislation on October 7, 2008. The committee focused on passing landmark energy legislation in the first session, with further attention to climate change bills in the second session. Questions remain regarding the relationship of climate change legislation to traditional air pollution programs of the EPA, particularly on whether greenhouse gases should be considered air pollutants. The debate over whether greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, should be regulated as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act is crucial for determining jurisdiction over climate change programs. This decision could impact which agency administers the program and the extent of state authority in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. EPA has taken conflicting stances on this issue over the years. The EPA debated whether greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, should be regulated as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The agency argued it had the authority to regulate CO2, while the Bush Administration disagreed, stating that Congress had decided not to regulate the pollutant. This debate could impact jurisdiction over climate change programs and the extent of state authority in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA confirmed that the Clean Air Act grants the EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons emitted from new motor vehicles. The Court found that these gases are considered air pollutants under the Act, giving the EPA the power to regulate them. In response to the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to cap greenhouse gas emissions by amending the Clean Air Act. These bills proposed creating a new Title VII to establish a separate program for greenhouse gas emissions, similar to previous amendments for acid precipitation and stratospheric ozone depletion. Most of the bills focused on establishing economy-wide programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while other bills targeted emissions from specific sectors. Electric utilities, cars and trucks, appliances, and buildings are key sectors targeted for emissions reduction. These sectors account for the majority of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Legislation focusing on individual sectors may not amend the Clean Air Act, leading to regulatory programs administered by agencies other than the EPA. Reducing energy consumption through efficiency standards and better insulation is crucial for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, were strengthened in P.L. 110-140 to achieve a 40% improvement in fuel economy by 2020. Appliance efficiency standards, administered by the Department of Energy, were also enhanced in the same legislation. Other elements of a GHG reduction program, such as building codes, are managed by state and local governments with input from DOE. The regulation of power plants is complex, with different agencies involved depending on the power source. State and local governments play a significant role in regulating building codes. Many suggest an economy-wide approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with an annual emissions cap and distribution of emission allowances to major emitters. Cap-and-trade programs involve setting a cap on emissions and allowing companies to buy or sell allowances. Companies with low-cost emission reduction options take action, while others can buy allowances. The success of such programs, like the Clean Air Act's acid rain program, shows they can achieve emission reduction goals at low cost with high compliance. The success of cap-and-trade programs like the Clean Air Act's acid rain program is attributed to favorable circumstances such as an abundant supply of cheap low-sulfur coal, a small number of entities covered by the program, and a long compliance period. However, not all trading programs have been as successful, as seen in the case of Southern California's RECLAIM program during the 2000-2001 energy crisis. During the 2000-2001 California energy crisis, electric utilities were removed from the RECLAIM system, charged a flat fee for excess emissions, and faced new command and control requirements. The EU-ETS also experienced price fluctuations in its early years, causing challenges for participants. Implementing a U.S. cap-and-trade system for GHG emissions would require establishing monitoring requirements for sources that have not been required to report their emissions. A monitoring requirement needs to be established for future reduction schemes, such as cap-and-trade. The EPA is directed to develop regulations for a mandatory GHG reporting program, but a registry does not yet exist. Decisions need to be made on the program's comprehensiveness, including which economic sectors to include and small emitter exemptions. Issues related to the distribution or sale of allowances also need to be addressed. Various considerations need to be made for cap-and-trade schemes, such as measuring emission reductions, allocating allowances, and establishing flexibility mechanisms like a safety valve or floor price. International trading of allowances is also a key issue to address. Issues arise regarding international trading of allowances, especially in developing countries where verifying baseline emissions and ongoing emission controls can be challenging. Similar concerns exist for domestic or international offsets through sequestration activities. Some suggest a carbon or GHG tax as a simpler approach to emission control due to economic efficiency and administrative ease, but political challenges limit its support. Some states have started programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite federal challenges. These programs cover various sources like power plants and buildings. The issue of federal preemption has already come up, especially with California's regulations on vehicle emissions. The Clean Air Act allows California to set its own vehicle emission standards, which require gradual reductions of GHG emissions. Compliance is based on fleet averages, with flexibility for averaging, banking, and trading credits. California's regulations have not yet gone into effect pending a waiver from the U.S. EPA due to federal preemption challenges. To obtain an exception, California must be granted a waiver by the EPA Administrator. Other states can adopt California's standards if granted a waiver, with 14 states already doing so. These states represent a significant portion of the U.S. auto market. California must meet four conditions outlined in the Clean Air Act to obtain a waiver, ensuring their standards are as protective as federal standards and necessary for compelling conditions. EPA's decision on this matter is crucial. California's argument for a waiver under the Clean Air Act seems sound, as the state's standards for greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources appear to meet federal requirements. The state has identified compelling conditions for the standards and provided information on available technologies. Legislative history supports California's case, with the House committee emphasizing the importance of not overturning the state's judgment lightly. The EPA Administrator denied California's waiver request under the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gases from motor vehicles, citing the national approach established by the Energy Independence and Security Act. The decision was made against the advice of the agency's staff and emphasized the global nature of the greenhouse gas emissions issue. The EPA Administrator denied California's waiver request to control greenhouse gases from motor vehicles, citing the national approach established by the Energy Independence and Security Act. The decision was based on the finding that Section 209(b) was intended for local or regional issues, not global climate change. California and 15 other states filed suit challenging the decision, opposed by the auto industry and the Bush Administration. The auto industry argues that California's GHG regulations will have no benefits and may actually increase emissions. Industry opponents may challenge EPA's authority in court if California is granted a waiver. The authority to set fuel economy standards is reserved for the federal government under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975. The auto industry argues that California's GHG regulations may increase emissions and challenge EPA's authority in court. Federal courts have ruled that California and other states are not preempted by EPCA from setting mobile source GHG standards. Legislation introduced in both the Senate and the House aimed to overturn the Administrator's denial of California's waiver application. The bills would approve California's waiver request despite any other laws. The Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA required EPA to decide on regulating mobile source GHGs under the Clean Air Act. EPA had three options following the Court's decision. The EPA has the authority to regulate emissions that may impact public health or welfare, including greenhouse gases. While the agency has not definitively stated that climate change endangers public health, it has acknowledged that greenhouse gases affect welfare by trapping heat in the atmosphere. This was highlighted in the Administrator's decision document on the California waiver request. The EPA is likely to issue an affirmative endangerment finding for welfare due to the impacts of climate change on various factors. The President directed the EPA to take steps towards regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles after a Supreme Court ruling. The EPA Administrator intended to propose regulating GHGs from automobiles by the end of 2007, with plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and a final rule by October 2008. An endangerment finding and proposed GHG emission standard were prepared but not issued, prompting a new request for public information. The EPA planned to regulate GHGs from automobiles by the end of 2007 but work was discontinued to reassess activities after the Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted. Despite new CAFE standards, EPA still needs to determine if GHG emissions from vehicles contribute to air pollution endangering public health. The Energy Independence and Security Act led to a pause in EPA's plans to regulate GHGs from vehicles. Section 3 of EISA emphasizes existing environmental law. EPA has discretion in setting GHG emission standards under CAA section 202. Commentators suggest voluntary or CAFE-based standards post an endangerment finding. Congressional committees play a role in further review. Congressional committees, including the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, are interested in clean air issues. Senator Feinstein's bill S. 2806 required the Administrator to issue a finding within 60 days, but no action was taken. Despite improvements in air quality, challenges with ozone and fine particles persist. 132 million people lived in areas with air quality concerns as of June 2008. Air quality issues persist with ozone and fine particles. Despite improvements since the Clean Air Act in 1970, EPA has tightened standards due to health concerns. PM 2.5 is a major concern, causing premature deaths and lost work days. The EPA has tightened air quality standards for PM 2.5 and ozone pollution due to health concerns, leading to a focus on major pollution sources like coal-fired power plants and mobile sources. The 110th Congress is discussing revisions to ozone, particulate, and lead standards, as well as multi-pollutant legislation and the Clean Air Interstate Rule for power plants. The EPA tightened air quality standards for PM 2.5 and ozone pollution, focusing on coal-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson signed changes to the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone in 2008, affecting 45% of the U.S. population living in nonattainment areas. The EPA revised air quality standards for ozone in 2008, impacting 132 million people in nonattainment areas. The new standards lower the acceptable level of ozone exposure, leading to more counties violating the regulations. This change follows a thorough review of ozone's health and welfare effects, with evidence of adverse impacts at lower levels than previously thought. The EPA revised air quality standards for ozone in 2008, impacting 132 million people in nonattainment areas by lowering the acceptable level of ozone exposure. EPA staff and CASAC recommended strengthening the standards due to concerns about mortality at lower exposure levels. The new standards will have far-reaching impacts on public health, pollution sources, and government entities. Designation of nonattainment areas will begin in 2010, with areas already expressing concerns about meeting the new standards. The EPA revised air quality standards for ozone in 2008, impacting 132 million people in nonattainment areas by lowering the acceptable level of ozone exposure. The Administrator's choices for the standards were influenced by the White House, leading to weaker standards than proposed by CASAC. There are concerns about whether the standards will result in stronger federal controls on ozone pollution sources. Current federal standards may not be sufficient to bring all areas into compliance, necessitating local pollution control measures. Additionally, there are questions about the adequacy of the monitoring network to detect violations of the new standards. The Clean Air and Nuclear Safety subcommittee of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held hearings on proposed changes to ozone standards in 2007 and discussed the final version in 2008. The EPA revised air quality standards for ozone in 2008, impacting 132 million people in nonattainment areas. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson signed revisions for particulate matter standards in 2006. The EPA revised air quality standards for particulate matter on September 21, 2006, with the new standard cutting the allowable concentration of PM 2.5 in the air averaged over 24-hour periods from 65 \u00b5g/m3 to 35 \u00b5g/m3. The revisions were based on 2,000 scientific studies linking particulates to health problems such as aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function, irregular heart beat, heart attacks, and premature death. The standards were not strengthened to the degree recommended by the agency's staff or scientific advisors. The CASAC endorsed more stringent air quality standards for particulate matter, recommending a 24-hour standard of 30 to 35 \u00b5g/m3 and an annual standard of 13 to 14 \u00b5g/m3. The Administrator disagreed with lowering the annual standard due to insufficient scientific evidence, despite acknowledging the health risks associated with higher PM 2.5 levels. EPA is conducting research to clarify the link between PM-related pollution and adverse health effects. The EPA is conducting research to inform the next periodic reevaluation of the PM 2.5 standard. The PM NAAQS also addresses thoracic coarse particles in the range of 10 to 2.5 micrometers, known as PM 10-2.5. The EPA's previous regulation of particles 10 microns or smaller (PM 10) was challenged in court and remanded due to its overlap with the PM 2.5 category. In January 2006, the EPA proposed a 24-hour standard for PM 10-2.5 at a level of 70 \u00b5g/m3, but the final standards in October 2006 kept the PM 10 standard at 150 \u00b5g/m3. The agency revoked the annual component of the PM 10 standard, arguing for its use as a coarse particle indicator. This decision deviated from CASAC's recommendations for the first time in nearly 30 years. The CASAC objected to the EPA's actions regarding PM 2.5 standards in a letter dated September 29, 2006. They expressed concern that the annual PM 2.5 standard was not protective of human health and recommended a change. The majority of the Particulate Matter Review Panel members agreed on the need for a reduction below 15 \u00b5g/m3. The CASAC expressed concern that the annual PM 2.5 standard does not provide an adequate margin of safety to protect public health. They were surprised by the decision to revert to using PM 10 as the indicator for coarse particles, which was not discussed during the advisory process. The Administrator is not required to follow CASAC's recommendations but must explain any important differences in his proposal. The CASAC raised concerns about the PM 2.5 standard not providing enough safety margin for public health. The Administrator is not obligated to follow CASAC's recommendations but must explain any significant differences in his proposal. EPA regulations are generally reviewed by courts focusing on procedural, jurisdictional, and standing issues, with deference given to the Administrator's scientific judgment. The NAAQS represents the EPA Administrator's formal judgment on ambient pollution levels to protect public health. States and EPA identify nonattainment areas after NAAQS promulgation, with states given three years to comply. The EPA revised the PM 2.5 standard, with states required to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) within three years to achieve attainment by 2015 (possible extension to 2020). The EPA announced modifications to the process for setting and reviewing NAAQS standards in December 2006, following the completion of the PM NAAQS review. The EPA's process for setting and reviewing NAAQS standards involves the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee making recommendations to the Administrator. EPA staff prepare reviews and policy recommendations, with CASAC approving them before final decisions. Under new procedures, political appointees will have a role early in the process, and CASAC will no longer approve documents. The EPA is changing its process for reviewing NAAQS standards to speed up the process, aiming to meet the five-year cycle required by the Clean Air Act. CASAC will no longer approve policy staff papers, with political appointees playing a larger role. This has raised concerns among environmental groups and the scientific community. The EPA is implementing new procedures for reviewing NAAQS standards, with CASAC's role changing. CASAC initially showed less concern about the changes. Suggestions made by CASAC, such as holding a science workshop at the beginning of the process, were included in the decision memorandum. The old process was criticized for spending too much time on irrelevant literature reviews. CASAC's Chair mentioned that comments from CASAC and the public would be considered simultaneously by the EPA. CASAC initially showed less concern about the new NAAQS review process, but later changed its mind after experiencing it during a meeting to consider the NAAQS for lead. CASAC's Chair, Dr. Rogene Henderson, expressed concerns about the lack of time for appropriate input to evaluate the science under the new process. CASAC Chair Dr. Rogene Henderson expressed concerns that the new process did not allow enough time for appropriate input to evaluate the science. EPA modified its schedule to address some of CASAC's concerns, but serious concerns remained. Senator Boxer called the changes \"unacceptable\" and planned to prioritize oversight in Congress. On February 6, 2007, a hearing was held on \"Oversight of Recent EPA Decisions.\" Seven Democratic committee members, including Senator Boxer, opposed changes to the role of CASAC in NAAQS reviews. EPA Administrator Johnson approved a stricter lead NAAQS on October 16, 2008, reducing the standard from 1.5 \u00b5g/m3 to 0.15 \u00b5g/m3. The revised standard, resulting from a lawsuit in 2004, is expected to be published in the Federal Register soon. The Clean Air Act mandates NAAQS reviews every five years. The Clean Air Act successfully reduced lead emissions by phasing out lead from gasoline, paint, and consumer products, leading to a 99% decrease in emissions from 224,100 tons in 1970 to 1,300 tons in 2007. Only two nonattainment areas for lead exist under the 1978 standard. In 2007, only two nonattainment areas for lead exist under the 1978 standard: East Helena, MT, and Herculaneum, MO, with a combined population of 4,664 people. Lead emissions were reduced significantly due to concerns about air pollution and children's health. Despite the reduction, airborne lead continues to have negative effects. EPA identified over 6,000 studies on lead health and environmental effects in the current NAAQS review. The EPA staff and CASAC recommended strengthening the NAAQS for lead in ambient air due to evidence of health effects on children and adults. They suggested reducing the standard from 1.5 \u00b5g/m3 to no higher than 0.2 \u00b5g/m3. The Administrator agreed with the recommendations, emphasizing the continued threat of lead in ambient air to public health. The EPA recommended strengthening the NAAQS for lead in ambient air, concluding that the current standard is inadequate to protect public health. Nonattainment areas will need to be identified, leading to a 5- to 10-year implementation process to reduce lead in the air. The monitoring network is insufficient, with only 70 out of 3,000 counties having lead monitors. The EPA proposed new lead monitoring requirements to address the lack of monitors in many states. The final rule set a threshold of one ton of emissions and required monitors in urban areas with populations of 500,000 or more. Industry groups, like the Battery Council International, influenced the final decision to focus more on exposure-oriented monitoring. The White House Office of Management and Budget supported a change in emphasis towards exposure-oriented monitoring for air quality standards. States can choose to install more monitors than required by the EPA, but funding may be a challenge due to revenue shortages. Congress and policymakers have been focused on regulating electric power plants in recent years. The Bush Administration's approach to regulating power plants focused on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated CAIR in 2008, impacting the Administration's efforts to control power plant pollution. Coal-fired power plants are major sources of air pollution in the U.S., but are not always subject to strict requirements under the Clean Air Act. Emissions and control equipment can vary based on plant location, construction date, modifications, fuel type, and other factors. Power plants, especially older ones built before the Clean Air Act of 1970, have limited emission control equipment, making them significant sources of pollution. Compliance with emissions regulations is complex due to various Clean Air Act programs, leading utilities to resist stringent controls. The cost of implementing controls could reach billions of dollars, hindering emission reductions compared to other sources. Power plants are significant sources of pollution, accounting for a large portion of sulfur dioxide, mercury, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. They also contribute to the formation of fine particles and are not subject to federal regulation for carbon dioxide emissions. Compliance with emissions regulations is challenging, and reducing NOx and SO2 emissions is necessary to meet new ambient air quality standards. Mercury emissions and fine particles from power plants are a major concern, leading to fish consumption advisories in 48 states. The controversy over New Source Review requirements is pushing for more predictable regulations. Calls for comprehensive legislation to address power plant pollution have been ongoing, with the proposed Clear Skies Act aiming to coordinate the reduction of major pollutants on a set schedule. The focus of power plant regulation has shifted towards broader climate change bills in the 110th Congress. Several bills have been introduced but no action has been scheduled, and little time remains for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA announced on March 10, 2005, that it would rely on a system of tradeable allowances for emissions control. On March 10, 2005, EPA announced the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to regulate utility emissions of SO2 and NOx in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. CAIR established cap-and-trade provisions similar to the Clear Skies bill but only covered the eastern half of the country. EPA projected a 53% decrease in SO2 emissions and a 48% decrease in NOx emissions by 2015 under CAIR, with health benefits of $85-$100 billion annually, including the prevention of 17,000 premature deaths. The Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) aimed to regulate utility emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia, with projected health benefits of $85-$100 billion annually, including the prevention of 17,000 premature deaths. Despite broad support, the rule was challenged in court and vacated on July 11, 2008, as the court found that EPA lacked authority to implement a regional cap-and-trade rule without a clear link between emissions and nonattainment of standards in downwind states. The court found EPA's methodology for establishing emission budgets in the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to be unrelated to the significant contribution made by power plants to pollution levels in other states as required by Section 110. The court also deemed the fuel adjustment factors in the rule arbitrary and capricious, stating that \"CAIR's flaws are deep.\" Despite requests for review, the court asked for briefs on whether the decision to vacate the rule should stand and if a mandate implementing the decision should be stayed until EPA issues a revised rule. The court's decision to vacate the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) undermines the Bush Administration's clean air strategy, impacting ozone and fine particulate National Ambient Air Quality Standards, mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, regional haze impacts, and state petitions to control pollution. EPA must issue a revised rule before implementing the court's decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) and a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions from electric utilities, remanding them to EPA for reconsideration. EPA had previously determined regulation of mercury from power plants under the Clean Air Act was necessary. In 2000, a regulatory finding added coal- and oil-fired electric generating units to the list of sources of hazardous air pollutants. EPA initially planned to propose MACT standards by December 15, 2003, but instead established a national cap-and-trade system for power plant emissions of mercury in March 2005. The final cap aimed for a 70% reduction in emissions by 2018, with an intermediate cap of 38 tons in 2010. The EPA planned to reduce emissions by 70% by 2018 through a cap-and-trade system for power plant emissions of mercury. Utilities could either control pollutants directly or buy excess allowances. Early reductions could be banked for later use, leading to a delay in full compliance until after 2025. Actual emissions were projected to be 24.3 tons by 2020, less than a 50% reduction. The D.C. Circuit ruled in February 2008 that the EPA had to proceed with MACT regulations for electric generating units (EGUs) as a source of hazardous air pollutants unless they were delisted, a difficult test given that EGUs are responsible for over 40% of mercury emissions in the U.S. The EPA's decision to maintain the EGU source category for mercury emissions was deemed unlawful by the court due to not meeting statutory criteria. Critics also raised concerns about the cap-and-trade approach not addressing \"hot spots\" with higher mercury concentrations. The cap-and-trade system may not reduce mercury concentrations in hot spots, unlike a MACT standard which would require reductions at all plants. Arguments for more stringent mercury regulations are based on assumptions about control technologies. Simultaneously controlling SO2, NOx, and mercury would maximize emission control co-benefits. Scrubbers and fabric filters used for SO2 and particulates also reduce mercury emissions. The EPA's cap-and-trade regulations aimed to maximize co-benefits by controlling SO2 and particulates, which also reduced mercury emissions. Specific controls for mercury were not required before the 2020s due to the cost advantage of relying on co-benefits. The availability of technology like activated carbon injection for mercury control was disputed, despite its successful use in other industries. Manufacturers have successfully demonstrated waste incinerators for over a decade, showing up to 90% reductions in mercury emissions at coal-fired power plants. Some states have set stricter limits than federal regulations, requiring significant reductions before 2010. The EPA may lack the authority to establish a cap-and-trade program for power plant mercury emissions unless the category is delisted. The EPA is required to impose MACT standards on individual plants once a category is listed. The agency appealed a court ruling but was denied. Senator Carper introduced a bill for MACT standards by October 1, 2008, with a 90% reduction in mercury emissions for power plants. The EPA is required to impose MACT standards on individual plants once a category is listed. Senator Carper introduced a bill for MACT standards by October 1, 2008, with a 90% reduction in mercury emissions for power plants. Bills with deadlines and 90% reductions were rejected by the D.C. Circuit. New coal-fired electric generating units must obtain permits under the \"MACT hammer\" provision. The NRDC released a list of 32 coal-fired power plants. The NRDC released a list of 32 coal-fired power plants in 13 states that must adopt MACT mercury controls. The debate over power plant emissions regulation includes the issue of EPA enforcement of existing regulations like New Source Review, which has been contentious in the courts. The Bush Administration has proposed changes to NSR regulations that critics argue will weaken or eliminate its effectiveness. The controversy surrounding New Source Review (NSR) involves the EPA's requirement for best available pollution controls on existing stationary sources of air pollution undergoing modifications. Industry often avoids NSR by claiming changes are routine maintenance. EPA began reviewing records in the 1990s to determine if changes were truly routine, leading to lawsuits against polluters for major modifications without undergoing NSR. The EPA has charged utilities with NSR violations for not installing pollution controls, resulting in settlements totaling $10 billion for emissions reduction. Petroleum refiners have also settled with fines and equipment installation to eliminate 315,000 tons of pollution. Some utilities claim the EPA has redefined NSR rules. The EPA has stricter NSR rules, causing disincentives for power producers and refiners to make changes without costly permit reviews and pollution control equipment. Ohio Edison violated the Clean Air Act and settled to spend $1.1 billion on controls. Duke Energy also faced NSR violations, appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 2004, Duke Energy was found not to have violated the Clean Air Act despite increasing total emissions without undergoing New Source Review. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned lower court rulings in 2007, stating that an increase in actual annual emissions determines the need for a modification permit. The Bush Administration made changes to NSR regulations in 2002 and 2003, including controversial rules on routine maintenance exemptions for industrial facilities. The changes aimed to make future NSR enforcement less likely by defining what constitutes routine maintenance. The Bush Administration made changes to NSR regulations in 2002 and 2003, including controversial rules on routine maintenance exemptions for industrial facilities. The changes aimed to make future NSR enforcement less likely by defining what constitutes routine maintenance. The replacement components were less than 20% of the replacement value of the process unit, triggering debates on whether it was streamlining or grandfathering older, more polluting facilities. Fifteen states, three municipalities, and environmental groups filed suit to block the rule, which was ultimately struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2006 for being contrary to the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed changes to NSR regulations in 2005 and 2006, focusing on hourly emissions rather than annual emissions to allow for increases in emissions with modifications to facilities. This change aimed to establish a uniform national emissions test but was criticized for being contrary to the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed changes to NSR regulations in 2005 and 2006, focusing on hourly emissions rather than annual emissions to allow for increases in emissions with modifications to facilities. However, internal EPA documents revealed strong opposition to the proposed rule by the Air Enforcement Division, citing concerns about its impact on NSR enforcement cases and enforceability. There was a conflict between the EPA's regulatory actions and enforcement stance, with key justifications for the change being overturned or vacated. The EPA's proposed changes to NSR regulations in 2005 and 2006 led to a double standard for utilities, with different rules applying to violations before and after the new rule. Despite earlier denials, the EPA dropped enforcement actions against 47 facilities and investigations at 70 power companies due to NSR rollbacks. The EPA's proposed changes to NSR regulations in 2005 and 2006 resulted in a double standard for utilities, causing some to withdraw from settlement negotiations over pending lawsuits. This delay in emission reductions could have been achieved. The National Academy of Sciences began a review of the NSR program in May 2004 at Congress's direction. An interim report in January 2005 stated that NSR provides more stringent emission limits for new and modified major sources compared to other existing programs. The final report, issued in July, provided further insights. The final report, issued July 21, 2006, found that over 60% of coal-fired electricity-generation capacity in the US lacks controls for SO2 and NOx emissions required under NSR. Older facilities are more likely to undergo maintenance, repair, and replacement of key components, potentially affecting emissions. The report concluded that the implementation of the proposed Equipment Replacement Provision could lead to emission increases in some locations and decreases in others due to a lack of data and limitations of current models. The National Academy of Public Administration released a report recommending modifications to the NSR program, suggesting an end to grandfathering major air emission sources and enforcing Best Available Control Technology. The report highlighted the limitations in quantifying the potential effects of NSR rule changes on emissions and other relevant activities."
