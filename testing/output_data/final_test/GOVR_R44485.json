    "content": "The Older Americans Act (OAA), enacted in 1965, provides social services and programs for individuals aged 60 years or older. These include congregate and home-delivered nutrition services, family caregiver support, community service employment, and programs to prevent abuse of older persons. The OAA is administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) in the Administration for Community Living (ACL) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Older Americans Act (OAA) has been reauthorized and amended multiple times since its inception in 1965. President Barack Obama signed the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016, authorizing appropriations for OAA programs through FY2019. Prior to this, the last reauthorization occurred in 2006. This report discusses bipartisan efforts to reauthorize the OAA and provides a summary of key issues and historical development. The Older Americans Act has been reauthorized multiple times since 1965, with the latest reauthorization in 2016. Reauthorization bills were introduced in the past two Congresses, but no action was taken in the 112th Congress. In the 113th Congress, bills were introduced in both the House and Senate, with legislative action in the Senate HELP Committee on a bipartisan bill. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA) was introduced in both the House and Senate. The Senate passed the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2015 (S. 192) on July 16, 2015, authorizing appropriations for OAA programs through FY2018 and making amendments to existing authorities. The bill was then referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce for further consideration. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce considered S. 192, which was passed with an amendment on March 21, 2016. The bill authorized appropriations for OAA programs through FY2019 and was signed into law by President Obama on April 19, 2016. Lawmakers debated the Title III funding formula, specifically the FY2006 \"hold harmless\" requirement, which ensures states receive at least their FY2006 amount. This requirement caused division among lawmakers from high-growth and low-growth states. P.L. 114-144 addresses inequitable distribution of funds in high-growth states by reducing the hold harmless provision over three years for four programs. The bipartisan Senate bill S. 192 introduced this change, which was signed into law in April 2016. The amendment to P.L. 114-144 changed the effective dates for the hold harmless reduction from FY2016 through FY2019 to FY2017 through FY2020. The House amendment to S. 192 specified certain amounts authorized for OAA programs for FY2017 through FY2019, reflecting House protocols for legislation. The reauthorization of the OAA has focused on balancing interests of policymakers and stakeholders, considering budget constraints. P.L. 114-144 provides flexibility for modernizing senior centers and promoting health services. The Older Americans Act Reauthorization of 2016 aligns programs for disease prevention and health promotion, establishes new performance measures, and allows for a combined state plan under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. It repeals certain unfunded sections under Title IV and clarifies policy for the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. Coordination among Aging and Disability Resource Centers is also addressed. The Older Americans Act (OAA) was first enacted in 1965 to address the lack of community social services for older individuals. It established grants for community planning, social services, research, and personnel training in aging. The Administration on Aging (AOA) was created to administer grant programs and serve as the federal focal point on older persons. Today, the OAA is the primary vehicle for organizing and delivering social and nutrition services to older Americans through State Units on Aging (SUAs) and Area Agencies. The Older Americans Act (OAA) was established in 1965 to provide social services for older individuals through a network of State Units on Aging (SUAs), Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and tribal organizations. It also supports a federal job program for low-income older workers and funds training and research in aging. Advocacy efforts led to the creation of the act, as older individuals were not receiving adequate support from existing programs. President Eisenhower created the Federal Council on Aging in 1956 to coordinate federal government activities related to aging. The 1961 White House Conference on Aging called for a federal coordinating agency and grants for elderly community services. Legislation in 1962 proposed establishing an independent U.S. Committee on Aging for social services and research grants. In 1963, legislation was introduced to create the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) to benefit older persons through grants for social services, research, and training. The Older Americans Act (OAA) was introduced in 1965 with bipartisan support, authorizing grants to states for community planning and services programs, as well as for research and training projects in the field of aging.

The law requires the Ombudsman to investigate and resolve complaints from residents with limited decision-making capacity. It also mandates private and unimpeded access to Ombudsman services for residents. The Ombudsman must provide technical support for resident and family councils and assist in their development. Additionally, designated local ombudsman entities must encourage and assist in council development. The Ombudsman should continue specified functions for residents transitioning from LTC facilities to home care. The law ensures private and unimpeded access for representatives of the Office to LTC facilities and residents, allowing access to all files, records, and information concerning a resident. Representatives must have appropriate access to review information when a resident is unable to communicate consent, expanding the requirement for access to necessary files, records, and information for investigating complaints. The law grants the Ombudsman and representatives of the Office private access to LTC facilities and residents' files, records, and information. This includes disclosing individually identifiable health information under certain circumstances. P.L. 114-144 amends disclosure requirements to include \"files, records, and other information\" and ensures access for investigating complaints. The law requires the Ombudsman to protect the identity of residents and disclose information as needed to serve those with limited decision-making capacity. It also addresses conflict of interest for individuals involved in designating the Ombudsman or local representatives. The law mandates that the Ombudsman and their immediate family must avoid conflicts of interest, including involvement in licensing or ownership of LTC facilities, receiving remuneration from LTC operators, or having management responsibility for adult protective services. The law mandates that the state agency overseeing long-term care facilities must comply with specific requirements to avoid conflicts of interest, including situations where the agency is involved in licensing, certifying, or surveying LTC services, providing APS, setting rates for LTC services, or making decisions regarding admission or discharge of individuals. The state agency must avoid conflicts of interest in operating the Office for LTC facilities, as mandated by law. If any conflict is identified, it must be disclosed and remedied according to specific requirements. The Assistant Secretary can require the removal of conflicts or approval of a remedial plan to ensure the Ombudsman's independence in fulfilling their functions. The law amends certain sections to include \"behavioral\" in provisions addressing mental health, now reading \"mental and behavioral\" health. It requires guidance for serving Holocaust survivors, considering varying needs based on geography. Providers like nutrition and transportation services must address the needs of Holocaust survivors under the act. The text discusses changes to definitions and authorizations of appropriations under the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-144) in comparison to prior law. It highlights the inclusion of \"behavioral\" in mental health provisions and the requirement for providers to address the needs of Holocaust survivors."
