    "content": "The Cobell v. Salazar case, filed in 1996, involved the Department of the Interior's management of Individual Indian Monies (IIMs) held for individual Indians. The conflict arose from the federal government's trust responsibility towards American Indians, with the U.S. Supreme Court likening the relationship to that of \"a ward to its guardian\" in 1831. The United States, as trustee, holds title to Indian tribal land and land allotted to individual Indians, with receipts from leases, timber sales, or mineral royalties disbursed to the appropriate Indian property owners. The Cobell v. Salazar case involved the federal government's fiduciary responsibilities towards managing Indian monies and assets held in trust for individual Indians. It was a claim for an accounting by the United States as trustee for the trust corpus held for the benefit of individual Indians, not a claim for just compensation. The litigation stemmed from the government's trust responsibility with respect to three groups of money accounts held in trust. The government's trust responsibility involves managing Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts, including Land-based Accounts, Special Deposit Accounts (SDAs), and Judgment and Per Capita Accounts. Congress has delegated these responsibilities to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of the Treasury, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) overseeing trust land management and income collection. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is responsible for managing Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts derived from income-producing activities on allotment land. Transactions involving IIM accounts require BIA approval, with the Office of Trust Fund Management (OTFM) ensuring accurate financial records. The Treasury Department maintains a single \"IIM account\" for all funds, while OTFM and BIA officers collect and deposit payments into local banks. The federal government, through various agencies like the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, is responsible for managing Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts for the benefit of Indian beneficiaries. However, there are challenges in accurately accounting for the number of IIM trust accounts and their balances, leading to fiduciary obligations not being fully met. The Treasury Department also faces issues with trust fund management procedures. The Treasury Department has faced issues with trust fund management procedures, including document destruction, delays in fund deposit and investment, and lost interest due to check issuance delays. Congressional oversight committees became concerned about mismanagement of Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts in the late 1980s, leading to the enactment of the Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act in 1994. The Reform Act identified Interior Secretary's trust fund responsibilities, including accounting for balances, controls over receipts and disbursements, reconciliations, and providing statements to account holders. The bill made the accounting duty retrospective to June 24, 1938, as determined by courts in the Cobell litigation. The Cobell litigation began in 1996 to compel performance of trust obligations related to IIM accounts. Plaintiffs alleged breach of fiduciary duties by mismanagement of accounts by the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury. The trial was bifurcated into two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on management reform. In 1999, Judge Royce C. Lamberth ruled that the Treasury and Interior Secretaries breached their fiduciary duties to IIM account holders. Transition to Phase 2 was challenging as defendants struggled to provide acceptable plans for reforming account management and historical accounting. DOI faced difficulties due to fractionation of interests in allotment lands, making accounting in the Cobell litigation complex. The Department of Interior (DOI) faces challenges in accounting for fractionated interests in allotment lands, with over 1.4 million fractional interests subdividing 58,000 tracts of land. DOI struggles to resolve problems with land-based accounts and determining the extent of historical accounting, with debates on accounting transactions dating back to 1887, 1938, and 1994. DOI argues for the use of statistical sampling to address these issues. The Department of Interior (DOI) faces challenges in accounting for fractionated interests in allotment lands, with debates on accounting transactions dating back to 1887, 1938, and 1994. DOI struggles with incomplete records, leading to a choice between fairness and feasibility. Judge Lamberth issued a controversial injunction in 2003, giving oversight authority to ensure DOI carries out accounting and reforms its management of Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. Judge Lamberth appointed a monitor to oversee DOI's compliance with the injunction order, which led Congress to pass a rider limiting funds for historical accounting activities to $58 million for FY2005 and FY2006 in response to potential costs of $6 billion. The D.C. Circuit overturned Judge Lamberth's injunction on DOI's historical accounting and systemic reform, citing Congress's directive and limitations on judicial review under the APA. The D.C. Circuit overturned Judge Lamberth's injunction on DOI's historical accounting and systemic reform, stating that it cannot be extended to claims of broad programmatic failure. The court found that Judge Lamberth's order went beyond his authority, suggesting excessive judicial intrusion into agency discretion. On February 23, 2005, Judge Lamberth issued another injunction regarding the historical accounting, adopting a modified version of DOI's plan but prohibiting the use of statistical sampling. On November 15, 2005, the D.C. Circuit vacated Judge Lamberth's injunction on DOI's historical accounting, directing the district court to evaluate DOI's plan for statistical sampling without ignoring congressional limitations on funding. Judge Lamberth was later removed from the case for abuse of discretion and bias. Judge James Robertson rejected DOI's historical accounting plan in 2008, citing its legal inadequacy in scope and funding. He ordered a hearing to determine a remedy and later awarded plaintiffs $455.6 million in restitution for uncredited receipts. The court examined models to determine restitution for uncredited receipts in the Cobell case. Information from DOI and Treasury aided in evaluating the parties' models. The court applied a modified burden of proof on the government's statistical model due to lack of data. Only 77% of collected monies for the IIM system had been posted. The plaintiffs claimed a $3.6 billion shortfall in funds for the IIM system over 122 years, with an additional proposed $43.4 billion as \"benefit to the government.\" The government explained the discrepancy between receipts and disbursements, stating that not all funds received into the Treasury's IIM account are intended for individual Indian trust fund accounts. The government explained a $4 billion shortfall in Indian trust fund accounts, stating that not all funds deposited in the IIM account are intended for individual beneficiaries. Judge Robertson found the plaintiffs' statistical model defective in demonstrating this point. Judge Robertson criticized the plaintiffs' defective model and lack of specific evidence to discredit the defendant's model. He accepted the government's model, using a \"maximally conservative\" estimate, determining $455.6 million missing in the IIM trust for restitution. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a decision regarding the Department of Interior's accounting obligation for the IIM trust, emphasizing deference to DOI's methodology but questioning the scope of the accounting obligation based on statutory law. The court of appeals concluded that the district court must adjust the scope of the accounting for the IIM trust to ensure an equitable accounting with limited government resources. The DOI must conduct the best accounting possible with the funds allocated by Congress. The court of appeals provided guidance to the district court on the scope of the accounting for the IIM trust, emphasizing equitable allocation of resources. They recommended low-cost statistical methods for estimating benefits across class sub-groups and clarified that accounts closed before the 1994 Reform Act were not subject to accounting. A settlement agreement was reached between the Secretaries of the Interior and Treasury and the plaintiffs' class on December 7, 2009. The settlement agreement with the plaintiffs' class required Congressional authorization, which was extended multiple times before being approved through the Claims Resolution Act of 2010. It addressed the claims of two classes: the \"Historical Accounting Class\" and the \"Trust Administration Class.\" The settlement agreement released the federal government from claims related to the mismanagement of IIM accounts for the Trust Administration Class, excluding certain specific claims. The settlement agreement released the federal government from various claims, including those related to special deposits, tribal accounts, judgment fund accounts, breaches of trust, damages to the environment, trespass, and boundary or appraisal errors. No further monetary obligations will be attached to the government after the agreed-upon funds are dispensed. The settlement agreement established two funds: the \"Accounting/Trust Administration Fund\" receiving $1.412 billion from the Judgment Fund, and the \"Trust Land Consolidation Fund\" receiving $2 billion. The Accounting/Trust Administration Fund will provide $1,000 to each member of the Historical Accounting Class, followed by pro rata payments to the Trust Administration Class. Any remaining funds will finance Indian education scholarships. The \"Trust Land Consolidation Fund\" will receive $2 billion over 10 years to acquire fractional interests in trust or restricted land. This fund is part of the Land Consolidation program, the main federal government initiative for consolidating fractionated trust and restricted lands. Monies from this fund will also support Indian Education Scholarships. The settlement agreement also addresses attorneys' fees and incentive awards, approved by the district court and appealed by some class members to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. In 2012, a few class members appealed the settlement to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which upheld its fairness. The settlement became final on November 24, 2012 after the Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari."
