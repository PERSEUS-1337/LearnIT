    "content": "The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board and NPS define deferred maintenance as repairs that were not performed when scheduled and put off for a future time. NPS refers to it as DM, which includes repair needs. This report uses DM to refer to NPS's maintenance backlog. DM does not include all maintenance, only the ones that were delayed. NPS emphasizes cyclic maintenance to control deferred maintenance costs, preventing its creation and ensuring repairs reach full life expectancy. Routine maintenance activities include landscaping, winterizing buildings, and litter removal. NPS estimated its FY2016 deferred maintenance at $11.332 billion, split between transportation-related and non-transportation-related categories. Transportation-related DM includes paved roadways, bridges, tunnels, and parking areas. The Roads and Structures category in NPS includes paved roadways, bridges, tunnels, and parking areas. NPS estimates its deferred maintenance for key facilities at $2.271 billion for FY2016, with a growth in maintenance backlog over the past decade. Ageing infrastructure is a key factor contributing to the increase in maintenance needs. The increasing age of agency infrastructure, constructed in the 1930s and 1950s-60s, has led to a growth in NPS maintenance needs. Unfunded costs for repair or replacement of deteriorating assets contribute to the backlog. Insufficient funding exacerbates the issue, accelerating asset deterioration. Funding details are discussed in the section on \"Funding Questions.\" The National Park Service (NPS) receives inadequate funding to address deferred maintenance, despite some increases in appropriations from Congress. Stakeholders have differing opinions on how to address maintenance needs, with some advocating for increased funding and others suggesting reorienting existing funds. The Administration's budget request for FY2018 includes reducing some NPS funding for maintenance while increasing other maintenance-oriented funding. There is also debate on how acquiring new properties may add to the maintenance burden. Stakeholders debate the impact of new assets acquired by NPS on deferred maintenance growth. While the agency claims that most acquisitions have been in good condition, some argue that further expansion of the National Park System will eventually contribute to the maintenance backlog. The Administration's FY2018 budget proposes to eliminate funding for NPS federal land acquisition projects to focus on managing existing lands. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies in NPS asset management strategies contributing to the maintenance backlog. The Government Accountability Office has recommended further improvements in NPS's asset management systems. The NPS DM for FY2016 decreased by almost $600 million due to factors such as data cleanup, completion of large projects, revisions to work orders, and savings from construction cost decreases. Methods used to estimate DM by NPS and DOI have varied over time and for different maintenance reports. The NPS DM estimates for FY2006-FY2013 were based on ranges provided to DOI for financial reports, while estimates starting in FY2014 were published separately on NPS's website. Changes in methodology and data completeness during FY2006-FY2013 may have contributed to fluctuations in NPS DM over the decade. Land management agencies like NPS, BLM, FWS, and FS have deferred maintenance backlogs. NPS has the largest backlog, with over $11 billion reported in FY2016. FS reported about $5.5 billion, while FWS and BLM reported less than $2 billion each. NPS reports DM by state and territory, with Alaska having a large park acreage but a small DM backlog. The 20 states with the highest NPS DM estimates are detailed in a report. The primary determinants of deferred maintenance for national park units are the amount, type, and condition of infrastructure in each state. Transportation assets, like parkways, contribute significantly to the maintenance backlog. Older park units with infrastructure from the mid-20th century tend to have higher maintenance backlogs. Gateway National Recreation Area and Golden Gate National are among the 20 individual park units with the highest maintenance backlogs. Some national park units, like Gateway National Recreation Area and Golden Gate National Recreation Area, located in or near urban areas, have more built assets. Three of the top 10 units with the highest estimated deferred maintenance are national parkways. The total funding allocated each year to address NPS's deferred maintenance backlog is not reported. Funding for deferred maintenance comes from various NPS budget sources, but the specific amounts used for deferred maintenance are not disclosed. GAO estimated that NPS's annual spending for maintenance averaged $1.182 billion per year from FY2006-FY2015. NPS would need roughly $700 million annually for deferred maintenance to prevent backlog growth. Funding sources for maintenance include discretionary appropriations, park entrance fees, and donations. Repair and Rehabilitation and Line-Item Construction are the main budget activities for maintenance funding. The Repair and Rehabilitation (R&R) budget subactivity focuses on large-scale repair needs for assets where scheduled maintenance is insufficient. R&R funds are used for projects under $1 million each, with a portion targeted to projects on the deferred maintenance backlog. The Administration's FY2018 budget would decrease R&R funding to $99.3 million. The Line-Item Construction budget activity provides funding for construction, rehabilitation, and replacement of facilities to meet management objectives. The Line-Item Construction budget activity provides funding for construction, rehabilitation, and replacement of facilities to meet management objectives in national parks. NPS prioritizes projects based on financial sustainability, health and safety, resource protection, and visitor services. The FY2018 budget allocates $137.0 million for Line-Item Construction, with a portion of other NPS discretionary budget activities also used for deferred maintenance. The Centennial Challenge account provides federal funds to match outside donations for NPS parks and programs, enhancing visitor services, reducing deferred maintenance, and improving resource protection. The FY2018 budget requests $15.0 million for the program, a decrease from the previous year. NPS also receives funds from the Highway Trust Fund to address transportation needs and deferred maintenance. The Federal Lands Transportation Program provides funding for NPS transportation-related maintenance, with an allocation of $284.0 million for FY2018. Additional funding may come from federal highway programs and entrance and recreation fees collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act. NPS estimates collecting $256.9 million for FY2017 and $259.5 million for FY2018 in entrance and recreation fees. The National Park Service collects concessions franchise fees from park concessioners for services like lodging and dining. These fees, available without further appropriation, are mainly retained at the collecting parks and can be used to reduce deferred maintenance. NPS estimates $127.8 million for FY2017 and $131.3 million for FY2018 in franchise fee collections. The NPS Centennial Challenge Fund, established by the NPS Centennial Act, receives offsetting collections from senior pass sales, estimated to provide an additional $15.0 million for FY2018. The senior pass sales will provide an additional $15.0 million for the account for FY2018 on top of discretionary appropriations. The funding may be used for projects prioritizing DM, improvements to visitor services facilities, and trail maintenance. Federal funds must be matched by nonfederal donations on a 50:50 basis. The NPS Second Century Endowment receives revenues from senior pass sales totaling $10 million annually and can also receive gifts from donors. The funds can be used for projects approved by the Secretary of the Interior that further the purposes of NPS, including projects on the maintenance backlog. Other types of donations to NPS may be used for projects that reduce DM and other purposes. The National Park Service (NPS) receives funding from various sources for Deferred Maintenance (DM) projects. In addition to senior pass sales, NPS estimated receiving $75.0 million in FY2017 and $71.0 million in FY2018 from donations. The Helium Stewardship Act of 2013 allocates $20 million in FY2018 from federal helium sales for DM projects. Other mandatory appropriations, such as the Park Building Lease and Maintenance Fund, also contribute to DM funding. Some stakeholders have proposed additional funding sources to address NPS's DM needs. Stakeholders have proposed various sources of additional funding for NPS's Deferred Maintenance (DM) needs, including resources from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, offshore oil and gas revenues, income tax overpayments, motorfuel taxes, and coin and postage stamp sales. Some suggest reducing NPS DM without additional funding by improving capital investment strategies, involving nonfederal partners in park management, or disposing of assets. NPS uses computerized maintenance management systems and condition assessments by park staff to prioritize DM projects. The National Park Service (NPS) uses a software system to assess the condition of park assets with facility condition and asset priority index ratings. Projects are prioritized based on these ratings, financial sustainability, resource protection, visitor use, and health and safety criteria. NPS faces funding challenges and other issues in managing the maintenance backlog, as identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in December 2016. In December 2016, GAO reported on NPS management of maintenance activities, highlighting challenges such as competing duties hindering timely facility assessments, remote asset locations causing difficulties, focus on high-priority assets leading to lower-priority asset deterioration, and lack of verification process for Capital Investment Strategy outcomes. NPS also faces challenges in disposing unneeded assets to reduce maintenance burden. Despite challenges, NPS has seen successes in asset management, including consistent assessment tools meeting federal standards and collaboration with partners and volunteers for maintenance needs. NPS faces challenges in disposing unneeded assets to reduce maintenance burden, including high FCI ratings and low API ratings for some assets. Legal requirements, such as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, create obstacles for disposal. Congress has addressed NPS's maintenance backlog through oversight, funding, and legislation. In the 115th Congress, oversight hearings were held to address NPS maintenance backlog. The National Parks Centennial Act of 2016 created funds to reduce deferred maintenance. The National Parks Centennial Act of 2016 created funds to reduce deferred maintenance in the National Park Service. These funds receive federal monies from senior recreation passes and donations, with projects prioritized under the Centennial Challenge Fund. The law also extended eligibility for the Public Land Corps and increased appropriations for the Volunteers in the Parks program. Additionally, it authorized annual appropriations for the National Park Foundation to match nonfederal contributions for various NPS projects, including addressing maintenance backlog. Bills in the 115th Congress related to NPS deferred maintenance, such as H.R. 1577, aim to enhance transparency and accountability within the agency. The Park Service Transparency and Accountability Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to Congress on the NPS's Capital Investment Strategy. H.R. 2584 / S. 751, the National Park Service Legacy Act of 2017, establishes a fund for NPS maintenance needs funded by mineral revenues, starting at $50.0 million for FY2018-FY2020 and increasing to $500.0 million for FY2027-FY2047. 20% of the funding goes to transportation-related maintenance, while 80% is for repair and rehabilitation of non-transportation assets. The Land and National Park Deferred Maintenance (LAND) Act, H.R. 2863, proposes a National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund funded by mineral revenues. $450.0 million annually would be allocated, with $375.0 million for NPS and $25.0 million for other agencies. The funds would address high priority deferred maintenance needs for critical infrastructure and visitor services, excluding land acquisition. S. 1460, Section 5101, also aims to establish a similar fund for NPS maintenance and revitalization. The Senate version of the National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund, as part of an energy-modernization bill, would receive $150.0 million annually from offshore revenues under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The funds are designated for high-priority deferred maintenance needs of critical infrastructure and visitor services, excluding land acquisition."
