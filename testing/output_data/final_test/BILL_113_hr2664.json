Monitoring and compliance reviews will be conducted to detect violations and ensure certified products maintain standards. Certification may be withdrawn at the Secretary's initiative.

If the manufacturer does not take action within a specified time, the certification will be withdrawn. The Secretary may withdraw product certification at the manufacturer's request. Regulations for implementation may be promulgated within 2 years. Administration by contract is allowed for certification determinations, monitoring, fee collection, and remission.
