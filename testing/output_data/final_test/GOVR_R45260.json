It has made progress in socioeconomic outcomes and is viewed as a stable U.S. partner in the region. The U.S. has provided substantial aid to Ghana, and relations between the two countries have been strong since Ghana gained independence in 1957. Former President George W. Bush visited Ghana in 2008 to showcase U.S. aid programs. The U.S. has provided substantial aid to Ghana, focusing on trade, entrepreneurship, health, and education. Former Presidents Obama and Bush highlighted Ghana as a democratic model. The Trump Administration supports close cooperation but proposed cuts in aid, which could impact relations. Obama Administration aid to Ghana was primarily through USAID programs like Feed the Future and Global Health Initiative. In 2014, Ghana signed a second MCC compact focused on the electrical power sector and joined the Obama Administration's African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership and Security Governance Initiative. Ghana is a key peacekeeping troop contributor in Africa and plays an active role in regional affairs, including mediating political tensions in neighboring Togo. Ghana has played a key role in mediating political tensions in neighboring Togo and supporting UN operations during the Ebola outbreak. Ghanaians hold leadership positions in regional and multilateral organizations, supporting economic integration efforts in West Africa and Africa. The country seeks to maintain positive donor relations, aid, and investment, while contributing to global peace, stability, and development. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo succeeded John Dramani Mahama, who took office in 2012 after the death of President John Atta Mills. In late 2012, Mahama won the election after the death of President John Atta Mills. The 2016 general elections were deemed free and fair, with Akufo-Addo winning the presidency with 53.7% of the votes. Akufo-Addo took office in January 2017, and his party, the NPP, also won the majority of legislative seats. Despite some economic improvements in 2016, there was widespread frustration over poor conditions. During Mahama's tenure, economic challenges led to protests over unemployment and socioeconomic issues. Ghana's political landscape alternates between the NDC and NPP, with similar policies focusing on private-sector growth and social services. President Akufo-Addo comes from a political family. President Akufo-Addo, from a prominent political family, aims to improve the economy through initiatives like increasing access to credit, reducing business costs, and supporting private-sector-led growth. The government prioritizes industrialization, economic diversification, infrastructure investment, and tax incentives for manufacturing sectors. In July 2019, a $320 million Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme was launched. The Akufo-Addo administration has launched a $320 million initiative called the Infrastructure for Poverty Eradication Programme, providing $1 million to each of 275 constituencies for local infrastructure projects. They also aim to strengthen public social services, including the Free Senior High School program for universal education. Additionally, a Social and Partnership Council was established in May 2019 to manage partnerships between the government, labor, and employers. The Akufo-Addo administration aims to increase economic competitiveness, combat corruption, and reduce reliance on foreign assistance. President Akufo-Addo emphasizes self-reliance and African-driven development. Public sector corruption in Ghana has been a chronic challenge, with a third of Ghanaians reporting paying a bribe in the last 12 months. High-profile bribery scandals involving top officials have emerged, despite efforts by both NDC- and NPP-led governments to combat corruption. Akufo-Addo has pledged to tackle the issue by strengthening asset disclosure. Akufo-Addo aims to address corruption by enhancing asset declaration and impartial prosecution. The creation of the Office of the Special Prosecutor in 2018 was controversial due to the nomination of Martin Amidu. Amidu, a former Justice Minister, pursued corruption cases independently after being dismissed by the previous administration. Akufo-Addo's crackdown on corruption included the arrest of customs officials involved in a $276 million revenue loss case and an investigation into the president of the Ghana Football Association for corruption, leading to the dissolution of the GFA. The dissolution of the Ghana Football Association (GFA) drew intense public attention, with criticism towards Akufo-Addo and the NPP for failing to control criminal acts of intimidation by NPP youth supporters, particularly the Delta Force vigilante group. The group's actions were linked to unmet demands for patronage or jobs after the NPP's 2016 electoral victories. Drug traffickers use Ghana as a hub for cocaine and heroin transshipment to Europe, South Africa, and North America, leading to arrests of Ghanaian drug mules abroad. Ghanaian drug mules are frequently arrested at airports abroad, with close U.S.-Ghanaian cooperation to combat drug trafficking. The DEA has an office in Ghana and helped establish a Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) in 2010. Ghana also hosts a State Department International Law Enforcement Academy Regional Training Center. While Ghana has not experienced Islamist terrorist attacks, the rise of violent extremist attacks in West Africa poses a potential threat, especially along its northern border with countries like C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Ghana's northern border abuts the Sahel region. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, neighboring Ghana, have faced extremist attacks. Ghana's contribution of troops to MINUSMA in Mali could make it a target for extremists. There are signs of limited radicalization among Ghana's Muslims, primarily following Sufi and Ahmadiyya traditions. Foreign or local radicalization may be occurring in Ghana. The Libyan government report suggested that between 50 and 100 Ghanaians may have joined IS in Libya, with some analysts believing there are more radicalized Ghanaians with IS links. In early 2018, individuals with grenades and suspected IS ties were arrested in Ghana. Additionally, there was controversy over hosting two Yemeni refugees with Guantanamo Bay ties, which the Akufo-Addo government allowed to remain in the country as refugees after the agreement expired. Ghana faces serious human rights challenges, including unlawful killings, harsh prison conditions, corruption, violence against women and children, child labor, and trafficking in persons. Despite signing a partnership to address child sex trafficking and forced labor, these issues persist. Ghana's anti-trafficking efforts have been rated poorly by the State Department, placing the country on the Tier 2 Watch List in recent years. While improvements have been made, Ghana still faces challenges as a source, transit, and destination for forced labor and sex trafficking, particularly in the fisheries and cocoa sectors. Child labor remains a significant concern for policymakers. Child labor in the cocoa sector is a major concern for U.S. policy-makers. Ghana's GDP has shown growth, reaching $65 billion in 2018 with a 5.6% growth rate. The IMF projects further growth to 8.8% in 2019, reaching $97 billion by 2024. Ghana faces challenges with trafficking in forced labor and sex trafficking, particularly in the fisheries and cocoa sectors. Ghana's key commodity exports, cocoa and gold, have seen price increases leading to a post-Mahama recovery. The oil and gas sector is expected to expand rapidly, with crude oil becoming a major export since 2010. The services sector, including a stock market and mobile money market worth $35 billion, has grown significantly. Agriculture's GDP share has decreased from 36% in 1997 to 20% in 2017. Ghana's diverse and dynamic domestic economy is expected to reach $97 billion by 2024. Ghana's agriculture sector's share of GDP has declined from 36% in 1997 to 20% in 2017, but it remains a key economic driver, employing 34% of the labor force. The country has effective public goods and services, high cell phone usage, and electricity access rates, supporting production, digital trade, and financial transactions. Ghana is expanding natural gas production for electricity and other sectors, but faces challenges with power generation and transmission. The exchange value of Ghana's currency has been declining, impacting the trade balance. The Akufo-Addo administration in Ghana has continued the heavy borrowing trend started under Mahama, selling billions in Eurobonds to finance state debts and campaign promises. Public debt has increased from 57.1% to 59.6% of GDP, driven by debt payments and spending to fulfill NPP pledges. This borrowing has been necessary to address fiscal imbalances, external deficits, and inflation linked to exchange rate fluctuations. In 2015, the IMF initiated a $925 million Extended Credit Facility (ECF) loan program in Ghana to address fiscal imbalances, external deficits, inflation, and power shortages. The program was extended into early 2019, with the government receiving waivers for some ECF targets. The IMF praised the government's economic performance, especially in revenue collection and public debt audits. Despite new credit commitments being justified, the national debt remains at high risk of distress. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has been increasing, particularly in the energy sector. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ghana has grown in recent years, especially in the energy sector. FDI flows averaged $3.3 billion annually between 2014 and 2016, with FDI stock at $26.5 billion. Ghana ranks 114th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's 2019 Doing Business Report. Under Mahama, an Investment Promotion Center was created to oversee FDI. The State Department reported Ghana has an open investment climate but cited troubling foreign investment policies. The Trump Administration has not announced major changes in U.S. policy towards Ghana but proposed a reduction in aid. The United States has proposed a sharp reduction in aid for Ghana, which could impact bilateral relations. Despite generally amicable relations, there are strong cultural ties between Ghanaians and African-Americans, with a significant expatriate community in Ghana. Ghana is seen as a model for promoting democracy, human rights, and regional stability in Africa. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security imposed visa sanctions on Ghana in January 2019 due to a lack of cooperation in accepting deported nationals. The restrictions affect tourist and business visas for certain government officials and their families. Ghana was warned about this action in June 2018 for not cooperating with deportation orders. The bilateral cooperation between the two countries includes security matters, development assistance programs, and professional exchanges. Ghana hosts various development assistance programs and professional exchanges, including the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) and Power Africa. The Trump Administration has maintained these programs but requested less funding than the Obama Administration. Ghana also benefits from USAID programs, such as the West Africa Trade Hub. Ghana receives development assistance from various programs and agencies, including the Peace Corps, State Department, and USAID. In FY2018, bilateral assistance totaled $143 million, with funding for health, agriculture, and education sectors. Health aid focused on nutrition, family planning, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. The Trump Administration has requested a 56% decrease in funding for FY2020. In FY2020, Ghana is proposed to receive $42 million in health sector assistance, nearly 67% of the total request. Agriculture programs would also receive funding. Ghana previously completed two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts focused on improving various sectors including agriculture, roads, education, and power service delivery. The second compact aimed at building electrical system capacity to meet power demand, spur growth, and reduce poverty. Key goals include improving the Electricity Company of Ghana's service quality and reliability through capacity building. The compact with Ghana aims to enhance the power utility's commercial viability through capacity building and partial privatization. It includes technical aid for the power sector, regulatory reforms, and support for off-grid solar power systems. Additionally, it focuses on improving energy supply and demand management, gas sector commercialization, and implementing a national gas-to-power plan. The MCC compact with Ghana aims to enhance the power utility's commercial viability through capacity building and partial privatization. It includes technical aid for the power sector, regulatory reforms, and support for off-grid solar power systems. The operationalization of an independent electricity producer framework and consideration of Ghana's suitability for a concurrent compact are ongoing. Ghana has aligned interests with the U.S. in addressing regional political and security crises, and has received U.S. military training for international peacekeeping operations. The U.S. military has access to Ghana's military facilities for exercises and crisis response, including an Exercise Reception Facility for troop deployments in West Africa. The two countries have defense agreements dating back to 1972, with an updated Status of Forces Agreement signed in 2018. This agreement supports joint exercises and the provision of $20 million in military equipment to Ghana under the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership. Ghana's military cooperation with the United States, primarily under the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) and the U.S. International Military Education and Training (IMET) program, faced controversy over the ratification of a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) by Ghana's parliament. Allegations of establishing military bases in Ghana were refuted by the State Department, leading to opposition boycotts citing national sovereignty concerns, possibly driven by partisan rivalry between NPP and NDC. Ghana is a partner of the North Dakota National Guard under the State Partnership Program, benefiting from various U.S. Africa Command activities focused on regional crisis-response and maritime security. The Department of Defense has provided counternarcotics assistance, ship traffic monitoring equipment, patrol boats, training, and maritime cooperation to enhance Ghana's capacity to counter maritime piracy. Ghana has also received bilateral Foreign Military Financing and Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs assistance. Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs assistance have been provided to Ghana, including support for international peacekeeping troops and efforts to increase security by targeting small arms trafficking. U.S. security sector assistance under the West Africa Regional Security Initiative focuses on justice, rule of law capacity-building, and countering transnational threats. Despite challenges, positive U.S.-Ghanaian relations suggest enduring cooperation in development, trade, and security. President Akufo-Addo aims to decrease Ghana's dependency on assistance. President Akufo-Addo's goal of reducing Ghana's reliance on foreign aid and promoting economic self-reliance aligns with the Trump Administration's focus on prioritizing national economic interests. If Ghana can enhance its self-sufficiency, boost economic production, diversify its economy, and reduce poverty, it could become a more significant trade partner for the U.S."
