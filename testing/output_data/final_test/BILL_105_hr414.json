    "content": "The Uniformed Services Medicare Subvention Program Act is established with definitions and provisions for reimbursement amounts. The Act defines a \"Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiary\" as someone entitled to Medicare hospital insurance and enrolled in the supplementary medical insurance program. It also defines the \"TRICARE program\" as the managed health care program established by the Secretary of Defense under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code. The term \"subvention program\" refers to a program that reimburses the Department of Defense for health care services provided to Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries through the managed care option of the TRICARE program. The term \"Secretaries\" refers to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services acting jointly. Establishment of subvention program. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program for the Department of Defense to receive reimbursement from Medicare for health care services provided to Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries who choose the managed care option of the TRICARE program. Enrollment in the managed care option will be voluntary, subject to capacity and funding limitations. Effect of Enrollment: Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries enrolling in TRICARE's managed care option will only receive payments under the subvention program, with exceptions for emergencies. The Secretary of Defense will waive enrollment fees for these beneficiaries. TRICARE contracts may be modified as needed for the subvention program. The Secretary of Defense may establish cost-sharing requirements for Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries enrolling in TRICARE's managed care option. The Secretaries have the authority to expand the subvention program to include health care services for these beneficiaries under the fee-for-service options of TRICARE if deemed feasible and advisable in a report submitted under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. Reimbursement of Department of Defense under the subvention program shall be made from the Medicare program on a monthly basis starting October 1, 1997. Payments will be made at a per capita rate equal to 93 from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary of Defense must maintain the Department of Defense health care efforts for Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries to avoid shifting costs to the Medicare program. The reimbursement under the subvention program will be made at a per capita rate equal to 93 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost for each beneficiary enrolled in the TRICARE program. The Secretaries estimate the amount expended by the Department of Defense for providing health care items and services to Medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries. Monthly targets are established based on this estimate. Monthly targets are set for the number of Medicare-eligible military beneficiaries for whom reimbursement will not be provided to the Department of Defense. The purpose is to protect the Medicare program from incurring costs related to providing healthcare services to these beneficiaries. The Comptroller General will review and report on the costs incurred by the Secretary of Defense annually. The Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services will assess if costs have increased due to the subvention program. If excess costs persist, they will take necessary actions to offset them, such as suspending or adjusting the program."
