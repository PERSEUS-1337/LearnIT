    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Pay Telephone Protection Act of 1998\". Congress finds that some payphone service providers have increased charges for local calls without providing change for excess deposits, consumers prefer excess deposits to be used for public purposes, and there are approximately 2,000,000 pay telephones in operation. The Federal Communications Commission's decision to deregulate payphone service in the United States, where there are approximately 2,000,000 payphones, has not adequately addressed the need for local competition and affordable service for the public. This decision does not promote the deployment of public interest telephones or benefit users who may not have exact change for payphone use. Commercial activity from coin-operated payphones significantly impacts interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to require payphone service providers to provide cash change to users or transfer the change to State entities for public interest purposes. It aims to encourage changes in payphone technology to benefit users and promote public safety, health, and welfare. The Act aims to regulate payphone service providers to prevent overcharging and ensure users are not billed for unused time. It also tasks the Federal Trade Commission with investigating market dysfunctions and determining if rates for local calls are market-based. SEC. 3. PUBLIC INTEREST PAY TELEPHONES. Section 276(b)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to ensure public interest pay telephones are available in locations where there would not otherwise likely be a pay telephone, and that they are supported fairly and equitably. State agency receiving funds must promote public interest pay telephones, including those for the disabled, in various locations like nursing homes, hospitals, and schools. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGE AT PAY TELEPHONES. SEC. 4 amends Section 276 of the Communications Act of 1934 to require payphone service providers to give cash change to individuals who deposit more than the call charge. The amendment to Section 276 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires payphone service providers to give cash change for local telephone calls exceeding 10 cents. Excess collections can be transferred to the State agency responsible for supporting public interest pay telephones. The amendment allows for the transfer of excess funds to the Commission if the State lacks an agency for payphone service funds. The State's chief executive officer has the option to permit or revoke the transfer, and must notify the Commission accordingly. The State officer must notify the Commission of any determination or revocation regarding payphone service funds. State agencies must use these funds to support public interest payphones, with excess amounts potentially transferred to the Commission. The State agency must promote public interest payphones and use excess funds for universal service or improving telephone service in the State. The Commission will deposit received amounts in a Treasury account and utilize them to assist States as needed. The payphone service provider must notify consumers if excess amounts deposited at a pay telephone will not be returned as cash when transferred to support public interest payphones. The Consumer Pay Telephone Protection Act of 1998 requires the Commission to prescribe regulations within one year for monitoring payphone service providers' compliance with the act. Additional notices may be required by states regarding excess amounts not returned as cash. The regulations under the Consumer Pay Telephone Protection Act of 1998 ensure providers do not pass compliance costs to consumers, maintain payphone service levels, and have an effective date 6-12 months after issuance. Additionally, a study of alternative technologies is required. The Federal Communications Commission must submit a report to Congress within 18 months on technologies allowing payphone use without overcharging for local calls, including tokens, cash debit cards, and crediting monthly bills. SEC. 5. STUDY OF COMPETITIVENESS OF PAY TELEPHONE MARKET. The Federal Trade Commission, in consultation with the Federal Communications Commission, will conduct a study on competition in the intrastate payphone service market. This study will assess the presence of locational monopolies, barriers to choice for users, market-based rates for local calls, and evidence of monopoly pricing. The Federal Trade Commission will conduct a study on competition in the intrastate payphone service market, seeking input from various stakeholders. A report will be submitted to Congress within one year, and the Federal Communications Commission may take action based on the study's findings. The Federal Communications Commission will conduct a rule-making proceeding under subsection (a) to set limitations on rates for local pay telephone calls, permit States to establish rates on a cost basis, limit commissions paid to persons leasing space for payphones, and prohibit exclusive contracts for payphone service providers."
