    "content": "During the Great Recession, various tax cuts were proposed as part of fiscal stimulus efforts, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. These tax cuts targeted lower- and middle-income individuals as well as businesses. Previous stimulus measures in 2008 and 2001-2003 also included tax rebates, accelerated depreciation for businesses, and other provisions. Debate focused on the effectiveness of different tax cut alternatives, such as tax rebates, tax rate reductions, sales tax holidays, payroll tax holidays, investment stimulus, corporate tax cuts, and dividend cuts. The 2001 and 2002 tax cuts included rebates and temporary investment stimulus. President Bush proposed rate cuts and dividend relief in 2003. Democratic leaders also proposed rebates. In response to the 2008 recession and Hurricane Katrina, tax stimulus measures were enacted, including rebates for individuals and bonus depreciation for businesses. In 2009, Congress passed a larger stimulus package with tax cuts, including a two-year refundable earnings credit. The 2010 legislation included tax components targeting lower-income individuals and businesses, such as bonus depreciation extension and net operating losses carryback. It also extended the Alternative Minimum Tax for higher-income individuals. Additionally, a temporary two-percentage-point reduction in the payroll tax was adopted, benefiting middle- and higher-income individuals. Many tax cuts were extended permanently after 2012, but the payroll tax reduction was not extended. The Congress enacted four measures related to the coronavirus, including the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-123) providing emergency funding. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127) offered employer tax credits for family and medical leave, costing $95 billion in revenue loss. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act (P.L. 116-136) had significant revenue effects. The CARES Act (P.L. 116-136) had significant revenue effects, including a refundable rebate, business tax provisions, and a delay in payroll taxes. It also included the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) costing $377 billion. The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with loan forgiveness provisions and excluded forgiven loans from taxable income. The program aimed to retain and pay employees, similar to the employee retention tax credit. The final bill, The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, added $321 billion to the PPP and $62 billion in small business loan authority. The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with loan forgiveness provisions and excluded forgiven loans from taxable income. The program aimed to retain and pay employees, similar to the employee retention tax credit. The final bill, The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, added $321 billion to the PPP, $62 billion in additional small business loan authority, and $100 billion in health-related spending ($75 billion for health providers and $25 billion for COVID-19 testing). Additional stimulus legislation may be considered, which might include aid to state and local governments and additional funds for the PPP. Effectiveness of a tax cut for short run stimulus purposes is judged by the extent to which the tax cut increases private demand. Individual income tax cuts, especially for lower-income individuals, are more stimulative than cuts for higher-income individuals. A rebate specifically targeted at lower-income individuals would be the most effective. Payroll and sales taxes, while more concentrated among lower-income individuals, still benefit middle- and higher-income individuals. Most income tax cuts exclude the bottom 44% of the population who do not pay taxes. Tax cuts are often concentrated among higher-income individuals, with reductions in 2001 benefiting the upper part of the income distribution. A flat dollar reduction, if refundable, would benefit lower and middle incomes more than rate reductions or deductions. There is weak evidence that lump sum tax cuts are less likely to be spent than incremental cuts. Rebates may be less effective than other tax cuts, but the distributional impact is more solidly grounded in economic theory. The effectiveness of temporary tax cuts varies depending on the type, with temporary investment subsidies being the most impactful. Corporate tax cuts that do not increase profitability for new investments may have little effect on investment or consumer spending, especially during a recession. Proposition 1: A tax cut targeted at lower-income individuals is more likely to boost spending compared to one aimed at higher-income individuals. The savings rate increases with income levels, with the top 1% saving significantly more than the average. This pattern suggests a departure from the permanent income model of consumption, as savings rise across income groups. Transitory income variations can lead to discrepancies between actual and permanent income levels. The savings rate increases with income levels, suggesting a departure from the permanent income model of consumption. Transitory income variations can lead to discrepancies between actual and permanent income levels, but age does little to explain saving behavior. Patterns of rising saving rates with income persist within age groups. Lower-income individuals are likely to spend more of an additional dollar of income than higher-income individuals, especially with temporary tax cuts associated with fiscal stimulus. Social welfare programs with higher wage replacement rates during instances of bad luck or old age may result in lower-lifetime saving rates for lower-income individuals. They may have less information to optimize savings over time, leading to spending additional income increases. Liquidity constraints are more likely for lower-income individuals. Lower-income individuals are more likely to spend additional income increases, especially with temporary tax cuts. They may have liquidity constraints and prefer to spend more than their earnings. Tax cuts for liquidity constrained individuals are more likely to be spent. A tax cut provided through a lump sum payment may be less likely to be spent than one which shows up in withholding. The Congressional Budget Office pointed out this differential effect in its studies of the effectiveness of alternative tax cuts. The effectiveness of lump-sum tax cuts versus tax cuts reflected in paychecks over time was studied in the early 1980s. While both types of tax cuts showed some spending effects, larger effects were found for rate reductions. However, there are reservations about comparing these events as individuals may use over-withholding to save, affecting spending behavior. Additionally, uncertainty about receiving future tax cuts may impact spending behavior. The effectiveness of lump-sum tax cuts versus tax cuts reflected in paychecks over time was studied in the early 1980s. Larger spending effects were found for rate reductions, but uncertainty about receiving future tax cuts may impact behavior. The payroll tax cut and sales tax holidays could be more effective than a rebate due to differential effects, but distributional effects must be considered. Evidence suggests that a large fraction of tax rebates was spent, while a smaller share of the payroll tax cut in 2011 was spent, possibly due to methodological and economic differences. Proposition 3 suggests that certain types of temporary tax cuts may be more effective than permanent ones. While permanent income modeling of consumption indicates that temporary tax cuts are less effective, tax cuts tied to spending are likely to be more effective in the short run. During periods of slack employment, temporary tax cuts triggered by spending are more effective than permanent ones. A temporary tax cut triggered by spending can be more effective, similar to a temporary sale inducing a large response. Examples include investment tax credits or temporary partial expensing of investment. While temporary tax cuts may be more effective than permanent ones in stimulating the economy, evidence suggests that investment subsidies have a small effect on investment. Proposition 4 states that corporate tax cuts that do not increase profitability for new investments are not very effective. Investment subsidies are more effective than corporate rate cuts. The implementation of a sales tax holiday may face delays due to state-imposed sales taxes, and pre-announced temporary spending subsidies can initially have a contractionary effect. Investment subsidies are more effective than rate cuts. Repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax may not make new investments more profitable. The corporate AMT was permanently repealed after the 2017 tax cut, but other similar measures could be considered. Temporary restoration of NOL carrybacks and additional measures to aid businesses affected by COVID-19 have been proposed. Economic theory suggests investment decisions should be based on expected returns. Economic theory suggests that investment decisions should be based on expected profitability. A tax decrease not associated with profitability is unlikely to impact investment, as the cash flow may be used to reduce debt or pay dividends instead of expanding aggregate demand. Corporate rate reductions benefit existing capital and have a modest effect compared to stimulus for new investment. However, firms without access to outside capital may be influenced by cash flow, especially small firms. Empirical evidence shows a positive relationship between firm investment and cash flow. Interpreting the evidence on corporate cash flow as a stimulus to investment during economic contractions is challenging due to two main concerns. Cash flow may be correlated with investment outlook rather than directly influencing investment decisions. Additionally, during periods of excess capacity, an increase in cash flow may not necessarily lead to new investments. In such situations, investment-focused choices like investment subsidies may have a more significant impact. Net operating loss carrybacks could be more effective in tight credit conditions where firms struggle to borrow. Investment subsidies may be more effective than general corporate rate cuts in stimulating new investments during economic contractions. Evidence suggests that even temporary investment subsidies have not been very effective. Multipliers indicate the additional output generated by revenue loss or spending increases, with different policies having varying effects. Corporate rate cuts primarily affecting cash flow are expected to have a small impact. During economic contractions, investment subsidies may be more effective than corporate rate cuts in stimulating new investments. Multipliers vary among policies and depend on the economy's proximity to full employment. Refundable rebates in the CARES Act had multipliers ranging from 0.4 to 1.22 according to the CBO and 1.22 according to Moody's. Net operating loss benefits in the CARES Act had multipliers ranging from 0 to 0.4 according to the CBO and 0.25 according to Moody's. Direct transfers to individuals and aid to state and local governments had multipliers similar to or larger than refundable rebates. CBO estimated multipliers between 0.4 and 2.1 for direct transfers, while Moody's estimated between 1.55 and 1.71. Aid to state and local governments had multipliers ranging from 0.4 to 1.8 according to the CBO and 1.34 according to Moody's. The CARES Act included various provisions with different multipliers. Refundable rebates had multipliers ranging from 0.4 to 1.22 by CBO and 1.22 by Moody's. The effects of the CARES Act implied a multiplier of 0.4 for rebates and 0.2 for business provisions. Researchers estimated higher multipliers for spending on health and disaster (0.8) and aid to state and local governments (0.7). The CARES Act and other measures enacted to address the effects of the coronavirus may not be very effective as stimulus measures but could be seen as relief measures. Payments used to pay debt may not increase spending but can help individuals and businesses avoid credit problems and survive. They may also facilitate compliance with social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus."
