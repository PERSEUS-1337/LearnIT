    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1993\". The Congress acknowledges the Palestine Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel's right to exist, commitment to peace, and acceptance of UN resolutions. Israel has recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people. Both parties signed a Declaration of Principles in 1993. The US has resumed dialogue with both parties. The United States has resumed a bilateral dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization and the President has requested flexibility to suspend certain provisions of law pertaining to the PLO to implement the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements and facilitate the Middle East peace process. The President has requested authority to suspend certain provisions of law related to the PLO to support the Middle East peace process. The President may suspend specific laws related to the PLO until January 1, 1994, after consulting with congressional committees and certifying it is in the national interest and the PLO continues to comply with commitments. The President can suspend laws related to the PLO until January 1, 1994, if it is in the national interest and the PLO complies with commitments. The suspension will end if the President certifies to congressional committees that the PLO has not continued to abide by its commitments made in various letters and agreements. Arrangements signed on September 13, 1993 state that any extension of presidential authority is conditional on the Palestine Liberation Organization renouncing the Arab League boycott of Israel, urging Arab League nations to end the boycott, and cooperating with US efforts to end the boycott. Provisions that may be suspended include sections of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Department of State Authorization Act. The Department of State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989, and the Bretton Woods Agreement Act are referenced in relation to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
