    "content": "A number of economic and political factors influence U.S. trade policy, including domestic economic conditions, trade deficits, the impact of trade on various states and industries, the importance of trade to the economy, and the geographical distribution of exports and imports. Political factors such as the role of Congress and the President also play a significant role in shaping trade policy. Poor economic conditions can shift policymakers' focus towards trade issues. The steel industry faced structural adjustments leading to restrictions on steel imports in 2002. Growing U.S. trade deficits sparked interest in foreign trade and policy reassessments. Economists argue deficits result from broader economic conditions, not trade policies. Large deficits prompt Congress to prioritize trade issues, especially when deficits with trading partners increase rapidly. In 2005, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services reached a record $725.8 billion, a 17.5% increase. In 2005, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services hit a record $725.8 billion, a 17.5% increase over the previous year. The deficit has increased over 600% in the 10-year period from 1996 to 2005. Economists attribute the deficits to macroeconomic factors, not trade policies. Trade deficits lead to more U.S. firms and workers facing import competition, increasing pressure for protection. The value of the U.S. dollar in terms of other major currencies is also related to trade deficits. The U.S. trade deficits are influenced by the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. Despite record-breaking current account deficits, the dollar has been appreciating. A stronger dollar makes domestic goods more expensive compared to imports, leading to trade imbalances. This situation may result in adjustments by manufacturers, such as using technology or moving production offshore, potentially leading to protectionist trade policies. The increasing importance of foreign trade in the U.S. economy affects the congressional trade agenda by creating winners and losers from trade, increasing the salience of trade issues. The ratio of exports and imports to U.S. GDP increased from 9.5% in 1960 to 26.6% in 2005, showing greater integration with the global economy. Advances in technology have led to outsourcing of services, creating competition for domestic providers but lowering costs for consumers. The distribution of U.S. trade has shifted, with a decline in exports to developed countries and an increase to developing countries. The rise of developing countries' share of U.S. trade, particularly driven by China, has raised concerns about U.S. workers' ability to compete with low-wage countries and the impact of globalization on employment, wages, and living standards. The decline in the United States' share of world trade is attributed to the emergence of China and other developing countries in the international trading system. Congressional responsibilities in U.S. trade policy are extensive, as outlined in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 delegated authority to the President to negotiate trade agreements and reduce tariffs, in response to the challenges faced by Congress in tariff administration and the negative economic impact of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. Trade negotiations have evolved from tariffs to nontariff barriers, labor, environment, and other issues. Negotiating authority was granted in 1974 for expedited congressional consideration of agreements. Congress maintains control by setting time limits and negotiating objectives for any agreement. The Congress establishes negotiating objectives for trade agreements eligible for expedited treatment. It requires the executive branch to notify and consult with Congress during negotiations. Concerns include ensuring the President respects Congress's authority over trade and consults on bilateral and multilateral negotiations. During trade negotiations, members aim to protect U.S. industries and ensure fair competition for U.S. exports. Each administration sets its own trade priorities and strategies. The Bush Administration pursued an active trade agenda, engaging in multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional free trade agreements, and other trade initiatives. The Bush Administration's trade priorities in its second term include completing FTA negotiations, launching negotiations with other trading partners, and ensuring compliance with bilateral and multilateral agreements. Conflict may arise between Congress and the Administration on trade matters due to differing institutional perspectives. The 109th Congress faces trade issues that could impact U.S. trade policy, with potential conflicts between branches over trade matters. Congress prioritizes constituents' interests, while the President must balance various groups' positions with national objectives in trade policy decisions. The President's trade promotion authority (TPA) is set to expire on July 1, 2007, which could affect the negotiation of trade agreements. The President's trade promotion authority (TPA), set to expire on July 1, 2007, imposes a deadline for U.S. trade negotiations on various agreements. The TPA statute requires agreements to be concluded by April 2, 2007, to be eligible for expedited congressional consideration. While Congress could potentially renew the authority briefly, it is uncertain if this will occur. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995 to regulate international trade among its 149 members. It sets rules and principles for trade and resolves disputes. The WTO is currently undergoing changes through the Doha Development Agenda round. Some Members of Congress and interest groups find the WTO controversial, believing it infringes on U.S. sovereignty. The 109th Congress did not pass a resolution to withdraw the United States from the WTO, affirming U.S. participation for another five years. The Doha Development Agenda negotiations were launched in 2001 to address trade issues among WTO members. The WTO launched the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) round of negotiations in 2001. The negotiations focused on agriculture, NAMA, and services. Trade ministers met in Hong Kong in 2005 and aimed to complete the negotiations by 2006. The Congress has oversight on trade promotion authority (TPA) but no direct involvement in the negotiations. The Congress has oversight on trade negotiations, including the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) covering issues like agricultural subsidies and intellectual property rights. Implementing legislation for WTO agreements would require congressional approval. The WTO has ruled against the US in cases involving trade remedy laws, finding non-compliance with WTO rules. The U.S. has faced WTO rulings stating its trade remedy laws do not comply with WTO rules. Compliance may involve administrative changes or congressional action. Failure to comply could lead to WTO sanctions and encourage noncompliance by other countries. The 109th Congress addressed adverse decisions by repealing the Byrd Amendment. The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) of 2000 required the distribution of revenues from antidumping and countervailing duty orders to successful petitioners. The WTO ruled against the US in 2002, leading to tariff sanctions by the EU, Canada, and Japan. The Byrd Amendment was eventually repealed by the 109th Congress in 2005. The Byrd Amendment program continues until September 30, 2007 despite its repeal. The EU has concerns about the delay in its effect, and it is uncertain if U.S. trading partners will maintain sanctions. The 109th Congress also eliminated illegal U.S. cotton subsidies following a WTO ruling in 2005. The Bush Administration is expected to propose new bilateral trade agreements after approving DR-CAFTA and U.S.-Bahrain FTA. The Bush Administration is likely to propose new bilateral and regional free trade agreements in the second session of Congress. Any agreement would require congressional approval, with consultations between the executive branch and Congress. The debate on DR-CAFTA was contentious, with differences along party lines, particularly regarding labor rights protection. The Senate and House passed the implementing legislation, which was signed into law by President Bush in August 2005. The U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was implemented into law in 2005 with minimal opposition. This agreement is part of the Bush Administration's initiative to create a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. Additionally, FTAs with Morocco and Oman were also established in 2006, with negotiations ongoing with the United Arab Emirates. President Bush announced intentions to sign an FTA with Peru in 2006 as well. Peru's participation in regional U.S.-Andean FTA negotiations with Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia has faced challenges. The United States is also in FTA negotiations with Panama, Thailand, SACU members, and South Korea. Debates in the 109th Congress will focus on implementing legislation for completed FTAs and oversight of new FTA negotiations, with concerns raised about the criteria for choosing FTA partner countries. The Bush Administration views FTAs as stepping stones in building regional free trade areas to benefit the U.S. economy and strengthen ties with countries cooperating on national security interests. Economists argue that FTAs can boost economic efficiency but raise concerns about potential impacts on specific sectors like agriculture and textiles. Members of Congress must consider the economic gains and potential drawbacks of increasing access to foreign markets. Concerns about compliance with trade agreements have been raised, particularly with China, as well as other major trading partners like Canada, Japan, and the EU. The \"United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act\" was passed by the House, focusing largely on China. The \"United States Trade Rights Enforcement Act\" (H.R. 3283) was passed by Congress, with a focus on China. Other bills aim to enhance U.S. trade enforcement capabilities. Trade enforcement is a priority for the 109th Congress, which will address issues related to import access and tariff preferences for certain countries. Former communist states are still affected by trade status regulations. The Trade Act of 1974 amendment requires countries to fulfill emigration conditions to maintain normal trade status, which must be renewed annually. Countries like Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Vietnam seek permanent normal trade status. These countries currently have conditional NTR under Jackson-Vanik, with no immediate impact on trade with the US. They are also seeking accession to the WTO, which would require unconditional MFN status from the US. The United States would need to grant unconditional MFN or PNTR to countries seeking WTO accession. Failure to do so would require invoking the WTO provision of \"non-applicability.\" The debate on granting PNTR may involve political, foreign policy, and trade matters, including concerns about Russia's political climate and business environment. The United States is facing concerns about economic reforms in Ukraine and Vietnam, as well as the expiration of trade preference programs like the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Andean Trade Preferences Act (ATPA) in 2006. Legislation to reauthorize these programs may be introduced during the 109th Congress, raising issues about eligibility conditions and the impact on the U.S. economy. The 109th Congress may monitor trade preference programs like the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the African Growth and Opportunity Act, in addition to considering extending preferences to other developing countries. U.S. trade remedy laws, including countervailing duty and antidumping duty laws, aim to alleviate the impact of imports benefiting from foreign subsidies and being sold at less than fair value. The escape clause allows measures to restrict imports sold fairly but at a rapid pace. The Trade Act of 1974 authorizes measures to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic producers. Some Members of Congress question the effectiveness of trade remedy laws and propose changes to protect domestic producers. U.S. trading partners have challenged the legality of these laws in the WTO. The U.S. trade remedy laws, including the 1916 Antidumping Act, have been successfully challenged. Many trading partners view these laws as protectionist and seek tighter rules in WTO negotiations. Congress may oversee and potentially change these laws. U.S. multi-national firms have outsourced production processes for years. U.S. multi-national firms have outsourced production processes to take advantage of lower labor costs in foreign countries. Recent reports show a trend of subcontracting design work for electronics products to offshore firms, raising policy issues for Congress. Should the government discourage outsourcing to keep jobs in the U.S.? The Export Administration Act (EAA) grants the President authority to control exports of dual-use goods and technologies. This includes establishing a licensing mechanism to prevent threats to national security and restricting exports in short supply. The EAA expired in 2001, but export controls have been maintained under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Congress may consider reauthorizing the EAA, with past debates focusing on the level of U.S. control restrictions. The 108th Congress passed the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act (P.L.108-61) imposing sanctions on economic ties with Burma. It includes a provision banning imports from Burma until democracy and human rights are promoted. The debate on export control authority revolves around the level of restrictions needed to prevent dual-use technology from falling into the wrong hands. The Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act (P.L.108-61) imposes sanctions on economic ties with Burma, including a provision banning imports until democracy and human rights are promoted. The import ban has been renewed annually by Congress for three years, with key trading partners like the European Union, Canada, Mexico, China, and Japan having a significant impact on U.S. trade policy. In 2005, these partners accounted for close to 70% of U.S. merchandise trade. The economic relationship between the United States and the European Union is the largest in the world, with $495.1 billion in merchandise trade in 2005. Trade disputes between these partners often raise concerns in Congress and lead to oversight hearings or legislation. In 2005, the EU accounted for $186.3 billion of total U.S. exports and $282.6 billion of total U.S. imports, resulting in a trade deficit of $122.4 billion. U.S.-EU disputes have become more complex, involving competition policy and government regulations. The EU is involved in a WTO case against the U.S. over compliance with a ruling on the Byrd amendment. The EU and U.S. are in a dispute over alleged government subsidies for Boeing and Airbus. Both parties filed complaints with the WTO in 2005, with panels created to study the claims against each company. The U.S. and EU are in a dispute over illegal subsidies to Airbus and Boeing. The EU challenged the U.S. export tax subsidy program, leading to tariff sanctions on U.S. exports. The WTO ruled against the U.S., prompting an appeal. The WTO Appellate Body ruled against the United States in a dispute with the EU over illegal subsidies to Airbus and Boeing. The EU threatened to reimpose tariff-sanctions. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body issued a preliminary decision in favor of the United States and other countries challenging the EU ban on bio-engineered food products. The U.S. and Canada have a strong trading relationship, with the NAFTA agreement superseding the U.S.-Canada FTA. Agricultural trade is a significant point of contention in U.S.-Canada trade. The U.S.-Canada trade relationship faces disputes over agricultural trade, particularly regarding Canadian cattle imports. The U.S. banned Canadian beef in 2003 due to \"mad cow\" disease, but some beef products have since been allowed. Discussions are ongoing to reopen the border for live Canadian beef, with a USDA rule issued in 2005 to permit additional beef imports from Canada. The USDA issued a rule in 2005 to allow more beef imports from Canada, including live cattle under 30 months. U.S. cattlemen opposed the rule, leading to a court ruling and a Senate resolution to block it. Despite opposition, U.S. meat-packers supported the rule, and live cattle imports from Canada began in July 2005. Another issue involved illegal subsidies for Canadian softwood lumber, leading to disputes between U.S. and Canadian lumber producers after a tariff agreement expired in 2001. The U.S. lumber industry filed cases alleging injury from Canadian softwood lumber dumping and subsidies after a tariff agreement expired in 2001. Canada challenged actions in NAFTA and WTO dispute settlement mechanisms. Canada prevailed in NAFTA proceedings, while the U.S. prevailed in WTO proceedings. Mexico is the second largest export market for U.S. exports. Mexico is the second largest export market for U.S. exports, with a trade deficit of $50.1 billion in 2005. Disputes have arisen, such as a 20% tax on soft drinks made with high-fructose syrup, leading to disagreements over NAFTA obligations and WTO rules. Mexico has appealed a WTO decision in 2005 regarding a tax violation. There is an ongoing issue with Mexican trucks transporting goods in the U.S. under NAFTA. In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Mexican trucks to operate in the U.S. Currently, negotiations are underway to address safety concerns. On the other hand, U.S.-China trade has significantly increased, with a trade deficit of $201.6 billion in 2005, the largest bilateral trade deficit for the U.S. China in 2005 had the largest U.S. bilateral trade deficit, surpassing Japan. China is a major source of U.S. imports and holds a significant amount of U.S. Treasury securities. An agreement was reached in 2005 to restrict China's exports of apparel and textiles to the U.S. due to concerns about the trade deficit and its impact on U.S. industries and workers. The House passed H.R. 3283 targeting China's unfair trade practices, including undervaluing the yuan and intellectual property rights concerns. The Senate is considering a bill that would impose tariff surcharges on imports from China if it does not revalue its currency. The U.S.-Japan economic relationship is strong and mutually advantageous, with both countries being important markets for each other's exports and sources of imports. Japan is a significant source of financing for the U.S. national debt and a major investor in the U.S. The U.S. consistently runs trade deficits with Japan, with the deficit reaching $82.5 billion in 2005. The economic relationship between the U.S. and Japan has seen friction in the past due to trade barriers and competition from Japanese industries. Japan has imposed trade barriers and faced competition from Japanese industries, leading to bilateral trade disputes. Japan banned U.S. beef imports in 2003 due to mad cow disease concerns, lifting it for younger cattle in 2005 but reimposing it in 2006. Some Members of Congress considered retaliatory legislation against Japanese imports over the bans. The 109th Congress faces a broad range of trade issues with implications for U.S. trade policy in the long term. Since the 1930s, there has been a movement towards trade liberalization, but measures have also been taken to restrict trade when necessary. Members of Congress will be debating each issue separately, but the cumulative effect of these debates may impact U.S. trade policy overall. The 109th Congress is debating trade issues that will shape U.S. trade policy. The debate is between open trade and restricted trade, not just free trade or protectionism. Developing countries are now major players in global trade, posing challenges for the U.S. like competition from cheaper labor. Questions arise on including labor rights in trade agreements. These issues affect U.S. FTAs, the Doha Development Agenda, and WTO negotiations. The 109th Congress is debating trade issues including FTAs with developing countries, Doha Development Agenda negotiations, trade remedy laws, and concerns about outsourcing and textile imports. There is a debate on whether trade with developing countries is a \"race to the bottom\" or a \"win-win\" proposition. Workers' rights and environmental protection are key points of debate in trade matters, with Congress including them as negotiating objectives in trade promotion authority legislation. Some Members of Congress argue that trade agreements should ensure partners' treatment of workers' rights meets core labor standards or face sanctions. Others believe agreements should only ensure countries enforce their own trade laws. Similar debates exist regarding environmental protection in trade agreements. These debates will likely arise in congressional consideration of DR-CAFTA and other trade agreements with developing countries. The outcome of these debates could impact U.S. trade policy and the international trading system. The international trading system, governed by the WTO, is expanding and becoming more complex. The Congress plays a crucial role in setting the agenda for trade negotiations and influencing U.S. trade policy. The WTO's membership is also growing, with 149 members and more countries in the process of joining. The WTO has 149 members with more countries in the process of joining. Congress can influence U.S. trade policy and entry into the WTO. The international trading system includes regional and bilateral free trade areas based on FTAs, which are expanding. There is debate on whether the WTO and FTAs are mutually reinforcing or in conflict. The Bush Administration views bilateral/regional FTAs as reinforcing trade policy strategy by setting high standards in areas like services, intellectual property, and e-commerce. Critics argue that FTAs undermine the WTO by promoting discriminatory trade treatment and creating confusion with conflicting tariff-reduction schedules and rules of origin. The Bush Administration supports bilateral/regional FTAs to set high standards in trade policy areas. Critics argue that FTAs undermine the WTO by promoting discriminatory trade treatment and creating confusion with conflicting rules. Policymakers suggest focusing on WTO negotiations for more effective U.S. trade policy goals."
