    "content": "The Act titled \"International Child Labor Relief Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Short Title\". The Act includes findings related to child labor. The Congress finds that international conventions recognize the right of children to be protected from economic exploitation and hazardous work, with minimum age requirements for employment. The Forced Labor Convention, in effect since 1930, prohibits most forms of forced labor, including child labor under 18. Despite being widely condemned, child labor is practiced, with an estimated 200-250 million child workers, mostly in developing countries. Around 13.2% of children aged 10-14 were economically active in 1995, with 75% working 6 days a week or more, and 50% working 9 hours a day or more. Despite international and domestic prohibitions, many children in developing countries are forced into debt-bonded and slave labor in hazardous industries. Tens of millions of children are affected, with unreliable statistics due to reluctance from governments to document these illegal activities. According to the International Labor Organization, tens of millions of child slaves are involved in various industries such as agriculture, domestic labor, the sex industry, and more. Children lack legal protection from exploitation in the workplace, which also hinders their access to education. The use of child labor not only affects the children themselves but also denies employment opportunities to millions of adults. The International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) was created in 1992 to combat child labor globally. It involves over 50 countries and aims to prevent child labor through long-term in-country programs overseen by a national steering committee. The International Labor Organization's International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) focuses on preventing child labor, removing children from hazardous work, and providing alternatives as a transitional measure towards eliminating child labor. For fiscal years 1999 through 2001, $30,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Labor to support the International Labor Organization's activities in eliminating child labor."
