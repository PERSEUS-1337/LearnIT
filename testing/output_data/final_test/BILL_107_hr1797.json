    "content": "The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Incentives Act of 2001 allows for a deduction for qualified energy management devices and retrofitted qualified meters under section 179B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under section 179B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a deduction is allowed for qualified energy management devices and retrofitted qualified meters. A qualified energy management device refers to any meter or metering device used by energy suppliers to help consumers manage their electricity or natural gas usage based on price and usage signals. The deduction amount is $30 for each qualified device placed in service during the taxable year, and for retrofitted meters, the deduction is the lesser of $30 or the meter's adjusted basis. The term 'qualified retrofitted meter' refers to an electric energy or natural gas meter modified to manage energy usage in response to price signals. 'Placed in service' means connected to read energy signals daily. The cost of meters includes installation. The cost of the original installation of a retrofitted meter is included in the deduction. Devices installed outside the United States are not qualified for the deduction. The basis of any property is reduced by the deduction allowed under subsection (a). The deduction for depreciation under section 167 is allowed. Conforming amendments include adding expenditures for which a deduction is allowed under section 179B. Amendments also include references to sections 179A and 179B in various sections of the Code. The amendment adds a new paragraph referencing section 179B(d)(1) and amends section 1245(a) by including \"179B,\" after \"179A,\" in certain paragraphs. The table of contents is also updated to include a new item after section 179A. The amendment introduces a deduction for qualified energy management devices and retrofitted meters. The effective date applies to devices placed in service after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, a 3-year applicable recovery period for depreciation of qualified energy management devices is established. The amendment introduces a deduction for qualified energy management devices, specifically meters used by energy suppliers. The amendment allows taxpayers to use energy management devices to monitor and adjust their electricity or natural gas usage based on price signals. The cost of installing such devices is eligible for a deduction. Effective starting from January 1, 2001."
