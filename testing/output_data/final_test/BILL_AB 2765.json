    "title": "AB 2765",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1170.18 of the Penal Code is amended to allow individuals serving felony sentences on November 5, 2014, to petition for resentencing as a misdemeanor under certain conditions. Upon receiving a petition, the court will determine if the petitioner meets the criteria to have their felony sentence recalled and resentenced to a misdemeanor. The court may consider the petitioner's criminal history, including the type of crimes committed and the extent of injury to victims, when deciding on resentencing. The court may also consider the petitioner's disciplinary record and rehabilitation while incarcerated, along with any other relevant evidence, to determine if a new sentence poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A person resentenced under subdivision (b) will receive credit for time served and may be subject to parole for one year, unless the court decides to release them from parole. The resentenced individual will be under parole supervision by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the court's jurisdiction. Resentencing cannot result in a longer term than the original sentence. A person who has completed a felony sentence can apply to have it designated as a misdemeanor. The court will grant the request if criteria are met, without a hearing. This does not apply to those with certain prior convictions. Any petition or application under this section must be filed by November 4, 2022, or with good cause shown. A felony conviction that is resentenced as a misdemeanor will be treated as a misdemeanor for all purposes, except for firearm ownership. If the original sentencing court is unavailable, another judge will be designated. This section does not limit other rights or remedies available to the petitioner. The finality of judgments in cases not covered by this act is not affected. A resentencing hearing under this act is considered a \"post-conviction release proceeding\" under Marsy's Law."
