    "content": "We analyze the convergence of gradient descent for learning a convolutional filter with ReLU activation function. Our analysis is not limited to Gaussian input distributions and shows that gradient descent can learn the filter in polynomial time. This is the first recovery guarantee for non-Gaussian inputs and justifies the two-stage learning rate strategy in deep neural networks. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications like computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Despite the non-convex nature of the objective function, simple first-order algorithms like stochastic gradient descent can successfully train these networks. However, the optimization perspective of convolutional neural networks remains challenging, especially when the input distribution is not constrained. Negative results have shown the difficulty of learning certain neural network structures, suggesting the need for further explanation of the empirical success of SGD in training. The negative results indicate that stronger assumptions on the input distribution are necessary to explain the success of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in training neural networks. Recent research has focused on assuming a standard Gaussian input distribution for SGD to recover neural networks with ReLU activation efficiently. However, these assumptions are limited to Gaussian distributions and cannot be generalized to real-world non-Gaussian distributions. New techniques are required for general input distributions. This paper explores a simple architecture involving a convolution layer, ReLU activation, and average pooling for input samples like images. The text discusses generating patches from input images using known functions, focusing on convolutional filters and ReLU activation. It presents a network architecture where patches are sent to a shared weight vector and then summed to produce the final label. Two conditions for convergence are proposed: high correlation of data and concentration on the direction aligned with the ground truth vector. The text discusses the use of convolutional filters in computer vision, focusing on training data generated from a ground truth vector. It explores conditions for convergence under stochastic gradient descent, emphasizing the learnability of filters in highly correlated input patches. The text discusses the recovery guarantee of randomly initialized gradient-based algorithms for learning filters on non-Gaussian input distribution. It establishes a connection between the smoothness of the input distribution and the convergence rate for filter weights recovery, showing that a smoother input distribution leads to faster convergence. From an optimization perspective, deep learning involves non-convex optimization problems, with a focus on the landscape of neural networks. Theoretical findings support a two-stage learning rate strategy for optimizing neural networks efficiently. However, these results do not directly apply to analyzing the convergence of gradient-based methods for ReLU activated neural networks. Training neural networks can be challenging, but recent research has shown that the \"niceness\" of the target function or input distribution can help optimization algorithms succeed. Some algorithms have been designed to learn neural networks efficiently, but they are specific to certain architectures. Gradient-based algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, have been analyzed for Gaussian input distribution, with studies showing their effectiveness in finding the true weight vector. Recent research has shown that optimization algorithms can succeed in training neural networks when the target function or input distribution is \"nice\". Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of gradient-based algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for Gaussian input distribution. Specific methods have been developed for different architectures, such as recovering true weights of convolution filters and ResNet models using population gradient descent and SGD under certain assumptions. These methods utilize explicit formulas for Gaussian input and tensor approaches to achieve convergence and exact weight recovery in linear time with sufficient samples and good initialization. In this paper, a new approach is proposed for finding the true weights of a neural network using SGD, without relying on known input distributions. The method is based on the definition of ReLU and requires weak smoothness assumptions on the input distribution. The effectiveness of large datasets, two-stage learning rates, and adaptive learning rates is justified using this approach. The paper discusses a one-layer one-neuron model in Section 2 and analyzes the connection between smoothness and convergence rate. Section 3 focuses on the performance of stochastic optimization methods. In Section 3, the paper discusses the performance of gradient descent for learning a convolutional filter. The largest and smallest singular values of a matrix are denoted by \u03bb max (A) and \u03bb min (A) respectively. The gradient function is assumed to be uniformly bounded. Before analyzing the convolutional filter, the special case for k = 1 is examined. The analysis focuses on the special case for k = 1 in learning a convolutional filter. By defining two events and their corresponding second moments, insights for the general case are gained. The population gradient is derived, showing the recovery of w* with certain conditions met. The gradient descent algorithm aims to recover w* with specific assumptions on input distribution and initialization. If the input distribution is degenerate, more data may be needed to avoid convergence issues around saddle points. This aligns with empirical evidence suggesting that additional data can aid in optimization. In practice, more data can aid optimization. The convergence rate of gradient descent depends on quantitative assumptions about the input distribution's smoothness. If the difference between certain quantities is large, the distribution is not smooth; if they are close, it is smooth. The input distribution's smoothness is crucial for optimization. Rotationally invariant distributions like the standard Gaussian have \u03b3(\u03c6) = L(\u03c6), where \u03b3(\u03c6) is the strong convexity parameter and L(\u03c6) is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient. As the angle between vectors w and w* increases, the operator norm of A w,-w* grows smoothly. The operator norm of A w,\u2212w* is bounded for input distributions with bounded probability density. The convergence rate is determined by the initialization w0 and the step size \u03b7t. Theorem 2.2 states that a solution close to w* can be found in a certain number of iterations, with a direct relation between distribution smoothness and convergence rate. The distribution smoothness and convergence rate are related to the step sizes in the optimization process. Choosing adaptive step sizes can improve computational complexity. The two-stage learning rate strategy is justified by the angle between w t and w*. Random initialization with constant success probability is needed for the theorem's initialization requirement. In this section, we generalize ideas from the previous section to analyze the convolutional filter. We define events that divide the input space of each patch and discuss smoothness conditions. The main difference between a simple one-layer one-neuron network and the convolution filter is that two patches may appear in different regions. The text discusses the importance of the interaction between patches Z i and Z j in the convergence of gradient descent. It assumes smooth growth of cross-covariance with respect to the angle. The closeness of patches is represented by L cross, where similar patches have small joint probability density. The result on learning a convolutional filter by gradient descent is presented. The text presents a theorem on learning a convolutional filter by gradient descent, showing linear convergence rate if the initialization satisfies certain conditions. It also discusses how stochastic gradient descent can recover the underlying filter with high probability. The text discusses the convergence rate of learning a convolutional filter using stochastic gradient descent. It emphasizes the importance of robust initialization and the conditions required for linear convergence. The proof involves constructing a martingale and utilizing the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. The text discusses the conditions for linear convergence in learning convolutional filters using stochastic gradient descent. It mentions the importance of robust initialization and the probability density around the decision boundary. The lower bound is monotonically decreasing as a function of closeness between patches, with an upper bound on the probability density around the decision boundary. The text discusses the importance of robust initialization for linear convergence in learning convolutional filters using stochastic gradient descent. It mentions the probability density around the decision boundary and the conditions for obtaining a good initialization with uniformly random sampling. The theorem shows that with proper initialization, the success probability can be boosted close to 1 through random restarts. The text discusses the importance of robust initialization for linear convergence in learning convolutional filters using stochastic gradient descent. It mentions the conditions for obtaining a good initialization with uniformly random sampling and uses simulations to verify theoretical findings on smoothness affecting convergence rates. The input distribution is constructed with different parameters, and the probability density around the decision boundary is centered around specific values. The text discusses the impact of input distribution parameters on convergence rates in learning convolutional filters using stochastic gradient descent. Simulations confirm that smoother distributions lead to faster convergence. Additionally, experiments on real-world data like MNIST show the effectiveness of SGD in learning filters. The text discusses the impact of input distribution parameters on convergence rates in learning convolutional filters using stochastic gradient descent. Better initializations lead to faster convergence rates, as shown in simulations. The study reports relative loss instead of the difference between learned and true filters, as SGD often converges to a filter with near-zero loss. The learned filter and true filter are equivalent due to data lying in a low-dimensional manifold. Linear interpolation between the filters results in similar low loss. Visualizations of true and learned filters show similar patterns. In this paper, the first recovery guarantee of gradient descent algorithm for learning convolution filters with non-Gaussian input distribution is provided. Future directions include extending results to deeper architectures and considering the agnostic setting where labels differ from neural network outputs. In the agnostic setting, the dynamics of gradient descent differ when labels do not match neural network outputs. Analysis of optimization robustness is needed, related to the expressiveness of neural networks. Theorem 2.1 is proven under input distribution assumptions, showing convergence of gradient descent. Theorem 2.2 states that gradient descent will not converge to w = 0 if w < 0. It also shows that if we are converging to a critical point w = w*, then w = w*. The proof relies on the observation that if w - w*^2 < w*^2, then certain conditions are met. Theorem A.1 states that for any unit norm rotational invariant input distribution, \u03b2 = 1. The proof focuses on the plane spanned by w and w* where w* = (1, 0). It concludes that max w,\u03b8(w,w*) \u2264 \u03c6 + sin(\u03c6)/2. The proof of Theorem 3.1 involves examining the gradient and bounding its norm using algebraic manipulations and inequalities. The dynamics of gradient descent are used to combine these bounds. Using gradient descent dynamics, the proof of Theorem 3.2 shows that with proper choice of parameters, the iterates stay close to a specific point. By setting appropriate conditions, a rate of convergence is derived. Lemma A.2 establishes bounds on the iterations to ensure convergence with high probability. The proof of Theorem 3.4 utilizes gradient descent dynamics to show convergence with high probability. By setting conditions and bounds on the iterations, a rate of convergence is derived, ensuring the iterates stay close to a specific point. The failure probability is lower bounded by a specific formula involving the initialization radius and optimization of parameters. The proof of Theorem 3.4 uses gradient descent dynamics to demonstrate convergence with high probability, setting conditions and bounds on iterations for a derived rate of convergence. Additional experimental results show the loss of linear interpolation between learned and ground truth filters, with low loss maintained for all interpolation ratios."
