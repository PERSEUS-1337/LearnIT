    "content": "Peru, located on the northwest coast of South America, is divided by the Andes Mountains. With a population of 25 million, 72% live in urban areas, with over 7 million in Lima. Official languages are Spanish and Quechua, with a diverse population including Indian, mestizo, white, and other groups. Peru has medium human development, with a life expectancy of 68.6 years and an adult literacy rate of 89.2%. GDP per capita in 1999 was $2,611. Peru has extensive poverty with 49% living below the national poverty line. 33% lack access to safe water and 28% lack access to sanitation. There is a significant income distribution gap, with the richest 20% accounting for over half of the nation's income. Peru has a free market economy with reforms implemented by the Fujimori government including privatization and opening to foreign investment. The United States is Peru's largest trading partner. Peru received about $1.6 billion in aid. It is a member of the Andean Community and Latin American Integration Association, sharing duty-free access on many products. Peru signed Free Trade Agreements with Chile and is negotiating with Mexico. Fujimori's control over the legislature and judiciary hindered democratic development, leading to criticism from domestic and international organizations. In 1999 and 2000, Peru was classified by Freedom House as the only country in the hemisphere, besides Cuba, where the press was \"not free.\" The State Department Human Rights report in February 2000 criticized the Fujimori government for poor human rights record. The 2000 elections in Peru were deemed neither free nor fair, leading to Fujimori agreeing to new presidential elections and eventually resigning in November 2000. Valentin Paniagua became Peru's new president under the constitution's rules of succession. Valentin Paniagua became Peru's new president after the resignation of Fujimori. The interim government organized extraordinary elections in April 2001, with a presidential run-off in June. The challenge for the Toledo administration is to maintain stability and strengthen democratic institutions eroded during Fujimori's autocratic rule. Fujimori brought stability by controlling terrorism, drug trafficking, and hyperinflation but also caused constitutional crises with a \"self-coup\" in 1992. In a \"self-coup,\" Fujimori dissolved Congress and took control of the judiciary, overseeing the drafting of a new constitution in 1993. He won a second term in 1995 and attempted to pave the way for a third term, eroding Peru's democratic institutions. The unicameral legislature passed a law in 1996 allowing Fujimori to run again, but the Constitutional Tribunal deemed it unconstitutional in 1997. The Peruvian Congress dismissed three members of the court for their opinion on the Law of Authentic Interpretation, rendering the court unable to act. Civic organizations' effort for a national referendum on a third term was blocked by Congress despite 1.4 million signatures gathered. Fujimori's government withdrew Peru from the Inter-American Court for Human Rights after recommendations to reinstate the dismissed justices and restore the Tribunal's power. Fujimori's government refused to comply with recommendations regarding the Tribunal's power on constitutional issues. In the 2000 elections, Fujimori ran for a third term amid concerns of unfair electoral conditions favoring the incumbent, including manipulation of the judicial system, biased media access, and use of public resources for campaign purposes. The 2000 elections in Peru were marred by unequal media access, bias, and harassment. International observers raised concerns about the fairness of the election campaign. After the first round of elections, there were delays in results, fraud suspicions, and public protests. President Fujimori's victory was not validated by observers, leading to a second round of elections on May 28. Fujimori won 49.8% of the vote, while Alejandro Toledo received 40.31%. As the second round election approached, concerns about the fairness of the election persisted. Monitoring organizations withdrew, and Toledo withdrew as a candidate. Fujimori won with 51.2% of the votes, while almost 30% of ballots were spoiled. The United States pushed for sanctions, but the OAS sent a mission instead. The OAS set up a permanent office in Peru to oversee democratic reforms and mediate dialogue between the government and civic society. Decreased support for Fujimori and corruption scandals led to new elections in April 2001. Opposition parties took over the legislature, leading to investigations into corruption in Fujimori's administration. After facing opposition and being declared \"morally unfit\" for office, President Fujimori resigned from Japan. Congress rejected his resignation, leading to his dismissal and the succession of Valentin Paniagua as the new President of the Congress. Fujimori remains in Japan, claiming Japanese citizenship to avoid extradition sought by the Toledo administration in Peru. The Toledo administration seeks Fujimori's extradition from Japan, but the two countries lack an extradition agreement. Japan has confirmed Fujimori's citizenship, allowing him to stay indefinitely. Valentin Paniagua became President of Peru in November 2000, with a cabinet including Javier Perez de Cuellar. The interim government aimed to ensure free elections, combat political corruption, and prevent an economic downturn. Paniagua's administration lasted until the Toledo administration took over in July 2001. The head of the OAS Electoral Observation Mission praised Paniagua's interim government for addressing corruption and preparing for future governance. The government committed to holding elections on April 8, 2001, with the appointment of Fernando Tuesta to oversee the electoral processes. The United States provided assistance for the elections, ensuring genuine democratic conditions. The NDI and the Carter Center delegation reported strong prospects for genuine democratic elections in Peru in 2001. An independent prosecutor and Congressional commission were investigating widespread corruption under the Fujimori regime, exposed through videotapes showing bribery. Montesinos fled Peru after incriminating videotapes were broadcast, leading to his capture in Venezuela and return to face 168 criminal investigations. The Paniagua administration purged the military of Montesinos associates and took actions against former President Fujimori, including barring him from holding public office for 10 years. The Peruvian Congress voted to bar Fujimori from holding public office for 10 years and stripped him of presidential immunity. Criminal charges were filed against him for abandonment of office and dereliction of duty. Fujimori was investigated for accusations of embezzlement linked to Montesinos, his close associate. Despite their tight-knit relationship, Fujimori denies involvement in Montesinos' illicit activities during his 10-year rule. The interim government stabilized the economy by addressing corruption and demonstrating fiscal discipline, restoring public confidence amid the political crisis. The interim government in Peru stabilized the economy by addressing corruption and demonstrating fiscal discipline. Economic Minister Javier Silva highlighted the national debt, fiscal deficit, and the need for investment. The government aimed to meet fiscal goals agreed upon with the IMF for 2001. The 2001 elections determined the new President and legislature members, with traditional parties discredited. A run-off between the top two presidential candidates was held on June 3, 2001. The run-off election in Peru on June 3, 2001, followed the first round on April 8. Toledo of the Peru Posible party won 36.51% of the vote, Garcia of Partido Aprista Peruano won 25.78%, and Flores of Unidad Nacional party received 24.30%. Flores, a former congress member and attorney, aimed to become the first woman elected president in Latin America based on her own merits. The campaign period leading up to the presidential run-off election in Peru was marked by character attacks between candidates rather than debates on issues. Polls showed public disillusionment with both candidates, with 25% considering casting null ballots. Voting is mandatory in Peru, and 13.8% cast blank or null votes. Election-related violence occurred, with a bomb exploding near the national elections board headquarters, injuring seven people. Pamphlets supporting the Shining Path guerrillas were found near the explosion, but it was premature to attribute the bombing to the group. Since the arrest of its leader in 1992, the Shining Path's activities have been reduced. The two presidential candidates in the run-off were Alejandro Toledo and another candidate who withdrew. Alejandro Toledo won the presidential election in Peru with 53.0% of the vote, defeating Alan Garcia who garnered 46.9%. Toledo, a Stanford University-educated economist and former World Bank adviser, emphasized his humble origins as one of 16 children from a poor indigenous family. Garcia, who served as president from 1985 to 1990, faced criticism for his policies that led to economic chaos in Peru. Despite this, Garcia's political comeback in the election positions him as a powerful opposition voice during Toledo's term. In conceding the race, Garcia pledged to work for unity in pursuing a national agenda. The OAS Electoral Observation Mission praised Peru for organizing free and fair elections. President Alejandro Toledo faces the challenge of enacting economic programs to stimulate growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty in a country where 50% of the population lives in poverty. Peru's underemployment rate has decreased to 33%, with a per capita GDP of $2,101 in 2000. President Toledo promised to create 2.5 million jobs during his term but faced a drop in popularity due to economic impatience. Despite receiving foreign aid for job creation, many Peruvians have doubts about Toledo's character, including allegations of drug use and domestic abuse. Toledo emphasized the need for economic development in Peru, promising to tackle corruption and implement reforms. He appointed the first civilian Defense Minister in Peru's history as part of military reform efforts. Wall Street analysts praised his government's budget, privatization plans, and IMF loan agreement as conditions for economic growth. The first civilian Defense Minister in Peru's history, David Waisman, is focused on tackling corruption and depoliticizing the military. The United States and Peru have had friendly relations, with President Toledo seeking economic support and investment during his visit to Washington in 2001. President Bush visited Peru in 2002, where both leaders pledged to combat terrorism and narcotics trafficking together. President Toledo, along with other South American leaders, urged President Bush to extend the Andean Trade Preference Act. Bush committed to the program and discussed various initiatives with Peru, including financial support for democratic reform and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He also promised to declassify State Department documents for Peru's investigation into corruption. Additionally, Bush and Toledo agreed to a debt-for-nature swap. Peru's foreign debt will be cancelled in exchange for the government's commitment to conserve wildlife reserves. President Toledo, who benefited from the Peace Corps program, announced its re-establishment in Peru after 27 years. President Bush introduced the \"Millennium Challenge Account\" initiative during his Latin America tour, rewarding countries with good governance and investments in education and healthcare. The primary U.S. interest in Peru over the past decade has been the reduction of illicit narcotics production and trafficking. U.S. assistance to Peru through AID was $109.6 million for FY2001, with various funds allocated for different programs. The United States provided $153.2 million in aid to Peru for FY2003, including funds for Food Aid and the Andean Counterdrug Initiative. The U.S. government urged the Fujimori regime to improve human rights, citing violations such as extrajudicial killings and torture by Peru's security forces. Post-Fujimori governments made institutional improvements to address these issues. In August 2001, Peru's Congress voted to remove former President Fujimori's immunity, leading to his indictment on charges of murder and human rights abuses. President Toledo established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past abuses. Peru has been cooperative in counter-narcotics efforts, with a significant reduction in illegal coca leaf production during Fujimori's term. Since Fujimori's downfall, there have been reforms to address corruption and improve civil and political rights. Since the downfall of former President Fujimori, revelations of widespread drug-related corruption in Peru's armed forces have emerged. Fujimori's top military leaders have been jailed for corruption, trafficking arms to Colombian guerrillas, and protecting drug traffickers. Peru remains a major supplier of coca leaf for cocaine. An incident involving the accidental shooting down of a civilian missionary plane by a Peruvian Air Force plane led to the suspension of the aerial interdiction program in Peru and Colombia. Two reports are under review by the White House to determine the program's future. The investigation into the incident involving the accidental shooting down of a civilian missionary plane in Peru and Colombia has led to two reports being reviewed for the future of the aerial interdiction program. Recommendations include closer adherence to aviation rules, better dissemination of information, and new agreements for more oversight and procedures. The Peruvian Foreign Minister believes the program is essential to combat the cocaine industry. The aerial interdiction program in Peru is seen as crucial in combating the cocaine industry, with U.S. aid set to triple to over $150 million in 2002. A Bilateral Peru Riverine Plan was signed to enhance joint operations against narcotics traffickers on rivers, with the U.S. providing $3 million annually for support. Security in Peru and the Andean region was a major concern, with Fujimori dismantling guerrilla insurgency groups but at the cost of human rights violations. Signs of the Shining Path resurfacing as a threat were seen in 2001, leading to a warning for U.S. citizens to avoid Peru. Two bombs exploded in a shopping center near the U.S. Embassy in Lima, killing eight people and injuring dozens. The bombing was linked to leftist guerrilla groups. Peru and Ecuador signed an agreement in 1998 to peacefully resolve their border conflict. The United States supports this peace agreement and promotes economic development in the border region. President Toledo aims to work with Ecuador and Chile to prevent border disputes and prioritize spending on nutrition, health, and education. Congress is concerned about democratic institutions in Peru and conditions aid on respect for those institutions. The development of democratic institutions in Peru is a major concern for Congress, which conditions aid on respect for these institutions, human rights, and free and fair elections. Congress is also concerned about counter-narcotics assistance, trade and investment issues, and the case of American prisoner Lori Berenson in Peru. The Andean Counterdrug Initiative prohibits funding for a Peruvian air interdiction program until certain certifications are made to Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the certification required by the Secretary of State and Director of Central Intelligence before resuming a program, health and safety guidelines for aerial coca fumigation, and funding for USAID economic and social programs in the Andean region. It also mentions concerns about Vladimiro Montesinos and his relationship with U.S. agencies. Vladimiro Montesinos, a top adviser to Fujimori, fled Peru but was captured in Venezuela and faces numerous criminal investigations including money laundering and corruption. He had ties to U.S. agencies, receiving $1 million annually for counter-narcotics assistance from the CIA. U.S. officials were aware of allegations against Montesinos by 1996. Members of the 107th Congress are monitoring the investigations related to Montesinos and U.S. agencies. The U.S. officials were aware of allegations against Montesinos by 1996, including taking protection money from drug traffickers and human rights violations. President Toledo thanked President Bush for U.S. help in Montesinos' arrest and requested assistance in building a case against former President Fujimori. President Bush promised to declassify and deliver State Department documents to the Peruvian legislature. Trade issues in Peru involve an essentially free market economy. Peru has a free market economy with the United States as its largest trading partner. Tariffs on U.S. exports to Peru average 13%, with some agricultural goods facing tariffs as high as 25%. Peru has benefited from the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) for 10 years, which provided duty-free treatment to certain exports. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (H.R. 3009) aims to reauthorize and expand trade preferences for Peru. The Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (H.R. 3009) aims to reauthorize and expand trade preferences for Peru, extending benefits into 2006 and including duty-free treatment for previously excluded products like apparel made from regional fabrics. Peru seeks unlimited access for such exports, which are hindered by weak government institutions according to a U.S. Trade Representative report. President Toledo has acknowledged weaknesses in Peruvian government institutions and promised reform to strengthen them. The government launched a privatization program in 1992, selling off most major state-owned businesses. U.S. companies have actively participated in Peru's privatization process, especially in the mining, energy, and petroleum sectors. Peru has eliminated most barriers to direct investment, guaranteeing national treatment for investors. Peru has eliminated barriers to direct investment, guaranteeing national treatment for investors. However, issues for U.S. investors include exclusion from privatizations and restrictions on ownership of broadcast media. Peru's enforcement of intellectual property rights has been a concern, leading to its inclusion on the U.S. Trade Representative's \"Special 301\" Priority Watch List since 1999. Counterfeiting and piracy of copyrighted goods are widespread in Peru, despite efforts to protect intellectual property rights. American Lori Berenson is serving a life sentence in Peru for treason, convicted in 1996 by a secret military tribunal. Some U.S. Congress members have called for her release or a fair trial, citing Peru's failure to provide a fair public trial as outlined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In August 2000, Peru's highest military court overturned Lori Berenson's conviction for treason, sending her to civilian court for a new trial on lesser charges of \"terrorist collaboration.\" She was convicted in June 2001 and given a 20-year sentence, which was upheld by Peru's Supreme Court in February 2002. Some analysts warn against prioritizing Berenson's pardon in U.S.-Peru relations, fearing it could be seen as interference with the courts or being soft on terrorism. President Bush asked President-elect Toledo to consider humanitarian factors in the case. Toledo told Bush that humanitarian factors should be considered in Lori Berenson's case, but he would not intervene. The White House denied reports of Bush asking for clemency during his trip to Lima. Berenson's case could be recommended to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for a possible release."
