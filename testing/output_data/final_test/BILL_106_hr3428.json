The final rule for the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, published in September 1999, will be implemented by the Secretary of Agriculture at least 30 days after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary shall use Option 1A for pricing Class I milk under the Federal milk marketing orders. The final rule for the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, published in September 1999, will be implemented by the Secretary of Agriculture using Option 1A for pricing Class I milk. Minimum prices announced before the effective date specified shall be the only applicable prices under Federal milk marketing orders. The final rule for the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders, published in September 1999, will be implemented by the Secretary of Agriculture without being subject to certain requirements such as notice and hearing provisions, referendums, and specific policy statements. The Act exempts the Secretary of Agriculture from certain requirements for implementing the final rule on Federal milk marketing orders, including notice and hearing provisions, referendums, and specific policy statements. Further rulemaking is needed to develop pricing methods for Class III and Class IV milk under marketing orders. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to conduct rulemaking to reconsider the Class III and Class IV milk pricing formulas in the final rule for the consolidation and reform of Federal milk marketing orders. On December 1, 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture will finalize new pricing formulas for Class III and Class IV milk, effective on January 1, 2001. If a court order delays implementation, the time period specified for the decision will be extended accordingly. If the Secretary of Agriculture fails to implement new Class III and Class IV milk pricing formulas within the required time period, assessments from milk producers or handlers under section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act cannot be collected until the pricing formulas are implemented. Services provided under that section will not be reduced due to the prohibition against assessments. The final decision on new Class III and Class IV milk pricing formulas will not be subject to congressional review. The cost of marketing order administration and services will be covered through funds available for the Agricultural Marketing Service. SEC. 23. DAIRY FORWARD PRICING PILOT PROGRAM. The Agricultural Adjustment Act is amended to include a Dairy Forward Pricing Pilot Program. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a pilot program allowing milk producers to enter into forward price contracts with handlers. These contracts will satisfy minimum milk price requirements and cover federally regulated milk marketing. The Secretary of Agriculture will establish a pilot program allowing milk producers to enter into forward price contracts with handlers to comply with federally regulated milk marketing for milk not classified as Class I milk and in interstate commerce. Milk handlers can allocate milk receipts to meet Class I milk usage requirements without tracking individual sources. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot program for forward price contracts between milk producers and handlers, ending on December 31, 2004. A study will be done on the impact of these contracts on milk prices, with a report due by April 30, 2002 to Senate and Agriculture committees. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a pilot program for forward price contracts between milk producers and handlers, with a report due by April 30, 2002 to Senate and Agriculture committees.
