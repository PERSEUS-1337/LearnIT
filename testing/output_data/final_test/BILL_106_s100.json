    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1999\". It outlines the structure of the legislation. The Committee on Appropriations of either the House or the Senate must include detailed allocation information in appropriation measures. Failure to do so will result in the measure being recommitted to the Committee. Authorization legislation also requires detailed allocation information. A committee of either the House or the Senate must present new direct spending or targeted tax benefits as separate items in an authorization measure. Failure to comply will result in the measure being recommitted to the committee. Conference reports must also include detailed allocation information. Conference reports must include detailed allocation information for appropriations and authorizations. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the measure being recommitted to the committee. If a House or Senate fails to comply with detailed allocation requirements in a conference report, it will not be allowed to consider the report. If a point of order is sustained in the House, the measure will be sent back to the conference committee. SEC. 3. WAIVERS AND APPEALS. Any provision of section 2 may be waived or suspended in the House or Senate by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members. An affirmative vote of three-fifths shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order. SEC. 4. SEPARATE ENROLLMENT. When an appropriation or authorization measure first passes both Houses of Congress in the same form, the items shall be disaggregated and assigned new bill numbers. Each item will be treated as a separate bill to be considered individually. The remaining parts of the bill will constitute a separate bill to be considered with the other disaggregated bills. The disaggregated bills resulting from the passage of appropriation or authorization measures in Congress will be designated with new bill numbers and placed on the appropriate calendars for consideration. They will be considered and voted on as a group without amendments in both Houses. The bills resulting from appropriation or authorization measures will be voted on as a group without amendments. Debate will be limited to 1 hour, divided equally between majority and minority leaders. Motion to recommit or reconsider the bills is not allowed. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriation measure\" refers to any appropriation bill, while \"authorization measure\" includes provisions for direct spending or targeted tax benefits. \"Direct spending\" is defined as in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. An \"item\" in an appropriations measure can be a numbered section or unnumbered paragraph. The curr_chunk states that an appropriation measure includes numbered sections, unnumbered paragraphs, and allocations of funds, but excludes provisions that do not appropriate funds or direct the President to spend on specific projects. It may rescind existing budget authority or restrict the President's spending authority. The curr_chunk defines \"targeted tax benefit\" as a provision estimated to lose revenue for a specific period by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The curr_chunk discusses periods covered by budget resolutions and tax treatment favoritism towards specific taxpayers. SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Judicial review under this Act allows any Member of Congress to challenge its constitutionality in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The court will consist of a three-judge panel, and both houses of Congress have the right to intervene in the action. The House of Representatives and the Senate have the right to intervene in a legal action without needing a resolution. Orders from the US District Court in DC can be appealed directly to the Supreme Court, with specific timeframes for filing appeals and jurisdictional statements. No single Justice of the Supreme Court can issue a stay on such orders. Expedited Consideration: The District Court for the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court must prioritize and speed up the handling of any cases under this Act. Severability clause: If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 7. TREATMENT OF EMERGENCY SPENDING. Amendments are made to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 regarding emergency appropriations and legislation. OMB is restricted from adjusting discretionary spending limits for statutes designating appropriations as emergency requirements if they include appropriations for other matters. Additionally, OMB cannot designate certain amounts as emergency requirements if the statute contains provisions not designated as such, but it may include provisions reducing direct spending. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new point of order that may reduce direct spending. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new point of order regarding emergencies, prohibiting bills with emergency designations from containing appropriations for other items or matters. Rescissions or reductions in direct spending are allowed for emergencies. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended to include a new point of order regarding emergencies, prohibiting bills with emergency designations from containing appropriations for other items or matters. Rescissions or reductions in direct spending are allowed for emergencies. The President must reduce discretionary spending limits after vetoing appropriations or authorization measures to prevent deficit increases. This reduction also applies to repeals of direct spending or targeted tax benefits. Exceptions exist for certain circumstances. The President must reduce discretionary spending limits after vetoing appropriations or authorization measures to prevent deficit increases. Exceptions exist if the measures become law despite the President's objections, in which case spending limits must be restored to previous levels. SEC. 9. EVALUATION AND SUNSET OF TAX EXPENDITURES. Legislation requires periodic review, reauthorization, and sunset of tax expenditures with the fiscal year 2000 budget. A Federal Government performance plan for assessing tax expenditure effectiveness is mandated starting from fiscal year 2002. Pilot projects for evaluating tax expenditures are also outlined in the legislation. The legislation mandates periodic analysis of tax expenditures' effects on achieving performance goals and their relationship with spending programs. This includes developing a framework for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to conduct these analyses in consultation with relevant authorities. The legislation prohibits the consideration of any bill containing a tax expenditure unless it includes a provision for the expenditure to end within 10 years. If any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected. The Act and its amendments apply to measures passed by Congress from the enactment date to September 30, 2004."
