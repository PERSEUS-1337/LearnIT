Offset regression is commonly used for spatial localization in vision tasks, but struggles due to convolution operation locality and multi-modality of real-world images. Mixture density networks (MDN) are proposed for offset regression to handle various modes efficiently. Experiments on 2D human pose estimation show significant improvement in localization accuracy, with viewpoint variation identified as a key multi-modal factor. Careful initialization of MDN parameters prevents training instabilities, facilitating widespread deployment. The method discussed addresses the challenge of spatial regression in vision tasks, emphasizing the importance of considering viewpoint variation for accurate spatial localization. It can be applied to tasks requiring spatial regression and highlights the multi-modal nature of real-world vision. Training deep neural networks involves various important factors such as weight initialization, learning rate tuning, and activation function selection. It is crucial to formulate the prediction task and loss on a rich representation to effectively utilize learned features. Combining representations at different network depths is essential for handling objects at various scales. While some issues can be addressed with straightforward network architectures, others like offset regression in human pose estimation require more complex solutions. In human pose estimation and instance segmentation, offset regression lacks high spatial precision due to limitations in convolution operations, downsampling, scale variation, appearance variation, clutter, occlusion, and viewpoint. To address this issue, mixture density models are proposed to improve accuracy by revealing important modes and disentangling them. Mixture density models have not been integrated in 2D human pose estimation. Recent work by Zhou et al. (2019a) introduced an offset-based method for dense human pose estimation, object detection, depth estimation, and orientation estimation in a single forward pass. This approach classifies a central region to determine category membership and regresses offsets to spatial points of interest. This eliminates the need for a two-stage top-down model. The use of mixture density networks (MDN) in 2D human pose estimation eliminates the need for a two-stage top-down model. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show that MDN helps disentangle underlying modes for high precision localization tasks. This approach can benefit applications requiring accurate spatial localization. Our approach using mixture density networks (MDN) in 2D human pose estimation offers a new solution for offset regression problems. It is the first to propose a full conditional density estimation model for this task on a large dataset. The method is general and can significantly improve spatial dense prediction tasks, such as identifying small broken elements on electronic boards or surface defects on steel sheets using computer vision. Human pose estimation solutions can be categorized as top-down or bottom-up approaches. In the top-down method, person instances are detected and processed by a single person pose estimator, while region-based detectors are used for scale variation. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach localizes all keypoints using heatmaps and learns embeddings for grouping them into instances. Recent advancements propose classifying spatial locations as corresponding to a person instance or not to overcome limitations of existing models. The method categorizes spatial locations as person instances or not, generating offsets for each keypoint without the need for a detector. While similar to YOLO and SSD models, it lacks high spatial precision and relies on heatmaps for refinement. The motivation is to improve accuracy by offering multiple choice solutions for vision tasks, as shown by previous studies. Mixture density networks are used for prediction and have been applied to human pose estimation in controlled environments. They lack the ability to learn conditional density of outputs for a given input, which is a key feature of mixture models. These models are powerful tools for estimating the density of any distribution. Mixture density networks (MDN) are powerful tools for estimating the density of any distribution. They recover different modes contributing to dataset generation and are easy to interpret. MDNs use neural networks to estimate parameters of a mixture density model, avoiding converging to an average target value. This is crucial in cases where a single Gaussian estimate would fail to capture multiple modes in the distribution. Mixture Density Networks (MDN) fit a neural network to maximize the likelihood of training data, representing the probability density of target values conditioned on input. The model includes mixing coefficients, probability density functions, and common variance for target elements. The conditional density function is often Gaussian but can vary. Human pose estimation aims to localize keypoints for each person in an image with unspecified poses. A mixed bottom-up and top-down approach is used, eliminating the need for an object detector to localize the person instance first. The model predicts if a spatial location is the central pixel of a person and generates offset vectors to keypoint locations. The formulation combines bottom-up and top-down approaches for human pose estimation, enabling advanced techniques like density estimation in a single forward pass through the network. The model generates offset vectors to keypoint locations and uses a mixture density model to learn the probability density of poses conditioned on an input image. The network generates a dense 2D classification map to determine instance centers and predict keypoint locations using offset vectors. Mixture density networks are used to model the offset regression for precise localization in spatial regression tasks. Using mixture density networks, the model predicts offsets for different components based on image conditioning. The density of ground truth offset vectors is determined by the network output function for each component, with shared standard deviation in X and Y dimensions. Scale factors for keypoints are considered to adjust for scale differences. Keypoints are independent within components, but the full model does not assume such independence. The loss for MDN is defined using negative log likelihood and is implemented in a dense fashion independently at each spatial location. Various loss terms are used in addition to MDN, including binary classification loss, keypoint heatmap loss, offset regression loss, and instance size regression loss. The total loss is calculated using a specific equation. The total loss for instance size regression L wh is calculated using a specific equation. Once the network is trained, C determines if a spatial location is the center of a person. MDN components generate offsets conditioned on the input, with the final offset vectors obtained using the maximum component. Experimentation shows that both approaches yield similar performance. Bishop (1994) and Clevert et al. (2015) are referenced in the methodology. Our implementation of the log likelihood uses the LogSumExp function on top of the code base by Zhou et al. (2019a). The network architecture is based on the LargeHG model, with experiments also conducted on SmallHG and XSmallHG variants. Models are trained for 50 epochs with batch size 12 and ADAM optimizer. For visualization and comparison, a version of the model was trained for 150 epochs. The effect of the number of components was analyzed on different architectures. Evaluation results on coco-val show significant improvement with MDN models, especially when using heatmap-based refinement. The MDN model significantly improves detection from keypoint heatmaps, with only two modes retrieved regardless of network size. One mode focuses on frontal view instances, while the other on instances with a backward view. Evaluation results on COCO validation split show good correlation with face components. The evaluations in table 2 show good correlation between face components and visibility. Despite noise in nose annotation, two modes are chosen based on viewpoint. Table 3 provides statistics for coco-val subsets and MDN max component. Table 3 compares dataset subsets and MDN component predictions based on face visibility and viewpoint. Majority of instances are in frontal view, correlating with front view component predictions. Excluding occluded keypoints during training improves performance. Occluded keypoints during training improve performance, as shown by Ye & Kim (2018) for 3D hand pose estimation. Occlusion caused by viewpoint poses a greater challenge to spatial regression models than pose variation. Normalized L2 loss yields superior results compared to L1 loss for offset regression targets. The single component version of the model is equivalent to optimizing the MS COCO OKS scoring metric for human pose estimation. Normalized L2 yields superior results for MDN compared to L1. Fine-grained evaluation shows wrists benefit the most, while torso keypoints show minimal improvement. A hierarchical model is built using binary classification to choose between two MDN models. The goal is to improve binary classification performance with a two-component MDN that learns full conditional probability density. Training MDN models using the LargeHG architecture and testing on COCO test-dev split shows significant improvement in offset regression accuracy. However, performance drops when using left-right flip augmentation at inference time due to the multi-modal prediction model's focus on viewpoint. This contrasts with traditional methods used for object detection and segmentation tasks. Our method using mixture density models (MDNs) improves performance for object detection and segmentation tasks. Despite a slightly lower accuracy compared to the base model, MDN 1 outperforms it under the same training setting. MDNs significantly enhance spatial offset regression accuracy and can handle real-world data for conditional density estimation without mode collapse. Analyzing ground truth data reveals that MDNs capture modes contributing to higher accuracy that single mode models cannot incorporate. In human pose estimation, the viewpoint is found to be the dominant factor over pose variation. Real-world data is multi-modal, emphasizing the need for principled approaches like MDNs to identify key factors in data distribution. Unlike other works using mixture models, our approach with MDNs shows stability with large and diverse datasets, eliminating mode collapse issues. This allows for the use of a standalone multi-hypothesis model in real-world scenarios without relying on an oracle or delaying model selection for downstream tasks. The text discusses the potential to learn finer modes from the dataset, particularly on pose variance, and the importance of analyzing the role of training data diversity. It also mentions the sparsity of revealed modes in deep models and suggests applying density estimation models to more challenging tasks like large vocabulary instance segmentation."
