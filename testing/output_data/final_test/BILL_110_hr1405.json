    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance Act\" or \"Wildlife GAINS Act\". Congress finds that the ongoing panzootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain H5N1 in Asia and Eurasia poses a threat to global human health and the poultry industry. The HPAI virus can cause massive avian die-offs, resulting in significant economic losses. The fatality rate in humans can be 30 to 50 percent or more. Wild birds are known to be a reservoir host for avian influenza viruses worldwide. The 1918 pandemic, which killed over 40,000,000 people worldwide, was caused by an influenza virus that initially jumped from birds to humans. The transmission of avian influenza virus from birds to humans, and its subsequent spread among humans, raises concerns about the current H5N1 strain. Increased surveillance, including on migratory birds, is crucial for controlling avian influenza and preparing for emerging infectious diseases. Proactively detecting threats could greatly improve disease prediction and prevention capabilities. International wildlife health surveillance lacks clear jurisdiction, leading to challenges in sharing real-time data. Continued challenges in sharing real-time data across various agencies on zoonotic threats persist. Surveillance in wild bird populations exposed to the virus is crucial for understanding its spread and protecting human, livestock, and wildlife health. Monitoring wild migratory and resident water birds is essential for identifying influenza virus strains and their role in transmission. Improving surveillance of wildlife health worldwide is crucial for closing gaps in preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. Attention should also be given to other emerging diseases beyond bird flu, as human activities like habitat alteration and wildlife trade contribute to the spread of diseases like HIV. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) moved from chimpanzees to humans through various mechanisms. Factors such as environmental degradation, wildlife handling, consumption, and trade contribute to the spread of zoonotic diseases like avian influenza, SARS, Ebola, and monkey pox. The lack of a comprehensive program to monitor wildlife health globally hinders preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. A program is needed to inform preparedness for a range of emerging infectious disease threats that arise at the interface between wildlife, humans, and domestic animals, not just for H5N1 influenza. The purpose of the program is to inform preparedness for emerging infectious disease threats at the interface between wildlife, humans, and domestic animals. The Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance aims to rapidly detect and report infectious diseases in birds and wildlife worldwide. It uses pathogen information to identify threats to domestic animals, humans, and wildlife. The network provides early warning and guides preparedness efforts globally. The Wildlife Global Animal Information Network aims to provide early warning information for agribiosecurity, surveillance, public health vigilance, and related areas. It also aims to create an open access database for sharing information on pathogens in wild birds and wildlife in real time. Additionally, it aims to protect the health and safety of US citizens abroad and safeguard the economic interests of the US and its partners from threats to health, agriculture, and natural resources. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, working with an eligible organization. The term \"eligible organization\" is defined as a US-based wildlife conservation organization with expertise in tracking diseases in wild birds and wildlife, identifying pathogens like avian influenza and Ebola virus, and managing wildlife surveillance activities. Wildlife GAINS is the Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance established under section 5(a), with partners described in section 5(b). HPAI refers to highly pathogenic avian influenza. The Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance, known as Wildlife GAINS, was established under section 5 for monitoring wildlife. The Administrator will offer a contract to eligible organizations to establish a Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The network will collaborate with Federal and State agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense. The Wildlife Global Animal Information Network for Surveillance will collaborate with various agencies including the Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, State wildlife agencies, multilateral agency partners, and conservation organizations with expertise in wildlife monitoring and surveillance. The eligible organization, in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development, shall manage an international surveillance program to monitor and test for avian influenza and other pathogens in wildlife and marketplaces with intense trade in wild animals. The eligible organization, in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development, shall manage an international surveillance program to monitor and test for avian influenza and other pathogens in wildlife and marketplaces with intense trade in wild animals. This includes using trained professionals to collect samples and data, sending samples to diagnostic centers, and utilizing Wildlife GAINS for disease surveillance, field investigations, training, and research on HPAI and other pathogens in migratory birds and wildlife. The eligible organization, in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development, shall manage an international surveillance program to monitor and test for avian influenza and other pathogens in wildlife. Samples are sent to certified laboratories meeting international standards for pathogen identification and testing. The eligible organization, in coordination with partners, reports findings from pathogen testing to Wildlife GAINS partners. Federal partners must share global pathogen data with the Administrator through the organization. The Administrator investigates local disease outbreaks in wildlife with partners. The organization, in coordination with Wildlife GAINS partners, develops a long-term baseline of regional data on HPAI and pathogens in migratory birds and wildlife. They provide technical assistance for disease prevention programs and regularly share analytical disease findings with Federal partners to combat human and animal diseases. The Administrator, through the eligible organization, manages a database on the Internet containing wildlife population data, movements, and laboratory test results. The database is accessible to Federal agencies, foreign countries, and multilateral institutions. The Administrator manages a database accessible to Federal agencies, foreign countries, and multilateral institutions. The Administrator requests accredited colleges to train Wildlife GAINS network members to monitor wildlife areas and test for pathogens. Authorization of appropriations for $10,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2012 is provided to carry out the Act."
