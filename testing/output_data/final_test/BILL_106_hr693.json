It also mandates a retail price report for meat products and outlines regulations. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act includes mandatory livestock market reporting under SEC. 203A. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act defines key terms related to livestock, including livestock, livestock product, and packer. Livestock refers to cattle, sheep, and swine, whether alive or dead. Livestock product includes products derived from livestock such as boxed beef, boxed lamb, and value-added pork products. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter, processing livestock products, or marketing livestock products in an unmanufactured form. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act defines key terms related to livestock, including cattle, sheep, and swine. A packer is a person involved in buying, processing, or marketing livestock products. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' encompasses various factors like base price, discounts, quality characteristics, and contracts offered by a packer. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the 'Secretary'. Mandatory reporting requirements apply to packers estimated to handle more than five percent of all cattle, sheep, or swine in the United States. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act requires packers in the United States to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock products. Packers must separately report domestic and imported livestock and products as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act mandates packers to report price, volume, and sales terms for domestic and imported livestock products to the Secretary of Agriculture. Noncompliance is prohibited, and the Secretary can verify information accuracy and impose penalties for violations. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act allows the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation by packers. Factors considered for the penalty include the gravity of the offense, the size of the business, and its impact on the packer's ability to continue operating. If there is no appeal or the civil penalty is affirmed, the case may be referred to the attorney general. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act allows the Secretary of Agriculture to impose civil penalties on packers for violations. If the packer fails to pay the penalty, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for recovery in a civil action. The Secretary encourages voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting requirements, and information received is made available to the public in a timely manner. The Livestock Industry Fairness and Enhancement Act allows the Secretary of Agriculture to impose civil penalties on packers for violations. The act also includes provisions for mandatory reporting requirements to protect the confidentiality of parties involved in transactions and proprietary business information. The reporting requirement established by subsection (b) shall expire after three years. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which allowed civil penalties on packers for violations, is repealed. This act also included mandatory reporting requirements to protect confidentiality and proprietary business information, which will expire after three years. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include new reporting and measurement requirements for swine production. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include new reporting requirements for swine production, with definitions provided for terms such as packer, swine, barrow, gilt, and Secretary. The Secretary of Agriculture is tasked with implementing a monthly inventory report for swine located on farms and production areas. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 is amended to include new reporting requirements for swine production in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for implementing a monthly inventory report for swine in leading pork producing States, including details on bred female swine assumed or confirmed pregnant. The monthly report will be available to swine producers, packers, market analysts, researchers, and other relevant entities. The quarterly report will provide data overlap until the monthly report is fully functional. The Secretary will require packers to measure lean content of swine carcasses using trained personnel. Inspection will be conducted by personnel of the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the subsection within six months of enactment. The report will detail packers who have initiated a measurement program voluntarily, the percentage of the industry involved, costs for voluntary and mandatory programs, and potential benefits. Inspection of equipment is also addressed. The packer slaughtering more than five percent of swine in the US must allow inspection of equipment by designated personnel. The Secretary can obtain pricing procedures used by the packer. The Secretary will gather data on barrow and gilt slaughter through valid reporting or sampling procedures. The Secretary will collect data on the division of market slaughter of swine between barrows and gilts, which will be published in a report for swine producers. The report will detail the jurisdiction, duties, and authorities of the Secretary of Agriculture regarding packers, livestock, and livestock products. The Secretary of Agriculture must submit a report to Congress within 90 days of this Act's enactment, detailing their jurisdiction over packers, livestock, and interstate commerce. The report will address burdens on interstate commerce in livestock and livestock products by packers and related laws. The Secretary of Agriculture must report to Congress on issues related to packers, livestock, and interstate commerce. This includes non-competitive pricing arrangements, transparency in contracts, investigations into packers' business practices, and cooperation for enhancing oversight. The Secretary of Agriculture cooperates with other Federal agencies to protect trade and commerce in the livestock industry against unlawful restraints and monopolies. Definitions for \"packer\", \"livestock\", and \"livestock products\" are provided in the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. The Secretary of Agriculture will report to Congress on the ability to provide reliable retail price reports for meat products, including existing price reporting services, data interpretation authorities, and opportunities for cooperation with other agencies. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to issue regulations within 180 days to implement amendments without following certain provisions, and use authority under section 808(2) of title 5, United States Code for Congressional review of agency rulemaking."
