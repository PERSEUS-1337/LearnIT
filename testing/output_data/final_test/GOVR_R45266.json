    "content": "In recent years, Central American migrant families have been arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in large numbers, seeking asylum. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy towards illegal border crossing to deter migration and reduce fraudulent asylum claims. DOJ prosecuted all adult aliens apprehended crossing the border illegally, regardless of asylum status or accompanying children. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has a \"100% prosecution\" policy for illegal border crossings, making it a criminal offense for offenders with prior immigration violations. This policy represents a shift in enforcement rather than a new law. Previous administrations prosecuted illegal crossings less frequently to avoid overwhelming DOJ resources, with exceptions made for families and asylum seekers. Offenders prosecuted by DOJ are detained in federal criminal facilities. The Trump Administration's policy of 100% prosecution for illegal border crossings led to family separations, with children being treated as unaccompanied alien children and transferred to HHS custody. Around 3,000 children, including at least 100 under age 5, may have been separated from their parents. The separations have sparked widespread public attention. The Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy aimed to deter migrants from entering the US illegally, leading to family separations. Immigrant advocates argue that families are fleeing violence and that the policy was cruel and violated human rights. The report reviews the legal authority for prosecuting illegal border crossers and discusses past enforcement policies. It presents various perspectives on the zero tolerance policy. The report discusses the zero tolerance policy and recent congressional activity. It also examines trends in family unit apprehensions at the U.S. Southwest border. Aliens can request admission legally at a port of entry or attempt illegal entry. DHS has authority to detain aliens not legally admitted. The U.S. Border Patrol and DHS have authority to detain and remove aliens not legally admitted, including asylum seekers. Aliens requesting asylum are entitled to an interview to assess the credibility of their claims. Those entering the U.S. illegally face civil and criminal penalties. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes civil penalties for unlawful presence in the U.S. The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes civil and criminal penalties for immigration violations, including illegal entry, eluding examination, fraud, and unlawful reentry. Foreign nationals apprehended for these violations may face removal or prosecution in federal criminal courts. Foreign nationals attempting unauthorized entry into the US between ports of entry are processed by CBP and may face criminal prosecution by DOJ. Apprehended individuals, including children, go through removal proceedings after any criminal prosecution. Removal procedures involve formal hearings in immigration court or expedited removal without hearings. CBP refers apprehended aliens for criminal prosecution if they meet enforcement criteria. Many aliens at the U.S.-Mexico border seek asylum in the United States. CBP refers apprehended aliens for criminal prosecution if they meet enforcement priorities, such as child trafficking or prior felony convictions. Those convicted are transferred to ICE custody for immigration detention and removal proceedings. If not prosecuted, aliens may be returned to their home countries or placed in ICE custody for removal proceedings. Asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border can request asylum either affirmatively or defensively. Arriving aliens who are inadmissible may undergo expedited removal. Those expressing fear of persecution are detained for a \"credible fear\" interview with an asylum officer. The purpose of the interview with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is to determine the validity of an asylum claim for a hearing before an immigration judge. Those with a favorable credible fear determination are placed in formal removal proceedings, while those with an unfavorable determination can request a review by an immigration judge. Aliens in expedited removal without credible fear are promptly deported, and child detention follows different policies than adult detention. The 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA) established a policy for the detention, treatment, and release of all alien children. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 charged ORR with providing temporary care for unaccompanied alien children (UAC). The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 directed DHS to ensure UAC are screened for human trafficking and placed in the least restrictive setting in their best interest. Children referred to ORR are put into formal removal proceedings to request asylum or other relief before an immigration judge. Due to the Flores Settlement Agreement, children with apprehended adults cannot be held in family detention for more than 20 days. Immigration judges determine if an alien is removable and may grant relief. Streamlined removal procedures include expedited removal and reinstatement of removal by DHS. Under expedited removal (INA \u00a7235(b)), aliens lacking proper documentation or committing fraud may be removed without further hearings unless they fear persecution or intend to apply for asylum. ICE and CBP share responsibility for repatriating removable foreign nationals, with CBP handling removals at the border and ICE handling interior and noncontiguous country removals. The Trump Administration's policy on aliens apprehended between ports of entry focused on civil removal proceedings for those not considered enforcement priorities. Those seeking asylum with credible fear were not held in immigration detention unless deemed a public safety risk, instead being placed into removal proceedings and released into the U.S. interior. This \"catch and release\" approach became more common after a federal judge's ruling in 2015 limiting children's detention to 20 days. The \"catch and release\" approach was justified by DHS officials in the past due to limited detention space and high costs. Previous administrations used alternatives to detention to monitor released families. ICE's budget only funds 50,000 beds for over 2 million aliens in removal proceedings. The Trump Administration's zero tolerance policy led to family separations at the border, with DHS referring 21% of illegal border crossers for prosecution from FY2010 to FY2016. Children were separated from adults in cases where family relationships couldn't be verified, or if there were concerns of smuggling, trafficking, or criminal conduct by the parent or legal guardian. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the \"zero tolerance\" policy on April 6, 2018. The Trump Administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions mandated criminal prosecution for all illegal border crossers, including asylum seekers and family units. To enforce this policy, additional prosecutors and immigration judges were deployed to the Southwest border. Children accompanying apprehended family units were processed as unaccompanied alien children and transferred to the custody of ORR. During the implementation of the zero tolerance policy, children were transferred to ORR custody and placed in state-licensed shelters. ORR attempted to place them with relatives or sponsors, or in temporary foster care. With over 100 shelters in 17 states, they were at full capacity, leading to considerations of housing children on DOD installations. Parents convicted of illegal entry were transferred to ICE custody, where they could be reunited with their children in family detention facilities. In FY2017 and FY2018, CBP apprehended alien family units and separated a small percentage due to fraud, medical, or security concerns. The ACLU filed a lawsuit against ICE on behalf of families separated at the Southwest border. The ACLU filed a lawsuit against ICE on behalf of parents separated from their children at the Southwest border. The lawsuit was expanded to a class-action lawsuit in March 2018. The Administration revised the number of families separated, with DHS reporting 2,342 children separated from their parents between May 5 and June 9, 2018. Between May 5 and June 9, children were separated from their parents. DHS reunited 538 children who were never sent to ORR shelters. HHS reported that under 3,000 minor children were separated, including roughly 100 under age 5. As of July 13, 2018, 2,551 children ages 5 to 17 remained separated. President Trump issued an executive order mandating DHS to maintain custody of alien families during immigration proceedings. The Executive Order mandates the Attorney General to prioritize adjudication of detained family cases and seek modification of the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow detained families to stay together. CBP temporarily stopped referring adults with children for prosecution due to lack of family detention space. DOD plans to use military bases to shelter up to 20,000 UAC. The DOD planned to use military bases to shelter up to 20,000 UAC and family units, with conflicting reports on the actual number. Efforts to house apprehended UAC or family units on military installations have not been made. Judge Dana Sabraw issued an injunction against the Administration's practice of separating families, ordering reunification within specific time frames and setting guidelines for border separations. The Trump Administration instructed DHS to provide parents with final orders of removal and two options: to return to their countries with their children or to return alone, leaving the children in the US to apply for asylum. Judge Dolly Gee ruled against a DOJ request on July 9, 2018. The District of California ruled against a DOJ request to modify the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires the release of alien minors in immigration detention after 20 days. ICE officials indicated that parents reunited with their children would be enrolled in an alternative detention program, such as ankle bracelets for electronic monitoring, and then released into the U.S. interior. DOJ maintained its zero tolerance policy. On July 11, 2018, ORR certified a list of 2,654 children in response to an ACLU lawsuit. In response to an ACLU lawsuit, ORR certified 2,654 children in its custody who were separated from their parents. An additional 946 children may have been separated but did not meet the lawsuit's criteria. Judge Sabraw temporarily halted deportations of reunited parents to allow time to understand their legal rights regarding asylum. On July 16, 2018, Jonathan White from the Office of Refugee Resettlement testified about the identification and reunification of separated children. ORR had identified 2,551 separated children, matched 2,480 to their parents, and was conducting background checks to ensure safety. ICE had 1,609 parents in custody, with security checks ongoing. About 300 children had been approved for release to be reunited with their parents as of July 16, 2018. HHS had approved 300 children for release to reunite with parents. A \"Tri-Department Plan\" was submitted on July 18, 2018, outlining steps for reunification. By July 19, 2018, 364 out of 2,551 children had been reunited. 1,607 parents were eligible for reunification, including 719 with deportation orders. 908 parents were not eligible due to criminal backgrounds or needing further evaluation. DHS and HHS proposed new regulations on September 6, 2018, to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement. The Administration proposed regulations to replace the Flores Settlement Agreement, allowing the detention of migrant children and parents until their cases are resolved. Alternative immigration enforcement policies, including family separation, were considered to address the high number of unauthorized migrants at the Southwest border. The proposed policy involved keeping children with parents in immigration detention or separating them and placing them in ORR shelters. The option gained attention as a migrant caravan from Honduras traveled through Central America and Mexico. DHS has not taken action on this proposal yet. Amnesty International reported 6,022 family separations between April and August 2018. Between April 19, 2018, and August 15, 2018, there were 6,022 family separations reported by Amnesty International. Additionally, a total of 7,790 family separations were reported by CBP to CRS or AI, excluding separations between March 1 and April 18, 2018. HHS's OIG stated that the exact number of children separated from parents by immigration authorities remains unknown due to tracking system limitations. According to a report, between July and December 2018, 162 additional children met the criteria to be included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit, while 79 previously included children were not actually separated from a parent. A representative from HHS's OIG testified that DHS was still separating children from parents, albeit at a lower rate than during the zero tolerance policy of May-June 2018. DHS had not provided sufficient information to HHS for appropriate placement within the ORR shelter system. The testimony highlighted that thousands of children were separated before June 26, 2018, with 2,816 children (2,709 ages 5 and above, 107 under age 5) included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit. 2,735 children had been reunited with their parents, while the remaining children had various statuses such as not separated, not reunited due to safety concerns, or not reunited because deported parents allowed the child to stay in the US. Additionally, up to 249 more children not part of the lawsuit were separated after June 27, 2018. Between June 27, 2018, and January 31, 2019, children not included in the Ms. L. v. ICE lawsuit were separated for reasons such as parent criminality or gang affiliation. A report by the Texas Civil Rights Project revealed that a significant number of family separations occurred between minor children and relatives other than parents after the termination of the zero tolerance policy. This data was the first large-scale collection on family separation by a non-governmental organization. According to DHS, minor children apprehended at the border who are accompanied by relatives other than parents or legal guardians must be treated as unaccompanied alien children, separated from their relatives, and turned over to ORR custody. Concerns have been raised that CBP statistics may not fully capture the extent of family separations among apprehended migrants. Perspectives on the zero tolerance policy are divided between those who support greater immigration enforcement and those who oppose it. Those supporting greater immigration enforcement point to recent surges in family unit migration and a backlog of asylum cases straining DHS and DOJ resources. Advocates for immigrants criticize the Administration's treatment of migrants as harsh and counterproductive. DHS argues that their policy enforces existing law to reduce illegal immigration, including separating children from adults in certain circumstances. DHS maintains that it does not have a formal policy of separating parents from children for deterrence purposes, citing a legal obligation to protect the best interests of the child. Family separation is seen as a consequence of stricter enforcement of immigration laws, similar to the family separation that occurs in the U.S. criminal justice system. Attorney General Sessions and DHS Secretary Nielsen defend the zero tolerance policy on illegal border crossings, citing a significant increase in apprehensions. Nielsen emphasizes that the numbers are unacceptable regardless of fluctuations and points to successful results in reducing illegal family border crossings in certain sectors. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defends its family separation policy as a means to reduce illegal border crossings, citing President Trump's Executive Order 13767 on border security. DHS argues that parents using children as shields enrich criminal organizations and exploit limited family detention space. Unpublished intelligence reports show unrelated adults using or trafficking children to avoid immigration detention. Asylum requests have surged, raising concerns of fraudulent claims. DHS maintains well-coordinated family reunification processes and communication mechanisms for separated families. DNA testing is used to confirm familial relationships. Immigrant advocacy organizations criticize family separation, arguing that migrant families are fleeing gang violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They believe requesting asylum is not illegal and DHS should process claims humanely. Critics blame the Administration for creating a debacle with frequent issues. The Administration has faced criticism for its handling of family separation, with reports of lost records and obstacles to reunification. Communication issues between agencies, lack of information on children, and a cumbersome vetting process have been highlighted as challenges. Child welfare professionals warn of lasting psychological harm from family separation, especially for children housed in ORR shelters far from their detained parents. Some question the Administration's ability to prosecute all illegal border crossers without additional funding. Observers question how DOJ and DHS can allocate fiscal resources to enforce the zero tolerance policy without compromising their other missions. Critics argue that the policy hinders CBP from using risk-based strategies, making the Southwest border region less safe. Some in Congress criticize the family separation policy for its cost compared to alternative options like the Family Case Management Program. Immigration advocates criticize the Trump Administration for terminating the Family Case Management Program (FCMP) in 2017, which had a high compliance rate with immigration requirements. They argue that the Administration is restricting access to asylum and reducing asylum claims, raising concerns about human rights and refugee-related international obligations. The United States is facing criticism for its handling of human rights and refugee-related international protocols, with a significant backlog of pending asylum cases and restrictions on asylum grounds. Efforts to limit consideration of gang or domestic violence for asylum could sustain illegal immigration flows from Northern Triangle countries. Bills discussed do not capture all recent legislative developments on family separation. Several bills introduced during the 116th Congress aim to address family separation by granting humanitarian parole, LPR status, and provisions to keep families together at the U.S. border. The REUNITE Act includes provisions for expedited reunification of separated families, while additional funding was allocated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The Appropriations Act, 2019, provided funding for Alternatives to Detention programs, additional ICE staffing for managing immigration cases, and the Family Case Management Program as an alternative to family detention. Legislation directed ICE to prioritize ATD programs for families and asylum seekers, with bills introduced in response to family separation during the zero tolerance policy. Several bills focused on immigration enforcement, such as H.R. 6182, H.R. 6173, and Section 3102 of H.R. 6136. These bills aimed to address family separation, clarify family detention standards, and allow children to remain in DHS custody during parent's criminal prosecution. Similar language was included in an appropriations bill approved by the House Appropriations Committee. H.R. 6204, the Families First Act of 2018, also included asylum reforms and increased funding for family units. In 2018, bills were introduced to prevent family separation at the U.S. border, including the Keep Families Together Act and the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act. Other bills aimed to reunite separated children with their parents and maintain family unity. The Enforce the Law Act and Protect Kids and Parents Act aimed to maintain family unity at the U.S. border by changing laws related to children accompanied by adults. The bills also sought to limit family separations for asylum seekers and improve asylum processing. The context includes increasing apprehensions of Central American families and children amidst historically low total alien apprehensions. Apprehensions at the Southwest border have fluctuated over the past two decades, reaching a low of 327,577 in FY2011 and increasing to 201,497 in the first four months of FY2019. The national origins of apprehended aliens have shifted, with a growing percentage of total apprehensions coming from countries other than Mexico since FY2012. In the first four months of FY2019, \"other-than-Mexicans\" comprised 78% of total alien apprehensions on the Southwest border, with family units and unaccompanied children making up the largest share. Single adult males previously dominated arriving aliens, but family units and unaccompanied children now account for roughly 60% of all apprehended aliens. Family unit apprehensions have increased significantly since FY2012, reaching a peak of 107,212 in FY2018. In FY2019, CBP apprehended 99,901 family units in the first four months, projecting almost 300,000 family unit apprehensions for the year. The composition of family unit apprehensions has shifted from mostly Mexican to mostly El Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran. Apprehensions of unaccompanied alien children peaked in FY2014 and reached 20,123 in the first four months of FY2019. The percentage of unaccompanied alien children from Mexico decreased from 57% in FY2012 to 15% in the first four months of FY2019, while the percentage from Guatemala increased from 3% to 51% over the same period. Similarly, the percentage of apprehended unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle countries increased from 42% to 82% during this time."
