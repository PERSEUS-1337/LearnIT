    "content": "The development of advanced drilling and reservoir stimulation methods has increased gas production from natural gas-rich shale formations in the United States. The Marcellus Shale formation in the northeastern US is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Natural gas prices have significantly dropped in the last five years, mainly due to the development of shale gas, with prices falling from over $13 per MBtu in 2008 to below $4 per MBtu in 2009. The Energy Information Administration expects the Henry Hub spot price for natural gas to average $3.53 per MBtu in 2012. Hub spot price for natural gas is expected to average $3.53 per MBtu in 2012, a decrease from 2011. Increased drilling activity in Pennsylvania and West Virginia indicates strong interest in the Marcellus Shale, potentially leading to a significant increase in natural gas reserves in the United States. Low prices have raised expectations for increased demand, with high-quality gas from the Marcellus formation requiring minimal treatment for transmission. The Millennium Pipeline project in New York could support increased shale gas production to meet regional needs. West Virginia may encounter obstacles in this regard. Gas producers in Pennsylvania and West Virginia face challenges in developing pipeline capacity due to rugged terrain. Nearly 60,000 miles of gathering pipelines are needed in the Marcellus area. Directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing are crucial for exploiting shale gas resources, with recent advancements allowing for industrial-scale application in unconventional gas shales. Gas development has expanded into areas with rugged topography and dense vegetation. Shale gas development in the Marcellus region has expanded into areas with rugged topography, dense vegetation, and higher population densities. Concerns include environmental safety, protection of water resources, and state regulations governing well construction and operation. Water supply is a key issue due to the large amounts needed for hydraulic fracturing, with contamination being a major concern. Federal laws also play a role in regulating gas production in the region. The Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act can apply to activities like wastewater disposal. Concerns about Marcellus Shale development include potential harm to human health and the environment, such as groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Bills in Congress aim to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. The potential contamination of water wells from surface activities related to gas production, such as spills, leaky impoundments, and equipment failure, poses a risk to nearby water sources. Improper treatment and disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing may harm local water supplies and damage public wastewater treatment plants. Gas producers argue that proper management practices are in place to address these concerns. Gas producers emphasize the importance of good well design and construction to prevent well-water contamination incidents, regardless of drilling techniques. Contamination incidents have been reported as Marcellus Shale development expands, with methane migrating to private drinking water wells in some cases. State regulators have issued violations to a drilling company for failing to prevent gas from entering fresh groundwater due to faulty well construction. Identifying the cause of contamination from gas development can be challenging due to various factors, including complex hydrogeologic processes, lack of baseline testing, and confidentiality of fracturing compounds. While major oil and gas producing states deny a direct link between hydraulic fracturing and groundwater contamination, incidents have been reported. The report discusses the Marcellus Shale resource, technical methods for its development, groundwater and surface water issues, federal and state regulatory authorities, recent developments, and pending federal legislation related to oil and gas development. Unconventional gas shales are organic-rich sedimentary rocks that serve as both the source and reservoir for natural gas. Gas in the shales occupies pore spaces and is adsorbed on organic matter surfaces due to their small pore sizes, making them relatively impermeable to gas flow. The United States has numerous major gas shale basins, with a resource base of 1,836 trillion cubic-feet. Shale gas accounts for roughly one-third of this base, with the Marcellus Shale alone estimated to hold 84 tcf of natural gas. U.S. dry natural gas production has significantly increased in recent years, with unconventional resources like gas shales playing a key role. In 2009, the U.S. became the world's largest natural gas producer for the first time since. States reclaimed the top spot as the world's largest natural gas producer, with shale gas production forecasted to grow significantly by 2035. The Marcellus Shale, a sedimentary rock formation, is a key region for gas production in the Appalachian basin. The Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian basin ranges from 50 to 250 feet thick, potentially up to 900 feet in some areas. Thicker shales with more organic material yield economically desirable gas. Shale in northeast Pennsylvania and southeast New York produces dry natural gas, while shale in western New York and western Pennsylvania produces wetter gas with natural gas liquids that need to be removed. The Utica Shale, located beneath the Marcellus Shale, is an organic-rich black shale source rock. The Utica Shale is an organic-rich black shale source rock underlying the Marcellus Shale, containing both conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources. The majority of oil and gas in this petroleum system is found in central and eastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, and western New York. It is estimated to hold 1.8 to 2.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. USGS has identified three principal groundwater environments overlying the Marcellus Shale. The aquifer systems in Pennsylvania and eastern West Virginia, as well as Mississippian sandstone aquifers in northern Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio, are important sources of fresh water for rural communities. These aquifers are typically closer to the surface compared to the Marcellus Shale, with groundwater wells reaching only several hundred feet in depth. Siltstones and shales act as barriers to fluid flow between the aquifers and the Marcellus Shale, with intervening layers of rocks several thousand feet thick in some areas. The Marcellus Shale is deeper in the eastern and northern areas, while shallower in the western and southern regions. Concerns exist about its impact on overlying aquifers. Estimates suggest a significant natural gas resource potential, with the possibility of up to 12 tcf. Hydraulic fracturing was not yet used in 2005 for gas recovery from shale. The Marcellus Shale has significant natural gas resource potential, with estimates of up to 12 tcf. In 2008, geoscience professors raised the resource potential to 516 tcf based on production data using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. EIA estimated that ultimate recovery from leased areas could reach 177.9 tcf and undeveloped areas could reach 232.4 tcf, totaling 410.3 tcf. A Marcellus well may produce 2.3 bcf of natural gas, with potential earnings of $9 million per well. USGS revised its assessment in 2011 to include more detailed geologic studies of the Marcellus Shale. USGS revised its assessment of the Marcellus Shale in 2011, increasing the mean undiscovered estimate to slightly more than 84 tcf. This new estimate is higher than the 2008 assessment but lower than EIA's 2011 estimate, leading to controversy. Both EIA and USGS have revised their technically recoverable resource estimates for the Marcellus Shale based on new data. USGS now estimates the TRR to be 84 tcf with a 90% confidence level ranging from 43 to 144 tcf, while EIA decreased its estimate to 141 tcf from 410 tcf. The EIA revised its estimate for the Marcellus Shale from 410 tcf to 141 tcf based on more recent data. The northeast region consumes about 4 tcf of natural gas, with New York leading in consumption. The region produces roughly 580 bcf of natural gas, with Pennsylvania and West Virginia contributing the most. The region consumes seven times more natural gas than it produces. The Marcellus Shale in the northeast region has an estimated 410.3 tcf of natural gas, which is seven times more than the current production. This gas could supply the region for the century at current consumption rates. The USGS estimate of 84 tcf could meet the region's demand for over 21 years. The existing pipeline infrastructure in the region is sufficient to take advantage of Marcellus production. Several long-distance natural gas transmission pipelines supply the region from the Southeast into Virginia and West Virginia, and from the Midwest into West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Canadian imports come into the region through New York, Maine, and New Hampshire. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies also enter the region through import terminals in Massachusetts, Maryland, and New Brunswick, Canada. Gas producers would need to construct an extensive network of gathering pipelines and supporting infrastructure to move the gas from the well fields to the transmission pipelines, which may constrain development in some parts of the Marcellus region. Well drilling technology has advanced over the last 50 years, with the ability to direct the drill bit horizontally being a recent important advance. Directional drilling, in combination with hydraulic fracturing, has made it feasible to develop unconventional gas and oil formations like the Marcellus Shale. This technology offers advantages over vertical drilling by increasing the surface area for gas flow and allowing multiple wells to be drilled from a single pad, reducing costs and environmental impact. However, additional methods like inducing fractures may be needed to significantly improve gas production in tight formations like shale. Before stimulation can take place, the well must be cased, cemented, and completed. Hydraulic fracturing, combined with directional drilling, has revolutionized the production of unconventional gas shales like the Marcellus. Well casings prevent collapse and water infiltration while conducting produced fluids to the surface. During drilling, casing is installed to conduct reservoir fluids to the surface and prevent infiltration into aquifers. Properly designed casing extends to the water table, filled with expanding cement to protect groundwater from contamination. After drilling and casing to the \"pay zone\" where gas or oil is produced, a cement evaluation log is conducted to ensure proper cement thickness and prevent fluid leakage. Once confirmed, the well is ready for completion with a perforating tool used to puncture the casing. The well is ready for completion with a perforating tool that punctures the casing sidewall at the pay zone. Good well construction is crucial for protecting groundwater during gas production. Hydraulic fracturing is often necessary to stimulate gas flow in low permeability shale formations like the Marcellus Shale. Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as \"frac\" jobs, involves injecting water, sand, and chemicals under high pressure into low-permeability geologic formations like shale to extract oil or gas. The process requires specialized equipment and can take up to a week to complete. Hydraulic fracturing, or \"frac\" jobs, are necessary for shale gas wells to produce significant amounts of gas. The process involves pumping fluids and proppant down the wellbore at high pressures to crack the shale, allowing gas to flow. Different types of fracturing fluids are used depending on the depth and pressure of the shale. In vertical wells, the fracture height is determined by the length of the perforated casing section within the formation. Horizontal wells have fracture height and depth based on shale thickness and rock properties to contain the fracture. Shallow frac treatments can lead to undesirable horizontally oriented fractures, with state regulations setting minimum depths. The Marcellus formation's depth generally prevents fractures from reaching groundwater aquifers, but geology is not always predictable. Fracturing fluid functions by opening and propping open fractures to create paths for natural gas to reach the wellbore. Proppants like silica sands and ceramic beads are commonly used. Water-based fluids are mostly water with additives, while acid-based fluids use hydrochloric acid to dissolve carbonate formations. Gelling agents adjust fluid viscosity. The most common additives for adjusting frac fluid viscosity are oxidizers like ammonium, potassium, and sodium peroxydisulfate. Enzyme breakers and silica flour are also used. Biocides prevent polymer degradation by bacteria, while stabilizers like methanol and sodium thiosulfate are added to prevent gel degradation at high temperatures. Service companies tailor the proportion of additives to each well's unique conditions. Oil-based fluids are used in hydrocarbon formations susceptible to water damage, primarily in coal-bed methane frac jobs. States have adopted new disclosure rules for chemicals used in well stimulation. Fracture treatments are planned, monitored, and adjusted operations that proceed in stages. Tests are performed on the well before treatment to ensure competency. The company conducts tests on the well to assess its ability to withstand hydraulic pressures from fracture pumps. The well is cleaned with hydrochloric acid before being fractured in separate zones within the shale using high-pressure fracking fluid. Each zone is treated with fluid and proppant to create multiple fractures, with the process lasting up to an hour. Multiple treatments are often needed for Marcellus wells. The high-pressure fracking process involves multiple treatments to create fractures in each zone of the horizontal wells, consuming millions of gallons of water. The injected fluid opens and propagates fractures in the shale, with a high volume remaining in the fracture that needs to be pumped out during the \"flowback\" treatment. The recovered water may contain dissolved salts and frac chemicals. The flowback water from shale gas wells may contain high levels of salts and chemicals, requiring disposal through deep well injection or treatment. The geologic environment of the Marcellus Shale prevents gas migration into fresh water aquifers, but the drilling and hydraulic fracturing process poses a risk of groundwater contamination. The drilling and completion practices for well casing aim to prevent groundwater contamination by sealing off the aquifer interval. Proper casing procedures are essential to protect groundwater resources in areas like the Marcellus Shale region. Thousands of oil and gas wells in various states require similar well drilling and casing techniques to safeguard against contamination. Properly designed and constructed wells are essential to protect groundwater resources in the Marcellus Shale region. Well casing must be properly cemented to prevent leakage of fluids or gas from gas-bearing shale formations, which could contaminate drinking water aquifers. Sound well construction and operating practices are crucial to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination. Hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region raises concerns about groundwater contamination from introducing contaminants into aquifers. The process aims to create or extend fractures in the shale, potentially linking it to aquifers. However, the vertical distance and rock layers between the shale and aquifers act as barriers to migration. Developing shallow portions of the Marcellus Shale could impact this barrier. Developing shallow portions of the Marcellus Shale could pose a risk to groundwater as it may shorten the distance to drinking water aquifers. Engineers conducting hydraulic fracturing aim to contain fractures within the gas-producing shale to prevent saline fluids from entering and hampering gas production. While there is a remote possibility of fluids leaking into aquifers, it would require additional pathways like leaky wells and casings. Multiple hydraulic fracture treatments may be needed for a single well in the Marcellus Shale region, with injections ranging from 3 to 5 million. After hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus region, typically less than 35% of injected fluids are recovered at the surface. Improper disposal of recovered fluids could contaminate shallow groundwater, posing a risk to aquifer systems in northern Pennsylvania and southern areas. Underground injection may not always be a feasible option in this region. Aquifer systems in northern Pennsylvania and southern New York, particularly shallow sand and gravel deposits, are at risk from leaky surface impoundments or careless disposal. New York designates these aquifers as \"primary\" or \"principal\" due to their high productivity as water sources. Improper disposal could lead to leaks that may be worsened by poorly constructed drinking water wells nearby. Poorly constructed drinking water wells near natural gas operations could exacerbate surface contamination risks. These wells are often shallower, may lack proper casing, and have less oversight than gas wells. If not properly constructed, contaminated water could flow into the well, compromising water quality and potentially contaminating the aquifer. Nearby gas drilling activities could further increase the risk of contamination through leaky impoundments or careless disposal of drilling fluids. Close proximity of water and gas wells adds to the complexity of the situation. The possibility of water well contamination from surface waters unrelated to drilling activities near natural gas wells can lead to disputes over responsibility. Resolving such disputes may require hydrogeological and chemical analysis, often at considerable expense. Regulation of natural gas development in the Marcellus Shale is subject to state and federal environmental laws. The large volumes of water needed for shale drilling and hydraulic fracturing, along with wastewater disposal, raise water quality and quantity concerns that trigger regulatory attention. State agencies handle permitting, inspection, and enforcement activities for gas development, with federal laws also being administered by states. Key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act, along with state requirements, are reviewed. Hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region involves injecting water, proppants, and chemicals at high pressures to create fractures for natural gas flow. Projects use millions of gallons of water, sand, and chemicals per well, raising concerns about water sources and local supplies. Injected fluids used in hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region can result in flowback, which contains proppant, chemical residues, metals, and trace amounts of radioactive elements. Approximately 9% to 35% of the injected water returns to the surface as flowback. The flowback is stored on-site before disposal or reuse, with the possibility of being retained in tanks or lined retention ponds. Flowback typically occurs in the first few weeks after the frac treatment, but can continue for several months, gradually slowing over time. Wastewater management in the Marcellus Shale region is crucial, especially in states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and eastern Ohio where hydraulic fracturing for natural gas drilling occurs. Companies are using on-site treatment processes like evaporation, distillation, oxidation, and membrane filtration to recycle flowback fluids. This allows for reuse until the wastewater reaches high concentrations of total dissolved solids, at which point it must be disposed of. On-site treatment technologies like distillation, oxidation, and membrane filtration are used for recycling and reusing water in the Marcellus Shale region. These technologies can return 70%-80% of water to potable standards, with the remaining 20%-30% being brackish brine water. Factors like available power and final water quality determine treatment selection. Flowback water and production brine not reused require proper disposal through underground injection or treatment and surface discharge. In the Marcellus Shale region, on-site treatment technologies are used for recycling water, with 70%-80% returned to potable standards. The remaining 20%-30% is brackish brine water that requires proper disposal through underground injection or surface discharge, depending on water quality standards and geology limitations. Direct discharge of untreated flowback and formation brine water is rarely possible due to contaminants and salinity. Flowback is typically prevented from being discharged into surface water without further treatment. The wastewater is often transferred off-site to an industrial treatment facility or municipal sewage treatment plant for processing. The operator of the treatment facility assumes responsibility for treating the waste before discharging it into nearby water sources. Chemical frac additives and produced brine in flowback can pose operational challenges for treatment facilities, potentially causing harm to essential biota and violating water quality standards if not adequately treated. The potential impact of wastewater discharge from natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region on water quality standards, particularly concerning salinity levels and contaminants like bromides and salts. This could lead to the formation of carcinogenic disinfection byproducts in drinking water treatment processes. Pennsylvania regulators have highlighted the significant wastewater management implications due to the large scale of drilling activities in the region. The Marcellus Shale region's natural gas drilling could lead to substantial wastewater return flows and treatment needs due to the high TDS wastes produced by thousands of gas wells. The potential pollution effects from these loads are significant, with concerns about the need for re-fracking in the future. The Marcellus Shale region's natural gas drilling may require re-fracking in the future, leading to uncertainty in wastewater treatment and disposal. Conventional POTW technology is ineffective in treating high-TDS wastewater from gas extraction operations, necessitating evaporation/distillation technology not typically found in municipal sewage treatment plants. Regulatory authorities must ensure permits limit contaminants harmful to aquatic life in streams and rivers under the Clean Water Act. The EPA sets limitations and standards for wastewater treatment facilities to prevent harm to aquatic life in streams and rivers. States in the Marcellus Shale region oversee compliance with Clean Water Act permits for facilities handling fracking wastewater. Pennsylvania's EPA collaboration includes requiring sampling for radionuclides and evaluating compliance with CWA regulations. In Pennsylvania, regulators are monitoring treatment facilities and water systems for radionuclides, TDS, bromide, chloride, and other substances. High TDS levels were found in water samples from the mid-Monongahela River valley in 2008, attributed to wastewater deliveries from gas drilling sites. This had environmental impacts like killing microorganisms and degrading soil. State officials ordered nine sewage treatment plants to address the issue. State officials in Pennsylvania ordered sewage treatment plants to reduce gas well drilling water volumes with high TDS levels. Analysis showed abandoned mines, not drilling wastewater, were the main source of high TDS. Concerns remain about the capacity of surface waters to handle projected gas well wastewater volumes. New standards were issued in 2010 for facilities treating oil and gas wastewater. The 2010 standards set strict discharge limits for TDS, chlorides, barium, and strontium to protect aquatic life by promoting water reuse. Pennsylvania and federal regulators took steps in 2011 to end the practice of sending fracking wastewater to POTWs due to concerns about inadequate waste handling. In response to concerns about elevated bromide levels in rivers, state regulators asked drilling operators to stop sending Marcellus Shale wastewater to POTWs. EPA requested information from six natural gas drillers on wastewater disposal methods, with companies planning to recycle 90% of produced water in Pennsylvania. Marcellus Shale operators have ceased sending wastewater to state POTWs, with West Virginia also addressing wastewater concerns. West Virginia has recognized wastewater disposal as a significant challenge for drilling operations. The state is considering underground injection as the best option, but only has two permitted commercial injection wells. There are concerns about the capacity of municipal wastewater treatment facilities to handle the waste. In 2009, the state proposed changes to drilling rules and industry guidance to address water issues, but faced criticism for not adequately addressing the concerns. In response to criticism, New York State passed the Horizontal Well Act in December 2011, requiring drillers to disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluids and provide water management plans. The state has imposed a moratorium on processing permits for Marcellus Shale wells while evaluating environmental impacts. The state of New York has imposed a moratorium on processing permits for Marcellus Shale wells under the existing Generic Environmental Impact Statement (SGEIS). The Department of Environmental Conservation released a Revised Draft Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (RDSGEIS) with recommendations to allow natural gas development while banning drilling in sensitive areas. The revised draft SGEIS would allow POTWs to accept flowback water under certain conditions. In October 2011, EPA started developing technology-based standards for shale gas wastewaters to be managed by POTWs. EPA plans to propose shale gas wastewater standards in 2014. Runoff from oil and gas drilling sites after rainstorms can cause water pollution by transporting sediment to nearby water bodies. The Clean Water Act regulates stormwater discharges from industrial and municipal facilities, requiring pollution prevention plans and treatment of runoff. Fracking fluid chemicals and wastewater leakage are also concerns. The federal Clean Water Act exempts the oil and gas industry from stormwater management regulations, allowing for potential contamination of soil, air, and water resources. States can still enforce erosion and sedimentation controls at well sites. Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia, and the Delaware River Basin Commission have requirements for erosion and sedimentation controls at well sites, with varying thresholds for site disturbance areas. The Marcellus Shale development raises concerns about potential water quality issues. The Marcellus Shale development raises concerns about potential water quality issues, particularly regarding the contamination of groundwater and drinking water wells from hydraulic fracturing operations. The EPA is conducting research on the impact of fracturing on potable aquifers and drinking water supplies, with initial results expected in 2012 and a final report in 2014. Three case studies in Pennsylvania are being conducted to investigate drinking water contamination incidents and assess the adequacy of state oil and gas laws in protecting groundwater. The adequacy of state oil and gas laws to protect groundwater and drinking water wells in unconventional gas and oil development, particularly with hydraulic fracturing, has been questioned. The Ground Water Protection Council found that state regulations generally cover permitting, well construction, closure, and waste fluid management, but few explicitly address hydraulic fracturing until recently. The Ground Water Protection Council noted that state regulations cover various aspects of oil and gas development, including drilling, construction, pressure testing, blowout prevention, and reporting to protect fresh water aquifers. They recommended the development of best management practices for hydraulic fracturing to ensure groundwater protection rules are consistent and effective. In Pennsylvania, groundwater contamination was attributed to defective casing and cementing of shale gas wells, leading to updated oil and gas regulations. Regulations governing well construction and water supply replacement were largely unchanged since 1989 until recent advances in drilling technology for extracting natural gas from the Marcellus Shale. The Department updated well construction requirements in response to incidents of contaminated drinking water from Marcellus Shale wells. The revised regulations address the need for proper casing, cementing, gas migration response, routine inspections, and hydraulic fracturing reporting. The final-form rulemaking includes operational, monitoring, plugging, water supply replacement, and hydraulic fracturing reporting requirements. It also specifies material and performance testing for well casing, cementing, and operation. New provisions mandate routine well inspections and outline actions for gas migration incidents. Ohio legislators revised oil and gas laws in 2010 to add hydraulic fracturing record submission and reporting requirements. Other states are also updating regulations for unconventional oil and gas development challenges. The law expanded well construction requirements to protect underground sources of drinking water. New regulatory regimes for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are being developed in New York State. West Virginia enacted the Horizontal Well Act in December 2011, imposing new conditions on permits to protect water resources. Operators must provide regulators with well-casing plans and drilling-depth plans, while also increasing permit fees for more state inspectors. Minimum distances from water wells and public water supplies are specified for horizontal wells. The law specifies minimum distances horizontal wells must be from water wells, public water supplies, streams, wetlands, etc. Wastewater management during natural gas production is a major water quality issue related to Marcellus Shale development. Underground injection is the most common method for wastewater disposal in the oil and gas industry, especially in regions like northeastern Pennsylvania where geology limits other disposal options. The increased use of underground injection for wastewater disposal has raised concerns about EPA regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The federal underground injection control program, regulated by the EPA's UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act, oversees the disposal of flowback and wastewater from gas wells to protect underground sources of drinking water. While hydraulic fracturing fluids are exempt, wastewater from oil and gas development is subject to regulation. EPA rules mandate minimum distances for wells and require state UIC programs to be established. The EPA's UIC program regulates underground injection wells to prevent endangering drinking water sources. There are six classes of wells with specific criteria for protecting underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used for disposing of brines and fluids from oil and gas production. Regulations include site characterization, well construction, monitoring, and public participation. The Safe Drinking Water Act authorizes EPA to delegate enforcement authority for UIC programs to states, ensuring underground injection is authorized by permits. States can demonstrate effectiveness in preventing endangerment of drinking water for Class II injection wells. This allows for flexibility in implementing UIC programs. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows states to implement their own program requirements for underground injection control (UIC) programs, granting them flexibility. States with primacy must enforce regulations, or EPA will step in. Emergency powers are granted to the EPA administrator to protect public water systems. Maryland, Ohio, and West Virginia have primacy in the Marcellus region for their UIC programs. Ohio and West Virginia have primacy for Class II wells, while Maryland follows EPA regulations. In New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, EPA directly implements the entire UIC program for shale gas wastewater disposal through deep well injection. Class II wells re-inject brine, a saline fluid with toxic metals and radioactive substances, back into their source formations to prevent contamination of land and water. States have adopted rules to limit or prohibit saline water disposal to surface water and land. The disposal of saline water from shale gas wells remains challenging and costly, with injection being the preferred method where geology permits. The amount of water produced by shale gas wells varies across the Marcellus Shale region. Shale formations produce less water than traditional oil and gas fields, but the large amounts of water used for hydraulic fracturing present disposal challenges. Reinjecting wastewater into the shale formation may not be feasible in many locations. Injection of wastewater into the Cambrian Mt. Simon Sandstone beneath the Marcellus Shale is feasible in Ohio, where deep well injection is the preferred method for disposal. The geology in Northeastern Pennsylvania is not suitable for injection, leading to challenges in wastewater disposal in that region. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has permitted 184 Class II brine disposal wells, with additional permit requests pending. Since Marcellus Shale gas development began, the number of permitted Class II disposal wells in West Virginia has increased to 13. New York has six active disposal wells, with operators submitting over 60 permit applications before drilling permits were halted in 2008. Pennsylvania has six operating disposal wells, with two more approved by the EPA but under appeal due to limited surface water discharges. Interest in deep well injection is growing in Pennsylvania due to these restrictions. State laws also regulate water quality in Marcellus Shale development. In New York, aspects of gas development require a SPDES permit, which is a state-approved version of the federal NPDES permit program. SPDES covers discharges to both surface water and groundwater, unlike NPDES. The state must ensure that injection will not harm groundwater for hydraulic fracturing to be exempt from the SPDES permit requirement. The SPDES permit in New York covers disposal of fluids from gas wells and treatment facilities for flowback water, ensuring compliance with state water quality standards. The SEQRA requires environmental impact statements for drilling activities, with the DEC evaluating potential impacts for over 15 years. The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) released the Revised Draft Supplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (RDSGEIS) for public comment on high-volume hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region. Permit applications for gas wells using HVHF will not be processed until a final SGEIS is completed. The RDSGEIS excludes certain areas like New York City and Syracuse watersheds, primary aquifers, state lands, floodplains, public drinking water supplies, and private water wells within 500 feet. The RDSGEIS excludes certain areas like New York City and Syracuse watersheds, primary aquifers, state lands, floodplains, public drinking water supplies, and private water wells within 500 feet. HVHF operations in shallow portions of shale formations, where the top of the target fracture zone is shallower than 2,000 feet below the surface or less than 1,000 feet below the base of a known fresh water supply, require site-specific environmental assessments. Maryland is also not processing permit applications for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the state's portion of the Marcellus Shale. Officials in Pennsylvania are planning to study \"best practice\" standards for drilling and fracking before permitting exploratory wells in the Marcellus Shale. Oil and gas exploration in the state is regulated under various state laws, including the Clean Streams Law, the Solid Waste Management Act, and the Water Resources Planning Act. These laws govern waste discharges, mining impacts on water quality, and stormwater runoff from oil and gas operations. West Virginia's NPDES permit program applies to wastewater treatment plants receiving flowback from Marcellus Shale production sites and frac water treatment facilities discharging into water bodies. State water-quality standards control discharge limits for surface water only, not groundwater. The state's underground injection control program regulates flowback and produced water disposal. The Delaware River Basin Commission also imposes water quality requirements in areas overlying the Marcellus Shale formation. The Commission's water quality requirements for the Marcellus Shale region are legally separate from state requirements. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission regulates water quantity, not quality. Thousands of wells in the region require large volumes of water for development, with up to 8 million gallons needed per well for hydraulic fracturing. The extensive development of the Marcellus Shale could strain local water resources, especially if water is taken from smaller streams or limited groundwater supplies. Large water withdrawals may impact water quality, affecting aquatic life, fishing, recreational activities, and private wells. Concerns have been raised about maintaining baseline stream flows to prevent cumulative and seasonal impacts. Management of water use for Marcellus Shale operations varies by geography. Management of water use for Marcellus Shale operations varies by geography, with laws and regulations governing water availability differing among states. States may use riparian or prior appropriation doctrines for water rights, with limits on water usage based on reasonableness. In areas with shale gas resources, water rights allocation may impact development, especially during water shortages. States east of the Mississippi River follow riparian doctrine, while western states follow prior appropriation. Marcellus Shale region, a riparian state, may face fewer water rights concerns compared to other shale gas areas like Barnett Shale in Texas. Riparian users in Marcellus Shale region reduce water usage proportionally during shortages, allowing shale gas development to continue. The amount of water required for hydraulic fracturing processes in shale gas development remains unclear and may impact the public debate. States in the Marcellus Shale region have similar surface and groundwater regulations, with some having specific programs in place. Gas producers must comply with state and local water rights administration and interstate water compacts. Examples of water supply regulations in the Marcellus Shale states are discussed. Some states have permit programs for water users withdrawing large amounts of water resources, while others have planning and reporting programs to monitor water use without requiring a permit. New York requires permits for certain water users, but those pursuing shale development remain unregulated. West Virginia mandates certain water users to comply with water resource statutes. West Virginia requires water users withdrawing large amounts of water to register with the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure sustainable water withdrawal. The state also mandates a water management plan for horizontal well applications used for fracturing if more than 210,000 gallons of water are needed in a 30-day period. Pennsylvania implements a permit program and a planning and reporting program for water use management. Public water supply agencies need approval for withdrawals exceeding 10,000 gallons per day. Reporting includes details on water source, location, and amount withdrawn. Marcellus Shale drillers in the region must submit a water use management plan for approval, which is a requirement for a shale well permit. The region includes parts of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, with specific regulations governed by interstate compacts like the Delaware River Basin Compact, Susquehanna River Basin Compact, and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact. The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) oversees water resource issues in the Delaware River Basin, while the Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) governs water resources in its region. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission (SRBC) and the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact regulate water use in their respective basins, which cover parts of Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. These compacts impose requirements on states to adopt standards for water use within the basins. The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) regulates water use in the basin, including hydraulic fracturing projects. Projects with a substantial impact on water resources require prior approval. Exemptions exist for withdrawals under 100,000 gallons per day, with specific regulations for withdrawals exceeding 1 million gallons per day. Draft regulations are in place to protect the basin's resources. The DRBC has issued draft regulations requiring approval for water sources in the basin used for natural gas projects. Similar regulations exist in the SRBC for projects affecting water resources, including consumptive use, withdrawals, and diversions. Specific regulations for Marcellus Shale projects also require approval. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact, approved in 2008, includes monitoring and reporting requirements to protect water resources in the region. Withdrawals of 100,000 gallons per day or more and diversions must be registered, with parties notified of consumptive use proposals of 5 million gallons per day or more. The compact aims to regulate natural gas projects in the Marcellus Shale region. The Marcellus Shale formation is a significant natural gas resource in the United States, with numerous projects planned for development. Gas producers are planning over 2,000 gas wells in West Virginia alone, leading to increasing demands on regulatory measures. The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact regulates withdrawals and diversions, with a focus on consumptive use proposals of 5 million gallons per day or more. The development of the Marcellus Shale and other unconventional natural gas resources in the region is increasing demands on regulatory agencies for licensing, permitting, inspections, and enforcement. State agencies and the DRBC are cautious about granting permits due to water supply and wastewater disposal concerns. New York is awaiting completion of an environmental impact statement before processing permits. There is pressure from companies, drillers, and landowners to move forward with gas resource development, but success may depend on regulatory agencies' capacity to provide oversight resources. The development of Marcellus Shale and other unconventional natural gas resources, including hydraulic fracturing, has sparked debate in Congress. Industry argues against broad federal regulation under the SDWA, citing successful use of the practice. Horizontal wells cost $3-5 million, and industry representatives believe more regulation is unnecessary and could slow gas development. Despite concerns, natural gas production from unconventional formations using hydraulic fracturing is increasing. Drilling and reservoir stimulation methods have evolved for more challenging formations. The use of hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling has increased significantly over time, leading to calls for greater environmental oversight. The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2011 was introduced in Congress to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act and create new disclosure requirements for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The FRAC Act proposes new disclosure requirements for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, including the underground injection of fluids or propping agents. Operators must disclose a list of chemicals before starting operations, including identification, Chemical Abstracts Service numbers, safety data sheets, and anticipated volumes. The bills propose disclosure requirements for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, with operators needing to provide information on the chemicals and amounts used within 30 days after operations. The disclosure would be made public by the state or EPA, but proprietary information would be protected. The FRAC Act proposes disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing chemicals, including sharing proprietary information with medical professionals in emergencies. Calls for disclosure have increased due to concerns about unknown chemicals in well water near oil and gas operations. Other bills in Congress also address hydraulic fracturing. The FUEL Act in the 112th Congress recognizes state regulation of oil and gas production and encourages voluntary disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. H.R. 1425 directs funding preference for research on reducing environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing during natural gas exploration. Advances in drilling technology have made extracting natural gas from shale more economical. Recent advances in directional well drilling and reservoir stimulation have made shale production more economical. The Marcellus Shale formation is a significant natural gas resource in the United States, but developing it comes with challenges such as the need for extensive infrastructure to transport the gas to transmission pipelines. Shale gas development raises concerns about water contamination from hydraulic fracturing and disposal of fracturing fluids. Contamination risks must be addressed during drilling, fracturing, and flowback phases to protect fresh water supplies. During shale gas development, drilling and well construction must be carefully conducted to prevent environmental impacts. Hydraulic fracturing induces new fractures in the Marcellus Shale, but the risk of linking it to an aquifer appears remote. Regulatory oversight by states is crucial during these activities. The flowback water from hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus Shale region poses environmental challenges due to its high content of salts, minerals, and contaminants. State laws and the Clean Water Act regulate the disposal of this water to prevent contamination of surface waters. Legislation may authorize the EPA to broadly regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA, potentially impacting state regulations. The Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act regulate the discharge and deep well injection of flowback water from hydraulic fracturing. Concerns about water quality and environmental impacts of unconventional gas exploration have prompted close examination. Congress directed EPA to review risks of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water supplies. President Obama's Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future called for improving safety and environmental performance of shale gas production. EPA is expected to report interim research results in 2012 and issue a follow-up report in 2014. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) Shale Gas Subcommittee issued recommendations to improve safety and environmental performance in shale gas production, focusing on water quality. Recommendations include adopting best practices for well construction, background water quality measurements, manifesting water transfers, and publicly reporting water composition. States are urged to review and modernize rules and enforcement practices. In April 2011, the New York State Attorney General threatened to sue the federal government over shale gas production. In April 2011, the New York State Attorney General threatened to sue the federal government if an environmental review of natural gas drilling in the Delaware River Basin was not conducted under NEPA. A coalition of environmental advocates petitioned the White House for an environmental impact analysis on natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region. EPA started a rulemaking process to regulate shale gas wastewaters. State regulators are revising regulations to enhance water quality protections during shale gas exploration. Gas development through high-volume horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has rapidly increased in the past decade, posing regulatory challenges for states and communities in the Marcellus Shale region. State agencies support state regulation of natural gas production, including hydraulic fracturing. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission has urged Congress to maintain state oversight of fracturing. The oil and gas producing states urge Congress to keep the fracturing exemption from the SDWA, stating that hydraulic fracturing is a temporary technique not suited for the UIC program. If EPA were to regulate all fracturing, it would require significant resources and staff. Concerns arise over EPA overseeing wells in non-primacy states like Pennsylvania and New York. The FRAC Act is supported by the American Water Works Association, various towns, and environmental groups to address concerns about water contamination during shale gas development. EPA is developing regulations under the Clean Water Act to regulate water discharges from fracking operations and writing guidance under the SDWA UIC program for states permitting hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuel. The EPA is working on regulations to address water contamination concerns during shale gas development, including permitting hydraulic fracturing with diesel fuel. There is ongoing debate about the risks of shale gas development to water resources, prompting Congress to urge the EPA to study the issue. States in the Marcellus Shale region are revising regulatory programs in response to the industry's growth. States in the Marcellus Shale region are revising regulatory programs in response to the robust growth in the shale gas industry."
