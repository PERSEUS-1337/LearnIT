    "content": "The \"Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act\" aims to designate certain lands within the Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System to protect their scenic, historic, and wildlife values, as well as scientific, educational, and recreational resources. Certain lands within Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, are designated as wilderness under the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness Act to preserve their natural values. The Secretary of the Interior will prepare a map and boundary description of the designated wilderness area. The Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate will have a map and boundary description of potential wilderness lands on file for public inspection. The map and description will have the same legal effect as if included in the Act, and the Secretary of the Interior can make corrections to any errors. The term \"potential wilderness lands\" refers to lands identified as potential wilderness on the map and acquired interests. The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness includes lands acquired by the United States after the enactment of the Act, contiguous with designated wilderness areas. The Secretary of the Interior can include potential wilderness lands in the park upon ceasing incompatible uses, with modifications to the map and boundaries. The boundaries of the Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness exclude certain lands, including the Grand Ditch, lands owned by the St. Vrain & Left Hand Water Conservancy District, and lands owned by the Wincentsen-Harms Trust. The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness boundaries exclude certain lands, and nothing in the Act will affect the management or use of lands outside those boundaries. SEC. 3. MANAGEMENT OF ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK WILDERNESS. (a) Management Generally.--Lands designated as wilderness in Rocky Mountain National Park shall be managed by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with the Wilderness Act and this Act. References to effective dates in the Wilderness Act will be adjusted accordingly. \n(b) Water Rights.--Congress acknowledges specific findings related to water rights. The Congress finds that the United States has existing water rights within Rocky Mountain National Park, sufficient for its designated wilderness purposes. No additional water rights reservation is needed under this Act. Activities related to the Colorado-Big Thompson Project on designated wilderness lands are allowed to continue without being affected by the wilderness designation. In case of emergencies or catastrophic events, additional activities may be necessary for the operation and maintenance of the project. Activities related to the Colorado-Big Thompson Project on designated wilderness lands are allowed to continue for operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and use, subject to reasonable restrictions by the Secretary of the Interior to protect wilderness values. No restrictions should hinder necessary activities or reduce water supply from the projects. Nothing in the Act of January 26, 1915, allows development within designated wilderness lands. The Rocky Mountain National Park Wilderness designation does not create buffer zones or protective perimeters around the wilderness area. Nonwilderness activities or uses visible or audible from within the wilderness area are not prohibited up to the boundary of the wilderness area."
