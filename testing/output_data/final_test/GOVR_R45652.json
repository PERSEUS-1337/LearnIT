    "content": "The United States has been the driving force behind NATO since its creation in 1949, leading the alliance as it has grown to 29 members. U.S. leadership in NATO is seen as crucial for national security, providing peace and stability in Europe and support from 28 allies. However, there has been criticism, particularly in the U.S., about the imbalance in burden-sharing, with concerns that European allies rely too heavily on U.S. security guarantees. President Donald Trump's criticisms of NATO have raised concerns about the U.S. bearing an unfair share of security responsibilities. He has called for allies to increase defense spending, suggesting the U.S. could modify its commitment if targets are not met. Despite this, Trump Administration officials emphasize continued U.S. commitment to NATO and increased funding for U.S. forces in Europe. President Trump's forceful statements have led to increased defense spending across NATO, which was not seen under his predecessors. However, concerns remain about his commitment to the alliance, with some worried about potential damage to NATO cohesion and credibility. In response, Congress has shown bipartisan support for NATO, passing legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the alliance and limiting the President's authority to withdraw. The bipartisan support for NATO in Congress is evident through legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the alliance. Concerns about NATO's utility and challenges such as burdensharing and managing relations with Russia are being addressed. Discussions are ongoing about NATO's value to the United States and its alignment with U.S. strategic interests. NATO has evolved through four phases since 1949, including the Cold War era, post-Cold War transformation, focus on crisis management post-9/11, and renewed focus on deterring Russia since 2014. The current Strategic Concept emphasizes collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. An appendix provides data on defense spending by NATO members. \"NATO's priorities include collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security, reflecting the complex global security environment. Concerns exist about NATO's political will and military capacities, potentially leading to a decline in support. However, NATO's ability to enhance security for member states is unmatched, with flexibility in adapting to evolving threats. The alliance was established after World War II to coordinate defense against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact.\" \"NATO's founding mutual defense clause in Article 5 aimed to prevent Soviet expansion and maintain alliance unity. The alliance also sought to prevent future hostilities among European states. Throughout the Cold War, the strategic benefits of defending Western Europe outweighed the cost of maintaining a U.S. military presence in Europe.\" With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO questioned its continued existence. However, the alliance decided to maintain a nonconfrontational posture, reduce military forces, and pursue partnerships with former adversaries from the Warsaw Pact to fulfill shared security objectives beyond Cold War territorial defense. NATO's focus on spreading peace, stability, and democracy in Europe led to the accession of 10 new member states in 1999 and 2004. The alliance also took steps towards partnership with Russia, although Moscow remained uneasy with NATO's enlargement towards its borders. The wars in the Western Balkans in the 1990s prompted NATO to consider \"out of area\" operations, leading to military intervention in Bosnia in 1995 as a first step in this direction. The NATO intervention in the Western Balkans in 1995 marked a significant shift for Germany, which had been restricted from deploying forces abroad since World War II. NATO's 1999 Strategic Concept expanded the definition of security to include new threats like terrorism and ethnic conflict. The aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks led to further changes in NATO's approach to security. NATO allies invoked Article 5 after 9/11, leading to extensive military operations in Afghanistan. European support was significant despite public opposition. Despite European public opposition to the war in Afghanistan and skepticism towards the Taliban and Al Qaeda as threats to Europe, Canada and European allies took on greater responsibilities in Afghanistan. The United States turned to NATO for support in Afghanistan after launching military operations in Iraq in 2003, highlighting disparities in allied operations. NATO allies faced disparities in military capabilities and willingness to engage in combat operations post-9/11 attacks. US pushed for increased defense spending and capabilities, adopting the 2% GDP guideline in 2006. Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine disrupted NATO's transformation into a globally oriented security organization since 2014. NATO has strengthened its territorial defense capabilities and deterred Russia since 2014, leading to tensions within the alliance. Member states differ in their views on engaging with Russia and prioritizing security threats from the south versus deterring Russia. NATO has launched initiatives like Enhanced Forward Presence with 4,500 troops and counterterrorism efforts in the Middle East and North Africa. NATO has increased its military presence in the Baltic States and Poland, launched a training mission in Iraq, and maintains a security force in Kosovo. The alliance is also focusing on developing cyber defense capabilities and addressing hybrid warfare. Despite its broad range of security efforts, analysts agree that NATO is more engaged than ever before. Since its creation in 1949, NATO has relied on the United States as the leader of the alliance, with the US being the world's top military power. Concerns have been raised about European dependence on US security, leading to calls for European allies to increase their defense budgets for a more equitable burden-sharing. The US has pushed European allies to increase defense budgets for a fairer burden-sharing. In the 1980s, legislation was enacted to cap US force strength in Europe if allies didn't raise defense budgets by 3% above inflation. Allies agreed to reach 2% of GDP for defense budgets by 2024. Analysts warn that focusing only on budget size without improving military capabilities could be ineffective. NATO aims for 20% of defense spending on new equipment and research. NATO members are urged to allocate at least 20% of their defense expenditure to new equipment and research. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasizes a broader approach to measuring contributions, including \"cash, capabilities, and contributions.\" Financial contributions to NATO come from national defense budgets and common funds. NATO members contribute to common funds for day-to-day operations and military assets. The U.S. leads with 22% share, followed by Germany, France, and the UK. NATO aims for 2% GDP spending on defense annually and 20% on new equipment. These targets were formalized in 2014 to guide national defense spending. The 2% GDP spending target for defense by NATO members is not directly contributed to NATO but guides national defense spending. The target is seen as politically and symbolically important, although not a critical threshold for defense capabilities. NATO does not impose sanctions on countries that do not meet the target, but there has been a steady rise in defense spending since the 2014 Wales Summit. NATO estimates that seven allies met the 2% defense spending target in 2018, with sixteen allies planning to meet the targets by 2024. President Trump criticizes NATO members, including Germany, for not reaching the 2% GDP target by 2024. If all allies met the 2% benchmark, NATO's defense budgets would increase by about $100 billion. Critics emphasize the importance of how additional resources are invested in modernizing military capabilities. Despite criticisms of European defense spending levels, key European allies like the UK and France still have highly capable militaries, ranking sixth and seventh globally in defense expenditure. In 2018, European allies are expected to spend around $282 billion on defense, funding close to 1.8 million military personnel. Critics argue that European defense spending is often inefficient, with high personnel costs taking up a significant portion of the budget. European defense spending is criticized for being inefficient, with high personnel costs hindering research, development, and procurement. NATO officials highlight long-standing shortfalls in key military capabilities, such as strategic air- and sealift, air-to-air refueling, and intelligence. Efforts to address duplication include urging allies to streamline mobilization and deployment processes. In 2014, allies adopted a guideline for 20% of national defense budgets to be allocated to procurement. NATO leaders are calling for 20% of member states' national defense budgets to be allocated to new equipment procurement and research. Progress has been made, with 16 allies meeting the target in 2018. The alliance conducts a Defense Planning Process to align national and NATO defense planning efforts efficiently. Only the United States, France, and the UK aspire to develop the full range of capabilities among NATO members. Among NATO members, the United States, France, and the UK aim to develop a full range of military capabilities for a global footprint. NATO and U.S. leaders promote defense cooperation initiatives, including pooling resources and joint acquisitions. Analysts suggest European defense industry consolidation for more efficient production and procurement. Progress in joint capabilities development is limited due to national governments prioritizing domestic interests over cooperation. Shifting strategic priorities challenge long-term defense planning in NATO. Post-Cold War, military modernization aimed at agile forces globally. Some allies cut tanks and submarines, but Russian aggression prompts reevaluation. Allied contributions to NATO operations impact burdensharing dynamics. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO allies and partner countries have contributed to various NATO-led military operations globally, including in Afghanistan. European allies and Canada view their contributions to Afghanistan as a demonstration of solidarity with the United States. Some analysts note that maintaining deployments to Afghanistan has delayed defense modernization efforts for member states. Since 2001, NATO allies and partner countries have deployed over 40,000 personnel to Afghanistan. Canada and European allies have suffered 1,050 coalition fatalities. Non-U.S. allies and NATO partners have committed $2.6 billion to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. Approximately 8,500 troops from European NATO member states are deployed to NATO's train-and-assist mission in Afghanistan. European allies and Canada have contributed forces to NATO's deterrence and defense initiatives since 2014. Since 2001, NATO allies and partner countries have deployed over 40,000 personnel to Afghanistan, with Canada and European allies suffering 1,050 coalition fatalities. Non-U.S. allies and NATO partners have contributed $2.6 billion to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. European NATO member states have 8,500 troops deployed to NATO's train-and-assist mission in Afghanistan. NATO operations have highlighted disparities in military capabilities, with European allies and Canada often relying on the United States for key support in interventions. Since 2001, NATO allies and partner countries have deployed over 40,000 personnel to Afghanistan, with Canada and European allies suffering 1,050 coalition fatalities. European allies and Canada have depended on the United States for key capabilities in interventions, such as air- and sea-lift, refueling, and munitions. NATO's 2011 military intervention in Libya exposed these shortfalls, with allies facing munition shortages early on. Since 2014, Russia's actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine have led NATO to reassess its relationship with Moscow. Russia has increased military activities in northern Europe, deploying nuclear-capable missiles and enhancing air and naval presence. In response, NATO has implemented its greatest defense reinforcement since the Cold War. Since 2014, Russia's actions in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine have led NATO to reassess its relationship with Moscow. NATO has implemented its greatest defense reinforcement since the Cold War, with some allies expressing concerns about the effectiveness and sustainability of these efforts. Poland and the Baltic States urge a more robust allied military presence in the region, while leaders in Western European countries emphasize a dual-track approach to Russia that combines deterrence with dialogue. NATO continues to resist calls for permanent troop deployment in countries that joined after the collapse of the Soviet Union due to concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act. Former German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier criticized NATO's deterrence posture in 2016, calling it \"saber-rattling.\" Discussions on NATO's strategic posture may continue to be marked by differing views on the threat posed by Russia. NATO's strategic posture is influenced by divergent views on the threat from Russia and the role of NATO in addressing security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa. Some allies are hesitant to increase NATO's involvement in issues like terrorism and migration, preferring the European Union to lead. Budgetary and political constraints may limit NATO's ability to deter Russia while addressing threats in the south. U.S. leadership in NATO has been a key component of U.S. national security strategy since the alliance's inception. The United States has a strong voice in NATO's strategic objectives, with a shift in military presence in Europe since the Cold War. Events like Russia's actions in Ukraine have tested the strategic assumptions of the U.S. European Command's posture. President Trump has criticized NATO, but his Administration's National Security efforts continue. The United States has a strong voice in NATO's strategic objectives, with a shift in military presence in Europe since the Cold War. President Trump has criticized NATO, but his Administration's National Security efforts continue. EUCOM's posture emphasizes the U.S. commitment to NATO and European security, with significant funding increases for U.S. military deployments in Europe under the European Deterrence Initiative. Proponents of NATO argue that membership brings peace, stability, conflict prevention, and deterrence, vital for preventing a repeat of past World Wars. NATO, with 28 allies, provides treaty-based defense and security support, including advanced militaries, nuclear deterrents, and missile defense systems in Europe. Despite criticisms of European defense spending, non-U.S. allies have significant military capabilities and support U.S. security objectives. NATO also serves as a platform for international military coalitions, with an integrated command structure for collective defense and crisis management operations. NATO, with 28 allies, provides defense and security support in Europe, including advanced militaries, nuclear deterrents, and missile defense systems. U.S. military bases strategically located in Europe enable quick access to other key regions. NATO's promotion of security and stability in Europe protects the extensive economic relationship with the EU, the U.S.' largest trade partner. However, questions about the value of NATO to the U.S. have led to a reassessment of membership benefits and costs. Critics of NATO point out the costs incurred by the U.S. due to its leadership, including loss of autonomy and heightened risks to U.S. forces. Some suggest that ad hoc coalitions under U.S. command may be more effective than working within NATO structures. Heightened risks to U.S. forces due to NATO's Article 5 commitment, European allies' dependence on U.S. security guarantee, and NATO's enlargement provoking Russia. The U.S. membership in NATO carries financial commitments, including contributions to NATO's Common Fund and missile defense capability. Analysts suggest that reducing the military footprint in Europe may not necessarily reduce overall costs, as the Department of Defense would still cover redeployment expenses. U.S. military bases in Europe offer strategic advantages beyond NATO commitments. Congress played a key role in creating NATO in 1949. Congress has been instrumental in creating and shaping U.S. policy towards NATO since 1949. Despite criticisms on burdensharing, Congress consistently shows bipartisan support for active U.S. leadership in NATO through financial support and legislation enabling NATO enlargement and military operations. Congressional support for NATO helps strengthen broader U.S. policy towards the alliance. During the Trump Administration, congressional support for NATO has been emphasized to reassure allies amidst President Trump's criticisms. Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation reaffirming U.S. commitment to NATO, including efforts to increase funding for defense activities in Europe. Legislation supporting NATO has been passed by both the House and Senate, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to the alliance. This includes H.R. 676 and S.J.Res. 4, as well as H.Res. 397 and H.R. 5515 / P.L. 115-232. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell invited NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to address Congress in April 2019, highlighting the importance of NATO to the U.S. Congress. Legislation supporting NATO, including H.R. 676 and S.J.Res. 4, reaffirms U.S. commitment to the alliance. Congressional hearings reflect disagreement on President Trump's impact on NATO. Some in Congress argue that President Trump's criticism of allied defense spending levels has spurred recent increases by NATO members. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has acknowledged Trump's impact in securing $41 billion of additional defense spending by European allies and Canada since 2016. Others counter that Trump's admonition of U.S. allies and questioning of NATO's utility has damaged relationships and undermined credibility. Doubts about U.S. commitment to NATO could embolden adversaries like Russia and weaken alliance cohesion. Some analysts argue that European allies feeling belittled by the U.S. president may be less likely to support future NATO operations. Critics downplay President Trump's role in securing defense spending increases, attributing them more to Russian aggression in Europe. Despite disagreements, most Members of Congress support robust U.S. leadership in NATO to address potential threats from Russia. Calls have been made for enhanced NATO and U.S. military responses to Russian aggression in Ukraine and for stronger European contributions to collective defense measures. Congressional consideration of EDI could further examine U.S. force posture in Europe and its capacity to uphold NATO. Further examination of U.S. force posture in Europe and NATO's capacity to address security threats, including from Russia, cyber warfare, and terrorism. Members of Congress may focus on NATO's strategic value to the U.S., leadership role, and the need for a new strategic concept. The curr_chunk discusses challenges faced by NATO, such as terrorism and migration, member states' defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, European allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts, NATO's \"open door\" policy on enlargement, and developing a NATO strategy toward China."
