Congress finds that the telecommunications industry's shift towards competition in long-distance services has led to an increase in consumers changing providers, with up to 50 million switches annually. Unauthorized provider changes, known as \"slamming\", are a significant issue, where consumers' services are switched without their knowledge or consent. Slamming is the primary concern for consumer protection in this market. The unauthorized change of telephone service providers, known as slamming, is a major concern for consumer protection. Up to 1,000,000 consumers are affected each year, leading to increased costs and threatening the benefits of a competitive marketplace. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to address this issue. The Federal Communications Commission has proposed regulations to address unauthorized changes of telephone service providers, requiring providers to pay the previously selected carrier all charges paid by the subscriber after the unauthorized change. However, difficulties in securing proof of unauthorized changes may impede enforcement of these regulations, affecting consumer interests. Consumer consent to changes in telephone service providers should be verified and maintained by providers through written or oral consent evidence. Congress and the FCC should explore electronic methods for consumers to switch providers with express consent. Consumers should have the right to take legal action in State court against unauthorized changes of providers. The majority of consumers affected by unauthorized changes in telephone service do not seek redress through the Federal Communications Commission. States should be allowed to pursue actions on behalf of their citizens in cases of unauthorized changes, while also preserving the role of the Federal government. The Act aims to protect consumers from unauthorized changes in telephone service providers, prosecute fraud cases, and make it easier for consumers to choose their providers. The Act enhances protections against unauthorized changes in subscriber selections of telephone service providers.

It also allows for a private right of action to enforce violations, including injunctions, monetary recovery, and treble damages for willful violations.

State attorney generals have investigatory powers for civil actions under this subsection. The attorney general or authorized state official can conduct investigations, administer oaths, compel witnesses, and produce evidence. State officials can still proceed in state court for violations. During a civil action by the Commission, no state can initiate a civil action against a defendant named in the Commission's complaint for the same violation.
