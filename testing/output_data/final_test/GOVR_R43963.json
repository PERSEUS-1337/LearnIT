Specifically, $99 million is recommended for exascale computing activities, with requested levels for ALCF, NERSC, and OLCF. ALCF, NERSC, and OLCF received $80 million, $76 million, and $104 million, respectively, in FY2015. Additionally, $176 million is recommended for Mathematical, Computational, and Computer Sciences Research, and $8 million for other purposes. The Senate report recommends $621 million for ASCR in FY2016, $80 million more than FY2015 enacted level. $158 million is recommended for exascale activities. Within ASCR, $104 million for OLCF, $86 million for NERSC, and $38 million for ESnet. The FY2016 Administration request for Basic Energy Sciences (BES) is $1.849 billion, a $116 million increase from FY2015. The increase includes funding for the Linac Coherent Light Source\u2013II (LCLS\u2013II) construction and Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs). Funding for Batteries and Energy Storage and Fuels from Sunlight Energy Innovations Hubs would remain at FY2015 levels. The House report recommends $1.770 billion for Basic Energy Sciences (BES) in FY2016, $37 million more than FY2015 enacted funding. Within this amount, $192 million is allocated for the LCLS-II and $98 million for EFRCs. The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) would receive $14 million, while Computational Materials Sciences would receive $8 million. The Senate report recommends $1.844 billion for BES in FY2016, $111 million more than FY2015. The Senate report recommends $1.844 billion for Basic Energy Sciences (BES) in FY2016, which is $111 million more than the FY2015 enacted level.

The Senate report recommends $610 million for BER, with $294 million for Biological Systems Science and $316 million for Climate and Environmental Sciences. Fusion Energy Sciences aims to expand understanding of matter at high temperatures. The FY2016 Administration request for Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) is $420 million, $48 million less than the FY2015 funding level. Most FES activities would decline or remain flat, except for an increase in funding for the Burning Plasma Science: Foundations subprogram. This increase would support facility and utility improvements for the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (NSTX-U) operations and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory Computer Center. In FY2015, FES planned to close MIT's Alcator C-Mod facility in late FY2016. The FY2016 budget request for Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) includes funding for the U.S. contribution to the ITER project, an international effort to build an experimental fusion reactor. Concerns have been raised about ITER's cost, schedule, and management, with the U.S. contribution estimated to be between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. Critics have focused on international project concerns rather than U.S. ITER specifically. The international ITER project has faced concerns about cost, schedule, and management. The U.S. contribution to ITER in FY2016 is $150 million, with the House recommending $468 million for FES. The House report warns of reconsidering support for ITER without management reforms. The Senate report recommends $270 million for FES in FY2016, which is significantly less than previous funding levels. It includes no funding for the U.S. contribution to ITER and suggests withdrawing from the project. Additionally, $2.8 million is allocated for heavy ion fusion science research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Administration seeks $788 million for the High Energy Physics (HEP) program in FY2016, $22 million more than the FY2015 enacted funding level.

The House report recommends $616 million for NP in FY2016. The House recommendation for FY2016 includes $100 million for CEBAF operations, $169 million for RHIC operations, and $98 million for FRIB construction. The Senate report recommends $592 million for NP in FY2016, with $95 million for FRIB and $175 million for RHIC. The WDTS program aims to support STEM workforce development. The FY2016 Administration request for WDTS is $21 million, including funding for various STEM programs. The House recommends the requested level, while the Senate recommends the FY2015 enacted level of $20 million. Office of Science appropriations from FY2010 to FY2015 are also shown in Table 3. The Office of Science subtotal increased by $241 million (5%) between FY2010 and FY2014, with most of the increase going to ASCR, BES, and FES. Funding for High Energy Physics was reduced by about -2% during this period. Appropriations authorizations to the Office of Science expired in FY2013, and measures have been introduced in the 114th Congress to reauthorize provisions. Funding levels for the Office of Science under selected proposed reauthorization measures from the 114th Congress are summarized in Table 4. H.R. 1806 specifies funding levels for major Science research programs like ASCR and FES, unlike H.R. 1898 and S. 1398. The proposed reauthorization measures from the 114th Congress include funding amounts for these programs, as shown in Table 5 for comparison with FY2015 enacted and FY2016 requested funding levels."
