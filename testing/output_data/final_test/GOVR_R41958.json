These agencies are responsible for issuing regulations that will have a significant impact. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies like the SEC, FRS, CFTC, and CFPB. The regulations issued are expected to have a major effect on implementation, with significant power given to regulators to determine the impact. The legislation is complex and ambiguous, leaving room for partisans to influence the outcome. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies, giving them discretion in crafting rules while Congress retains some control. Over half of the rulemaking provisions in the Act are discretionary, allowing agencies to decide whether to issue rules and what they should contain. The Dodd-Frank Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies, allowing them discretion in crafting rules. Section 732 of the act requires the CFTC to implement conflict-of-interest systems for futures commission merchants and introducing brokers. Congressional oversight of rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act is crucial to ensure that delegated authority is exercised properly. This oversight can address issues related to the substance and process of rule issuance by federal agencies. David H. Rosenbloom highlighted the equivalence between rulemaking and lawmaking, emphasizing the need for appropriate procedures in exercising delegated authority. Congressional oversight of rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act is essential to ensure proper exercise of delegated authority. To oversee the regulations being issued, Congress can use the CRS report to identify provisions requiring rulemaking. The Unified Agenda published by the Regulatory Information Service Center can also help Congress anticipate upcoming rules. The Unified Agenda, published by the Regulatory Information Service Center, helps agencies meet transparency requirements by disclosing regulatory actions with significant economic impacts on small entities. It also fulfills Executive Order 12866's mandate for agencies to prepare agendas of regulations under development or review to facilitate early consultation and public involvement in regulatory processes. The executive order requires agencies to involve the public and officials in regulatory planning. Each agency must prepare a regulatory plan for significant actions expected in the upcoming fiscal year, listed in the Unified Agenda in different stages of the rulemaking process. The Unified Agenda lists regulatory actions in different stages: upcoming actions, long-term actions, and completed actions. Each entry includes data elements like the issuing agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number, action description, timetable, and priority level. There is no penalty for issuing a rule without prior notice. The Unified Agenda lists regulatory actions in different stages: upcoming actions, long-term actions, and completed actions. It helps Congress and the public know about upcoming regulatory actions. The July 7, 2011, edition is the second one issued after the Dodd-Frank Act. Federal agencies submit data for the Unified Agenda to RISC. The Unified Agenda, issued after the Dodd-Frank Act, contains upcoming proposed and final rules from federal agencies. The report examines the July 7, 2011 edition, identifying actions related to the Dodd-Frank Act. Agencies are required to submit data to RISC for the Unified Agenda. The upcoming rules and actions are searched using the term \"Dodd-Frank\" in the proposed rule, final rule, and long-term actions categories. The results are provided in the report's Appendix. The Unified Agenda, issued after the Dodd-Frank Act, contains upcoming proposed and final rules from federal agencies. The table in the report identifies the department or agency, rule title, RIN, abstract, and expected issuance date. The information was taken from Unified Agenda entries, with updates from a search in the Federal Register for the latest publication status. As of August 3, the Federal Register citation is provided when submitting rules to the Unified Agenda. Agencies submit all upcoming rules to RISC, even if issued jointly. CRS consolidates entries for joint rules to avoid double-counting. The July 7, 2011, Unified Agenda listed 30 Dodd-Frank Act-related actions in the proposed rule stage. The upcoming proposed rules from various agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Office of Housing (HUD\u2013OH), Farm Credit Administration (FCA), Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Six joint proposed rules are also expected. The CFTC and SEC are required to propose rules for identity theft programs under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Financial institutions and creditors regulated by these agencies must develop and implement written programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. The Unified Agenda indicated that upcoming proposed rules under the Dodd-Frank Act would be issued in May, June, or July of 2011. As of August 3, 2011, 14 out of 26 proposed rules had been published. Some proposed rules not yet published included regulations on alternatives to external credit ratings, funding policies, and conflicts of interest in securitizations. The SEC rule on \"Conflicts of Interest Relating to Certain Securitizations\" was part of the Dodd-Frank proposed rules expected to be issued in 2011. Other rules included a HUD\u2013OH rule on \"Housing Counseling\" and a CFTC rule on \"Identity Theft Red Flag Rules.\" None of the 30 proposed rules were expected to have a significant economic impact. The HUD\u2013OH rule on \"Housing Counseling: New Program Requirements\" is set to amend regulations for the Housing Counseling program to address certification requirements for counselors as per the Dodd-Frank Act. It will establish the authority of HUD's Office of Housing Counseling to coordinate and administer the program, implementing changes to provide comprehensive homeownership counseling. Housing counseling agencies provide counseling on homeownership processes, with HUD establishing materials for HUD-approved counselors. The Unified Agenda listed 14 \"other significant\" proposed rules, including ones from HUD, Treasury, and CFTC on various topics like program requirements, compensation arrangements, and swap definitions. The Unified Agenda listed 30 rules, including the SEC's \"Disqualification of Felons and Other 'Bad Actors' From Rule 506 Offerings\" proposed rule, which may require a regulatory flexibility analysis for small entities. None of the other proposed rules were expected to impact small entities. The Unified Agenda listed 72 Dodd-Frank Act-related actions in the \"final rule stage\" of rulemaking, with various agencies involved. Some rules were expected to be joint rules issued by multiple agencies. One specific CFTC final rule entry was rather general, related to imposing position limits for derivatives as mandated by Congress. The Commission, mandated by Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act, aims to impose position limits on futures and swaps to prevent excessive speculation, market manipulation, and ensure market liquidity for hedgers. A notice of proposed rulemaking has been issued to gather public comments before final rules are issued. As of August 3, 2011, 18 out of 61 expected final rules had been published. As of August 3, 2011, several rules included in the Unified Agenda had not been published, such as a CFTC rule on \"Swap Data Repositories\" and an SEC rule on \"Reporting of Proxy Votes on Executive Compensation.\" Several rules expected to be published in June or July 2011 were related to Dodd-Frank Act provisions with a deadline of one year after enactment. Four of the rules listed in the Unified Agenda were considered economically significant or major, including rules from HUD-OH and FDIC. Several upcoming final rules were considered \"other significant,\" including rules from the CFTC and DOL-OSHA. Examples include rules on procedures for handling retaliation complaints, core principles for designated contract markets, and governance requirements for DCOs, DCMs, and SEFs. Several upcoming final rules were considered \"other significant,\" including rules from the CFTC and DOL-OSHA. Examples include rules on procedures for handling retaliation complaints, core principles for designated contract markets, and governance requirements for DCOs, DCMs, and SEFs. Nine rules listed in the Unified Agenda were expected to trigger an analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, including rules on alternatives to credit ratings in risk-based capital guidelines, disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers, and net worth standards for accredited investors. Three other rules were expected to impact small entities. Three rules were expected to impact small entities, including a Federal Reserve rule on \"Regulation M\u2014Consumer Leasing,\" a Federal Reserve rule on \"Regulation Z\u2014Truth in Lending,\" and an SEC rule on \"Registration of Municipal Advisers.\" 11 of the 25 proposed rules expected to be issued in June or July 2011 had been published by August 3, 2011. Some of these proposed rules had final rule statutory deadlines in 2011 or were expected to result in final rules in 2011. For example, a Treasury\u2013OCC proposed rule on \"Off-Exchange Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions\" was published on April 22, 2011, with a final rule deadline of July 16, 2011. Many Dodd-Frank Act final rules may be published in 2011, with proposed rules having statutory deadlines in July 2011. The Unified Agenda also lists long-term actions related to the Dodd-Frank Act, with two actions by the CFTC. The CFTC was directed by the Dodd-Frank Act to adopt an interim final rule for reporting swaps entered into before the Act's enactment. The agency published the rule on October 14, 2010, with the next steps to be determined. Another directive was for rules to be adopted for reporting transition swaps, entered into after the Dodd-Frank Act but before its effective date. The Commission plans to issue a notice for comment on permanent rules under CEA section 2(h)(5). The CFTC issued an interim final rule on reporting swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act, with the next steps to be determined. Congress oversees agency rules to ensure consistency with legislative intent and rulemaking requirements. Congress can oversee rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Act through tools like oversight hearings, confirmation hearings, and requesting evaluations from the Government Accountability Office. The Unified Agenda provides early information on upcoming rules, allowing for congressional involvement in the rulemaking process. The Dodd-Frank Act contains over 40 provisions requiring the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct studies and write reports on various topics such as compliance costs associated with SEC rules and the feasibility of creating an independent professional organization for rating analysts. Reports must be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within a specified timeframe. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct studies and submit reports to Congress on the impact of the Act on credit availability and affordability. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit final rules to Congress and GAO before implementation. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit final rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect. It allows Congress to use expedited procedures to disapprove agency rules by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The definition of a covered rule under the CRA is broad, encompassing various types of documents that agencies want to make binding on the public. However, the CRA has only been used to disapprove one rule since its enactment, as Presidents may veto resolutions of disapproval to protect rules developed under their administration. Congress can overturn agency rules using the Congressional Review Act (CRA) with a two-thirds vote in both houses, but it may be challenging due to potential presidential veto. Regular legislative procedures can also be used, but they are more difficult to enact and can also be vetoed. Appropriations bills often include provisions directing or preventing specific regulations, influencing agencies to issue certain rules. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation allows Congress to control agency actions through its \"power of the purse.\" These provisions are used strategically due to the necessity of appropriations bills passing and may vary depending on the political alignment of Congress and the President."
