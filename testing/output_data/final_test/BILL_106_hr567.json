    "content": "The \"Physician Availability Act of 1999\" requires physicians to be available in acute care hospitals. Each covered hospital must have a qualified physician available 24/7 for inpatient care. Covered hospitals are defined as those with a participation agreement under the Social Security Act, participating in the Medicaid program, or receiving Federal funds. The term \"physician\" in a hospital refers to an individual authorized to practice medicine and surgery. A \"qualified physician\" in a hospital is a physician who meets certain criteria. In a hospital, a physician's credentials must be verified before providing services. Physician availability in a hospital requires physical presence, primary responsibility for inpatient care, and not being in the emergency room. Enforcement measures are in place. The hospital's emergency room must comply with regulations. The Secretary of Health and Human Services enforces violations, starting with a warning and monitoring compliance. Subsequent violations result in further action. If a hospital knowingly violates regulations, it may face a civil money penalty of up to $100,000. The hospital must also submit a remedial plan to prevent future violations. Civil money penalties are governed by the provisions of the Social Security Act. Subsequent violations may result in additional penalties. If a hospital knowingly violates regulations, it may face a civil money penalty of up to $100,000 and be disqualified from participating in certain programs and receiving federal funds until compliance is assured. Failure to submit a satisfactory remedial plan may also result in penalties. If a hospital fails to comply with regulations and does not submit a satisfactory remedial plan, the Secretary may suspend payment of funds under certain programs until assurances are received. This section will take effect 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
