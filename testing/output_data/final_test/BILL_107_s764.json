    "content": "Congress finds that prices in the spot market for electric energy in the western energy market have consistently remained high since 2000, with California being the starting point for price increases. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has deemed these prices unjust and unreasonable, attributing them to the high and volatile prices of natural gas impacting electricity production costs. In this Act, the term \"Commission\" refers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The term \"cost-of-service based rate\" means a rate for electric energy that includes all reasonable costs. The term \"load-differentiated demand rate\" refers to a rate that varies based on demand. The term \"differentiated demand rate\" refers to a rate for electric energy that varies based on demand during different times. The term \"public utility\" and \"western energy market\" are also defined in the Act. SEC. 3. Wholesale electric energy rates of regulated entities in the Western energy market. The Commission will impose load-differentiated demand rates or cost-of-service based rates on wholesale electric energy sales in the western energy market within 60 days of the Act's enactment. Limitations apply to sales for delivery in states that restrict passing through approved rates or impose price limits on retail energy sales. The Commission will impose load-differentiated demand rates or cost-of-service based rates on wholesale electric energy sales in the western energy market within 60 days of the Act's enactment. Limitations apply to sales for delivery in states that restrict passing through approved rates or impose price limits on retail energy sales. Payment for energy at retail within the western energy market must be made on time, and no orders can be issued without a reasonable assurance of payment for electric energy or natural gas sales. The Act requires sellers of electric energy or natural gas to ensure payment by buyers in specified states, either at an agreed price or a determined fair price by the President or Secretary. The Act allows State public utility commissions in the western energy market to prohibit utilities from selling electric energy outside their service area if it would impact their ability to meet local demand. The Act allows State regulatory authorities to regulate rates for the sale of electric energy to consumers, including setting tiered pricing and real-time pricing. Effective March 1, 2003, any load-differentiated demand rate or cost-of-service based rate imposed under this section will no longer be effective. SEC. 4. NATURAL GAS RATES. Effective immediately, the waiver of the maximum rate ceiling provision for transporting natural gas into California is no longer applicable. Additionally, bundled natural gas transactions must disclose the commodity and transportation portions of the sale price within 60 days under the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act requires sellers of natural gas in bundled transactions for transportation into California to disclose the price breakdown within 60 days of enactment. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION: The Senate urges the Bonneville Power Administration to reduce power purchase needs and minimize potential rate increases starting October 1, 2001. SEC. 6. EFFECT OF ACT. This Act does not impact energy production not online before enactment, existing energy purchase contracts (except spot market purchases), or the ability of states to challenge the enforcement of the Federal Power Act in federal court."
