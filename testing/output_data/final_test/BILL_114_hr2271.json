    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act\" and amends the Federal Power Act to include a new section on Critical Electric Infrastructure Security. The \"Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act\" defines key terms related to critical electric infrastructure, including bulk-power system, Electric Reliability Organization, regional entity, critical electric infrastructure, and critical electric infrastructure information. These definitions are crucial for ensuring the security of systems and assets used for generating, transmitting, and distributing electric energy affecting interstate commerce. The term 'critical electric infrastructure information' refers to information related to critical electric infrastructure designated by the Commission, excluding classified national security information. 'Defense critical electric infrastructure' includes infrastructure in the US used for electric energy generation, transmission, or distribution, not part of the bulk-power system, serving a facility designated by the Secretary. The term 'grid security emergency' refers to the imminent danger of a malicious act using electronic communication, electromagnetic pulse, or geomagnetic storm that could disrupt operations. A geomagnetic storm event or direct physical attack on electronic devices or communication networks could disrupt the reliability of the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure. The Secretary of Energy may issue emergency orders to protect the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure during a grid security emergency identified by the President. The Secretary of Energy can issue emergency orders to protect the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure during a grid security emergency identified by the President. After the date of enactment, the Secretary will establish rules for expedited exercise of this authority. The President must notify relevant congressional committees of any directives or determinations, and the Secretary must consult before issuing emergency measures. During a grid security emergency, the Secretary of Energy can issue emergency orders to protect the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure. The Secretary must consult with relevant authorities and agencies, including those in Canada and Mexico, before implementing emergency measures. The order can apply to various entities involved in the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure within the United States. The order for emergency measures expires unless reissued. During a grid security emergency, the Secretary of Energy can issue emergency orders for the bulk-power system or defense critical electric infrastructure. The order expires in 30 days unless reissued by the Secretary with a directive from the President confirming the emergency. Cost recovery for the bulk-power system is determined by the Commission. The Commission can establish a mechanism for owners, operators, or users of the bulk-power system to recover costs incurred for emergency measures if they cannot be recovered through regulated rates or market prices. Additionally, for defense critical electric infrastructure, emergency measures can be required under an order issued by the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary can designate facilities for emergency measures, with owners bearing the costs. Temporary access to classified information is provided to key personnel during a grid security emergency. The Secretary, in consultation with appropriate agencies and stakeholders, must identify and designate critical defense facilities vulnerable to disruptions in electric supply within 180 days of enacting the section. The list of designated facilities can be revised periodically as needed. The Commission will designate critical electric infrastructure information and protect it from disclosure under certain laws. The Commission will designate critical electric infrastructure information and ensure sanctions for unauthorized disclosure. Standards for sharing information with various entities will be provided. The Commission will consider various entities, including regional entities, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, owners, operators, and users of the bulk-power system, and other relevant entities when promulgating regulations and issuing orders. Consideration will be given to the role of State commissions in reviewing investments, determining rates, ensuring safety, and reliability of the bulk-power system. The Commission will develop protocols for sharing critical electric infrastructure information with Canadian and Mexican authorities and entities outside the United States. No required sharing of information is mandated, and non-critical electric infrastructure information may be disclosed as per the implementation of this section. The Commission will segregate critical electric infrastructure information for disclosure, and the Secretary will facilitate security clearances for key personnel to enhance communication with Federal agencies regarding threats. Federal agencies will share timely actionable information while protecting classified data. The act clarifies that actions taken to comply with emergency orders for grid security will not be considered violations of the Act or any related regulations. The act clarifies that actions taken to comply with emergency orders for grid security will not be considered violations of the Act or any related regulations. Actions taken to comply with emergency measures shall be treated as actions taken to comply with orders issued under section 202(c). No cause of action shall lie for the sharing or receipt of information conducted in accordance with the act. The act clarifies that actions taken to comply with emergency orders for grid security will not be considered violations of the Act or any related regulations. Amendments are made to the Federal Power Act regarding jurisdiction and public utility."
