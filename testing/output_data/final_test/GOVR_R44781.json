    "content": "With the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, states gained the option to fill Senate vacancies through popular election or temporary gubernatorial appointment. Governors historically appointed interim Senators until special elections could be held, as outlined in the Constitution. Gubernatorial appointment to fill Senate vacancies has been the prevailing practice since 1913, with 45 states allowing executives to appoint temporary Senators until elections are held. Vacancies can also occur during presidential transitions, leading to resignations for executive branch positions or higher offices. In 2008-2009, four vacancies arose after the presidential election. In 2008-2009, four Senate vacancies occurred after the presidential election, including two due to Senators Obama and Biden becoming President and Vice President, and two more when Senators Clinton and Salazar were nominated for cabinet positions. The report discusses Senate vacancies, state provisions for filling them, and the constitutional origins of the appointments provision. Another vacancy arose in 2016 when President Trump was elected, leading to Senator Sessions' resignation to become Attorney General. Senator Sessions was confirmed by the Senate on February 8, 2017, and resigned the same day to become Attorney General. Governor Bentley appointed Luther Strange III as Senator to fill the vacancy. Special elections were held, with Doug Jones winning and being sworn in on January 3, 2018. Senator Jones was sworn in on January 3, 2018, to serve the balance of the term until January 3, 2021. Senator Franken announced his resignation on December 6, 2017, and Lieutenant Governor Tina Smith was appointed to fill the vacancy until a special election on November 6, 2018. Senator Smith will serve until the special election, which will fill the seat until January 3, 2021. Senator Thad Cochran announced his resignation on March 5, 2018, due to health reasons. Governor Phil Bryant appointed a replacement on March 21. Governor Phil Bryant appointed Mississippi Agriculture Secretary Cindy Hyde-Smith to fill Senator Thad Cochran's vacancy until a special election. Hyde-Smith's appointment brings the number of women Senators to a historical record of 23. The special election will be held concurrently with the November 6 statewide general election, where Mississippi voters will elect two Senators: one to fill Cochran's seat for the balance of his term, and the second for a full term for the other seat. Special elections for Mississippi Senate seats are nonpartisan with no primary. Candidates must win a majority of votes, or a runoff election is held. Five states require vacancies to be filled by special elections, while 45 allow governors to appoint replacements. Some states expedite the election process to reduce vacancy periods. In 45 states, governors can appoint temporary Senators to fill vacancies until the next general election, followed by a special election to complete the term. Some states require a special election shortly after the vacancy occurs. Six states mandate that the appointed Senator be from the same political party. In 36 states, governors can appoint temporary Senators to fill vacancies until the next general election, with the requirement that the appointed Senator be from the same political party as the prior incumbent. General elections are held regularly in every state, with some states also scheduling elections for local officials in odd-numbered years. In some states, governors can appoint temporary Senators to fill vacancies until the next general election, with political party-related restrictions. For example, Arizona requires the replacement Senator to be from the same party as the previous incumbent, while Hawaii requires the governor to select from a list of three prospective appointees submitted by the previous incumbent's party. Some states require the governor to appoint a replacement Senator from the same party as the previous incumbent, sparking debate over additional qualifications for Senate membership. Other states allow governors to fill Senate vacancies by appointment until a special election is held. Some states require the governor to appoint a replacement Senator from the same party as the previous incumbent, sparking debate over additional qualifications for Senate membership. In Alabama, the governor can fill a Senate vacancy by appointment and must order a special election if the vacancy occurs more than four months before a general election. If it occurs between 2 and 4 months before the general election, it is filled at that time. Alaska and Connecticut allow the governor to appoint a replacement Senator in case of a vacancy, with specific guidelines for scheduling special elections. Louisiana and Massachusetts also have procedures for filling Senate vacancies. In Louisiana, the governor can appoint a replacement for the balance of the term if it expires within a year. Otherwise, a special election is held within a specified timeframe. In Massachusetts, the governor can appoint a replacement until a special election is held. Mississippi and Texas allow the governor to appoint a replacement for a Senate vacancy until a special election is held. If less than one year remains on the term, the appointee serves the balance of the term; if more than one year remains, a special election is held within a specified timeframe. Texas also allows for filling a vacancy concurrently with a regularly scheduled election. Texas authorizes the governor to fill a Senate vacancy temporarily by appointment if the vacancy exists or will exist when Congress is in session. If the vacancy occurs in an even-numbered year and 62 or more days before the primary, the vacancy is filled at that year's general election. If the vacancy occurs in an odd-numbered year, or fewer than 62 days before the primary, the governor calls a special election which is scheduled for the first uniform election date falling 36 or more days after it has been ordered. Vermont authorizes the governor to fill a Senate vacancy by appointment until a successor has been elected. The governor calls a special election, which is held within three months of the vacancy, except if the vacancy occurs within six months of a general election, in which case the special election is held concurrently with the regularly scheduled general election. Washington authorizes the governor to fill a Senate vacancy. The Constitutional Convention of 1787 addressed Senate vacancies soon after approving the Great Compromise. Washington allows the governor to appoint a Senate vacancy until a successor is elected, with a special election called within 10 days of the vacancy and held not less than 140 days later. If the vacancy occurs close to a general election, a special election is held concurrently. If after the filing period, the special election is held within 90 days of the general election. The Committee of Detail was appointed to organize and present decisions to the convention for refinement. They proposed that governors fill Senate vacancies when state legislatures were not in session. This was seen as necessary to prevent gaps in the Senate due to some states only meeting once a year. The Committee of Detail proposed that governors fill Senate vacancies when state legislatures were not in session to prevent gaps in the Senate. James Wilson argued against this, stating that it removed appointment of Senators from popular election and violated separation of powers. Oliver Ellsworth suggested that the power of executive appointment may not always be exerted when legislative meetings were near. Despite opposition, a motion to strike out executive appointment was voted down. The appointment provision for filling vacancies in the Senate was debated and ultimately approved during the Constitutional Convention. The language was amended and finalized without much debate, allowing the Executive to make temporary appointments until the legislature could fill the vacancies. This provision did not generate significant interest during the ratification debates. The appointment provision for filling Senate vacancies was not a topic of much debate during the ratification process. State governors appointed temporary Senators for 124 years, with only minor controversy over 20 contested appointments. The Senate mainly excluded appointees when vacancies occurred during legislative recesses. The appointment of temporary Senators to fill vacancies was generally unremarkable, with an average of 3.3 appointments per state from 1789 to 1913. States with longer Union membership had more appointments, while newer states had fewer. There was little interest in changing the original constitutional provisions governing Senate elections and vacancies for over 70 years. During the late 19th century, dissatisfaction with indirect election of Senators by state legislatures grew, leading to support for a constitutional amendment for direct popular election of the Senate. This was fueled by prolonged and deadlocked elections, resulting in unfilled Senate vacancies for extended periods. During the late 19th century, dissatisfaction with indirect election of Senators by state legislatures grew due to prolonged and deadlocked elections, resulting in unfilled Senate vacancies for extended periods. The Senate election process was increasingly compromised by corruption, with corporations and wealthy individuals bribing state legislators to secure the election of favored candidates who then prioritized party leaders and corporate sponsors over constituents. Support for direct election of Senators also rose due to a long-term American inclination to strengthen representative democracy. The campaign for popular election of Senators was part of a series of laws and amendments to expand voting rights and ensure election integrity. Progressive elements in both major parties and rising political movements supported this reform. The House of Representatives approved popular election amendments multiple times between 1893 and 1902, but the Senate did not take action. Efforts for direct election of Senators faced Senate's refusal, leading the House to set the issue aside. States like Oregon implemented the \"Oregon Plan\" in 1904, requiring state legislators to elect the Senate candidate with the most votes in the popular primary election. This indirect popular election method spread to over half the states by 1911. Pressure continued to build on the Senate in the early 20th century for direct election of Senators, with states adopting versions of the Oregon Plan and petitioning Congress for a direct election amendment. Deadlocked elections and media coverage further fueled the push for direct election. In 1911, both chambers revisited the issue with H.J.Res. 39 proposed in the House. The 62nd Congress convened with H.J.Res. 39 as the House vehicle for the proposed amendment regarding the composition and election of Senators. The language closely mirrors the eventual Seventeenth Amendment, with provisions for election by the people, qualifications for electors, and procedures for filling vacancies in the Senate. The proposed amendment closely resembled the Seventeenth Amendment but included a controversial clause regarding the election process for Senators, which sparked debate over federal authority versus state sovereignty. The House rejected an effort to remove clause 2 from H.J.Res. 39, and approved the resolution intact. Senator Bristow offered an amended version in the Senate without the elections control clause. After almost two months of debate, a tie vote was broken by Vice President James Sherman in favor of the Bristow amendment. The Senate then approved the Seventeenth Amendment by a vote of 64 to 24, with little discussion on the vacancies clause. The curr_chunk discusses the provision for filling vacancies in the Senate, allowing the governor of a state to appoint a Senator temporarily until an election is held to fill the vacancy. This mirrors the current process for filling such vacancies. The Seventeenth Amendment directed the governor to call special elections to fill Senate vacancies, mirroring the process for filling vacancies in the House of Representatives. After a year of debate, the amendment was ratified in record time by the states. The Seventeenth Amendment directed governors to call special elections to fill Senate vacancies, following the process for House vacancies. Precedents were set in Maryland and Alabama regarding the power of governors to appoint interim Senators before ratification. The Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 directed governors to call special elections to fill Senate vacancies, following the process for House vacancies. The Alabama legislature had not passed legislation for gubernatorial appointments, leading to the Senate declining to seat an appointee. The Senate Historical Office records 198 appointments to the office of U.S. Senator since 1913, including Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. The report details the appointment of 195 individuals to the Senate, with 16 appointees being women. These appointments include widows, spouses, and daughters of incumbent Senators or governors. The data excludes \"technical\" resignations that ended in 1980, where retiring Senators resigned after the election of their successor to provide extra seniority. The practice of providing Senators-elect with extra seniority through technical resignations ended in 1980. Out of 194 Senators appointed before 2017, 60.8% sought election, with a success rate of 52.5%. A study from 1945 to 1979 showed a lower success rate in primary elections for appointed Senators. Appointed Senators face challenges in subsequent elections, with only half being successful and one-fifth failing to secure their party's nomination. Despite being full members of the Senate, their low survival rate suggests they lack the same advantages as \"normal\" incumbents. Controversies surrounding Senate vacancies in 2008 and 2009 have highlighted these challenges. In 2008 and 2009, proposals were made to limit gubernatorial power in filling Senate vacancies, including the Illinois Senate vacancy left by Barack Obama. H.R. 899 aimed to expedite special elections for Senate vacancies and assist states with election expenses while allowing gubernatorial appointments to continue. H.R. 899 proposed shorter tenures for appointed Senators and reimbursement for election costs to address concerns of state and local governments. It required special elections to fill Senate vacancies within 90 days of certification, following existing state laws. H.R. 899 proposed shorter tenures for appointed Senators and reimbursement for election costs. It aimed to eliminate states' authority for temporary Senate appointments and required special elections to fill vacancies within 90 days. Senator Russell D. Feingold introduced S.J.Res. 7 in 2009, aiming to require Senate vacancies to be filled by popular election. A companion measure, H.J.Res. 21, was introduced by Representative David Dreier. The proposed amendments sought to eliminate state-appointed Senators and mandate special elections within 90 days. The proposed amendment aimed to require Senate vacancies to be filled by popular election, eliminating state-appointed Senators. The amendment was debated in constitutional subcommittees in the House and Senate, with the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution approving S.J.Res. 7 for further consideration. Several states have introduced bills affecting the governor's appointment authority for filling U.S. Senate vacancies, with some states limiting or eliminating this power. Massachusetts changed its requirement for filling vacancies to allow temporary appointment by the governor followed by a special election. North Carolina and Maryland also enacted legislation related to Senate vacancies in recent years. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, most states have allowed governors to appoint Senate vacancies until a permanent replacement is elected. Controversies arose during the 2008 presidential election regarding these appointments, leading to proposals for changes at both federal and state levels. Interest in revising Senate vacancy procedures at the federal level has decreased, with relevant bills in the 111th Congress not progressing beyond hearings. Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, most states have allowed governors to appoint Senate vacancies until a permanent replacement is elected. Controversies arose during the 2008 presidential election regarding these appointments, leading to proposals for changes at both federal and state levels. However, amendments introduced in the 111th Congress did not progress beyond hearings, and no similar proposal has been offered since then. States like Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and Rhode Island took action between 2009 and 2015 to limit governors' role in filling Senate vacancies, but no further legislation has been reported. Recent actions show a return to the traditional pattern of Senate vacancies being filled by temporary appointments with little controversy."
