    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\". Congress finds that international terrorism poses a serious threat to the United States, and has the power to impose penalties on those supporting terrorist organizations. Terrorism impacts US commerce and limits international travel. Some foreign terrorist organizations raise significant funds outside the United States for conduct directed at the country. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 recognizes causes of action for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability. The legal framework for such liability is based on the Halberstam v. Welch case, which is widely acknowledged by the Supreme Court. The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 imposes an obligation on all countries to refrain from supporting terrorist acts and ensure justice for those involved. No country has the discretion to finance or sponsor terrorism knowingly. Persons, entities, or countries that contribute material support to terrorism will be held accountable. The United States has a vital interest in holding accountable those who knowingly or recklessly provide material support to persons or organizations that pose a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism. This includes providing full access to the court system for those injured in terrorist attacks to pursue civil claims against the responsible parties. The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants with a broad basis to seek relief against those who have provided material support to foreign organizations or persons engaging in terrorist activities against the United States. The Act aims to allow civil litigants to seek relief against those who support foreign organizations or individuals involved in terrorist activities. The Act allows for money damages to be sought against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage caused by the tortious act of the foreign state or its officials, including acts of terrorism or extrajudicial killing. The Act allows for money damages to be sought against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage caused by the tortious act of the foreign state or its officials, including acts of terrorism or extrajudicial killing. This excludes claims related to discretionary functions or malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, interference with contract rights, emotional distress, or derivative injury occurring outside the United States. The Act allows for money damages against a foreign state for physical injury, death, or property damage caused by acts of terrorism or extrajudicial killing. Definitions for terms like 'aircraft sabotage' and 'hostage taking' are provided in section 1605A(h), while 'terrorism' is defined as international and domestic terrorism in section 2331 of title 18. SEC. 4. AIDING AND ABETTING LIABILITY FOR CIVIL ACTIONS REGARDING TERRORIST ACTS. Section 2333 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to allow liability to be asserted against any person who aided, abetted, or conspired with the perpetrator of an act of international terrorism committed by a designated foreign terrorist organization. This amendment does not affect the immunity of foreign states under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The term defined in section 1603 of title 28, United States Code, pertains to jurisdiction under other law. SEC. 5 amends Section 2334 of title 18, United States Code, to grant district courts personal jurisdiction over individuals involved in international terrorism acts causing harm to U.S. nationals. SEC. 6 addresses liability of government officials in civil actions related to terrorist acts. Section 2337 of title 18, United States Code is amended to prevent suits against government officials. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest remains unaffected. Effective date is specified in Section 8. The amendments made by this Act apply to civil actions pending or commenced after the date of enactment, related to injuries after September 11, 2001. Passed by the Senate on December 11, 2014."
