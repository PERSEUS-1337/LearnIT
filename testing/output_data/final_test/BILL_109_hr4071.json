    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Accountability and Flexibility Associated With Spending on Transportation Act of 2005\". It provides transportation funding flexibility. The Act, known as the \"Accountability and Flexibility Associated With Spending on Transportation Act of 2005,\" allows states to use funds from the Highway Bridge Program and Projects of National and Regional Significance for designated projects. The Act allows states to use funds for designated projects under various transportation programs. Funding flexibility is provided for projects eligible for assistance. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act allows states to use funds for designated transportation projects under different programs. Funding flexibility is provided for eligible projects. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act allows recipients to use funds for eligible transportation projects, including those under section 5308 of title 49, United States Code. Funding flexibility is granted to carry out projects listed in the table or other eligible projects, excluding bus operations or facilities. Congress believes that State transportation departments should consider specific project descriptions outlined in various sections of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act when improving transportation safety. Additionally, there are provisions for across-the-board rescissions. In Fiscal Year 2006, $4,718,047,269 of unobligated funds for various transportation programs were rescinded. The Secretary determined each State's share of the amount to be rescinded. The Secretary of Transportation calculated each State's share of the $4,718,047,269 rescinded in Fiscal Year 2006 by considering the ratio of funds apportioned to each State for transportation programs. The Secretary will rescind unobligated funds available to the State on September 30, 2006, for various programs based on apportioned amounts for fiscal year 2006. The allocation among programs will be determined in consultation with the State. Restoration of funds for covered programs: If the rescission for a covered program exceeds the calculated amount, the State must immediately restore funds from unobligated balances of other programs to ensure the net rescission does not exceed the calculated amount. Restored funds under clause (i) are deemed as rescinded funds for obligation purposes. A \"covered program\" refers to specific programs authorized under various sections of title 23, United States Code. There is a limitation on recalculating the equity bonus program amounts. In fiscal year 2006, amounts determined and allocated under section 105 of title 23, United States Code, will not be recalculated due to a rescission. The STP set-aside program is defined as the amount set aside for transportation enhancement activities. For fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009, 10 percent of authorized amounts will be rescinded. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (Public Law 109-59) authorizes appropriations for the equity bonus program under section 105 of title 23, United States Code. Rescissions of authorized amounts take effect before any allocation or set aside. There are limitations on recalculating the equity bonus program amounts. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (Public Law 109-59) authorizes appropriations for the equity bonus program under section 105 of title 23, United States Code. Rescissions of authorized amounts take effect before any allocation or set aside, and the amounts allocated shall not be recalculated. Amendments include adding high priority projects and transportation improvements. Reports on rescissions must be submitted to Congress within 60 days. The rescission made by subsection (b) specifies the amount rescinded for each program or activity referred to in subsection (a)."
