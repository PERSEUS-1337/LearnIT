    "content": "The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) includes State-State and investor-State dispute settlement mechanisms. These provisions need to be considered alongside other PTPA obligations and exceptions to understand the scope of obligations under the agreement. The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) incorporates general exceptions from WTO agreements, an \"essential security\" exception, and was approved by the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act in 2007. It entered into force in 2009 and includes provisions involving labor and the environment. The 2007 revision of the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) incorporated provisions on labor, the environment, intellectual property, government procurement, port security, and investment. This revision, known as the May 10 agreement, aimed to expand labor and environmental obligations in FTAs, with similar dispute settlement mechanisms as commercial obligations. Similar approaches are seen in U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Korea, and other countries. The U.S. free trade agreements with Colombia, Korea, and Panama are awaiting approval by Congress. There have been no disputes initiated under the PTPA State-State dispute settlement mechanism. The use of panels for FTA State-State dispute settlement has been uncommon due to consultative arrangements that facilitate informal dispute resolution. WTO dispute settlement is available for disputes under both WTO agreements and FTAs. On July 19, 2011, the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs accepted a case related to labor and environmental disputes. The Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) of the U.S. Department of Labor accepted a petition by a Peruvian union under the PTPA labor chapter, alleging Peru's violation of collective bargaining rights. The review aims to gather information and report on the U.S. Government's views within 180 days. The United States may request consultations with Peru under Chapter Seventeen of the PTPA if there is a failure to resolve a matter within 60 days. This could lead to further dispute settlement proceedings if consultations are unsuccessful. To establish a violation under Article 17.2.1, the US must show that Peru has not maintained a law affecting trade or investment. Dispute resolution procedures under the PTPA labor chapter are discussed in detail in the report. In late December 2010, the U.S. firm Renco Group, Inc. submitted a notice of intent to initiate arbitration under the PTPA investor-State dispute settlement provisions against Peru for alleged violations of investment agreements. The firm filed its arbitral claim in April 2011. Investor-State cases under FTAs, such as NAFTA, have been more common than State-State cases. NAFTA investor-State cases have been brought against all three agreement Parties, and there have been five cases filed by U.S. investors under DR-CAFTA. No investor-State claims have been filed under other U.S. FTAs. Dispute settlement under the PTPA involves consultation requests by the complaining Party and responses from the other Party. Each Party must provide sufficient information for a full examination of the dispute. The PTPA dispute settlement process involves consultation requests by the complaining Party and responses from the other Party. If the dispute is not resolved within a specified timeframe, either Party may request a meeting of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Commission to promptly resolve the issue through various means such as technical advisers, working groups, conciliation, or mediation. If the matter remains unresolved after the Commission's involvement, recommendations may be made. The PTPA dispute settlement process allows for the establishment of an arbitral panel if the issue is not resolved within a specified timeframe after the Commission's involvement. Panels consist of three members, with the complaining and defending Parties appointing one panelist each. If they cannot agree on a third panelist, one will be selected by lot from a roster of panelists. The panel selection process in PTPA disputes must adhere to set timelines. The panel's initial report, due within 120 days of the last panelist selection, includes findings of facts and compliance determinations. Recommendations for dispute resolution may be included. The final report, due 30 days after the initial report, must be considered by the disputing Parties for resolution. The final report in PTPA disputes requires the disputing Parties to agree on resolving the dispute based on the panel's findings. If non-conformity is found, the resolution aims to eliminate it, possibly through law modification. Temporary measures like compensation or benefit suspension can be implemented until full compliance. Dispute settlement results are non-self-executing under U.S. law, requiring legislation for compliance if the executive branch lacks authority. If the disputing Parties cannot agree on resolving the dispute within 45 days after receiving the final report, the defending Party must negotiate compensation with the complainant. If no agreement is reached within 30 days, the complaining Party may suspend benefits, such as imposing tariff surcharges on selected imports from the defending Party. The defending Party can challenge the proposed retaliation if it deems it excessive or believes it has complied with the dispute. If the panel determines that the proposed suspension of benefits is excessive, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the proper level of retaliation. If the defending Party agrees to pay an \"annual monetary assessment\" or fine, benefits cannot be suspended. If the disputing Parties cannot agree on the fine amount within 30 days, it will be set at 50% of the proper level of benefits determined by the panel. The defending Party may be required to pay a 50% assessment to the complaining Party, to be paid in installments or into a fund for trade initiatives. Failure to pay may result in suspension of agreement benefits. Compliance determination by a panel is necessary before sanctions are imposed. The defending Party can request a compliance panel if it believes it has complied, with a decision to be made within 90 days. If the panel rules in favor of the defending Party, the complaining Party must end any trade retaliation and no monetary assessment is required. Private right of action under domestic law is prohibited, and challenges can only be made by the United States. The PTPA prohibits challenges by entities other than the United States against U.S. agencies based on PTPA inconsistency. It incorporates additional labor and environmental obligations compared to previous FTAs, expands dispute settlement procedures, and does not limit remedies for non-compliance to monetary assessments. The PTPA includes labor rights based on the 1998 ILO Declaration, such as freedom of association, collective bargaining, elimination of forced labor, child labor abolition, and non-discrimination in employment. The PTPA labor chapter does not reference core ILO Conventions but focuses on the ILO Declaration. To establish a violation, a Party must show failure to maintain laws affecting trade or investment. Parties are prohibited from waiving statutes implementing labor rights that impact trade or investment. The PTPA labor chapter focuses on the ILO Declaration and prohibits waiving statutes implementing labor rights that impact trade or investment. Dispute settlement procedures apply to disputes arising under Chapter Seventeen without limitations, requiring initial consultations and potential involvement of the bilateral Labor Affairs Council. If a dispute is not resolved within 60 days, the complaining Party may seek further consultations or a meeting of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Commission. The PTPA labor chapter focuses on the ILO Declaration and prohibits waiving statutes implementing labor rights that impact trade or investment. Dispute settlement procedures apply to disputes arising under Chapter Seventeen without limitations, requiring initial consultations and potential involvement of the bilateral Labor Affairs Council. Parties may seek consultations or a meeting of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Commission under the general dispute settlement chapter and may invoke the rest of the chapter. Unlike earlier FTAs with labor chapters, the prevailing Party in a PTPA dispute is not initially limited to seeking the payment of an annual monetary assessment or fine by the defending Party. The PTPA allows the prevailing Party in a dispute to impose trade sanctions on the non-complying Party if they fail to pay the monetary assessment. The defending Party can choose to pay the assessment or contribute to a fund for compliance. Unlike previous FTAs, the PTPA includes substantive environmental obligations and applies general dispute settlement procedures to environmental disputes. The PTPA requires each Party to enforce environmental laws affecting trade or investment. It also mandates adoption of laws to fulfill obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. Disputes under the environment chapter are subject to Chapter Twenty-One dispute settlement procedures. The PTPA mandates enforcement of environmental laws affecting trade or investment and adoption of laws to fulfill obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. Disputes under the environment chapter are subject to Chapter Twenty-One dispute settlement procedures, including initial consultations and potential involvement of the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Commission. If disputes are not resolved within 60 days, further provisions of the chapter may be pursued, with specific directions for dispute panels involving obligations under multilateral environmental agreements. The PTPA allows for enforcement of environmental laws related to trade and investment, with dispute settlement procedures in place. Disputes may involve interpretations of obligations under multilateral environmental agreements, with fines imposed by panels capped at $15 million annually. Sanctions can also be imposed to ensure compliance with agreement obligations. The PTPA allows for enforcement of environmental laws related to trade and investment, with dispute settlement procedures in place. Sanctions may be imposed on the defending Party for non-payment of fines, with the option to pay an annual monetary assessment or contribute to a fund for compliance. Chapter Ten of the PTPA sets out rights and obligations for investment facilitation. Chapter Ten of the PTPA outlines rights and obligations to facilitate investment between the United States and Peru, including national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment, and minimum standards of treatment for foreign investors. It also covers compensation for expropriation, free transfer of investment-related funds, and restrictions on certain performance requirements. The obligations in Chapter Ten are subject to exceptions, exemptions, and qualifications, with annexes addressing specific investment issues. The PTPA includes provisions on investment issues, such as expropriation and ensuring equal rights for foreign and domestic investors. It states that foreign investors should not have greater rights than domestic investors under domestic law. The PTPA includes provisions for investor-State dispute settlement, allowing investors to file arbitral claims against Peru and the United States for violations of Chapter Ten obligations. If a dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, arbitration can be pursued by an investor of a Party. Investor-State dispute settlement under the PTPA allows investors to file claims for breaches of investment obligations, authorizations, or agreements. Claims must be submitted within three years of knowledge of the breach and resulting loss or damage. This mechanism can also be used for disputes involving financial services institutions in the United States and Peru. The PTPA allows investor claims for breaches of investment obligations, authorizations, or agreements. Consent to arbitration is required in writing. Chapter Ten does not mandate exhaustion of local remedies before filing a claim. Various arbitral mechanisms can be used, including ICSID Convention and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. A three-member arbitral tribunal will be established once a claim is filed. Chapter Ten of the PTPA outlines the rules for investor claims, including the establishment of a three-member arbitral tribunal and procedures for conducting the arbitration. The tribunal must rule expeditiously on any preliminary objections raised by the defending party. Amicus submissions from non-disputing parties may be accepted. The tribunal in investor claims must rule promptly on preliminary objections. Defending parties can seek early rulings on jurisdictional issues, potentially leading to case dismissal. Claims with common elements may be consolidated. Documents and tribunal decisions are made public, with public hearings required. Tribunal decisions must align with PTPA obligations and international law, and are bound by interpretations issued by the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Commission. The tribunal's decision in investor claims is binding and must align with PTPA obligations. Monetary awards can be given for damages or property restitution, along with costs and attorney's fees. An arbitral award is only binding between the disputing parties. Enforcement of the final award can be sought after a waiting period, and non-compliance may lead to further proceedings. If a party does not comply with a final award, the claimant can request a panel under the PTPA State-State dispute settlement chapter to determine the non-compliance and recommend compliance. The prevailing investor can also seek enforcement of the award through multilateral conventions such as the ICSID Convention, the New York Convention, and the Inter-American Convention."
