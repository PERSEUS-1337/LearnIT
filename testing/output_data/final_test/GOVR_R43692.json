    "content": "Amid concerns about college affordability, this report examines the relationship between student aid and college prices. It analyzes trends in college prices and student aid, focusing on the idea that increases in student aid may lead to higher college prices. The report includes an introduction to college costs and prices, data on price increases at colleges and universities, and comparisons of those increases over the past decade. In the past decade, various measures of college price increases have been compared to inflation rates. The report also examines trends in student aid and explores possible explanations for rising college prices, with a focus on the impact of student aid on price hikes. Rising college prices and concerns about affordability have been prominent in recent years. College affordability is a key focus for federal policy makers due to the increasing prices of higher education. They are concerned about ensuring access to affordable education for individuals and the overall vitality of the labor force. The federal government plays a significant role in providing direct aid to postsecondary students, supporting the majority of such aid. The federal government provides significant aid to postsecondary students, amounting to roughly $170 billion or 71% of total aid. There are concerns about the efficacy of federal aid programs in promoting postsecondary access, attainment, and affordability, with some suggesting that aid may be contributing to rising college prices. Examining changes in college prices is crucial, but determining the appropriate measure of price is a challenge. Understanding the difference between college costs from the institution's perspective and prices for students is important in assessing college affordability. The term cost in college refers to what institutions spend on education, supported by government funding, endowment revenue, and student payments. College prices are what students pay for higher education, with only a portion of costs covered by students. Colleges publish list prices for reference. Colleges determine list prices for tuition, fees, room, and board, but often offer discounts based on financial need or merit. The actual price students pay, known as net price, is the amount after deducting grant and scholarship aid. Government subsidies help reduce the cost for students. When examining college affordability, tracking changes in net price is more helpful than focusing on published prices. However, historical data on net price is not as readily available, making it challenging to systematically track trends. Institutions often offer discounts on tuition, resulting in net tuition revenue, which reflects the average revenue per student after discounts. This adds complexity to the discussion on college prices. When discussing college prices, distinctions are made between tuition and fees versus total cost of attendance, which includes other expenses like room and board. It is important to consider total cost of attendance when presenting trends to prospective students and determining eligibility for federal student aid programs. Measures of college price can include expenses related to the student's cost of attendance. Net price is based on full cost of attendance, while net tuition is based on tuition and fees. The focus is on four-year public and private nonprofit institutions, which serve half of the student population. Research on college price increases typically centers on these institutions. The curr_chunk focuses on the affordability debate surrounding four-year public and private nonprofit institutions in the policy discourse on college price increases. Public colleges aim to provide affordable higher education options for state residents and have tuition levels established by legislatures or governing agencies. Entities in many states have primary tuition-setting authority, with processes involving input from various stakeholders. The share of education expenses borne by students versus taxpayers is a key consideration. Private nonprofit colleges rely heavily on tuition revenue to cover costs, considering factors like revenue needs and peer institution prices. Tuition discounting is used to aid enrollment. Private nonprofit colleges and universities use tuition discounting as a pricing strategy to meet enrollment and revenue goals. This practice involves setting prices based on consumers' ability or willingness to pay, filling seats, and enhancing academic profiles. Private nonprofit colleges and universities use tuition discounting as a pricing strategy to meet enrollment and revenue goals. Roughly three out of five students at these institutions receive a discount, with discount rates ranging from 27% to 36%. Public institutions also engage in tuition discounting for similar reasons as private institutions. At public four-year institutions, price discounting is a widespread practice, benefiting roughly one out of five students. Discount rates range from 12% to 18%, depending on the type of institution. Prices are also differentiated through separate tuition levels for in-state and out-of-state students, with out-of-state tuition set at higher levels to generate more revenue. Some institutions may increase nonresident students to boost tuition revenues. Various factors impact pricing at public and private nonprofit institutions. Prices at public and private nonprofit institutions are influenced by various factors, leading to price differentiation across students. College prices have consistently increased at rates higher than inflation in recent decades. Examining price increases can be complex due to variations in pricing practices. A complication in assessing price increases in colleges and universities stems from variations in pricing practices. List prices, although not always the most informative measure, are commonly reported and can grab headlines. Approximately 59.1% of undergraduates received grant aid in 2011-2012, reducing the list price for many students. High list prices often receive substantial attention from prospective students and policymakers. The text discusses how list prices for postsecondary education have been increasing at a rate higher than inflation, as shown by the Consumer Price Index. This trend is illustrated in Figure 2, which compares the cost of attendance to inflation rates over the past decade. Figure 2 illustrates the trend in list prices for undergraduate students at four-year public and private nonprofit institutions from 2000-2001 to 2011-2012. The average annual increase above inflation was 3.5% for public institutions and 2.4% for private institutions. In 2003-2004, public institutions saw the largest increase above inflation at 6.8%. Despite a small decline in the CPI-U in 2009-2010, the cost of attendance still rose by 5.3% at public institutions and 3.7% at private institutions. In 2009-2010, the average cost of attendance increased by 5.3% at four-year public institutions and 3.7% at private institutions. Private institutions have less volatile changes in cost of attendance, possibly due to not relying on state funding. Institutions offer various types of price discounts through grants and scholarships, with approximately 20% of undergraduates receiving institutional grants averaging $6,400 in the 2011-2012 academic year. Institutions provide discounts through grants and scholarships, with about 20% of undergraduates receiving institutional grants averaging $6,400. Federal, state, and outside grants also help lower out-of-pocket costs for students. Net price, the actual cost after deducting grant and scholarship assistance, is crucial for assessing college affordability. Data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) can identify trends in net price, with the latest available data from the 2011-2012 academic year. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) provides detailed information on student budgets and aid packages, allowing for the calculation of net price by subtracting grant aid. Table 1 shows average net prices at four-year public and private nonprofit institutions for various academic years. Over a 12-year period, there were changes in net prices at these institutions. Over a 12-year period, the average net price at four-year public and private nonprofit institutions exceeded inflation by around 23.7% to 23.9%. The largest increases in net prices occurred in recent four-year intervals, with public institutions seeing a 7.60% increase between AY2007-2008 and AY2011-2012, and private nonprofit institutions experiencing a 10.61% increase between AY2003-2004 and AY2007-2008. Net price data is only available at four-year intervals, making it challenging to determine reasons for the higher rate of increase in either sector. The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is another source for net price information, mandated by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) calculates and publishes the average net price of postsecondary institutions on its College Navigator website. This data is generated by subtracting grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. The College Affordability and Transparency Center displays this information annually to meet HEOA requirements, focusing on full-time, first-time degree-seeking undergraduates who received aid. The average net price of postsecondary institutions is calculated by subtracting grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. However, this calculation excludes a significant number of students who did not receive any grant aid, leading to potentially misleading averages. An alternative approach is to evaluate net college prices by looking at institutional grant aid and tuition revenue received after discounts, shifting the focus to the institution's net revenue per student. This perspective highlights the revenue received for tuition and fees. The approach focuses on net tuition revenue received for charges related to tuition and fees only, excluding other revenue from room, board, and other services. The IPEDS Analytics: Delta Cost Project Database 1987-2010 allows for stable comparisons of institutional characteristics over multiple years. This dataset enables the comparison of changes in average net tuition revenue on a FTE student basis. Net tuition revenue is the total revenue received at an institution from tuition and fees, excluding institutional grant aid. Data from the IPEDS Analytics: Delta Cost Project Database 1987-2010 shows the average net tuition revenue at IHEs by Carnegie sector in constant 2010 dollars for academic years 1999-2000 to 2009-2010 on a FTE student basis. Public bachelor IHEs saw a 59% increase in average net tuition revenue, while private, nonprofit bachelor IHEs had a 24% increase during the same period. During the period from AY1999-2000 to AY2009-2010, net tuition revenue at public IHEs increased annually by 4.49%\u20134.79%, while private, nonprofit IHEs saw an annual increase of 1.70%\u20132.17%. Public IHEs experienced the largest increases in net tuition revenue from AY2002-2003 to AY2004-2005, coinciding with a decline in state appropriations for higher education. This suggests that public IHEs may be relying more on student revenue during this time. The examination of recent trends in college prices shows that regardless of source or definition, each price measure outpaced inflation. From AY1991-1992 to AY2011-2012, the published cost of attendance at four-year public institutions exceeded inflation by an average of 3% each year. Additionally, from AY1990-1991 to AY1999-2000, the published cost of attendance at these institutions also outpaced inflation. From AY1990-1991 to AY1999-2000, published cost of attendance (COA) at four-year public and private institutions exceeded inflation by 2.2% and 2.4% each year, respectively. The report explores reasons for college price increases, focusing on the relationship between student aid and price hikes. Recent changes in student aid are highlighted using data from The College Board's 2013 Trends in Student Aid. Average grant aid per FTE undergraduate student has increased by 57% from AY2002-2003 to AY2012-2013, after adjusting for inflation. Loan aid and federal tax benefits per FTE have also increased by 44% and 132%, respectively, over the same time period. The substantial increase in grant aid in AY2009-2010, likely due to Pell Grant aid, aligns with boosts in loan aid and tax benefits in AY2008-2009 and AY2009-2010. The annual changes in average aid per FTE student for various types of aid were more volatile than changes in prices, suggesting that aid and prices move in the same direction but can vary significantly from year to year. Trends in aid show patterns of large escalations followed by periods of little change or. The annual changes in average student aid per FTE student for different types of aid were more volatile than price changes, indicating that aid and prices generally move in the same direction but can fluctuate significantly from year to year. This relationship between student aid and college prices is the main focus of the report. The next section of the report explores various explanations for rising college prices, including external and internal factors. These explanations offer insight into the complex factors influencing price escalation. The \"cost disease\" thesis, introduced by Baumol and Bowen in the mid-1960s, explains how colleges pass on increased costs to consumers, with wages in labor-intensive service industries rising rapidly. This contributes to college price increases above the rate of inflation. The \"cost disease\" theory argues that wages increase more rapidly in labor-intensive service industries, such as higher education, law, medicine, and investment counseling. This leads to increased costs for consumers, particularly in education, as labor costs are passed on through price increases. The limited-scale interaction between service provider and recipient in these industries hinders productivity improvements through capital or technology substitution. The cost disease thesis suggests that as wages rise, higher education must pay higher wages to attract skilled workers, leading to increased college costs. Despite rising prices, more students have enrolled in colleges over the last few decades. The population of students in four-year institutions has increased from 7.6 million in 1980 to 13.3 million in 2010. The share of 18-24 year olds attending four-year institutions has increased from 18.6% to 28.2%. Total enrollment in two-year and four-year institutions has grown from 12.1 million to 21.0 million. The earnings premium associated with college degrees is a key factor driving consumer demand, with individuals holding a bachelor's degree expected to earn $2.4 million over a 40-year period. The value of a college education is evident in the earnings premium, with individuals holding a bachelor's degree expected to earn $2.4 million over a 40-year period. Colleges sell a product with great economic value, as the degree serves as a prerequisite for many positions. The demand for postsecondary education is durable, leading to little pressure on institutions to provide services more cost-effectively. Postsecondary education is funded through government appropriations, gifts, endowments, and tuition fees. State subsidies to public higher education institutions have decreased per student, leading to a reliance on tuition revenue. State appropriations for higher education have not kept pace with enrollment growth, resulting in a 21.6% decline in education appropriations per student over a 25-year period. Tuition revenue for public institutions has increased from 23.2% in 1986 to 43.3% in 2011. Endowment contributions fluctuate, with the size of endowments changing based on market conditions. Declining revenues have led colleges to rely more on tuition and price increases. The \"revenue theory\" thesis by Howard Bowen suggests that internal decisions drive higher education costs. Institutions prioritize excellence, prestige, and influence, with few limits on spending. Howard Bowen's \"revenue theory\" thesis suggests that colleges prioritize excellence, prestige, and influence, leading to increased spending. Institutions focus on raising as much money as possible and spend all they raise, with the cost of an institution determined by its revenue. Colleges are primarily focused on academic excellence and enhancing the educational experience, rather than efficiency. A growing area of spending is on institutional student aid, which has been increasing at both private and public colleges. In the 2011-2012 academic year, 20% of undergraduates received institutional grants averaging $6,400. Public four-year institutions gave grants to 21% of students averaging $4,100, while private nonprofit four-year institutions provided grants to 58% of students averaging $13,200. $32.8 billion was spent on undergraduate institutional aid across all institution types. Charging higher prices to some students helps offset the cost of discounting prices for targeted students. Some institutions charge higher prices to students with greater ability to pay, creating a cyclical problem. This leads to more discounting for targeted students, burdening those who pay full price. Institutions may publish high prices to signal quality and often follow pricing trends of peer institutions. Students may perceive higher prices as indicative of higher quality. The \"Chivas Regal effect\" suggests that higher prices can signal higher quality products, leading colleges to set prices accordingly. This pricing strategy may motivate colleges to raise list prices, impacting those who pay full price and affecting net prices for students. Critiques of college practices, decisions, and governance structures related to costs and prices are common in literature. Critiques of college practices include issues like class size, teaching loads, technology use, tenure policies, faculty governance, and cost control. Lack of studies on productivity and cost-effective practices is noted, with concerns about inefficient work processes and governance structures contributing to price increases. Questions are raised about the \"full service model\" colleges offer, including amenities like manicured lawns, dining halls, athletic programs, and student activities. Critiques of college practices include issues like class size, teaching loads, technology use, tenure policies, faculty governance, and cost control. Some suggest that the bundling of nonessential components in educational offerings may be driving up prices, making it difficult for consumers to purchase only the services they need. This critique questions the need for as much subsidy to be devoted to faculty research and publication. Federal higher education policy has been in place since the enactment of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Federal higher education policy, focused on college access and affordability through direct aid to students, has faced scrutiny over its effectiveness in making college more affordable. Former Secretary of Education William Bennett highlighted in a 1987 op-ed that federal student aid policies may have enabled colleges to raise tuition prices, although they do not directly cause inflation. The \"Bennett Hypothesis\" suggests that increases in student aid may unintentionally lead to price increases in colleges. This hypothesis has sparked questions about the effects of student aid on college prices, with two main lines of inquiry focusing on aid recipients. The questions raised by CRS focus on the impact of different types of aid on college affordability and whether aid recipients actually benefit from reduced net prices. Another set of questions examines if increases in various types of aid could lead to inflation in college prices, regardless of the aid's intended purpose. Research on federal aid programs addresses these questions beyond just the prices faced by aid recipients. Policy makers are concerned about whether increasing aid will actually lower net prices for students as intended, due to the possibility of colleges raising prices and capturing part of the aid increase. An increase in aid may result in a lower reduction in net price for recipients, as colleges could capture aid by raising prices or replacing institutional aid. Policy makers also worry that increased aid could lead to price increases, signaling colleges to rely more on tuition revenue. This concern extends to students targeted by aid and those who are not, raising questions about the broader impact on prices. Prices are commonly raised with regard to various types of aid, such as loan aid and tax credits. Loan aid is not aimed at reducing net price for student borrowers but rather helps finance postsecondary education. Questions arise about the unintended effects of making low-cost capital widely available, potentially leading to colleges increasing tuition revenue and resulting in price increases for students. Tax credits also face similar inquiries and are available to a broad range of students and families. Federal grants are more narrowly targeted towards high-need students, unlike tax credits which are broadly available. Concerns arise about the unintended effects of grant increases on institutional pricing for all students. Grant recipients may not always realize desired gains in purchasing power due to institutional behavior. Concerns arise that government promises to cover students' full costs could incentivize institutions to raise prices, similar to past issues with Pell Grants and tax credits. The breadth of targeting for aid recipients may have unintended effects, especially for a small proportion of students. Studies on the effects of aid increases on prices will be discussed in the report. The report will discuss the effects of aid increases on prices, focusing on the alignment with policy questions, types of aid studied, and the findings of relevant studies conducted over the last decade. Studies have investigated the potential causal link between college prices and financial aid, with a search for published studies or working papers after 2000. The report discusses the effects of aid increases on college prices, focusing on various types of aid studied in nine research studies. Grant aid is the most commonly studied form of aid, with a focus on federal aid in five studies and state grant aid in one study. The studies primarily focus on state grant aid and institutional price responses, rather than the impact of student aid on reducing net price. The relationship between prices and loans or tax assistance is not extensively researched. College prices and federal financial aid have both increased over the last decade, showing a positive correlation. The \"Bennett Hypothesis\" is proposed to explain this correlation. The Bennett Hypothesis suggests that colleges raise prices in response to the availability of federal financial aid. However, drawing causal conclusions from correlational relationships is problematic. A correlational relationship between two variables cannot determine causality. An alternative explanation for the Bennett Hypothesis is that a third variable, like the actual cost of attendance, may be driving increases in college prices and federal financial aid. Limited studies suggest that increases in federal financial aid lead to increases in college prices. The literature review examines the relationship between college prices and financial aid, focusing on studies that isolate a causal effect. The review provides brief summaries of nine studies, presenting research design, major hypothesis, main results, and limitations. Table 5 summarizes the findings in terms of consistency with the Bennett Hypothesis. The studies analyzed in the literature review vary in terms of research questions, analytical approaches, data selection, and model specifications. While they address common policy issues, they differ in numerous ways, making it challenging to summarize their findings concisely. Comparing and contrasting these studies is particularly difficult due to their diverse methodologies and focuses. The studies analyzed in the literature review vary in research questions, analytical approaches, data selection, and model specifications. Comparing and contrasting these studies is challenging due to their diverse methodologies and focuses. There is no consensus on the relationship between federal financial aid and college prices, with findings evenly distributed between supportive, mixed, or not supportive of the Bennett Hypothesis. Contradictory findings exist within studies, depending on the specifications used in different models. The studies analyzed in the literature review vary in research questions, analytical approaches, and model specifications. Findings are limited by challenges in measuring price change and isolating the effects of student aid on prices. Lack of a good measure of net or effective price hinders understanding the relationship between aid and price. Outcome variables used to measure \"college price\" differ across studies, making it difficult to compare results. Available data do not allow for measuring price changes for individual students or subgroups like aid recipients. The lack of individual level data or precise institution level data hinders analyses on price changes for specific student groups or aid recipients within an institution. This leads to reliance on measuring changes in list price or average institutional grant aid per FTE student, which may not accurately reflect the real prices paid by students. Limitations exist when using average institutional grant aid as outcome measures, as they only apply to a specific segment of the student population. These averages are based on data from full-time, first-time, degree-seeking fall enrollees, excluding part-time students and those not in their first semester. Changes in price or grant aid may differ for students included and omitted from these averages, potentially missing part of an institutional price response. Additionally, these measures do not encompass all charges included in prices. The lack of data allows for average institutional charges for room and board to be calculated, leading to challenges in analyzing the effects of student aid on net price components. Researchers often examine the effects of student aid on institutional grants and tuition prices separately due to the lack of comprehensive measures of average net price at an institution. An increase in list price without a corresponding increase in institutional grant aid may indicate that an institution is capturing aid. However, this method often leads to conflicting findings and does not consider how other factors like tuition discounting or room and board charges affect students. The extent to which an institution benefits from increased financial aid depends on various response mechanisms. The impact of financial aid on actual prices for students is measured through various mechanisms, but data limitations prevent the ideal outcome measure. Studies focus on changes in list prices and average institutional grants, raising questions about whether outcome variables truly capture the change in price. Studies on the relationship between grant aid and prices face challenges in establishing causality due to the lack of an outcome variable that accurately captures price changes. The inability to control the policy implementation environment limits the ability to draw firm conclusions. Most studies rely on regression analysis to attempt to establish causal connections between aid and prices. Regression analysis is commonly used in studies examining the relationship between federal aid and college prices, but establishing causality is challenging due to the wide range of covariates used in different studies. These covariates include state appropriations, endowment, income per capita, selectivity, home equity, unemployment, population demographics, and governing boards. There is little consistency in the mix of covariates used across studies. The mix of covariates used in studies on the relationship between federal aid and college prices varies greatly, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in making comparisons. This lack of consistency hinders the ability to reach a consensus or draw robust conclusions. Additionally, establishing causality in regression models is challenging due to the complex interactions among variables in real-world policy phenomena. In studies on the relationship between federal aid and college prices, the complex interactions among variables make it difficult to establish causality. Endogeneity bias can occur when the level and structure of financial aid are influenced by pricing strategies of higher education institutions. Instrumental variables can be used to address this bias by finding a variable related to the independent variable but exogenous to the dependent variable. The studies review the use of instrumental variables to correct for endogeneity bias in analyzing the relationship between financial aid and college prices. Valid instruments like state tax revenue and state lottery revenues are used to isolate the effect of aid on price. The difficulty in selecting appropriate instruments is highlighted by the range of variables used, such as median home equity, institutional quality rankings, and SAT scores. The studies discuss the importance of selecting instrumental variables to correct for bias in analyzing the relationship between financial aid and college prices. Omitted Variable Bias can lead to biased effects of included variables in regression equations. It is challenging to interpret the substantive meaning of instrumental variables and determine the best model to explain changes in prices. It is difficult to construct a perfectly controlled study that includes every variable with explanatory power. Studies examining the relationship between grant aid and prices may not include all variables that affect prices due to measurement limitations or data availability. Excluded variables can lead to attributing their effects to other included variables like grant aid in regression equations. Natural and quasi experimental designs face challenges in establishing causality, such as constructing well-matched comparison groups and obtaining necessary data. The review of studies on federal financial aid and college prices shows inconclusive results with contradictory findings. There is no consensus on the causal relationship between aid and price due to the difficulty in isolating the effect of financial aid on rising college prices. Rising costs in higher education are likely influenced by multiple factors, making it challenging to attribute price increases solely to increases in federal financial aid. The relationship between financial aid and rising college prices is complex and inconclusive. Various factors contribute to increasing costs in higher education, such as reductions in state funding, faculty and staff expenses, technology investments, and institutional aid. The lack of consensus on the impact of financial aid on price changes is partly due to the limited studies with significant changes in aid levels. The absence of clear evidence does not negate the possibility of a causal relationship between financial aid and college prices. The relationship between changes in financial aid and college prices is complex and varied among institutions. Highly selective institutions may not benefit much from federal grant aid increases, while community colleges may struggle to capture aid due to their focus on access and affordability. Tuition discounting further complicates the relationship between aid and price changes. The complex relationship between aid changes and price changes in colleges poses challenges due to data constraints, methodological issues, and various explanations for price increases. Research may not provide a clear diagnosis or solution for the problem of rising prices surpassing inflation. Concerns about college affordability persist, with limited evidence on the impact of aid on prices available to guide decision-making. There is a perceived information imbalance between colleges setting prices and students paying and subsidizing them. Colleges gather extensive information on students' financial circumstances to set prices, but share limited pricing information. This lack of transparency hinders oversight and research on the link between student aid increases and price hikes. Without better data, research on pricing behavior and affordability issues may be limited. Some policy questions regarding federal aid for students, such as the impact on student loan prices and tax credits, are not extensively researched. Existing studies focus on general price responses rather than specific effects on aid recipients or student subgroups, possibly due to data limitations. Conceptual alignment between policy questions and empirical research is unclear, particularly regarding the unit of analysis (individual students, groups, or schools). The research focuses on the unit of analysis, whether it is students, groups, or institutions. Policy questions regarding federal aid for students are not extensively researched, with existing studies focusing on general price responses. The appendix provides summaries of nine studies, detailing research design, hypotheses, results, and limitations. The study examines the relationship between federal student aid, institutional aid, and tuition revenues. It shows a positive association between federal student grant aid and private institution tuition revenue, with a net revenue gain per student. The results for public institutions are less significant and sensitive to the model used. Despite significant findings for private institutions, the model's explanatory power is low. The study found a positive association between federal grant aid and private institution tuition revenue, but did not consider other variables that likely explain most of the relationship. Cellini and Goldin conducted a study comparing tuition responses of Title IV eligible and non-Title IV eligible institutions, finding that Title IV eligible institutions charge higher tuition due to federal financial aid availability. Title IV institutions charge 75% more in tuition than non-Title IV eligible institutions, possibly due to capturing federal aid. However, the comparability of non-Title IV institutions, accreditation status, and unobservable differences may affect the findings. The study supports the Bennett Hypothesis, focusing on for-profit institutions where tuition discounting is less common. The findings apply to non-degree and sub-baccalaureate programs only, using regression models to explore how institutions adjust net price in response to changes in state financial aid policy. The authors examine institutional responses to changes in state financial aid policy, focusing on higher education governance structures. They investigate if institutional pricing policies align with state financial aid policies and analyze the impact of federal grant aid on net prices at public and private institutions. The results show a negative association between federal grant aid and private institution net prices, with a $1 increase in aid leading to a $0.48 decrease in net price. In fixed effects models, Curs and Dar find a negative relationship between federal grant aid and net price across institution types. However, in instrumental variable models, this relationship is only significant for net price in private institutions. They use regression models to test the impact of financial aid programs on institutional pricing strategies, finding that federal student grant aid is associated with a decrease in both in-state and out-of-state net prices. In federal grant aid, in-state net price falls $0.42 and out-of-state net price falls $0.51 at public institutions. For private institutions, a $1 increase in federal grant aid is associated with a $0.39 decrease in net price. However, the findings are sensitive to model specification, with changes in covariates affecting the significance of the association between federal grant aid and net price. Long (2004) studied the impact of the Georgia HOPE Scholarship program on list tuition prices. Public institutions saw a 3% decrease in tuition prices, contrary to the Bennett Hypothesis. Private institutions, however, experienced an increase in tuition prices. Long's study on the Georgia HOPE Scholarship program found that private institutions responded by raising tuition and lowering institutional aid, recouping $0.30 for every $1 of HOPE aid. Public institutions, on the other hand, decreased tuition but raised room and board fees, suggesting that sector plays a role in aid and price relationships. The Georgia HOPE Scholarship study suggests that it offers a valuable research opportunity, with aid-eligible students as the 'treatment group' and others as the 'control group.' Introduced in 1993, HOPE provides full tuition, fees, and a book allowance to Georgia residents with a \"B\" average attending public colleges. This program allows for causal inference, attributing changes in institutional behavior to HOPE. Surrounding states are also considered for comparison. The HOPE study in Georgia provides robust evidence for changes in higher education behavior, compared to surrounding states without similar merit-based programs. Results may not generalize to federal aid programs due to their non-merit-based nature. Long (2004) uses a differences-in-differences-in-differences design to study the impact of federal aid programs like the Hope Learning Credit and Lifetime Learning Tax Credit on institutions. The study examines the impact of tax credits on institutions with different levels of incentives to raise tuition prices. Lower-cost colleges with many credit-eligible students are more likely to increase list tuition prices in response to credit availability. Public two-year institutions with greater incentives experienced faster tuition price growth compared to those with lower incentives. No significant differences were found for public four-year institutions in states with high levels of state aid. In states with high state aid levels, public two-year and four-year institutions raised tuition faster, especially for two-year institutions with many credit-eligible students. Private institutions showed no significant effect. The study focuses on list tuition prices, not net measures, and highlights the complexity of interactive effects in the model. The findings suggest a consistent effect in public institutions, particularly two-year schools. Rizzo and Ehrenberg (2004) also explore tuition and enrollment relationships in their regression models. The authors include a Pell Grant variable in their equations to test the relationship between maximum Pell Grant award and in-state tuition at flagship public universities. They find a positive association, with a 10% increase in Pell award leading to a 4.8% increase in in-state tuition. The relationship between federal grant aid and tuition was significant in some models but not consistently strong enough to draw broad conclusions. Private institutions' price response is not modeled in this study. The study does not model private institutions' price response, and the subset of public institutions studied may not represent all public schools' reactions to federal grant aid changes. The study's extensive use of covariates makes comparisons with other studies challenging. Additionally, the model specifications for the featured findings are not clearly explained. Singell and Stone (2007) use various regression models to test the Bennett Hypothesis. Singell and Stone use regression models to test the Bennett Hypothesis, examining the impact of Pell Grant aid on public and private university tuition prices. They find mixed effects, with a positive relationship between Pell Grant aid and public in-state tuition prices, a positive association for public out-of-state tuition, and significant but mixed results for private tuition. Singell and Stone find a significant relationship between Pell Grant awards and tuition prices, with public out-of-state tuition increasing by $0.80 and private tuition by $0.86 for every $1 increase in Pell Grant per recipient. They also report little difference between list and net tuition effects of Pell Grants at a subset of 71 universities. Turner Turner's (2012) study examines how institutions respond to Pell Grant aid by adjusting institutional aid rather than tuition fees. She finds that each dollar of Pell Grant aid reduces students' effective prices by 84%, with institutions capturing the remaining 16% through lower institutional grant aid. This capture varies across sectors and institution selectivity. In Turner's (2012) study, institutions adjust institutional aid in response to Pell Grant aid, with selectivity being the primary determinant of Pell capture. Nonselective private institutions capture 18% of every Pell dollar, while selective nonprofits capture 79%. Capture is measured by the percent that institutional grant aid changes in response to Pell Grant aid, reflecting the \"effective price\" for students. The study does not consider the impact of other sources of institutional revenue on capture. Turner's study on institutional aid adjustment in response to Pell Grant aid is unique as it uses NPSAS data, unlike other studies using IPEDS data. Turner argues that tuition does not respond to Pell Grant aid due to timing, shutting off a potential adjustment channel. The study combines four waves of NPSAS data (1996, 2000, 2004, 2008), but implications of this aggregation are unclear. Regression discontinuity is a quasi-experimental method that approximates natural or randomized experiments by allowing for a clear pretest-posttest design. This method relies on a break point in the population, such as a Pell Grant eligibility threshold, to infer causality. The use of RD creates a natural experiment with treatment and control groups due to similarities in characteristics on either side of the cutoff."
