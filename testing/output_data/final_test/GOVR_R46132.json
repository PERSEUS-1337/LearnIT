    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied, encompassing production activities related to traditional field crops, livestock, poultry products, fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables. Farm income and rural economic conditions vary across the United States due to regional differences in market structure, production processes, and agro-climatic settings. Annual U.S. net farm income is a key indicator of farm sector well-being, reflecting economic activity across production processes, input expenses, and marketing. The U.S. farm sector is diverse, including various production activities. Annual net farm income reflects economic activity, expenses, and marketing conditions. In the latest forecast, U.S. net farm income is projected to increase by 10.2% in 2019 to $92.5 billion, with net cash income also expected to rise by 15.0% to $119.0 billion. This forecast is above the 10-year average but below the record high in 2013. The USDA's income forecast for 2019 is projected to increase to $92.5 billion, with government support playing a significant role in driving net farm income higher. Direct government payments are expected to reach $22.4 billion, representing 24.2% of net farm income, the largest share since 2006. This increase in support is mainly due to trade retaliation under the trade war with China. The net farm income for 2019 is projected to be on par with the average since 1940, with global demand for U.S. agricultural exports decreasing in 2019. Farm asset values and debt levels are expected to reach record highs in 2019, pushing the debt-to-asset ratio to the highest level since 2003. USDA forecasts that prices for major commodities will vary in 2019. In 2019, U.S. agricultural markets faced uncertainty due to large domestic supplies of corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton, leading to pressure on commodity prices. Adverse weather conditions during planting and fall further added to the uncertainty for market conditions heading into 2020. In 2019, adverse weather conditions affected the corn and soybean crops, leading to market uncertainty. The U.S.-China trade dispute also impacted exports, particularly soybeans to China. The resolution of the trade dispute and international demand heading into 2020 remain uncertain. Corn and soybeans are the largest U.S. commercial crops in terms of value and acreage, with strong growth in productivity and output in recent years. In 2018, U.S. farmers had a record soybean harvest of 4.5 billion bushels with high ending stocks. The loss of the Chinese soybean market led to lower prices. In 2019, there were projections of smaller crops and lower stocks for soybeans, corn, wheat, and cotton, keeping downward pressure on farm prices. In 2019, U.S. agricultural production faced delays in planting corn and soybean crops due to cool, wet conditions. Record large \"prevented plant\" acres were reported, with significant planting delays in states like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and North and South Dakota. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was behind the average, impacting crop development as they entered hotter, drier periods. In 2019, U.S. agricultural production faced delays in planting corn and soybean crops due to cool, wet conditions. This impacted crop development by pushing the growing cycle into hotter, drier periods, increasing the risk of lower yields. The fall brought cold, wet conditions, delaying harvests and leading to high-moisture crops that required costly drying. Nearly 11% of the corn crop remained unharvested as of December 2, 2019, affecting the export outlook for corn and soybeans. The trade dispute between the United States and China has impacted the export outlook for soybeans and corn, crucial for farm profitability. Livestock sectors like dairy and cattle are slower to adjust to market changes compared to crops. USDA projects livestock and dairy production and prices further into the future than the crop sector. During 2007-2014, high feed prices and drought in the Southern Plains led to an 8% decrease in the U.S. cattle inventory. This resulted in higher beef prices and record profits for cow-calf producers in 2014. The slow rebuilding phase of the cattle cycle began in 2014, with expansion continuing through 2018 despite weakening profitability. The cattle expansion seems to have plateaued in 2019. In 2014, the cattle expansion leveled off with the population unchanged at 103 million. Producers are producing more beef with fewer cattle due to heavier weights. U.S. hog and poultry flocks are growing and expected to expand in 2019. USDA projects robust growth in beef, pork, broilers, and eggs production for 2019 and 2020. The key uncertainty is whether demand will absorb the growth in output or lead to lower prices. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for red meat, driven by pork products, but flat demand for poultry in 2019. The livestock sector's changing conditions can be tracked by the ratios of output prices to feed costs, with higher ratios indicating greater profitability for producers. However, the hog, broiler, and cattle feed ratios have trended downward, suggesting eroding profitability for many producers. Cattle, hog, broiler, and milk producers are facing financial difficulties. Production growth for red meat and poultry is expected to be between 1% and 4%, making prices vulnerable to demand weakness. USDA projects an upward price outlook for cattle, hogs, and poultry in 2020. U.S. milk production is projected to grow in 2019 and 2020, with prices expected to increase as well. Farm-sector revenue sources in 2019 include crop revenues, livestock receipts, government payments, and other farm-related income. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2019 is projected to increase driven by government payments and other farm-related income. Total crop sales peaked in 2012 at $231.6 billion due to a nationwide drought, but in 2019, crop sales are projected at $197.4 billion, up 1.0% from 2018. Projections for 2019 show increases in feed crops, fruits and nuts, vegetables, and other crops, while decreases are expected in oil crops, food grains, and cotton. Livestock sector revenue is also facing challenges, with cattle, hog, broiler, and milk producers experiencing financial difficulties. The livestock sector, including cattle, hogs, sheep, poultry, eggs, dairy, and other activities, saw cash receipts peak at $212.3 billion in 2014. However, there were declines in 2015 and 2016 due to price decreases. Cash receipts recovered in 2017 with a growth of 8.1% to $175.6 billion, and slightly increased in 2018 (+0.6%). Projections for 2019 show a slight increase (+0.1%) to $176.8 billion, driven by hog and dairy sales offsetting declines in poultry and cattle. Projected government payments in 2019 are expected to reach $22.4 billion, a 64.0% increase from 2018. These payments include various types such as direct payments, price-contingent payments, conservation payments, ad hoc and emergency disaster assistance payments, and other miscellaneous outlays. This would be the largest taxpayer transfer to the agriculture sector. The projected surge in federal subsidies for agriculture in 2019 is driven by large \"trade-damage\" payments under the MFP program initiated by USDA in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. MFP payments are reported to be $14.3 billion, including outlays from the 2018 program and expected payments under the 2019 program. USDA ad hoc disaster assistance is also projected to increase to $1.7 billion, with most of it coming from the new WHIP+ program. Payments under other programs are projected to be lower in 2019. Government payments for conservation programs are projected to decrease in 2019, with a forecasted total of $22.4 billion representing a 5% share of projected gross cash income. This is down from $3.2 billion in 2018. The government share of net farm income is expected to reach 24%, the largest share since 2006. In 1984, government payments peaked at 65.2% during the farm crisis of the 1980s. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the Margin Protection Program, now called the Dairy Margin Coverage program, allowing milk producers to cover the milk-to-feed margin up to $9.50/cwt. As of October 2019, the milk-to-feed margin used for government payments had risen to $10.88/cwt., decreasing the likelihood of DMC payments in the second half of 2019. The DMC program is expected to make $214 million in payments in 2019, down from $250 million in 2018. Total production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector are projected to be slightly up in 2019 at $344.6 billion. Production expenses affect crop and livestock farms differently, with feed costs, labor expenses, and property taxes all projected to increase in 2019. In 2019, production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector are projected to be slightly up at $344.6 billion. Fuel, seed, pesticides, interest, and fertilizer costs are expected to be lower. The prices received index declined from 2014 through 2016, rebounded in 2017, then declined again in 2019. Farm input prices have steadily climbed since mid-2016, squeezing farm sector profit margins. Renting or leasing land is a way for young or beginning farmers to enter agriculture without incurring debt. Since 2002, about 39% of U.S. agricultural land has been rented, with the majority rented from nonoperating landlords. In 2017, 29% of all land in farms was rented from non-farm operators, while 8% was rented from other farm operations. Total net rent to nonoperator landlords is projected to decrease by 1.2% to $12.7 billion in 2019. Average cash rental rates for 2019 increased by 1.4% year-over-year to $140 per acre. Farm rental rates are typically set in the fall or early spring before field work. National average rental rates peaked at $144 per acre in 2015, reflecting high crop prices and strong net returns from 2011-2014. The downturn in U.S. agricultural exports since 2015 has deepened the farm income downturn from 2013-2016. The U.S. agricultural sector's trade outlook has been vulnerable to international trade changes since 2018. The U.S. agricultural sector's trade outlook is impacted by international trade disputes, particularly with China. Improved international trade prospects are needed for market-based farm income growth. USDA projects a decrease in agricultural exports to $135.5 billion in FY2019. Agricultural imports are projected to increase to $113.0 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $7.0 billion, the lowest since 2006. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to decrease, with China, Canada, and Mexico being the top markets. China's share of U.S. exports is expected to decline, with Canada projected to be the top market followed by Mexico, the EU, Japan, and China. In FY2018, China's imports of U.S. agricultural products declined to $20.5 billion, projected to further decrease to $13.6 billion in FY2019 due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The EU and Japan are the fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. export markets, with a combined share of 17% during FY2014 to FY2018. The \"Rest of World\" component, including South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, is expected to account for 42% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019, showing strong import growth. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports to the \"Rest of World\" markets are driven by population and GDP growth, with some products diverted from China. High-value exports are forecasted at $100.1 billion, comprising 73.8% of total exports, while bulk commodity shipments are at a record low of 26.2% at $35.5 billion. Grain and oilseed price declines are impacting the bulk value share of U.S. exports. The U.S. farm income and asset-value situation heading into 2019 suggests a slowly eroding financial situation for the agriculture sector. Uncertainty clouds the economic outlook due to declining prices, reliance on international markets, and federal support to offset trade disputes. Farm asset values are projected to increase by 2.3% in 2019, reaching $3.1 trillion, with higher real estate and nonreal-estate values. Farm asset values are expected to increase in 2019, with real estate values up by 2.1% and nonreal-estate values up by 3.4%. Crop land values are tied to commodity prices, which have been stagnant since 2015. Total farm debt is forecasted to rise to a record $415.5 billion in 2019, while farm equity is projected to increase slightly to $2.7 trillion. The farm debt-to-asset ratio is expected to rise to 13.4%, the highest level since 2003. The average farm household income in 2019 is projected to be $120,082, with 20% coming from farm production activities and the remaining 80% earned off the farm. Since 2014, over half of U.S. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations. Farm household incomes have surged ahead of average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. Farm household incomes have surged ahead of average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. In 2018, the average farm household income was $112,211, about 25% higher than the average U.S. household income of $90,021. USDA data on monthly farm prices received for major commodities are presented in indexed format for comparison. Tables present aggregate farm income variables and annual average farm prices for major commodities."
