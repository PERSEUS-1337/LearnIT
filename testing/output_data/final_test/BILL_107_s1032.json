The Act \"International Infectious Diseases Control Act of 2001\" defines key terms related to infectious diseases, including AIDS, Executive agency, global fund, HIV, HIV/AIDS, Secretary General, and World Bank. SEC. ____03. FINDINGS. The findings by Congress highlight the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on the world's poorest countries. These diseases are projected to cost the lives of 6,000,000 people this year alone. HIV/AIDS has already infected over 58,000,000 people globally, causing significant health and economic challenges in various regions. In Africa, AIDS has become the leading cause of death, claiming the lives of 17,000,000 people and threatening a quarter of the population in the next decade, including many productive adults and children. The World Health Organization estimates that 8,000,000 people annually contract tuberculosis, a highly contagious disease that kills at least 2,000,000 people each year globally. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death for women aged 15-44 and the most common cause of death in Africa for those with HIV/AIDS. Over 40% of tuberculosis cases in the United States are due to imported cases, with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis spreading due to inadequate control programs and misuse of drugs in developing countries. Malaria affects over 500 million people annually, killing at least 1 million each year, with a child dying every 40 seconds in Africa. The economic impact of AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis on regional economies is severe. According to UNAIDS, HIV/AIDS will reduce South Africa's GDP by 17% over the next 10 years, costing $22 billion. WHO estimates that conquering malaria 35 years ago would have increased sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by $100 billion. The annual economic loss from malaria is up to $12 billion. UNAIDS estimates $3 billion is needed for basic AIDS prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, with an additional $2 billion for anti-retroviral drugs. Currently, only $500 million is available for AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis control in Africa. (9) WHO estimates $1 billion per year is needed for tuberculosis control to identify 70% of cases and cure 85% of them, with an additional $400 million to reach this goal. (10) Kofi Annan calls for a global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, proposing a multibillion-dollar fund financed by governments and private contributors. Leaders of developing nations are urged to prioritize comprehensive health systems. The Secretary General has outlined five objectives for the fight against AIDS, including prevention, care, and scientific breakthroughs like vaccines. Prevention of new infections is crucial, along with providing treatment and care for those already infected. The African heads of state at the African Summit on HIV/AIDS in Abuja committed to increasing health sector budgets to reduce social and economic damage. Expanded US financial support for international partnerships can help control HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The World Bank and WHO have shown ways to narrow the gap between need and available resources. Investment in global public health activities to reduce HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis is crucial for economic and social development, as well as for building political and trade alliances. Containment of international disease threats also benefits Americans who are increasingly vulnerable to global infectious diseases. The Act aims to support global efforts to mitigate HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis by providing care, treatment, and prevention programs, especially for children orphaned by the epidemic. It emphasizes a science-based integrated approach, public-private partnerships, and good governance to control these diseases. The Act establishes a global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The President, in consultation with relevant agencies, will work to establish a global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The fund will involve foreign governments, the United Nations, the World Bank, and the private sector. The President will delegate authority to the Secretaries of State and Health and Human Services, with the Treasury Secretary handling World Bank matters. The global fund's description will be outlined. The global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis will be a public-private partnership involving governments, foundations, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations, and other parties. It will focus on prevention, treatment, and care, promote best practices, ensure scientific and medical accountability, and respect intellectual property rights. The global fund to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis will be governed by a board of trustees and a technical advisory group consisting of experts in public health, epidemiology, and biomedical research to advise on funding proposals and other matters. The global fund is governed by a board of trustees and a technical advisory group to advise on funding proposals. Other bodies, like a secretariat, support the board's work. The fund provides grants for measures to prevent infections and care for those infected with disease. The global fund provides grants for preventing infections and caring for those infected with diseases. Governments and NGOs are eligible for grants, with an emphasis on funding NGOs, including faith-based and secular groups. National authorities set the overall plan for dealing with public health and infectious diseases in their countries. Activities supported include HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. The global fund emphasizes strong political leadership in recipient countries for effective strategies against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Priority is given to combating HIV/AIDS due to its global impact. Programs focus on prevention, health education, treatment, care services, and access to affordable drugs. Priority should be given to programs combating HIV/AIDS, including promoting best practices in prevention, education on risk avoidance, measures to prevent mother-to-child transmission, and support for AIDS orphans and affected families. The President must submit annual reports to Congress on the global fund's structure and objectives. The global fund's structure, objectives, contributions, funded projects, and effectiveness are assessed by appropriate committees of Congress. The United States authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 for the Department of State to contribute to the global fund. The United States authorizes $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 for payment to the global fund. Reprogramming of fiscal year 2001 funds allows for their transfer and availability for the same purposes as funds from fiscal year 2002. Certification by the President is required before the initial obligation or expenditure of funds. The President must certify procedures for fund accountability and monitoring to Congress. This Act does not replace or reduce resources for other global health programs. SEC. 6. REPEAL. Subtitle B of title I of the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 is repealed."
