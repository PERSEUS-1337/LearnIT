    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Veterans' Oral History Project Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that military service during times of war is a significant sacrifice, with millions of Americans serving in various conflicts throughout the 20th century. The Department of Veterans Affairs reports nearly 19 million war veterans living in the country today. Despite this, the number of living veterans from World War I and World War II is dwindling, highlighting the importance of preserving oral histories for future generations. Oral histories of American war veterans are invaluable for preserving the memories and experiences of those who served in conflicts. Collecting and cataloging these stories is essential for future generations to understand the heroics, horrors, and triumphs of war. The Library of Congress, as the Nation's oldest Federal cultural institution and largest library in human history, aims to collect, preserve, and make available oral histories of American war veterans. This Act establishes a federally sponsored program to coordinate the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of veterans, aiming to preserve their memories for future generations.
