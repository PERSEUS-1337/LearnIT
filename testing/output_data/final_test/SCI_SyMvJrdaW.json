    "content": "Warped Residual Network (WarpNet) uses a warp operator for faster training compared to the original residual neural network. Perturbation theory is applied to decouple interactions between residual units, resulting in a first-order approximation of output over multiple layers. This theory exhibits properties like binomial path lengths and exponential gradient scaling. The proposed WarpNet achieves comparable predictive performance to the original residual network with the same parameters but offers a significant speed-up in training time through model parallelism. Various deep CNN architectures have been successful in image recognition tasks, with notable examples like VGG, Inception, and ResNet. Training deep neural networks is challenging due to the vanishing or exploding gradients issue. The vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks is addressed by techniques like Batch Normalization and skip connections. Skip connections allow previous layers to propagate relatively unchanged, enabling training of extremely deep networks. However, as the number of layers increases, so does the training time. Forward propagation is used to evaluate the neural network's output during training. In this work, the ResNet neural network architecture is introduced as a solution to the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. ResNets consist of residual units that behave like an ensemble of shallow networks, allowing for faster training times. Empirical evidence shows that randomly deactivating residual units during training can improve performance. The ResNet architecture introduces residual units to address the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks. Deactivating residual units during training can improve performance. An approximation of ResNet using a series expansion in small perturbations allows for faster training times with comparable predictive accuracies. The WarpNet architecture is proposed as an approximation to ResNet with a warp operator for faster training times while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results show that WarpNet achieves comparable performance to ResNet with significant speed-up. The WarpNet architecture offers faster training times while maintaining accuracy compared to ResNet. It distributes weights over GPUs for larger network training and achieves similar performance with a speed-up. The paper analyzes ResNet properties and explains recent numerical results using perturbation theory. The interpretation of ResNets as an ensemble of subnetworks is accurate up to the first order in F with identity mapping. The output of two residual units can be approximated by a series expansion, showing the relationship between input and output. The Taylor series expansion in powers of F 1 on F 2 shows that higher order terms are negligible when ReLU activations are used. The second order perturbation terms vanish almost exactly due to the non-linearity of ReLU at the origin. The interpretation of ResNets as an ensemble of subnetworks is accurate up to the first order in F with identity mapping. The power set of S K is denoted by P(S K). The equation is simplified by setting all weights to be the same. The binomial coefficients appear due to the number of subsets of S K with cardinality k being K choose k. The gradient norm decreases exponentially with subnetwork depth in ResNets, as shown in experimental results. This property applies after training, even with network approximations. The Warped Residual Network (WarpNet) is an approximation to the original ResNet, compressing K consecutive residual units into one warp layer. It uses a warp operator for computation, allowing for parallel weight updates. Forward and backward propagation rules for the warped residual network are described. The forward and backward propagation rules for the Warped Residual Network are derived using the warp operator T warp. The expression for T warp is obtained from Equation 3 using Taylor series expansion. The backpropagation rules involve computing gradients for gradient descent by back propagating from x 5 to x 3. The formula for K = 3 case is provided in Appendix A. The derivative of F 4 is set to zero for ReLU non-linearities, with BN layers removed from F 4. Parallelism in the warp operator is seen in back propagation. Weight gradients for updates are evaluated similarly for W 2. The weights W 1 and W 2 can be updated independently in parallel. Derivatives needed for backpropagation can be computed in the forward pass. Implementation of the WarpNet architecture and experimental results are discussed. Series expansion is used to ensure validity. Experimental results are discussed for a WarpNet architecture using a wide residual architecture (WRN) with various parameters implemented in Tensorflow. The series expansion ensures validity, replacing 1 \u00d7 1 convolution layers with average pooling layers and concatenate layers on skip connections. Automatic differentiation in Tensorflow is used for backpropagation. In the experiment, WarpNet was found to train faster than WRN with comparable accuracy by removing BN layers in F2 due to computational bottlenecks. The network still performed well without BN layers in F2, as normalizing layers in F1,2 were still being trained. To further speed up training, the F1 block in the derivative term F2 F1 was replaced with the input x1. In experiments, WarpNet was modified to train faster by replacing the F1 block in the derivative term F2 F1 with input x1. This modification, referred to as WarpNet1, showed similar predictive accuracies while improving speed-up. For K = 3, all Fj Fi terms were replaced by Fj x1 in WarpNet1. The term F3 F2 F1 was dropped in computing x4 in both versions of WarpNet due to limited GPUs. Speed-up provided by WarpNet was evaluated by defining relative speed-up compared to wide residual network (WRN). For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, WarpNet was trained for 80000 iterations with a batch size of 128 and an initial learning rate of 0.1. Learning rate decreased by a factor of 0.1 at epochs 60, 120, and 160, with a weight decay of 0.0005. Common data augmentation techniques were used. WarpNet performance with K = 2 and K = 3 was studied, showing similar or better validation errors than baseline WRN. The experiments show that WarpNet can achieve similar or better validation errors than wide ResNet while offering speed-up. Replacing F F by F x 1 improves accuracy and speed-up. Increasing from K = 2 to K = 3 significantly improves speed-up with a slight drop in accuracy. The speed-up increases as WarpNet gets wider, with speed-ups of 35%, 40%, and 42% for k w = 4, 8, and 16 respectively. Speed-up also increases with warp factor K, reaching 50% for K = 3. WarpNet was also tested on a down-sampled ImageNet dataset. The WarpNet model was tested on a down-sampled ImageNet dataset BID0, showing improved validation accuracy and faster training compared to WRN models. By increasing the number of residual units, WarpNet-109-2 trained 12% faster than WRN-73-2 with better accuracy. Additionally, WarpNet achieved close to the benchmark validation error of 18.9% with WRN-28-10 in BID0. WarpNet can achieve close to the benchmark validation error of 18.9% with WRN-28-10 in BID0. The weight distribution of WarpNet across GPUs allows for training larger networks. The validation error curve for WRN-73-2 and WarpNet 73-2 are almost identical, indicating a good approximation. WarpNet offers model parallelism to ResNet learning, enabling different sets of weights to be learned in parallel. WarpNet is compared with a data parallelism method on 2 or 4 GPUs on CIFAR-10. Synchronization is done after each GPU finishes its mini-batch to maintain accuracy. Results show WarpNet outperforms data parallelism in both 2-GPU and 4-GPU setups. The WarpNet model outperforms data parallelism on 2 or 4 GPUs in terms of accuracy and speed. WarpNet distributes weights among GPUs, requiring less GPU memory and allowing for training larger networks. Additionally, data parallelism can be applied to WarpNet for further speed improvements. The Taylor series approximation in WarpNet allows for parallel training of residual units on various GPUs, leading to faster training and similar performance to ResNets. Experimental results show WarpNet outperforms wide ResNets in speed and accuracy, especially with more than 2 GPUs. Additionally, the model explicitly calculates path lengths using the Taylor expansion. In the general case, the path lengths k correspond to the binomial number of terms with power k in the Taylor expansion of x 3 and x 4. The coefficients for each power of 0, 1, and 2 are (1,2,1) respectively, which can also be obtained by setting the weights to be the same. Another iteration of Taylor expansion gives x 4 in terms of x 1, organizing terms with the same power of F and F together in rows. In the Taylor expansion, terms with the same power of F are organized in rows. The number of terms for each power of F follows a pattern. Index reduction operations reduce the index of outputs x_i by one. This generates terms of different powers in the expansion. The operation generates power terms from x_i, with index reduction and Taylor expansion generating terms of powers k and k + 1. The number of terms after K + 1 index reductions with power k + 1 is related to those after K index reductions. The number of terms with power k + 1 after K + 1 index reductions is related to those after K index reductions, following a recursion formula satisfied by binomial coefficients. The coefficients for K = 3 and K = 4 are explicitly shown to be binomial coefficients. After K index reductions, the output is the sum over all subsets of a chosen unordered subset of k indices from S K. The process can be identified with a Bernoulli process with parameters K and p = 0.5, leading to Equation (3). Realizing X i \u223c B(K, p = 0.5) results in the expression of x K+1 in terms of x 1. The Bernoulli process with parameters K and p = 0.5 represents the power of terms in a sum after index reductions. The probability of a term having power k is 2^(-k), and the number of terms with power k is the binomial coefficient K choose k. Consecutive Taylor expansions involve summing over all terms corresponding to realizations of X K:1."
