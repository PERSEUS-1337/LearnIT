    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Small, Safe Schools Act\". The \"Small, Safe Schools Act\" findings show that smaller schools with 300-400 students for elementary and middle schools, and 400-800 students for secondary schools, are more effective. Smaller school size improves learning, grades, and test scores, especially for minority and low-income students. Students in smaller schools have better self-concepts and take more responsibility for their education. Studies show that smaller schools lead to decreased dropout rates and promote school safety by reducing behavioral problems. Teachers in smaller schools can address student disagreements before they escalate, shaping positive social relationships within the school environment. Smaller schools and learning communities reduce isolation and violence by fostering closer relationships between students and teachers, creating a sense of ownership and belonging. This connection decreases the likelihood of students being involved in violence, especially gang activity and serious incidents. Studies show that students in smaller schools are less likely to have issues with drugs or alcohol. Researchers emphasize the importance of breaking through the impersonal atmosphere of larger schools by creating smaller, more connected communities to address school violence effectively. Research shows that smaller schools foster closer relationships between students and teachers, leading to increased participation in extracurricular activities and a greater sense of belonging for all students. In contrast, larger schools contribute to negative teacher attitudes and low staff morale. Smaller schools can be established cost-effectively. Smaller schools are more cost-effective to establish compared to larger schools, which require more administrative support leading to less flexibility and innovation.

A small school is described as having a maximum student population of 350 for elementary schools and 400 to 800 for secondary schools, where teachers know all students and coordinate and cooperate.\" A smaller learning community is defined as a cohesive unit within a larger school where teachers coordinate in developing curricula, shared leadership exists among teachers and administrators, and parents are valued members of the educational team. \"SEC. 10996.
