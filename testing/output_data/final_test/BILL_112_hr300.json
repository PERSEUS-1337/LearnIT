    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Young Adults Financial Literacy Act\". The Congress finds that there is a lack of financial literacy education, leading to inadequate skills among adults. Immediate response is needed for those facing financial instability, along with long-term solutions to prevent future disasters. Urgent action is required to address the economic crisis through research-based financial education. The need for research-based financial literacy education programs is crucial to reach individuals of all ages and socioeconomic levels, especially those in unique financial situations. Parents are talking to their teens about credit, but many teens report not receiving this information. High school students often lack a budget, and graduate students carry an average credit card debt of $7,831. Young adults between 20 and 24 are the fastest-growing segment of bankruptcy filings, with more people filing for bankruptcy in 2004 than graduating from college. Credit card debt has increased significantly among different age groups, with those aged 18-24 experiencing a 104% increase since 1982. In 2009, the Comptroller General testified about the National Strategy for Financial Literacy and Education Commission's report. The National Strategy for Financial Literacy was a useful first step but lacked strategic recommendations. The Commission has not fully implemented recommended elements, with revisions mainly consisting of 'calls to action' rather than fundamental shifts in approach. The text chunk discusses a grant program to establish centers of excellence in financial literacy education. The Secretary of the Treasury may make grants to establish centers of excellence for financial literacy education for young adults and families aged 15-24. Activities include developing research-based programs. Financial literacy education programs for young adults aged 15-24 can be integrated into academic settings. Programs should target specific educational expectations, provide assessment tools, training for educators, and materials for diverse populations. Core competencies include goal setting, budgeting, managing money, saving, managing debt, and earning. Instructional materials should be evidence-based. Improving financial literacy education for young families by addressing life situations and financial pitfalls like bankruptcy, foreclosure, credit card misuse, and predatory lending. Developing professional development programs in financial literacy education to ensure competence and accountability. Collaborating with financial institutions to increase access to financial literacy education for young adults and families. The importance of financial literacy education is highlighted through programs aimed at reducing student loan default rates and developing research-based assessment tools. Priority is given to applications that provide clear definitions of financial literacy and establish parameters for educational outcomes. The Secretary will establish parameters for effective programs reaching young adults, include age-appropriate content, develop programs based on educational standards, focus on financial independence goals, and implement evidence-based professional development systems. Application and evaluation standards, distribution criteria, and other necessary procedures will be determined by the Secretary through regulations. The Secretary will establish parameters for effective programs for young adults, including age-appropriate content and financial independence goals. Grants under this section range from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000. Definitions for eligible institutions and institutions of higher education are provided. The term \"institution of higher education\" is defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury, unless specified otherwise. Authorization of Appropriations: $55,000,000 is authorized for the Secretary annually from 2012 to 2016 for implementing the Act. The Secretary can also establish additional regulations as needed."
