    "content": "The Act titled \"Support Our Military Caregivers Act\" allows for external clinical review of denied applications by caregivers of veterans. The \"Support Our Military Caregivers Act\" amends Section 1720G of title 38, United States Code to allow for external clinical review of denied caregiver applications by veterans. The Secretary can grant a determination of the level of personal care services a veteran needs, reconsider requests based on changes in health, and revoke assistance. Independent contractors awarded contracts through open competition can carry out this section. The external clinical review process for caregiver benefits requires reviewers to have no financial ties to non-Department providers, specific expertise in medical and legal matters, and employ a panel of healthcare professionals who do not treat the individual seeking review. The external clinical review process for caregiver benefits involves reviewing the application for assistance, including input from the individual and veteran, as well as a review of the initial clinical assessment. An independent contractor collects and shares necessary information with the Secretary as part of the review process. The Secretary considers but is not bound by determinations made by an independent contractor in deciding on assistance applications. The Secretary may make a different decision with clinical documentation. External clinical reviews must be completed within 120 days, with results shared within 30 days for veterans. The Secretary ensures that veterans and individuals are notified in writing of final decisions regarding assistance applications. Notifications include an explanation of the decision, facts, regulations, and clinical rationale. Individuals applying for caregiver assistance are informed of their eligibility. These amendments apply to disability compensation claims made by veterans. The amendments made by subsection (a) apply to elections under section 1720G of title 38, US Code, for caregiver assistance applications not yet decided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. SEC. 3. PROCESS TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY FOR CAREGIVERS OF VETERANS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will issue directives for the Family Caregiver Program, including eligibility criteria. The Comptroller General will report on the eligibility determination process, appeals, and reevaluation for participants in the program. The Family Caregiver Program includes comprehensive assistance for family caregivers or general caregiver support services established by section 1720G of title 38, United States Code. Eligibility criteria, appeals, and reevaluations for participants will be addressed in directives issued by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs."
