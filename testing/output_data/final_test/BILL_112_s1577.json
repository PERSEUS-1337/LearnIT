    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Greater Research Opportunities With Tax Help Act\" or \"GROWTH Act\" and involves amending the 1986 Code. It includes a permanent extension and modification of the research credit. The \"GROWTH Act\" involves amending the 1986 Code to simplify the credit for qualified research expenses by calculating it as 20% of qualified research expenses exceeding 50% of the average expenses of the previous 3 years. Special rules apply if there were no qualified research expenses in the preceding 3 years. The credit for qualified research expenses is determined under a specific subsection if the taxpayer had no qualified research expenses in the 3 preceding taxable years. The credit rate is 10% of the qualified research expenses for the current taxable year. Additionally, consistent treatment of expenses is required regardless of the claim filing period in the 3-taxable-year period. The qualified research expenses for the current year must be determined consistently with the expenses for the credit year to prevent distortions. Regulations may be prescribed to address changes in accounting methods. Acquired persons may have pre-acquisition qualified research expenses partially included. Acquisitions of a major portion of a trade or business increase qualified research expenses for the acquiring person in the 3 taxable years preceding the credit year. Acquisitions of a major portion of a trade or business increase qualified research expenses for the acquiring person in the 3 taxable years preceding the credit year. For any taxable year after the acquisition, the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor during the measurement period preceding the credit year also contribute to the credit calculation. The credit amount for a taxable year is determined based on the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor with respect to the acquired trade or business in the 3 taxable years before the acquisition. The credit amount for a taxable year is determined based on the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor with respect to the acquired trade or business, divided by 12. Special rules apply for coordinating taxable years between acquiring person and predecessor. The credit amount for a taxable year is determined based on the qualified research expenses paid or incurred by the predecessor, allocated equally among the months of the taxable year. The expenses attributable to the acquiring person for a taxable year are based on the months during that year. The term \"measurement period\" refers to the acquiring person's taxable year of acquisition and the three preceding years. Subparagraph (B) of section 41(f)(3) is amended regarding dispositions. The amount of qualified research expenses paid or incurred by a person disposing of a trade or business in a transaction shall be decreased for taxable years after the disposition, based on information provided to the acquiring person. The aggregation of expenditures for the research credit is determined on a proportionate basis to the share of aggregate qualified research expenses taken into account by the controlled group. The research credit expenditures are determined proportionately based on the share of qualified research expenses within a controlled group. Section 41 and 45C are permanently amended, with conforming adjustments made to basic research payment calculations and special rules. The amendments to various sections include striking certain paragraphs and making adjustments to cross-references. For example, section 41 and 45C are permanently amended with conforming adjustments made to basic research payment calculations and special rules. The term 'qualified organization' in this paragraph refers to educational institutions or organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) primarily conducting scientific activities. Section 280C and 409 are amended to remove references to basic research expenses and make technical corrections. Section 409 is amended to make technical corrections related to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, including adjustments in subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(4), (i)(1)(A), and (m). The amendments made by this section, including technical corrections related to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2011. Amendments made by subsection (e) apply to amounts paid or incurred after the same date, while corrections made by subsection (g) take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act."
