    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Enhancement Act\". Congress finds that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease mainly affects the lower part of the small intestine and large intestine, while ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulceration of the colon. Both diseases, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease, share similar symptoms such as severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and rectal bleeding. Inflammatory bowel disease affects up to 1,400,000 people in the US, with 30% diagnosed in childhood. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, delayed puberty, and impaired growth. Patients are at high risk for colorectal cancer. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases is expanding research on Inflammatory Bowel Disease under SEC. 434B. The Director of the Institute will expand research on inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on genetic susceptibility, causes in children, animal models, clinical studies, and pediatric research centers. The Disease Centers program focuses on pediatric research, training health professionals in biomedical research on inflammatory bowel disease, including pediatric investigators. Research priorities are based on scientific agendas from relevant organizations. Authorization of appropriations is set at $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2009, and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2010. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Program under Section 310A. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will expand the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Program to include studies on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on incidence, genetic and environmental factors, demographics, and treatment outcomes. The Director will consult with a national patient organization for this expansion. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008, and additional funding for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, to support the expansion of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Program focusing on pediatric cases."
