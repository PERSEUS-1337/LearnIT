The Social Security Act is amended to allow continued use of 2009 practice expense relative value units for specific cardiology services. The Social Security Act allows for the continuation of 2009 practice expense relative value units for specific cardiology services performed predominantly by cardiologists. This includes cardiac monitoring services, services for heart disease diagnosis or treatment, and other services primarily performed by cardiologists. The Social Security Act allows for the continuation of 2009 practice expense relative value units for specific cardiology services, including myocardial perfusion imaging, cardiovascular computed tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. New category I CPT codes related to these services are permitted. The Secretary will conduct a study on the practice expense methodology for determining relative value units under specific cardiology services, including myocardial perfusion imaging, cardiovascular computed tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. The methodologies used for budget neutrality adjustments in physician services are consistent with accounting principles and distribute the burden proportionally. The results accurately reflect the resources involved in providing different services. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by January 1. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress by January 1, 2011, with recommendations for determining practice expense under this subsection.

No budget neutrality adjustment shall be made by the Secretary. The Secretary may adjust practice expense relative value units and codes for services furnished on or after January 1, 2012, without budget neutrality adjustments."
