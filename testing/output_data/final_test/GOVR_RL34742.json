President Obama diverts $30 billion from TARP to help small banks lend to small businesses. Obama proposes limits on bank deposits and bans on risky investments. IHS Global Insight predicts slow U.S. recovery, slower rebound for Europe and Japan, and faster growth for emerging markets in 2010. In emerging markets, especially in Asia, growth will outpace developed economies. Interest rates, particularly in the G7, will remain low. Fiscal stimulus will start to ease, while commodity prices are expected to remain stable. Inflation is not a major concern, but global imbalances may worsen. The dollar may strengthen temporarily but is on a downward trend. There is a risk of a double-dip growth profile. Abu Dhabi provides Dubai with $10 billion, Euro Zone officially emerges from recession, and the European Central Bank plans to gradually withdraw stimulus measures. During the third quarter of 2009, Germany powered the economic rebound. On November 10, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd released a draft of a financial regulation bill. At the Group of 20 Summit in Pittsburgh on September 24-25, world leaders agreed on various economic policies, including not withdrawing stimulus measures until a durable recovery is in place, coordinating exit strategies, harmonizing macroeconomic policies, and eliminating subsidies on fossil fuels in the medium term. Trade commitments were weak, with a vague goal to revive multilateral trade negotiations by 2010. Leaders also pledged to provide developing countries with at least 5% more voting power in the International Monetary Fund. The Financial Stability Board, comprised of central bankers and financial regulators, has taken a lead role in coordinating and monitoring tougher financial regulations since the global financial crisis. Policymaking has shifted towards promoting recovery and preventing future crises. Concerns have been raised about regulatory reform losing traction amidst competing issues like healthcare and the war in Afghanistan. The global financial crisis, or Great Recession of 2007-2009, was a once-in-a-century disaster with unique features. Super-aggressive liquidity injections and reflationary actions stabilized the situation in 2008-2009. The global economy rebounded in 2009, with world GDP growth accelerating to well above 3.0%. Global Insight expects world GDP to grow at a below-trend pace of about 2.8% in 2010. Global Insight expects world GDP to be at a below-trend pace of about 2.8% in 2010, after having contracted by 2.0% in 2009. The role for Congress in the financial crisis is multifaceted, focusing on ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets while protecting taxpayer interests. The existing patchwork system of regulation has evolved over the past century in response to specific problems, and making dramatic changes may result in opposition. The financial crisis has led to global economic challenges, with Congress playing a multifaceted role in ensuring financial market stability and protecting taxpayer interests. Congress provides funds for economic stabilization, oversees regulatory functions, and reforms the international financial system. The crisis originated from the U.S. housing market collapse, leading to global financial turmoil. The global financial crisis of 2008 was triggered by the U.S. housing market bubble and a rise in foreclosures. Major financial institutions faced bankruptcy or required financial rescue. The crisis spread worldwide, causing recessions and exposing weaknesses in financial systems. Despite massive interventions by governments and central banks, recovery is slow. The crisis affected both industrialized and emerging market economies, leading to capital flight and stock value declines. The global financial crisis of 2008 led to capital flight, stock value declines, and economic turmoil worldwide. The United States is facing challenges in protecting economic security and achieving foreign policy goals amidst the crisis. The repercussions are felt in exports, imports, growth rates, unemployment, government finances, and political risk globally. The global financial crisis of 2008 caused economic turmoil worldwide, impacting growth, unemployment, government finances, and political risk. Emerging markets are not immune to the slowdown, and governments cannot rely on exports to recover. Key terms like systemic risk are crucial in understanding and resolving the crisis. To mitigate systemic risk, regulatory agencies may need to expand their scope to cover a wider range of institutions and markets. Deleveraging involves reducing debt to lower default risk, but selling assets at a discount can depress prices and lead to losses. Procyclicality refers to actions that amplify boom-and-bust cycles, making it challenging to regulate. Preferred equity offers a claim on earnings and assets before common stockholders in the event of liquidation. Preferred stock pays a fixed dividend and offers a claim on earnings and assets in liquidation. Banks may convert preferred equity to common stock to increase capital base. Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are structured asset-backed securities based on fixed-income assets, with sub-prime mortgage CDOs being central to the financial crisis. CDOs have different risk tranches, with senior tranches considered safer. Credit default swaps (CDS) are credit derivative contracts between counterparties. The global financial crisis highlighted the importance of the United States as a major center of the financial world. Regional financial crises may not impact the global financial system significantly, but a stumble in the U.S. financial system can have widespread repercussions due to its role as the main guarantor of the international financial system. The United States is a major player in the global financial system, with its currency widely used as reserves and a contributor to global financial capital. A financial crisis in the U.S. has global implications, leading to policy actions like the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. There are ongoing discussions about changing regulations and supervision at both domestic and international levels. The Obama administration announced regulatory reform for the U.S. financial system in response to the global financial crisis. Various bills in Congress address issues such as oversight of Federal Reserve and Treasury lending, housing and mortgage markets, consumer credit cards, and national debt. The U.S. must consider international regulations in the context of multinational corporations. The G-20, IMF, and Financial Stability Board aim to coordinate regulatory changes among nations to prevent business migration due to burdensome U.S. regulations. The third G-20 Summit in 2009 focused on tougher financial sector regulations, including limits on banker bonuses. The G-20 Summit in 2009 focused on regulatory changes to prevent business migration, including limits on banker bonuses and increased cooperation on global economic trade imbalances. The leaders called for a greater role for the IMF and collaboration with the Financial Stability Board to address macroeconomic and financial risks. National financial supervisors were urged to establish Colleges of Supervisors overseeing globally active financial institutions. At the April 2009 G-20 London Summit, a schism arose between the United States and the U.K., who argued for large stimulus packages, and Germany and France, who saw existing programs as sufficient. The G-20 leaders decided to add $1.1 trillion to international financial institutions, including $750 billion for the IMF, $250 billion for global trade, and $100 billion for development banks. President Obama signed H.R. 2346 into law, increasing the U.S. quota in the IMF and providing loans of up to $116.01 billion. On June 17, 2009, the Obama Administration proposed financial regulatory reform with twelve titles of legislation focusing on promoting supervision and regulation of financial firms. Key proposals include establishing a Financial Services Oversight Council and granting the Federal Reserve authority to supervise firms posing a threat to financial stability. Legislation in Congress also addresses these issues. The Obama Administration proposed financial regulatory reform with key proposals including supervision of all firms posing a threat to financial stability, stronger capital standards, a new National Bank Supervisor, elimination of loopholes, registration of advisers of hedge funds, and comprehensive supervision of financial markets. This includes enhanced regulation of securitization markets, transparency requirements, stronger regulation of credit rating agencies, and comprehensive regulation of all financial markets. The Obama Administration proposed financial regulatory reform including supervision of firms posing a threat, stronger capital standards, a new National Bank Supervisor, and comprehensive oversight of financial markets. This involves enhanced regulation of securitization markets, transparency requirements, and stronger regulation of credit rating agencies. Additionally, measures are in place to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse through a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency and higher standards for providers of financial products. The government is also equipped with tools to manage financial crises, including a regime to resolve nonbank financial institutions and revisions to the Federal Reserve's emergency lending authority. The Obama Administration proposed financial regulatory reform including supervision of firms posing a threat, stronger capital standards, a new National Bank Supervisor, and comprehensive oversight of financial markets. This involves enhanced regulation of securitization markets, transparency requirements, and stronger regulation of credit rating agencies. Measures are in place to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse through a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency and higher standards for providers of financial products. The Treasury proposed international reforms to support U.S. efforts, including strengthening the capital framework, improving oversight of global financial markets, coordinating supervision of internationally active firms, and enhancing crisis management tools. Numerous bills have been introduced in Congress addressing financial regulatory issues, with the House passing H.R. 4173, The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in December 2009. The Treasury Plan proposed the U.S. Federal Reserve as a systemic regulator for macro-prudential supervision and systemic risk. Congressional bills like H.R. 4173 and H.R. 3996 aim to create a Financial Services Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk. H.R. 1754 / S. 664 would establish a systemic risk monitor for the U.S. financial system, including an independent Financial Stability Council and transferring authorities to the Comptroller of the Currency. The Treasury Plan proposed the U.S. Federal Reserve as a systemic regulator for macro-prudential supervision and systemic risk. Congressional bills like H.R. 4173 and H.R. 3996 aim to create a Financial Services Oversight Council to monitor systemic risk. S. 2746 and H.R. 2897 address the issue of Too Big to Fail financial companies, with S. 2746 calling for their breakup and H.R. 2897 requiring premium assessments by the FDIC based on banks' risk levels. President Obama also proposed the Volker Rule to limit a single bank's total holdings to 10%. President Obama proposed the Volcker Rule in 2010 to limit a single bank's total holdings to 10% and prevent banks from operating hedge funds, private equity funds, and engaging in risky investments for quick rewards. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker highlighted moral hazard and the issue of deposit insurance for banks. Banks argue that separating proprietary trading from market making operations is challenging. After recent bank rescue programs, large financial institutions can rely on public support, creating moral hazard. Legislation addresses concerns about credit rating agencies' failures in rating derivatives. Various bills aim to enhance oversight of rating agencies and regulate derivatives. Several bills address the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, including H.R. 4173, H.R. 3795, H.R. 977, and H.R. 2454. Other derivatives bills include H.R. 1754, H.R. 2448, H.R. 2869, H.R. 3145, H.R. 3153, H.R. 3300, S. 221, S. 272, S. 447, S. 664, S. 807, S. 961, S. 1225, S. 1399, and S. 1412. Additionally, investor protection is addressed in bills such as H.R. 4173, H.R. 3817, and H.R. 3818. H.R. 3818, Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2009, requires certain hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC. Bills have been introduced to establish commissions to study the financial crisis, including the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission authorized by S. 386. The House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs must submit a report within 120 days, terminating the Commission 60 days after. Republican approval is required for subpoenas. Other related bills include H.Res. 345 / S.Res. 62, H.R. 74, H.R. 768, H.R. 2111, H.R. 2253 / S. 298, and S. 400. Various bills address housing market, mortgages, and foreclosures, such as the Troubled Assets Relief Program and foreclosure prevention initiatives. S. 896, Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, and S. 386, Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, became laws in May 2009. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (FERA) became law on May 20, 2009, amending the federal criminal code to include mortgage lending businesses under the definition of \"financial institution.\" The Obama Administration prioritized consumer protection in financial markets, proposing bills like H.R. 4173 and H.R. 3126 to establish a Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) to safeguard consumers when borrowing money or obtaining financial products and services. The bill aims to regulate financial institutions but exempts non-financial entities like retailers and service providers. Various bills propose oversight and investigations into activities related to the financial crisis, including the establishment of the Congressional Oversight Panel and monthly reports on the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009, H.R. 1207, S. 1223, and H.R. 4482 / S. 1683 propose reforms and oversight related to the financial crisis, including audits of the Federal Reserve, congressional approval for TARP funds, and recaptured taxpayer investments being used to reduce the national debt. Executive compensation for firms is also addressed. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 restricts executive compensation for firms receiving government support during the financial crisis. Legislative proposals aim to give shareholders more influence in compensation and governance decisions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 restricts executive compensation for financial firms receiving government support during the crisis, aiming to give shareholders more influence in compensation and governance decisions. Legislation also prohibits incentive pay structures encouraging inappropriate risk-taking and requires adoption of say on pay. For fiscal stimulus and monetary policy, refer to CRS Report R40104 and CRS Report RL34427. For Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and GSEs policy, see CRS Report RS21663, CRS Report RS22950, and CRS Report R40800. IMF policy is covered in CRS Report RS22976. The global financial crisis has unfolded in four phases, with each phase impacting the others. The first phase involved intervention to contain contagion and strengthen financial sectors in countries. This included policy actions such as lowering interest rates. For more information on IMF policy, refer to CRS Report RS22976. During the global financial crisis, countries took macroeconomic actions like lowering interest rates and quantitative easing, as well as microeconomic measures such as financial rescue packages for firms and guaranteeing bank deposits. Governments also intervened by rescuing \"too big to fail\" institutions, facilitating mergers, and purchasing problem assets. These unprecedented actions aimed to restore confidence in credit markets and resolve immediate crisis effects. During the global financial crisis, countries implemented various measures to contain the contagion. In the United States, traditional monetary policy has been nearly exhausted, leading to quantitative easing and direct intervention in toxic assets. Resolving underlying issues with toxic assets and restoring financial institutions' health is crucial to prevent prolonged financial crises. During the global financial crisis, countries implemented measures to contain contagion. In the United States, various institutions worked together under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to invest in banks and address toxic assets. The U.S. Treasury also released details of a Public Private Partnership Investment Program to tackle legacy assets in the financial system. The U.S. Federal Reserve conducted $1.2 trillion in emergency commitments to stabilize the financial sector during the global financial crisis. This included interventions such as a safety net for commercial banks, rescuing Bear Stearns, and providing loans for money-market assets. The severity of the macroeconomic downturn was the worst since the Great Depression, affecting economies worldwide. Countries with emerging markets were particularly impacted by capital flight. The global financial crisis led to a widespread economic slowdown, affecting both developed and developing markets. Governments implemented traditional monetary and fiscal policies to address recessionary conditions, declining tax revenues, and rising unemployment. The crisis had a significant impact on economic growth rates worldwide, with many countries experiencing a recession. This synchronous drop in growth rates made it challenging for nations to export their way out of the recession, including China facing a \"growth recession.\" In July-August 2009, forecasters predicted a weak global economic recovery starting in the second half of the year. The OECD revised its outlook, with China and developing countries showing higher growth rates, while the United States had less negative growth. Housing prices were falling in most OECD countries except for Switzerland. In response to the global recession, many countries implemented fiscal stimulus packages to spur economic recovery. These packages, totaling over $2 trillion globally, included measures such as government spending, tax cuts, and bank stabilization efforts. Notable contributors to these packages were China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and South Korea. The global fiscal stimulus packages, totaling $2 trillion, aim to stabilize banks and financial institutions. The packages amount to approximately 3% of world GDP, exceeding the IMF's recommended 2% for countering economic downturns. Specific percentages of GDP for different regions include 1.32% for the European Community, 1.9% for the U.S., 0.9% for the euro area, 1.4% for Japan, and 1.5% for Asia excluding Japan. At the G-20 London Summit, a schism arose between the United States and the U.K., who argued for large stimulus packages, and Germany and France, who considered existing programs sufficient. The leaders committed to delivering sustained fiscal effort to restore growth, adding $1.1 trillion to international financial institutions. The G-20 London Summit resulted in a commitment to boost global trade with $250 billion and provide $100 billion for multilateral development banks. International financial institutions are urged to provide additional lending to countries in need, as some nations face the risk of a sovereign debt crisis due to currency depreciation and high debt exposure. The IMF has already provided financial support packages for countries like Iceland and Ukraine. The IMF is providing financial support packages for various countries, including Iceland, Ukraine, Hungary, Pakistan, Belarus, Serbia, Armenia, El Salvador, Latvia, Seychelles, Mongolia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Romania. Additionally, the IMF has created a Flexible Credit Line for countries with strong fundamentals, approving loans for Mexico, Poland, and Colombia. The third phase of the global financial crisis is underway to determine necessary changes in the financial system. The third phase of the global financial crisis involves coordinating reforms in national regulatory systems through international meetings like the G-20 Summits to address policy, regulations, oversight, and enforcement. World leaders are working on \"fixing the system\" to prevent future crises. President Obama hosted the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009 to address these issues. The leaders at the November 2008 G-20 Summit approved an Action Plan for preventing future financial crises. This plan includes recommendations on regulatory policies, global accounting standards, transparency in credit derivatives markets, compensation practices, and the governance of International Financial Institutions. The leaders at the November 2008 G-20 Summit approved an Action Plan for preventing future financial crises, including recommendations on regulatory policies, global accounting standards, transparency in credit derivatives markets, compensation practices, and governance of International Financial Institutions. The plan involves collaboration with international organizations like the International Accounting Standards Board, Financial Stability Board, and IMF to address macroeconomic and financial risks. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) will collaborate with the IMF to provide early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and recommend actions to address them. The Pittsburgh Summit agreed to regulate hedge funds and Credit Rating Agencies, leaving individual countries to reshape regulatory systems to identify systemic risks. The United States faces questions about altering laws to conform to FSB recommendations and the authority of the Board and IMF. The London Summit strengthened regulations and the IMF but did not establish a new international financial architecture, raising the question of changing the Bretton Woods system. The United States is considering a shift towards a more \"Europeanized\" financial market structure within the international financial architecture. The President's Working Group on Financial Markets is addressing these issues in collaboration with international financial organizations. Regulatory reform proposals are being discussed, with a focus on strengthening or potentially increasing control over the financial system. Regulatory reform proposals by U.S. Treasury and G-20 include stricter regulations for systemically important financial institutions, enhanced stress testing, more stringent capital standards, registration requirements for hedge funds, and increased oversight on over-the-counter derivatives. The U.S. Treasury and G-20 propose stricter regulations for systemically important financial institutions, stress testing, capital standards, hedge fund registration, and oversight on over-the-counter derivatives, including credit default swaps through regulated clearing houses. Minimum international standards should apply in all countries, including tax havens. Other proposals include a single regulator for important financial institutions, stronger regulation of payment systems, and authority for government intervention in failing non-bank institutions. The fourth phase of the financial crisis involves dealing with political, social, and security effects of the turmoil, including the impact on the United States' global leadership position and the security threat posed by instability in countries affected by the crisis. Dennis Blair highlighted the geopolitical implications of the crisis as a primary security threat to the U.S. The crisis affects political leadership and regimes through discontent and instability. The drop in oil prices has significant implications for countries heavily reliant on oil revenues, leading to discontent among citizens and potential extremist movements, especially in poorer nations. This can challenge existing leadership and regimes, particularly in democracies, as public opposition grows. The drop in oil prices has implications for countries reliant on oil revenues, affecting political stability in petroleum exporting countries. The decrease in commodity prices also impacts exporter countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Pakistan faces economic challenges amidst security issues and a budget shortfall. The financial crisis strengthens central government power by blaming the industrialized West for economic woes, fueling nationalism and support for ruling regimes. Political authorities take actions to counter the crisis, consolidating their power and preserving their positions. The financial crisis strengthens central government power, leading authoritarian regimes to take dictatorial actions to address economic challenges. Expediency is prioritized over free-market ideologies, potentially hastening the decline of economic neoliberalism. Market-based structures will likely persist, but there is a shift towards increased regulation, government intervention, and some reversal of trade barriers reduction. Emerging market countries, especially in Eastern Europe, may be affected. State capitalism is on the rise globally, with governments nationalizing or owning shares in companies and intervening in their operations. This trend is seen in countries like Russia, the United States, Europe, and Asia. Government involvement in economic decision-making, including nationalization of banks and financial institutions, raises concerns about efficiency and equity. The rise of state capitalism globally involves governments nationalizing or owning shares in companies, raising concerns about efficiency, equity, and the use of government resources in oversight. This has been exemplified by public scrutiny over executive compensation, government loans, and the ideological debate on the government's role in the economy. Calls to avoid protectionism in stimulating economies have been made in international meetings like the G-20. Countries have been resorting to protectionist measures to boost their economies, such as buying domestic products, providing financial assistance to local producers, and offering export incentives. While the World Trade Organization limits overt trade restrictions, there is room for increasing trade barriers within its rules. This includes raising tariffs, imposing countervailing duties, and implementing antidumping measures. Certain sectors may be excluded from trade agreements for national security reasons, and there are opportunities to support domestic producers over foreign ones through industry-specific relief programs and subsidies. In July 2009, the WTO reported a trend towards more trade-restricting policies, with some countries resorting to protectionist measures to assist domestic industries. While there were also trade-liberalizing measures introduced, overall governments did not unwind the measures taken early in the crisis. New trade-restricting measures included an increase in trade remedy investigations and the implementation of new tariffs and non-tariff measures. The WTO reported an increase in trade-restricting policies, including new tariffs and non-tariff measures affecting merchandise trade. Various countries implemented measures such as steel tariffs, increased tariffs on imported products, restrictions on imports, and imposition of licensing requirements on sensitive products. Between November 2008 and November 2009, 297 discriminatory trade measures were implemented globally. Between November 2008 and November 2009, 297 discriminatory trade measures were implemented globally, with 184 by G-20 member states. China was the most targeted country with 146 protectionist measures, followed by the European Union, the United States, and Japan. Russia, China, and Indonesia adopted the most protectionist measures. Despite this, a repeat of 1930s protectionism has been avoided so far. China announced policy responses including a $586 billion boost to domestic spending and export tax rebates. China announced export tax rebates for certain products and \"Buy Chinese\" stimulus package spending. In 2009, China kept its currency stable against the dollar despite calls for appreciation. The US Buy America provision in the stimulus package was criticized for being protectionist. Many nations protested the provision, fearing it could lead to WTO-inconsistent protectionism. The global financial crisis has raised concerns about protectionism and financial protectionism among countries. The United States imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese tire imports, and there is worry that countries may resort to WTO-inconsistent protectionism. Developing nations fear \"financial protectionism\" may emerge, with governments directing banks to lend domestically. The US borrowing to cover its deficit could crowd out other countries seeking funds. Exporters like Vietnam and China are concerned about declining investment capital due to excess production capacity. The global financial crisis has raised concerns about the role of the United States on the world stage and its leadership position. The Obama Administration emphasizes diplomacy while still maintaining a strong presence in areas like Afghanistan. The rest of the world has mixed feelings towards the U.S., blaming it for the crisis but also recognizing its ability to influence other nations. The U.S. presence and leadership are crucial in finding solutions to the financial crisis. The United States' presence and leadership are crucial in finding solutions to the global financial crisis. U.S. military power, economic clout, and veto power in the IMF make it central to resolving the turmoil. European leaders initially played a significant role in crafting policies, while countries like China, Russia, and Japan have also gained influence in world financial circles. China's financing of U.S. budget deficits has further elevated its political profile. The United States' influence in global financial issues is crucial, but China's financing of U.S. budget deficits is increasing its political profile. As Beijing sees its economic system as superior, Washington is losing leverage on various issues. The inclusion of China, India, and Brazil in G-20 Summits reflects the growing influence of non-industrialized nations. Despite this, the U.S. image is improving globally, especially in Western Europe. In Western Europe, favorable ratings for the nation and American people have increased, along with positive opinions of America in key countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. The financial crisis has brought international financial organizations like the IMF, Financial Stability Board, G-20, World Bank, and others into focus. The architecture of any international financial structure and its powers are yet to be determined, but the need for stronger coordination in global financial and economic markets is evident. The interconnectedness of global financial and economic markets has emphasized the necessity for stronger institutions to coordinate regulatory policies internationally. The IMF has expanded its role as a lender of last resort and is now offering flexible credit lines to countries with strong economic fundamentals. Sovereignty remains a key question in determining the extent of power an international organization should have compared to national authorities. The IMF has expanded its oversight of the international economy, monitoring systemic risk and providing policy advice to countries. The organization is also assisting the G-20 with recommendations for international regulation and governance. President Obama signed a law increasing the U.S. quota in the IMF by $7.69 billion. The U.S. increased its quota in the IMF by $7.69 billion and authorized loans of up to $116.01 billion. The President signed a $105.9 billion war spending bill that included IMF provisions, but he expressed concerns about certain sections interfering with his constitutional authority in foreign relations. The President signed a war spending bill with IMF provisions but expressed concerns about sections interfering with his foreign relations authority. The G-20 Leader's Summit in 2008 led to policy changes addressed in the April 2009 Summit in London. Specific changes have been assigned to international organizations like the Financial Stability Board and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The global crisis is causing losses and pushing people into poverty in developing countries through declining exports, falling commodity prices, reverse migration, and shrinking remittances. This affects countries with large numbers of migrant workers like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. The decline in tax revenues is increasing competition for budget funds and affecting decisions on resource allocation, impacting official development assistance and poverty alleviation programs. The economic downturn is affecting developing countries through declining exports, falling commodity prices, and shrinking remittances. This poses challenges for poverty alleviation programs and official development assistance. In the United States, financial constraints may impact foreign policy priorities, such as increasing non-military aid to Afghanistan or global health programs. President Obama and top officials aim to boost civilian foreign policy institutions and U.S. foreign assistance levels, but resource limitations due to the global economic downturn complicate these efforts. The global financial crisis has led to significant wealth destruction, with uncertainty surrounding the economic recovery and the potential impact once government stimulus measures end. Unemployment is on the rise, and many companies are facing bankruptcy. Despite some recovery in equity markets, the future remains uncertain. The global financial crisis has led to significant wealth destruction and uncertainty about the economic recovery post-government stimulus measures. It is unclear if the crisis can be fixed with minor adjustments or if major systemic changes are needed. Strong entrenched interests make even small changes in financial regulation challenging. Efforts are being made to change regulatory structures, global financial architecture, and trade imbalances to prevent future crises. Policy proposals in the US and Europe are taking a multipronged approach to address the crisis at different levels of financial markets globally. The global financial crisis has highlighted the lack of international architecture to prevent crises. There is no supranational authority with oversight and regulatory powers, leading to a system based on trust and confidence. International norms for financial institutions are voluntary, and countries are slow to incorporate them into domestic law. The crisis has made investors question the reliability of credit ratings on securities. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 saw a significant downgrade in credit ratings by agencies like Standard & Poor's, affecting $1.5 trillion of U.S. residential-mortgage-backed bonds. The crisis spread globally, impacting economies and innocent bystanders connected through trade and investments. International organizations like the IMF and World Bank monitored the situation but focused more on the global economy. The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 was influenced by macro and micro factors, leading to market excesses and systemic risks. In the United States, regulation is mainly by function with separate agencies overseeing banking, insurance, securities, and futures, lacking macroprudential oversight. The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 was influenced by macro and micro factors, leading to market excesses and systemic risks. In the United States, regulation is mainly by function with separate agencies overseeing banking, insurance, securities, and futures. Microprudential regulation lacks the ability to monitor systemic risk or coordinate actions throughout the financial system. The Council on Foreign Relations suggests that a systemic regulator should oversee the health and stability of the overall financial system, gathering information, implementing regulations, and coordinating with fiscal authorities. The central bank should be responsible for monitoring systemic risks, as suggested by the European Central Bank. Macroprudential analysis should encompass all components of financial systems, their interactions, and the relationship between the financial system and the economy. Financial markets are constantly evolving due to innovation and international integration, leading to potential crises from poorly managed liberalizations or innovations. The interconnectedness of global financial centers can lead to systemic risk amplification due to actions in different countries. Regulatory compatibility among major financial centers is crucial to prevent business flow to areas with minimal supervision. The challenge of institutions being \"too big to fail\" poses a risk to the world economy. The concept of institutions being \"too big to fail\" poses a significant risk to the system as a whole. Governmental support may create a moral hazard, leading to risky behavior. Regulatory challenges include understanding and regulating innovative financial instruments, bringing entities like hedge funds under regulatory authority, and addressing the failure of micro-prudential regulation to identify and address accumulating financial risks. Analysts and institutions raised alarms before the crisis due to a lack of regulatory tools to manage risk accumulation. Market participants and authorities did not adequately respond to these risks. The challenge is to determine the necessary level of regulation to moderate behavior that may be in institutions' financial interest but could pose excessive risks. The financial crisis highlighted the need for improved regulation to prevent risky behavior by institutions. Foreign financial institutions are also vulnerable to the health of American banks and financial institutions due to the interconnected nature of the global financial system. Investors worldwide seek higher risk-adjusted returns in financial markets, where innovations quickly spread across borders. The revolution in communications allows for instant access to information but also spreads biased or incomplete information. International trade flows are directly affected by macroeconomic conditions. Global markets are experiencing historic declines, with drops in stock, currency, and commodity markets. There is a mismatch between regulators and those being regulated. The policy implementation, oversight, and regulation in financial markets primarily rest with national governments, even though many institutions being regulated are international in presence. These institutions operate in major financial centers like London, New York, and Hong Kong, where client portfolios are based. The derivatives market, for example, is centered in London, despite a significant portion being issued by U.S. companies. The proportion of derivatives issued by U.S. companies based on U.S. assets raises questions about government intervention in corporations receiving federal support. Financial regulations aim for stability, transparency, and equity, but public pressure increases for regulation once public support is provided. The nature of regulation and supervision differs between banking and federal securities regulation. Federal securities regulation is primarily based on disclosure, with registration required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, registration does not guarantee safety, only full disclosure of risks. The SEC lacks authority to prevent excessive risk-taking, leading to financial crises occurring sporadically worldwide. Each crisis is unique but bears resemblance to others, with policy makers often breaking rules in response. The current crisis, similar to past financial crises, has been caused by factors such as market overshooting, excessive debt leveraging, credit booms, risk miscalculations, capital outflows, asset mismatches, unsustainable macroeconomic policies, off-balance sheet operations, inexperience with financial instruments, and insufficient market oversight. This crisis is reminiscent of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, where countries had to borrow from the IMF to manage short-term foreign debt and currency devaluation. Countries then began accumulating foreign exchange reserves to avoid similar situations. Countries accumulated dollars, Euros, pounds, and yen due to low foreign exchange reserves, driven by the U.S. trade deficit and low saving rate. By mid-2008, world currency reserves reached $4.4 trillion, with China holding nearly $2 trillion, Japan almost $1 trillion, and other countries also holding significant amounts. Some nations invested reserves in sovereign wealth funds for higher returns. The dot-com boom, fueled by \"hot money,\" ended in 2000 with the collapse of high-tech stocks. After the dot-com bust in 2000, investment capital shifted to housing markets globally. China and other countries invested in U.S. Treasury securities, keeping interest rates low. This led to a housing boom and the rise of securitization of assets, including subprime mortgages, into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Mortgage originators, often finance companies, wrote mortgages using funds from banks and had no responsibility for the loans. The housing boom led to the rise of securitization of assets, including subprime mortgages, into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Mortgage originators had no responsibility for loans gone bad, incentivizing them to maximize the number of loans concluded. To cover the risk of defaults on mortgages, holders of CDOs purchased credit default swaps (CDSs), a type of insurance contract against credit events associated with debt. CDSs quickly became a speculative asset. The rise of securitization of assets, including subprime mortgages, led to the creation of credit default swaps (CDSs) as a speculative asset. Sellers of CDSs could earn large fees without sufficient capital requirements, leading to a $62 trillion notional value of CDSs by 2007. Investors could arbitrage between lower and higher risk CDSs to generate income streams with perceived minimal risk. The notional value of credit default swaps (CDSs) reached $62 trillion by 2007, exceeding the global GDP. However, the actual risk was only around 3.5%. As defaults increased, the value of CDSs declined to $46.95 trillion by October 2008. The financial crisis was fueled by the originate-to-distribute model for mortgages and the securitization of assets, leading to outsized profits and eventually outsized losses for companies like AIG. The financial crisis was fueled by the originate-to-distribute model for mortgages and the securitization of assets, leading to outsized profits and eventually outsized losses for companies like AIG. This recycled funds back to the mortgage market and made mortgages more available. However, the originator was not penalized for not ensuring borrower qualifications, and investors relied heavily on credit agency ratings. Credit rating agencies faced perverse incentives and complexity, lacking experience with credit default swaps at the \"systemic failure\" tail of the probability distribution. The financial crisis was fueled by the originate-to-distribute model for mortgages and securitization of assets, leading to outsized profits and losses for companies like AIG. Credit rating agencies faced perverse incentives and complexity, lacking experience with credit default swaps during a systemic crisis. The blurring of lines between issuers of credit default swaps and traditional insurers led to inadequate capital to pay claims in case of default. The CDS market was largely unregulated by the government, with over 850 institutions in 56 countries belonging to the ISDA. ISDA members subscribe to a master agreement and protocols requiring collateral posting in certain circumstances, leading some companies to bankruptcy. The blurring of boundaries among banks, brokerage houses, and insurance agencies made regulation difficult, especially in the United States where separate agencies oversee different financial sectors. The global financial crisis was triggered by the bursting of the housing bubble and the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Factors contributing to the severity of the situation included leveraged debt, deficits in international trade, \"hot money\" investments, rising commodity prices, interest rate hikes, slow economic growth, and increased globalization. The global financial crisis was fueled by factors like leveraged debt, deficits in international trade, rising commodity prices, and increased globalization. This led to rapid communication, instant fund transfers, and a herd instinct in the world economy, causing uncertainty and changing expectations. Stock market values plummeted globally, with indices in the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Russia falling by nearly half by mid-October 2008. Despite a slow recovery, concerns remain about a sustained decline in stock markets. The global financial crisis led to significant declines in stock market values worldwide, driven by changes in expectations and capital flight from risky assets. Investors withdrew funds from BRIC countries rapidly, coinciding with new accounting rules that reduced banks' capital base and limited their ability to lend. This highlighted the global nature of capital markets and the speed of international capital flows. The global financial crisis severely impacted banks and insurance companies, leading to diminished capital reserves and triggering credit default swap contracts. The market saw a rise in defaults and bankruptcies, causing stock prices to plummet. Hedge funds also suffered losses, leading to frozen credit markets. During the financial crisis in October 2008, trust and confidence in lending evaporated as lenders reassessed risk. The Libor rate doubled to 5.1%, causing interbank lending to stop briefly. The \"Ted spread\" between Treasury bills and Libor averaged 0.25. During the financial crisis in October 2008, the \"Ted spread\" between Treasury bills and Libor exceeded 4.5 percentage points, causing anxiety in the marketplace. As the crisis led to a global economic slowdown, countries pursued expansionary monetary policies by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Investors sought safety in cash, leading to increased demand for U.S. Treasury securities and a decrease in U.S. interest rates. During the financial crisis, the influx of liquid capital into the United States attracted investors, causing a decline in demand for vulnerable countries' currencies and an increase in their interest rates. The crisis led to a depreciation of the Euro and other European currencies relative to the dollar, while the Japanese yen continued to appreciate. Other currencies like the Korean won and Icelandic krona experienced sharp declines but the won has since recovered somewhat. A weak currency in a crisis-hit country increases the local currency. The financial crisis caused a weak currency in crisis-hit countries, making it harder to service debt denominated in dollars. Governments took drastic measures to prevent financial collapse, some seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund. Economic growth rates dropped in some countries in the fourth quarter of 2008 as they shifted focus from shoring up financial institutions to dealing with recessionary conditions. Stimulus packages became a priority to assist in recovery efforts. In the fourth quarter of 2008, economic growth rates dropped significantly in some countries, leading to high levels of unemployment. Stimulus packages were implemented by major countries, with the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan all introducing large packages. The global credit crunch that started in 2007 has caused a financial crisis in emerging market countries, particularly impacting those in Central and Eastern Europe. Emerging market countries, particularly Central and Eastern Europe, have been heavily impacted by the financial crisis. Countries like Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania saw high growth rates due to borrowing from global markets, but became vulnerable when credit lines dried up. These countries rank high in debt, current account deficits, foreign investment dependence, and domestic banking sector indebtedness. Central and Eastern European countries like Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania have high current account deficits, with Latvia at 22.9% and Bulgaria at 21.4% in 2008. The region's average deficit exceeded 6% in 2008. Due to the financial crisis, countries in the region sought IMF loans, including Iceland, Ukraine, Hungary, and Kyrgyzstan. The IMF approved a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement for Pakistan on November 24 to support economic stabilization. Emerging market economies accumulated foreign reserves as self-insurance against capital flow disruptions since the Asian financial crisis. Export-led growth strategies and rising commodity prices also drove reserve accumulation. Emerging market economies, including oil-exporting countries, reported large current account surpluses due to a rise in commodity prices from 2004 to 2008. Foreign reserve accumulation increased, providing financial security. Some countries established sovereign wealth funds to invest reserves for higher yields. Analysts believed that emerging markets had successfully \"decoupled\" their growth from industrialized countries, deepening global trade and finance linkages. Emerging market countries in Eastern Europe and Asia have developed their economies and trade to a point where a slowdown in the US or Europe would not have a significant impact. A report by IMF economists found evidence of this, showing that the influence of developed countries on emerging markets has decreased over the past twenty years. Emerging markets have diversified their economies, achieved high growth rates, and become important players in the global economy. Emerging market countries have diversified their economies, achieved high growth rates, and become important players in the global economy. Despite efforts at self-insurance through reserve accumulation, the U.S. financial crisis in October 2008 affected all emerging markets due to their dependence on foreign capital flows. Brazil, India, Mexico, and Russia drew down their reserves to protect their currencies from depreciating against the U.S. dollar. The vulnerability of emerging markets, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, lies in their high dependence on foreign capital flows for economic growth. Despite efforts to reduce net capital inflows, the large amount of gross foreign capital flows remains a key vulnerability. Countries with high gross and net capital flows, like those in Central and Eastern Europe, are at even higher risk of financial crisis. Once a crisis occurs, it becomes difficult for these countries to continue financing their foreign debt, particularly if domestic banks or corporations fund themselves in foreign currency. Corporations in emerging markets face challenges in rolling over their foreign currency obligations, leading to uncertainty and loss of confidence. Western financial institutions have significant exposure to emerging markets, with G-10 institutions holding $4.7 trillion in total. European banks have a disproportionately high amount of lending to Central and Eastern Europe, making them vulnerable to financial crises. Western financial institutions have significant exposure to emerging markets, with European and U.K. banks lending between 21% and 24% to Central and Eastern Europe. This heavy debt increases vulnerability to financial crises. A downturn in industrialized countries will impact emerging markets through decreased export demand, affecting countries like China and India. The economic slowdown in industrialized countries will reduce demand for raw resources from developing countries like China and India, impacting commodity-exporting nations. Foreign aid may also decrease significantly in the coming years, as seen in past crises. Latin America is facing unique challenges due to the origins of the current financial crisis in the United States, affecting the region through shocks from the housing and credit market collapses. Latin America faced shocks from the U.S. housing and credit market collapses, despite minimal direct exposure to toxic assets. The crisis spread to the region, impacting countries differently based on policy differences and reliance on the U.S. economy or commodity exports. Initially, investors were wary, but a year later, many Latin American countries showed signs of economic stabilization and growth. The Latin American countries have stabilized and are showing signs of growth after the economic downturn caused by the U.S. housing and credit market collapses. Policy responses and macroeconomic fundamentals have helped mitigate the regional decline, but some countries still face challenges in recovering from the recession. Domestic policy reforms have led to macroeconomic stability, stronger fiscal positions, sounder banking systems, and lower sovereign debt risk. Latin America's growth trend is attributed to international economic fundamentals, with factors like commodity prices, external financing conditions, and remittances contributing to economic welfare. However, the region remains tied to world markets and trends, experiencing economic problems related to the financial crisis. Initial effects included high volatility in financial market indicators, with major indicators falling sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to capital inflows seeking safer havens. In the fourth quarter of 2008, capital inflows reversed direction towards safer assets, causing regional stock indexes and currencies in Latin American countries to plummet. Investor flight to the U.S. dollar reflected a lack of confidence in local currencies, leading to currency depreciation. Mexico and Brazil faced compounded currency losses due to speculative derivative positions, requiring central bank intervention. Debt markets tightened, credit became more expensive, and borrowing costs rose with widening bond spreads. In 2008, bond spreads in Latin America's Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) widened by 600 basis points, half in the fourth quarter. This indicated a pre-existing economic slowdown in the region, with the financial crisis exacerbating the situation. Some countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia maintained access to international debt markets, while others relied more on domestic debt placements. Financial markets showed signs of stabilization by mid-2009, with regional stock and currency indexes recovering 60% of their losses by September 2009. This suggested renewed interest and confidence in Latin America's ability to weather the downturn. In Latin America, sovereign bond spreads have decreased from their peak in 2008, indicating a trend reversal. However, countries like Argentina, Ecuador, and Venezuela still face high spreads due to their reliance on commodity exports and weak economic policies. The global crisis has led to second-order effects, impacting broader economic fundamentals in the region. The global crisis has led to second-order effects in Latin America, with GDP growth expected to be negative in 2009 and a slight recovery in 2010. The fall in global demand has caused a significant decline in exports and imports, leading to rising unemployment and severe aspects of the crisis. Remittances have also decreased, impacting family incomes and fiscal balances. Public sector borrowing is expected to rise, contributing to the regional slowdown. Policy responses to the regional economic slowdown in Latin America include increased lending from multilateral organizations like the IMF, World Bank, IDB, CAF, and LARF. These programs aim to address the credit crisis, stimulate demand, provide credit to the private sector, support bank recapitalization, and fund public sector spending for infrastructure and social programs. The United States provided dollar liquidity to central banks in Latin America through currency swap arrangements to support trade and investment transactions. National governments in the region are also using monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies to stimulate their economies. Many Latin American countries are using fiscal stimulus measures to boost their economies, with varying capacities due to high debt levels and recession constraints. Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico have implemented stimulus packages ranging from 2.5% to 8.5% of GDP. Government spending is the primary method, with Brazil also utilizing tax cuts and increased benefits. Some countries face limitations in using monetary policy, especially in reducing interest rates due to currency depreciations. Flexible exchange rates have helped countries manage adjustments without severe financial instability. The Mexican economy contracted for four consecutive quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, with a forecasted economic decline of 7%-8% for 2009, making it the hardest hit country in Latin America. Output fell in both industry and service sectors, with a 13% decline in industrial production, the worst since the 1995 \"peso crisis.\" Remittances may fall by 15% from $25 billion in 2008. Mexico's economy faced challenges due to heavy reliance on the U.S. economy, falling foreign investment, low oil prices, and declining oil output. The United States plays a significant role in Mexico's imports, exports, foreign investment, and remittances income. Despite the initial impact of the financial crisis, analysts predict a sharp increase in economic growth in the second half of 2009, with a 3.3% expansion in economic activity forecasted for 2010. The sustainability of this trend depends on the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. Mexico experienced a significant devaluation of the peso, dropping by 40% from its 2008 high due to factors such as investor portfolio re-balancing, falling commodity prices, and decreased U.S. demand for Mexican exports. Large private positions in the peso worsened the situation, leading to losses exceeding $1.4 billion for some firms. The government intervened by selling reserves and implementing temporary currency swaps to stabilize the currency. The Mexican government sold reserves and used currency swaps with the U.S. Federal Reserve to stabilize the peso, which was heavily impacted by the U.S. demand for exports. Industrial production suffered initially but rebounded with 2.8% growth in July 2009. Mexico's economic recovery depends on the recovery of U.S. aggregate demand, as its trade is heavily reliant on the U.S. market. Mexico's economy has shown improvement since June 2009, with a 15% increase in key indicators, although still below the peak in October 2007. The country has faced challenges due to a decline in remittances from Mexican workers in the U.S. and job losses in the formal economy. The government has implemented supportive monetary and fiscal policies, including increasing liquidity in the banking system and providing fiscal stimulus amounting to 2.5% of GDP. Programs are in place to support businesses, worker training, employment generation, and social safety nets. Mexico's response to the economic crisis has included maintaining and expanding support for medium-sized businesses, worker training, employment generation, and social safety nets. However, the costs of these measures have strained Mexico's public finances, with the fiscal deficit expected to reach 3.5% of GDP for 2009 and 2010. Recent credit rating downgrades reflect concerns over Mexico's financial position, especially as its recovery relies heavily on a U.S. economic rebound. Analysts believe Mexico may have reached its financial limits, but some speculate that the effects of current policies could continue to support its recovery. Brazil's economy is expected to recover from a two-quarter recession in the second half of 2009. Despite a slight contraction in 2009, the economy grew by 5.1% in 2008. Commodity price rebound has boosted Brazilian output and exports, with industrial production also on the rise. However, fiscal pressures from stimulus packages pose a short-term financial burden. The financial crisis led to a significant drop in Brazil's stock market index in 2008. The Brazilian government sold billions of dollars to fight a depreciating currency, with the real falling over 35% from its 2008 high. Brazil's central bank agreed to a currency swap with the U.S. Federal Reserve and has $200 billion in reserves. The country's well-regulated banking system and experienced central bank leadership have helped maintain confidence in the financial system. Financial indicators show stability and hint at an upcoming economic recovery. The Brazilian real has fully recovered against the U.S. dollar, with the stock index up 17% since January 2009. Bond spreads on Brazilian debt are only 200 basis points above U.S. treasuries, reflecting confidence in the country's economic prospects. Government debt was upgraded to investment grade, supporting further confidence. Despite challenges in the nonfinancial economy, July employment figures showed a net job increase of 292,000, indicating a beginning of recovery. Brazil's trade account has improved due to the recovery of commodity prices and strong demand from China. Capital inflows have slowed despite solid macroeconomic performance. Fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts and government spending, have helped mitigate the effects of the global downturn. The country has maintained support for social programs and made provisions for low-income housing. Brazil has implemented fiscal stimulus measures, including tax cuts and government spending, to support social programs and low-income housing. The government has reduced its primary fiscal surplus target to 2.5% of GDP to accommodate increased commitments, leading to concerns over growing deficits. In addition to fiscal response, Brazil has focused on enhancing financial sector liquidity through monetary policy, injecting billions into the banking system and lowering interest rates. State-owned banks have been authorized to purchase private banks, accounting rules for derivatives have been tightened, and credit has been extended directly to firms through the National Development Bank (BNDES). Argentina, due to its shaky economic and financial position, struggled to cope with the crisis compared to other Latin American countries. The country experienced a contraction of -0.8% in the second quarter of 2009, following a period of economic growth fueled by a rebound from the 2001-2002 financial crisis and rising commodity prices. Argentina's economy suffered in 2009 due to the collapse of commodity prices, leading to decreased export and fiscal revenues. Investment, consumer demand, and industrial production also declined. Capacity utilization dropped from 79% to 67.4%, with sectors like motor vehicles, metallurgy, and textiles hit hard. Economists predict a 2-4% contraction for the year, with slow recovery and rising unemployment. The country's financial isolation, questionable policies, global recession, and drought have further eroded confidence in its financial system. Despite liquid and solvent banks, the stock market fell by 37% and the peso depreciated.

Capacity utilization dropped from 79% to 67.4%, with sectors like motor vehicles, metallurgy, and textiles hit hard. Economists predict a 2-4% contraction for the year, with slow recovery and rising unemployment. The country's financial isolation, questionable policies, global recession, and drought have further eroded confidence in its financial system. Despite liquid and solvent banks, the stock market fell by 37% and the peso depreciated by 18%. Among the questionable policies are the 2002 historic sovereign debt default, government interference in independent statistics reporting, price controls, high export taxes, and nationalization of private pension funds. These policies have led to market distortions, protests, and declining consumer confidence. Argentina's exports declined by 21% in the first half of 2009 due to falling demand and questionable financial policies. The currency depreciated by 20%, leading to trade restrictions on imports, particularly affecting Brazilian goods. This strained relations within the Mercosur customs union. Bond ratings fell, with high yields on public debt and increased interest rate spreads. The interest rate spread on Argentina's bonds rose to over 1,700 basis points, settling around 750-800 basis points, four times higher than Mexico or Brazil. Credit default swaps peaked at 4,500 basis points in December 2008, indicating high insurance costs against bond defaults. These indicators reflect a global perception of Argentina as high-risk, leading to its exclusion from international capital markets. Argentina's response to the economic crisis includes a large fiscal stimulus equal to 9% of GDP, mainly focused on public works spending, exacerbating short-term fiscal issues. With high debt costs, declining revenues, and limited access to credit markets, Argentina faces challenges ahead. Argentina faced challenges due to high debt costs, declining revenues, and limited access to credit markets. To finance programs, it nationalized the private-sector pension system in 2009, providing immediate assets of $29 billion and access to $4.6 billion in annual contributions. Bond swaps were conducted for guaranteed loans, but increased fiscal outlays and investor skepticism remain. Analysts suggest limited room for fiscal expansion, potentially impacting a budding recovery. Russia's economy, highly industrialized and hit hard by the global economic crisis, is slowly recovering due to structural issues like dependence on commodities and a weak banking system. Policymakers face the challenge of addressing these problems once the immediate effects of the crisis subside. Russia experienced impressive growth from 1999-2008, improving the standard of living for its citizens. The Russian economy saw significant growth from 1999-2008, driven by factors like a decline in the ruble value, surge in oil prices, and export revenues. However, the global financial crisis and recession led to a downturn, impacting demand for energy and access to foreign loans. Despite a 5.6% increase in real GDP in 2008, growth slowed compared to previous years. In 2008, Russia's real GDP increased by 5.6%, slower than in 2007. The GDP growth was only 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, there was a significant decline in GDP during the first and second quarters of 2009. The government had to tighten fiscal policy due to declining revenues, resulting in budget deficits for the first time since 1999. To address the crisis, the government implemented measures to support the stock market, banks, and stimulate domestic demand. In response to the economic crisis, the Russian government implemented various measures to support banks and companies, including providing funds for lending, lowering taxes on oil exports, and purchasing stocks. Additional packages of credits were announced in 2008 and 2009, with a shift towards macroeconomic measures such as reducing corporate tax rates to stimulate investment. The government also aimed to rein in expenditures to address budget deficits. The IMF projects a decline in Russia's real GDP of over 7.5% in 2009, with forecasts from private economic firms also predicting a downturn. Russia's economy is heavily reliant on oil and natural gas exports for income. Recovery is expected in 2010, with modest growth forecasts. Russia's economy heavily relies on oil and natural gas exports for income. To achieve sustainable growth, Russia must diversify its economy and reduce dependence on commodities. President Medvedev criticized the lack of diversification in 2009 and pledged to change economic policy. It is uncertain if Prime Minister Putin shares these views. The financial crisis initially seen as American spread to Europe, causing a decline in economic activity and global trade. Public protests over unemployment and economic turmoil increased political stakes for European governments. The crisis strained EU unity and solidarity, posing a challenge to common interests. International pressure may mount on governments not seen as stimulating their economies enough. Since the financial crisis, the European Union has taken steps to improve supervision of financial markets by strengthening advisory bodies like the Committee of European Securities Regulators, Committee of European Banking Supervisors, and Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors. These actions aim to enhance coordination and oversight of securities, banking, and financial conglomerates within EU members. The Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors was strengthened by the European Commission. It now has the authority to coordinate policies among EU members and improve transparency in credit rating agencies. The European Union also approved direct funding for various financial regulatory bodies and proposed measures to regulate hedge fund managers and executive compensation. European countries are concerned about the impact of the financial crisis and economic recession on East European economies, leading to worries about political instability and market reforms. Worsening economic conditions in East European countries are adding to the problems faced by financial institutions in the EU. Some fear that delayed actions to aid East European economies could harm European and US economies. Iceland and Latvia have seen government collapses due to public protests over governance issues. The financial crisis in Europe has led to government collapses in countries like Iceland and Latvia due to public protests over economic governance. The crisis has highlighted the interconnectedness between financial markets and the need for improved supervision and regulation to prevent future economic downturns. The United States and Europe share a mutual interest in developing a sound financial architecture to oversee the complex financial system. The financial crisis in Europe has led to varied responses by national governments and private firms, with some countries opting for a case-by-case approach while others seek a systemic solution. Great Britain proposed a plan to rescue distressed banks, while Iceland had to take over three of its largest banks to save its financial sector. This experience has raised questions about protecting depositors and managing financial sector debt without risking system-wide failure. The financial crisis in Europe was caused by factors similar to those in the United States, such as low interest rates and aggressive credit expansion. This led to a broad expansion in credit and economic growth, pushing up values of equities, commodities, and real estate. However, higher commodity prices and rising housing costs eventually led to a drop in consumer spending, resulting in a slowdown in economic activity and contraction. The drop in consumer spending caused a slowdown in economic activity, leading to a contraction in housing prices. This triggered a downgrade in subprime mortgage-backed securities ratings, closure of hedge funds, and spread concerns to other financial markets. The financial turmoil quickly spread to Europe as creditworthiness problems surfaced in the United States subprime mortgage market in July 2007. The financial turmoil spread to Europe due to linkages between national credit markets and international investors rebalancing their portfolios. This led to a drop in confidence in major European banks, disrupting the interbank market and causing money center banks to struggle with financing large securities portfolios. Financial institutions in Europe and elsewhere increasingly rely on short-term liquidity lines. The financial crisis has made financial institutions vulnerable to drawbacks in the interbank market. The International Monetary Fund estimates a significant impact on economic growth in Europe and the United States in 2009, with a projected drop in GDP and inflation expected to lessen. The drop in oil and commodity prices from 2008 highs may have provided some relief. The financial crisis has affected financial institutions, leading to a slowdown in economic growth in Europe and the United States in 2009. Despite a drop in oil and commodity prices from 2008 highs, the IMF projections struggle to accurately estimate economic growth rates. Central banks in various countries coordinated interest rate cuts in October 2008 to address the widening financial crisis, but concerns persisted as the crisis spread rapidly in Europe. The financial crisis spread rapidly across national borders, surprising many Europeans with its impact on economic growth in Europe. The crisis highlighted global economic and financial linkages, leading to coordinated actions by governments and central banks to stabilize banks and address the crisis. On October 10, 2008, G-7 finance ministers and central bankers met in Washington, DC, followed by a Euro area summit on October 12, 2008, where Euro area countries and the United Kingdom urged for a coordinated approach. At the Euro area summit on October 12, 2008, European governments, including the United Kingdom, agreed on measures to address the financial crisis. These measures included recapitalization of struggling banks, state ownership through buying shares in banks, government debt guarantees for new debts, and improved regulations for valuing assets based on default risk. EU leaders agreed on October 16, 2008, to set up a crisis unit and hold monthly meetings to improve financial oversight. Jose Manuel Barroso urged EU members to develop a \"fully integrated solution\" to address the global financial crisis. The European Council stressed the need to strengthen supervision of the European financial sector and urged EU members to develop a coordinated supervision system at the European level. The European Commission is considering rules for EU members to use a central clearing house for credit default swaps to reduce risk. They released a \"European Framework for Action\" to coordinate actions of EU member states in addressing the financial crisis. The European Commission is considering rules for EU members to use a central clearing house for credit default swaps to reduce risk. They released a \"European Framework for Action\" to coordinate actions of EU member states in addressing the financial crisis. The short-term plan focuses on a three-part approach to an overall EU recovery action plan/framework, including a new financial market architecture at the EU level and dealing with the impact on the real economy. The EU can assist member states in addressing unemployment and economic decline post-financial crisis by investing in R&D, education, promoting flexicurity, freeing up businesses, and enhancing competitiveness through green technology. The Commission will explore ways for EU members to boost economic growth globally. The financial crisis highlighted the interconnectedness between the financial sector and the goods-and services-producing sectors, prompting a need for a global response. The EU aims to reform global financial architecture by strengthening regulatory standards, coordination among financial supervisors, monitoring macroeconomic policies, and addressing financial crises at various levels. Key principles include efficiency, transparency, accountability, and representation of emerging economies. European leaders plan to promote these measures at the G-20 economic summit in November 2008. European leaders meeting before the G-20 economic summit in November 2008 agreed that the IMF should play a key role in preventing future financial crises. They set a 100-day deadline to reform the international financial system. There were discussions on fiscal stimulus measures to support interest rate cuts by central banks, with calls for the IMF to have a larger role in financial market regulation. French and German officials argued for the IMF to act as a global supervisor of regulators. Prime Minister Sarkozy suggested the IMF should assess the work of regulators. At the G-20 summit, leaders disagreed on the role of the IMF in the international financial system. German Chancellor Merkel proposed a 60 billion Euro stimulus package for infrastructure projects to address economic challenges. Other European leaders were not keen on formalized economic policy coordination. Germany's response to the economic downturn in January 2009 included a plan of over 60 billion Euros to prevent job cuts and provide government subsidies. There were discussions about creating a 100 billion Euro emergency fund for state-backed loans to aid struggling companies. This marked a significant shift from their previous stance in December 2008, where they disagreed with the EU's broad economic stimulus plan in favor of a more tailored approach for the German economy. Germany's response to the economic downturn in January 2009 included a tailored plan of over 60 billion Euros to prevent job cuts and provide government subsidies. Finance Minister Steinbruck argued against large-scale stimulus programs, stating that they are unlikely to have real-time effects and may not significantly encourage consumption during a recession. He highlighted the importance of automatic stabilizers like unemployment benefits in the German economy. France, leading European response to financial crisis, proposes $500 billion package. Two state agencies to provide funds: one with $480 billion in guarantees on inter-bank lending, valid for 5 years, and another with $60 billion to recapitalize struggling companies. President Sarkozy announces tougher stance on French banks seeking state aid, requiring suspension of dividends and bonuses for additional aid. France had injected $15 billion into French banking system prior to this announcement. On December 4, 2008, President Sarkozy announced a $33 billion stimulus package focused on infrastructure projects and investments by state-controlled firms in France. The plan includes a canal north of Paris, renovation of university buildings, new metro cars, construction of 70,000 new homes, and a 200 Euro payment to low-income households. Additionally, France agreed to provide $1.2 billion in credit guarantees to Renault and Peugeot's finance division and $250 million to support their consumer finance division on December 15, 2008. The French government is considering increasing aid to the auto industry, including Renault and Peugeot, which employ about 10% of France's labor force. The European Union is addressing the long-term needs of the financial system by commissioning a group to assess weaknesses and develop proposals for a stronger financial system. The European Union issued two reports in early 2009 to address financial market supervision. The de Larosiere Report, led by Jacques de Larosiere, focuses on causes of the financial crisis, organizing supervision of financial institutions, strengthening European cooperation, and organizing EU mechanisms for financial stability. The de Larosiere Report proposes recommendations on financial market regulation and supervision in the EU. It criticizes the inadequate crisis management infrastructure and inconsistent rules across EU members. The focus on micro-prudential supervision neglected the broader objective of macro-prudential supervision. The de Larosiere Report proposes a two-level approach to reform financial market supervision in the EU. It suggests creating a new macro-prudential level of supervision called the European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC) chaired by the President of the European Central Bank. The ESRC aims to coordinate national supervisors and assess system-wide risks to protect the economy from significant losses. The ESRC would gather information on macro-prudential risks in the EU, decide on policy, provide early risk warning to supervisors, compare observations on macroeconomic and prudential developments, and give direction. The Report recommends creating a new ESFS to transform L3 Committees into EU Authorities, maintaining a decentralized structure while coordinating actions of national authorities to maintain high supervisory standards and ensure strong cooperation with other supervisors. The ESFS authorities would ensure strong cooperation with other supervisors, adopt binding supervisory standards, oversee colleges of supervisors, license EU-wide institutions, and coordinate in crisis situations. National supervisors oversee daily operations of firms. The European Commission's \"Driving European Recovery\" proposes a different approach to financial supervision and recovery than the de Larosiere group. The European Commission's plan for financial supervision and recovery diverges from the de Larosiere group's proposal but incorporates many of its recommendations. The plan complements the EU's Economic Recovery Plan, which includes funding for cross-border projects in clean energy and telecommunications infrastructure. The EC aims to regulate all financial investments and actors appropriately, noting the need for updated supervisory models to address the reality of cross-border financial institutions. The Commission praised the de Larosiere report for highlighting necessary changes in the financial sector. The European Commission supports developing harmonized standards for financial supervision in the EU and creating a new European body to assess risks. They aim to reform the current EU Committees overseeing the financial sector and establish a new European financial supervision system based on five key objectives. The European Commission presented a financial supervision package to the European Council in May 2009, which included measures for macro-prudential stability oversight and proposals for micro-prudential supervision. They also planned to reform regulatory gaps by establishing standards for hedge funds and increasing transparency for financial stability. The European Commission presented measures to increase transparency and ensure financial stability in derivatives and structured products. They proposed legislative changes to address liquidity risk, excessive leverage, and improve risk management in financial firms. Additionally, they aimed to strengthen protection for investors, bank depositors, and insurance policy holders. The EC plans to strengthen remuneration recommendations for directors in financial firms and introduce new recommendations for the financial services sector. They also aim to review the Market Abuse Directive for more effective sanctions against market wrongdoing. The British Government announced an $850 billion plan to rescue its banking sector during the financial crisis. During a day of financial turmoil, British banks lost \u00a317 billion on the London Stock Exchange. The Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest loser, with its shares plummeting by 39%, or \u00a310 billion. Other banks, such as Halifax Bank of Scotland, also suffered significant losses. To address the crisis, the British government implemented a plan that included coordinated interest rate cuts and an investment facility of $87 billion to recapitalize eligible banks and building societies. The British Government provided up to $436 billion in guarantees for financial institutions participating in a recapitalization scheme. Additionally, $352 billion was made available through the Special Liquidity Scheme to improve liquidity in the banking industry. The scheme allowed banks to swap high-quality securities for UK Treasury bills. In November 2008, the majority Labor party presented a plan to stimulate the slowing economy. The majority Labor party presented a 20 billion pound stimulus package to Parliament to boost the slowing economy, including tax cuts, government spending projects, and guarantees for small businesses. The plan involves a VAT cut, postponement of corporate tax increases, and increased government spending on public works. To fund the plan, income taxes for high earners would increase, and National Insurance contributions would rise for most workers. The Labor government unveiled a 10 billion pound Capital Working Scheme, a one billion pound Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme, and a 75 million pound Capital for Enterprise Fund to support small and medium businesses struggling to access credit. The British Parliament passed the Banking Act of 2009 to address potential insolvency of large banks. Other EU governments are considering similar procedures. Iceland's bank failures raised concerns about bank supervision and crisis management. Britain used anti-terrorism laws to seize Icelandic bank deposits to prevent fund shifting. The case of Iceland raised questions about supervising foreign financial firms and the cost of branch banking across national borders. Iceland reached an agreement with the IMF for a $2.1 billion economic stabilization program. Iceland reached an agreement with the IMF for a $2.1 billion economic stabilization program, subject to quarterly reviews. Iceland proposed a plan to restore confidence in its banking system, stabilize the exchange rate, and improve the nation's fiscal position. The central bank raised its key interest rate to 18% to attract foreign investors and strengthen its currency. The IMF postponed its decision on a loan to Iceland multiple times, possibly due to concerns from British, Dutch, and German officials regarding Icelandic bank deposits in their countries. Iceland agreed in principle to cover the deposits, but details were still being finalized. In November 2008, Germany, Britain, and the Netherlands agreed to work towards a solution for Iceland's financial crisis. Iceland's Financial Supervisory Authority took control of three major banks to prevent their collapse. Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden provided $2.5 billion in loans to Iceland. Trading on Iceland's stock exchange was suspended for two days to stabilize the situation. The takeover of three major Icelandic banks aimed to stabilize the exchange value of the krona and prevent their collapse. The banking crisis was attributed to a flawed banking model and a disruption in liquidity, leading to the inability of the central bank to act as the lender of last resort. On October 15, 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland implemented a temporary daily system. The Central Bank of Iceland set up daily currency auctions to support the banking system during the financial crisis. The value of the krona was a key issue, affecting the ability to support banks heavily involved in foreign markets. The crisis also impacted British account holders in Icelandic banks, leading to asset freezes by the British government. The situation highlighted the challenges faced by various economies in the past decade. While Asian economies have improved in the past decade, the recent crisis has shown that policy changes have not fully protected them from global contagion. However, in the second quarter of 2009, many Asian economies showed signs of rebounding due to fiscal and monetary stimulus programs. Asian governments remain concerned about the ongoing situation. Many Asian banking systems are healthy, but governments are worried about their economies, especially in countries reliant on exports. Bilateral relations with the United States, particularly China, are tense as officials push for specific policies. Unlike Western nations, Asian countries avoided major financial institution failures at the start of the crisis due to low leverage and healthy bank balance sheets. At the outset of the crisis, Asian economies were comparatively healthy with current account surpluses and significant government reserves, enabling them to provide fiscal stimulus and support their financial systems. This contrasts with the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998 when countries depleted their reserves defending currencies. The initial stage of the current crisis focused on losses from subprime assets in the United States. The global financial crisis transitioned from subprime losses in the United States to a broader crisis affecting Asian economies due to interconnected trade and financial linkages with the US. Despite low direct exposures to toxic assets, Asian countries experienced economic slowdowns and recessions in 2008-2009. Notably, China, Japan, and South Korea fared better than others during this period. Several Asian countries, including China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Singapore, implemented large fiscal stimulus programs in response to the global financial crisis. Japan and China announced stimulus packages amounting to 5% and 12% of their GDP, respectively. China also eased lending by state banks, leading to significant GDP growth and industrial production increases. Stock markets in the region saw gains larger than those in the United States. In Asia, markets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Indonesia saw significant growth between January and July, with some up by more than 40%. The belief that Asian economies were decoupling from the West has shifted, as the region can still be affected by crises originating in the West. While most Asian economies are showing signs of recovery, they are highly dependent on the recoveries in the United States and Western Europe. Pakistan, facing political instability, has sought emergency loans from the IMF due to dwindling reserves, highlighting the limits of bilateral solutions to the crisis. Pakistan sought support from China, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern states before turning to the IMF due to dwindling reserves. Despite receiving a $500 million aid package from Beijing and $7.6 billion in emergency loans from the IMF, Pakistani leaders still say they need $10 billion-$15 billion over the next two years. Analysts suggest that Asian reserves could provide relief for the global economy, as seen with Japan's contribution to the IMF support package for Iceland. Prime Minister Taro Aso announced Japan's $100 billion loan to the IMF to support future financial packages before the IMF's capital increase in 2009. There is speculation on whether reserve-rich countries like China will use their reserves to aid financially-strapped governments. Asian countries, including Japan, China, South Korea, India, and Indonesia, attended the G-20 summit, but their approach to multilateral regulation remains unclear. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao expressed agreement with European governments on expanding multilateral support at the Asia Europe Forum meeting. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao agrees with European governments on the need for expanding multilateral regulations, emphasizing the importance of financial oversight. He criticized the crisis on the excessive expansion of financial institutions and lack of government supervision. Wen's comments were seen as a critique of the United States' consumption-driven model. Previous attempts by Asian countries to take a leadership role, like the proposed \"Asian Monetary Fund\" during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, have been unsuccessful. The U.S. Treasury Department opposed the creation of an \"Asian Monetary Fund\" in 1998, fearing it could bypass IMF conditions. In 2000, ASEAN+3 nations introduced the Chiang Mai Initiative, offering a swap mechanism for foreign reserves. This was a milder alternative, subject to IMF conditions for recipients. On October 26, Japan, China, South Korea, and ASEAN members agreed to start an $80 billion initiative. On October 26, Japan, China, South Korea, and ASEAN members agreed to start an $80 billion multilateral swap arrangement in 2009, allowing countries with balance of payments issues to access reserves from larger economies. There is disagreement in the region about the IMF's role in setting conditions for countries using these swap lines. Asian leaders are considering starting a pan-Asian financial stability forum. In December, Japan, China, and South Korea agreed on bilateral swap lines, including a new renminbi-won swap line worth $28 billion. The summit between Japan, China, South Korea, and ASEAN members resulted in a new renminbi-won swap line worth $28 billion and an expansion of an existing yen-won swap line to $20 billion. Japan took early steps to provide liquidity in response to the crisis, with the Bank of Japan continuing aggressive monetary stimulus and injecting billions into financial markets. The BOJ also announced unlimited dollar offerings to ensure the functioning of Japanese interbank credit markets. Japan took early steps to provide liquidity during the crisis by cutting key interest rates and injecting billions into financial markets. The country spent nearly $440 billion between 1998 and 2003 to assist and recapitalize its banking system, leading to a fairly sound financial system. Mitsubishi UFG Group and Nomura took advantage of their healthy capital positions to acquire distressed U.S. investment banks during the crisis. Japan's financial insulation thinned as Western economies slowed down, impacting its highly export-dependent economy. To counter the effects, Japan implemented fiscal stimulus packages totaling $161 billion. Prime Minister Taro Aso's response to the crisis has caused internal strife within the ruling party, with low support ratings ahead of a crucial Parliamentary election on August 30. China's government entities control most investment flows, limiting individual and firm investments overseas. Detailed information on financial holdings is not publicly disclosed. China's economy has been impacted by the global financial crisis, with sectors like real estate experiencing a bursting bubble. Trade also plummeted, with both exports and imports declining each month from November 2008 to October 2009. The global financial crisis severely impacted China's economy from November 2008 to October 2009, leading to a 26.4% decline in exports in May 2009, the largest monthly drop on record. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to China fell for 10 consecutive months, with a nearly one-third drop in January 2009. Reports indicated significant reductions in production and employment, with an estimated 20 million migrant workers losing their jobs in 2008. China responded by focusing on maintaining steady economic growth to prevent major fluctuations. China's central bank announced plans to cut interest rates and the reserve-requirement ratio to stimulate the economy, coinciding with other major central banks. China's State Council considered implementing a new economic stimulus package, including construction projects, export tax rebates, and increased lending to small and medium enterprises. The Chinese government announced a $586 billion stimulus package in 2008, focusing on infrastructure projects and various sectors like affordable housing, rural infrastructure, and technological innovation. Banks were directed to ease credit requirements, leading to a significant increase in lending. This stimulus package, along with easy monetary policies, had a positive impact on China's economy, with real GDP showing growth on a year-on-year basis. China's economy saw positive growth in 2009, with real GDP increasing by 6.1% in the first quarter, 7.9% in the second quarter, and 8.9% in the third quarter. Monthly FDI flows showed growth for three consecutive months, and real estate investment was up by 18.9% year-on-year. Despite trade not reaching 2008 levels, gradual growth was observed since February 2009. The IMF projected a 8.5% GDP growth for 2009 and 9.0% for 2010, higher than other major economies. China's economic growth in 2009 was positive, with real GDP increasing in each quarter. Concerns were raised about overcapacity in some industries, asset bubbles in real estate and the stock market, and non-performing loans in banks. Trade frictions with the United States were also a concern due to China's currency policy. South Korea's economy was significantly impacted by the crisis, with the stock market and currency tumbling. The South Korean won reached its lowest point since 1998, prompting foreign investors to withdraw $25 billion from the stock market. Korean banks, with large dollar-denominated debts, were encouraged to buy won to stabilize the currency. The government announced a $100 billion guarantee for banks' foreign-currency debt and $30 billion to support them, equivalent to 14% of the country's GDP. South Korean government announced policies to support banks, real estate developers, and small businesses. The central bank cut interest rates to 3% and launched a $15 billion fund to boost bank capital. South Korea has rebounded from the Asian Financial Crisis and saw significant GDP growth after seeking IMF support in 1998. In 2007, South Korea's GDP grew by 9.5% and 8.5% after a 6.9% contraction in 1998. President Lee stated the current situation is more severe than the 1997 crisis. South Korea has a current account deficit and highly leveraged banks. In contrast, Pakistan's economy declined in 2008 with GDP growth dropping to 3-4%, high inflation, and a depreciating currency. Pakistan's economy faced challenges in 2008, with a significant decline in foreign reserves and rising trade deficits. President Zardari highlighted the economic crisis, stating the need for billions in assistance to avoid defaulting on debt obligations. The country required substantial financial aid over the next few years to manage its deficits and debt. Pakistan's economy is facing a downturn due to factors like the global financial crisis, ongoing struggle against Islamist militancy, and recent escalation of violence. This has led to high federal deficits, capital shortage, and capital flight from overseas investors. Pakistan is seeking assistance from various countries and international financial institutions to address these challenges. Pakistan sought assistance from various international financial institutions and an informal group of nations called the \"Friends of Pakistan\" to address its economic challenges. Despite receiving some support from institutions like the ADB and the World Bank, the amount was insufficient to avoid default risk. As a result, Pakistan reluctantly negotiated a $7.6 billion loan with the IMF, with the first installment expected by the end of November. This loan falls short of the estimated $10-15 billion needed to avoid a financial crisis in the next two years. Pakistan negotiated a $7.6 billion loan with the IMF to avoid a financial crisis. The IMF agreement may not secure the full amount needed, leading to short-term relief but not a long-term solution. Pakistan announced economic policy changes to address the capital crisis, including the elimination of subsidies and reduction of the government deficit. Tarin also announced tax reforms to reduce the incidence of taxation on large landowners. The economic policy changes in Pakistan include addressing the capital crisis by eliminating subsidies, reducing the government deficit, and implementing tax reforms targeting large landowners. These measures may lead to popular discontent, threaten political stability, and weaken support for the current coalition government. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and financier George Soros question whether policies should aim to restore a self-correcting system or change an inherently unstable one that creates financial crises. Greenspan admitted his free-market ideology was flawed during the 2008 financial crisis, while Soros criticized the prevailing paradigm of financial markets tending towards equilibrium. The international financial system's development based on this flawed paradigm is seen as a major contributor to current financial troubles. The crisis raises questions about the future of free-market capitalism. The International Monetary Fund suggests improving market discipline and addressing systemic risks in the financial system. Questions arise about the level of regulatory authority - whether it should be at the state, national, or international level, and the role of institutions like the IMF in enforcement and oversight. The IMF's role in the financial crisis includes being a lender of last resort and providing analysis and advice to member countries. It tracks global economic and financial developments, offers policy advice, and assists in shaping international regulation and governance. The June 17 Treasury proposal for financial regulation does not cede sovereignty to the IMF, focusing instead on international reforms to support U.S. efforts. The IMF's authority over countries primarily lies in its advisory capacity and the conditions it sets. The IMF's influence over countries is through its advisory role and loan conditions. Calls for a new Bretton Woods conference aim to reform the international financial architecture, with a focus on giving emerging economies more representation. The G-20 Summit emphasized the need for comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions to reflect changing economic weights and address future challenges. The G-20 serves as a platform for discussions between industrial and emerging-market countries on global economic stability. The G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh in 2009 focused on promoting sustainable and balanced growth through a new framework. This framework aims to shift from public to private sources of demand, avoid asset and credit price fluctuations, and implement stable macroeconomic policies. The members agreed to a cooperative process of mutual assessment to achieve these goals. The G-20 members at the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009 agreed on shared policy objectives, including responsible fiscal policies, strengthened financial supervision, promotion of balanced current accounts, and monetary policies consistent with price stability. They aimed to prevent excess credit growth and leverage in the financial system and support open trade and investment while rejecting protectionist measures. The G-20 members at the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009 agreed on shared policy objectives, including responsible fiscal policies, strengthened financial supervision, promotion of balanced current accounts, and monetary policies consistent with price stability. They aimed to prevent excess credit growth and leverage in the financial system and support open trade and investment while rejecting protectionist measures. In addition, the G-20 leaders agreed to strengthen the regulatory system for banks and financial firms by raising capital standards, implementing compensation standards, improving derivatives markets, and holding global firms accountable for risks to promote balanced and sustainable economic development, reduce poverty, and address systemic financial risks. The G-20 leaders at the Pittsburgh Summit in 2009 supported efforts to improve the financial system by taking actions against non-cooperative jurisdictions and tasking the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to issue a list of high-risk jurisdictions. They also agreed to designate the G-20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, establish the Financial Stability Board (FSB), include major emerging economies in the FSB, and coordinate progress in strengthening financial regulation. Additionally, they agreed to shift the IMF quota share to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries by at least 5%. The G-20 supported reviewing IMF quotas, Executive Board size, Board effectiveness, Governors' involvement, staff diversity, and leadership appointments. They agreed to contribute over $500 billion to the IMF and called for reforming development banks' mission and governance to promote global financial stability and growth. The G-20 called on the World Bank to lead in addressing global issues like climate change, food security, and human development. They agreed to increase access to food, fuel, and finance for the poorest economies, improve energy market transparency, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and promote clean energy technology transfer for sustainable growth. The G-20 countries are addressing financial market abuses by regulating non-bank institutions and complex financial instruments. Lack of regulation in hedge funds and derivatives contributed to the financial crisis. G-20 leaders are calling for common principles to reform financial markets, including transparency, accountability, consumer protection, and consistent regulations across borders. The G-20 countries are focusing on regulating non-bank institutions and complex financial instruments to address financial market abuses. The G-20 London Summit emphasized the importance of financial supervision, regulation, and transparency of financial products. The role of the G-20 in dealing with the global financial crisis began in 2008 with a summit in Washington, DC, involving emerging market economies. The summit aimed to strengthen economic growth and prevent future crises. The G-20 Washington Declaration in response to the financial crisis outlined objectives and steps for stabilizing national economies and reforming financial markets. It established an Action Plan with high priority actions to be completed by March 31, 2009, with details to be worked out by finance ministers. A second G-20 summit in London in April 2009 expanded to include the Association for Southeast Asian Nations. Leaders agreed to establish a new Financial Stability Board to work with the IMF for cross-border cooperation and closer regulation of financial institutions. The G-20 leaders collaborated with the IMF to ensure global cooperation, regulate financial institutions, and combat tax havens. They focused on providing additional funding for the IMF and multilateral development banks as stimulus for developing economies. The leaders also emphasized transparency, accountability, and sound regulation in financial markets to prevent excessive risk-taking. The G-20 leaders focused on oversight of credit rating agencies, prudent risk management, integrity in financial markets, preventing market manipulation and fraud, and reinforcing international cooperation. They also aimed to reform international financial institutions by modernizing governance and membership for greater representation and crisis response. At the London Summit, G-20 leaders reviewed progress on the November Action Plan, which included immediate actions to address weaknesses in accounting standards, ensure credit rating agencies meet high standards, maintain adequate capital for firms, strengthen risk management practices, and establish processes for global financial institution oversight. At the London Summit, G-20 leaders discussed expanding the Financial Stability Forum and making specific recommendations in various areas such as regulatory policies, global accounting standards, transparency in credit derivatives markets, compensation practices, and governance of International Financial Institutions. Reforms should be based on free market principles. At the London Summit, G-20 leaders agreed on principles such as the rule of law, respect for private property, open trade, competitive markets, and efficient financial systems. They also pledged to reject protectionism, work towards a successful outcome in the Doha Round of WTO negotiations, refrain from new trade barriers for a year, and uphold development assistance commitments. IMF is proposed to play a key role in the international financial architecture. The IMF plays a crucial role in monitoring macroeconomic conditions globally and within countries, providing technical assistance, and responding to financial crises. There is a need for a better early warning system to detect and address stresses in financial markets, as well as a macro-prudential framework to assess risks and promote sound policies. This includes regulating financial instruments and institutions, considering cyclical and macroeconomic factors, and addressing vulnerabilities from increased banking concentration and inter-linkages within the financial system. The IMF focuses on monitoring macroeconomic conditions globally and within countries, with an emphasis on risks to currency stability, employment, inflation, and government budgets. Recently, the IMF has increased its work on financial markets and macro-financial linkages to strengthen early warning systems. However, the IMF has not traditionally pushed countries to address specific risks related to synergisms among regulated entities and new investment vehicles affecting prudential risk for insurance, banking, and brokerage houses. The Bank for International Settlements provides recommendations to countries on measures like Basel II to ensure financial stability. The IMF provides recommendations to ensure banking stability and capital adequacy, but the financial crisis revealed that focusing solely on capital adequacy is insufficient during systemic crises involving brokerage houses and insurance companies. The crisis has given the IMF an opportunity to play a constructive role in resolving global downturn effects through crisis management and long-term systemic reform. The IMF offers expertise and policy advice to member countries to help resolve financial crises. The IMF has been providing policy advice to member countries during financial crises. IMF rules allow countries to borrow up to three times their quota, but this limit has been exceeded in the past. In response to the current crisis, the IMF has activated its Emergency Financing Mechanism for rapid approval of loans. As of April 2009, the IMF has provided financial support packages to countries like Iceland, Ukraine, Hungary, Pakistan, Belarus, Serbia, Armenia, and El Salvador. The IMF has provided financial support packages to countries like Belarus, Serbia, Armenia, El Salvador, Latvia, and Seychelles. The IMF also offers a Flexible Credit Line for countries with strong fundamentals, policies, and track records of policy implementation. Mexico has been approved for $47 billion under this facility, while Poland has requested $20.5 billion. The IMF may also use its Exogenous Shocks Facility to assist low-income countries facing events out of their control like commodity price changes, natural disasters, and conflicts. The IMF's Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) was modified in 2008 to provide quicker and more flexible responses to crises caused by commodity price changes, natural disasters, and conflicts in neighboring countries. Countries can access up to 25% of their quota immediately and an additional 75% in phased disbursements over one to two years. In 2009, world leaders agreed to increase IMF resources, with Japan lending $100 billion and the G-20 summit allocating $750 billion for the IMF. The IMF received additional resources in 2009, with $250 billion immediately available through bilateral arrangements and an additional $250 billion as more countries pledged their participation. Japan, the EU, Canada, South Korea, Norway, and Switzerland all agreed to provide additional funds. The Obama Administration requested $100 billion from Congress, China offered $40 billion, and the remaining $145.5 billion source is unknown. The IMF is considering issuing bonds for the first time in its history, which would be sold to central banks and government agencies. This move has been previously blocked by the United States and Europe to maintain control over IMF policy direction. Other multilateral institutions like the World Bank routinely issue bonds for financing. Additionally, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) is launching a $3 billion fund to support small banks in poor countries. The World Bank will launch a $3 billion fund to support small banks in poor countries affected by the financial crisis. Other institutions like the Inter-American Development Bank, Andean Development Corporation, and Latin American Fund of Reserves are also providing financial support. These efforts may benefit smaller countries heavily reliant on tourism and property investments. The global financial crisis in 2010 led to banks relying on government support to avoid a financial disaster, creating moral hazard issues. Efforts have been made to design a more resilient financial system, including proposals to make banks bear the costs of their failures. Former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker suggested separating commercial and investment banking, a measure adopted by the Obama administration. This separation could have prevented the bailout of RBS but not the bankruptcy of investment banks like Lehman Brothers. The U.S. scheme aims to restrict deposit banks from engaging in risky activities like proprietary trading and participating in hedge funds and private equity. Global capital flows to developing countries decreased in 2008, with private capital flows falling by almost 40%. Emerging market economies in Europe and Central Asia were hit the hardest. In 2008, global capital flows to developing countries decreased, with private capital flows falling by almost 40%, and emerging market economies in Europe and Central Asia experiencing the sharpest downturn. Official creditors increased their support to low- and middle-income countries, with a 54% rise in medium- and long-term financing to $114 billion. Foreign direct investment (FDI) rose moderately to $594 billion, with the top ten recipient countries receiving 70% of FDI inflows. Increased concessional financing in 2008, including $6.7 billion from the International Development Association (IDA), helped support low-income countries with limited access to market-based financing. Official grants from bilateral and multilateral sources also rose by 13%. In 2008, global capital flows to developing countries decreased, with private capital flows falling by almost 40%. Official creditors increased their support to low- and middle-income countries, with a 54% rise in financing to $114 billion. Foreign direct investment rose moderately to $594 billion. Official grants from bilateral and multilateral sources also rose by 13%. Bilateral creditors restructured claims of $3.1 billion with six low-income countries, canceling more than half of them. External debt indicators improved, with developing countries showing a decrease in outstanding external debt to export earnings ratio from 122.2% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2008. The debt to gross national income ratio fell to 22.1% from 37.2% at the start of the decade. The debt service to exports ratio was 9.5% in 2008, half the 2000 level. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) was enacted to stabilize the financial sector and the economy, along with other stimulus efforts. The ARRA was initially projected to provide $787 billion in stimulus, but the Congressional Budget Office now estimates the cost at $862 billion over ten years. Concerns over Eurozone fiscal stability have been raised due to Greek fiscal difficulties, with the deep economic recession exposing serious issues that require corrective action to prevent the Eurozone's collapse. There is growing talk that one or more countries may face challenges within the Eurozone. The Eurozone is facing tensions due to Greece's fiscal deficit, leading to concerns about countries leaving the single currency. Markets have reevaluated risk as central banks unwind emergency measures, causing risk spreads to converge with German bunds. Despite Germany's brinkmanship, the EU is expected to take necessary actions to save the Eurozone. The EU is committed to saving Greece to prevent a default and stabilize the Eurozone. While support for Greece may ease market pressure on other countries, structural problems need to be addressed to ensure long-term stability. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the American GDP grew by 5.7%, driven by private inventories and exports. Government economic support will decrease in 2010, with state budget cuts affecting output. Federal stimulus contributed significantly to growth in the fourth quarter but will diminish over time. In January 2009, U.S. lawmakers questioned Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's credibility regarding AIG's bailout, while Geithner defended the necessity of the government-funded rescue to prevent an economic collapse. He stated that he had withdrawn from decisions by the New York Fed after being nominated to the Treasury post. Meanwhile, GM sold Saab to Spyker Cars NV for $74 million in cash. GM signed a deal to sell Saab to Spyker Cars NV for $74 million in cash plus $326 million worth of preferred shares. The sale includes a $550 million loan from the European Investment Bank guaranteed by the Swedish government. This deal is crucial for Saab, which faced liquidation as part of GM's restructuring. Saab Spyker Automobiles NV will continue to receive vehicles and parts from GM. The world economy is recovering faster than expected, with growth forecasted at 3.9% this year and 4.3% in 2011. Emerging markets are leading the global recovery, while advanced economies lag behind. Abu Dhabi has provided a $10 billion cash infusion to help Dubai pay off debts, with no apparent strings attached. Dubai World may be declared insolvent as part of the agreement. Dubai World sustained the fiction of dealing with debts through refinancing and streamlining until requesting a standstill on $26 billion owed by Dubai World, Nakheel, and Limitless. Abu Dhabi agreed to provide $10 billion to the Dubai Financial Support Fund for Nakheel sukuk-holders. The support fund has received a total of $25 billion, which may not be enough to cover Nakheel's sukuk redemption. Dubai also set up a tribunal under the Dubai International Finance Centre's jurisdiction. Dubai World may need to declare bankruptcy, leading to the establishment of a tribunal under DIFC jurisdiction. Abu Dhabi intervened to protect UAE's reputation and credit status. There may be a cost, such as asset transfers or increased federal control over Dubai. Obama calls for increased federal spending to boost the economy and reduce unemployment. Obama calls for increased federal spending to combat high unemployment rates in the U.S., proposing funding for infrastructure projects, small business tax cuts, and energy-efficient home retrofits. He also aims to extend economic stimulus programs to support unemployed Americans and help them maintain health insurance. Congressional approval would be needed for the new spending, which is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars. Obama proposed increased federal spending to combat high unemployment rates, including funding for infrastructure projects, small business tax cuts, and energy-efficient home retrofits. He also suggested additional stimulus spending for seniors and veterans, aid to state and local governments, and measures to prevent layoffs of teachers, police officers, and firefighters. The total proposals in Congress could amount to $170 billion or more, with infrastructure projects alone potentially costing $50 billion. Meanwhile, Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund announced the sale of its stake in Citigroup Inc. for a profit of $1.1 billion, following other Gulf investors in selling foreign shares as markets improve.

The global economic recovery has been supported by government incentives in various countries, such as tax credits for new home-buyers in the US and incentives for consumer spending in Japan. As governments begin to unwind stimulus programs, spending is expected to peak in the first half of 2010 before gradually declining in the second half of the year and in 2011. The time lag between stimulus disbursement and its impact on the economy means that GDP growth in many countries in 2010 will still be inflated. The global economy is expected to face a fierce reversal in 2011 after being supported by government incentives in 2010. U.S. GDP growth is projected to fall from 2.5% in 2010 to 1.3% in 2011.

Foreclosure filings decreased by 3% in October, marking the third consecutive monthly decline, although rates are still 18% higher than in October 2008. This trend follows a 4% drop in filings in September and a 1% decrease in August, with factors like high-risk mortgages, negative equity, and unemployment continuing to impact foreclosure activity. RealtyTrac spokesman Rick Sharga believes that the decline in foreclosures may be artificial due to processing delays and legislative actions slowing down foreclosures. Factors such as banks assessing loans for eligibility in the Making Home Affordable program and new state-level regulations have contributed to the delay in bank repossessions.

The growth rate between 2009 and 2013 is expected to be the slowest since 2000, but still impressive. The resilience of these investors during financial turmoil is attributed to the nature of the assets they hold, such as oil prices responding to increased demand and Asian reserves building up from trade surpluses. The petrodollar and Asian investors have a hedge over other institutional investors due to structural flows benefiting their existing portfolios. This may lead to a shift in financial power towards developing world centers. However, there is a risk of feeding asset bubbles globally.
