    "content": "American consumers are increasingly using credit and debit cards for payments, with card transactions rising from 23% to 48% between 1997 and 2011. Cash and check payments decreased from 70% to 35% during the same period. In 2011, there were 49 billion debit transactions totaling $1.8 trillion and 26 billion credit transactions totaling $2.1 trillion. To combat fraud, MasterCard and Visa set a deadline of October 1, 2015, for U.S. card issuers to replace magnetic stripe cards with chip cards. Chip cards, also known as EMV cards, were developed by Europay, MasterCard, and Visa to enhance security. EMVCo membership has expanded to include American Express, JCB, Discover, and UnionPay. Four drivers of EMV adoption in the US: Liability Shift, Financial Impact of Fraud, Concern over Data Breaches. Fraud losses in the US totaled $5.33 billion in 2012, with a 70% increase in fraud using US-issued bank credit cards between 2004 and 2010. Data breaches have shown a modest increase between 2012 and 2013. The number of data breaches in 2013 (198) is small compared to 2011 (855), but the attention on these breaches in the news has created a perception of increasing breaches. Chip cards provide better security for transactions, making data stolen in a breach harder to use. The transition to chip cards in the US is expected to cost at least $6 billion, with liability for fraudulent transactions shifting to parties that have not adopted chip cards. Fraudulent transactions will shift liability to parties not using chip cards. If a merchant doesn't accept chip cards and the customer has one, the merchant is responsible for fraud. If the merchant has a chip POS terminal but the bank hasn't issued a chip card, the bank is liable. If neither or both comply, fraud liability remains the same. Issuers historically paid 60% of losses, while retailers paid 40%. With the transition to chip cards, understanding the consequences is crucial. The transition to EMV chip cards is crucial for data security, with new deadlines approaching in 2016 and 2017. The report highlights financial harm from data breaches, discusses policy issues, and identifies obstacles to completing the transition in the US. EMV cards offer higher security than stripe cards, making it difficult to counterfeit even if card data is compromised. The EMV chip in cards carries cardholder and account data, making decisions about transactions and controlling outcomes. It can be \"chip-and-PIN,\" \"chip-and-signature,\" or \"chip-and-choice.\" EMV is the global standard for chip technology in financial payment cards, with many countries already using chip cards. In 80 countries, 1.62 billion chip cards are in use, with the United States lagging behind as the last major country to adopt this global standard. Card fraud globally reached $11.3 billion in 2012, increasing by 15% from the previous year. In the U.S., credit card losses totaled $5.33 billion in 2012, a 14.5% increase from 2011. The U.S. has been disproportionately affected by fraud, accounting for half of global losses despite only a quarter of total card payments. Between 2004 and 2010, fraud on U.S.-issued bank credit cards rose by 70%. Debit card fraud also increased, with signature verification cards accounting for 91% of fraud. Card fraud can occur in various ways, starting with the theft of card information. Data breaches, particularly POS intrusions, are common methods used to steal credit and debit card data. These breaches are facilitated by the continued use of magnetic stripe cards in the U.S., which carry unencrypted data. Hackers can access POS systems through various means, such as brute force attacks. Hackers can access POS systems through various ways, including brute force attacks and exploiting stolen vendor credentials. Once access is gained, malware like RAM scrapers is installed to copy unencrypted card data as it is swiped. The RAM scraper exploits the brief period when card data is unencrypted in the POS reader before being sent for payment. Europe has mostly transitioned to EMV technology for cards and POS terminals. A 2012 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta showed that countries transitioning to chip-and-PIN cards experienced decreases in card fraud rates. When the United Kingdom introduced chip cards, they still included magnetic stripes. Chip-and-PIN technology is effective in reducing card-present fraud, domestic counterfeit card fraud, and lost or stolen card fraud. Additionally, mail non-receipt fraud is also a concern. Since the introduction of chip cards, fraud has decreased significantly, with a 91% decrease in card theft before activation in the UK. Most US issuers are opting for chip-and-signature cards over chip-and-PIN, leading to uncertainty about the impact on fraud. However, in most countries, the switch to chip cards has led to an increase in domestic CNP fraud and cross-border counterfeit card fraud, with fraud migrating primarily to the US. The market is transitioning to chip cards to combat fraud. Merchants are adopting prevention measures like requiring cardholders to authenticate their identities by entering verification codes or expiration dates. Additional measures like Address Verification Service (AVS) are also being used. Visa, MasterCard, and American Express have developed security measures like Verified by Visa, SecureCode, and SafeKey to prevent CNP fraud. Verified by Visa, SecureCode, and SafeKey are based on the 3-D Secure protocol for Internet-based purchases. They redirect payment transactions to the issuer's website for user authentication, requiring additional credentials. All parties involved must use the system for it to work. In 2013, only 3% of U.S. merchants used 3-D Secure authentication. Card issuers can define authentication credentials, such as passwords, which can be permanent or transaction-specific. Transaction-specific passwords can be generated and sent via text message or email for added security. In Europe, about 30 million people use chip cards and readers for Internet transactions, providing an extra layer of security for CNP transactions. However, 3-D Secure still has vulnerabilities, such as hackers using malware to direct cardholders to fake enrollment windows to steal card data. New security measures developed by third-party companies are available to address these vulnerabilities. New security measures like \"D-FACTOR\" and \"TranSecure\" have been developed by third-party companies to enhance security for CNP transactions. D-FACTOR links credit cards to devices for verification, while TranSecure provides ongoing fraud monitoring. Cross-border counterfeit fraud has increased in countries still using stripe cards, with data stolen from chip-and-PIN markets being used for fraudulent purposes. The increase in cross-border counterfeit fraud is attributed to issuers providing cards with both chips and magnetic stripes. This vulnerability allowed stolen data from EMV cards to be used to manufacture counterfeit stripe cards for markets still using them. To address this, cards issued in the U.K. now include a small \"flag\" on the magnetic stripe to indicate the presence of a chip, alerting merchants if a cloned card is being used. The United Kingdom and Australia saw an initial increase in counterfeit fraud after EMV implementation, but it later decreased. The United States, still using stripe cards, may not experience the same increase. Counterfeit fraud diminishes as more countries eliminate stripe cards. Liability shifts for branded ATM cards and the debate over signature versus PIN continue towards a complete shift to chip cards. On October 1, 2016, a new liability shift will occur for MasterCard-branded debit cards at ATMs. Visa-branded debit cards have an additional year to comply. ATMs accepting Visa-branded debit cards have an extra year to comply with EMV standards, unlike MasterCard-branded ATMs which must be operational by 2016. Concerns arise over the complexity of updating payment processing software for both debit and credit transactions, potentially causing delays or reducing the number of ATMs. Retailers are frustrated with certification delays after investing significantly to upgrade systems and avoid liability for fraudulent transactions. In New York City, a supermarket chain spent $700,000 to upgrade systems for EMV compliance by October 1, 2015, but remain uncertified as of March 2016, incurring fraud liability costs. Banks blame retailers for last-minute terminal updates, while retailers cite financial ties between banks and certification companies for delays. Some experts predict a shift from chip-and-signature to PIN use in EMV transactions, supported by retailers and the federal government. Not all EMV cards have PIN capability, and not all merchant terminals can accept PIN entry. EMV transactions at chip PoS terminals provide more security for consumers' personal data than magnetic strip transactions. While EMV cards offer greater security, they do not prevent lost or stolen cards from being used for purchases without the physical chip. Legislation in the 113th and 114th Congress did not directly impact the EMV transition, but some bills aimed to enhance protection against credit card data theft through measures like free credit monitoring for affected consumers. Legislation in the 113th and 114th Congress aimed to enhance protection against credit card data theft by providing free credit monitoring for affected consumers and increasing penalties for identity theft. It also included criminal penalties for entities that fail to notify breaches of personally identifiable information and defined thresholds for public and government notification after a breach. Additionally, a resolution was introduced to pursue extradition authority for international cybercriminals committing credit card theft targeting US citizens. In the 114th Congress, one hearing was held on the EMV transition, specifically addressing its impact on small businesses. The 113th Congress had three hearings on data breaches, discussing EMV adoption in the US and its effects on cybersecurity. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on data breaches, focusing on the Target Corporation breach and the reintroduction of the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act by Senator Leahy. The hearing discussed the timeliness of customer notifications after breaches and the need for potential legislation to improve reporting requirements. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee held a hearing on the relationship between federal law enforcement and the private sector in tracking data breaches, the tactics of cybercriminals, and the need for additional data security regulation. Witnesses included government officials and industry representatives. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee held a hearing on data breaches and cybercrime tactics. Witnesses included government officials, payment industry representatives, and a privacy advocacy organization. Members were concerned about meeting the October 1, 2015 deadline for payment industry security. Issues discussed included technology to protect consumers from cybercriminals and the evolution of cyberattacks. Questions remain about the impact of EMV signature verification on fraud reduction compared to PIN verification. The 114th Congress may need to examine the effectiveness of the EMV debit card transition in the United States to determine if legislative action is necessary to reduce fraud and data breaches. Delays in reaching agreement over debit card programming could cause the transition to lag behind the credit card transition, impacting overall fraud reduction. The payments industry will need to ensure a simultaneous transition for all card products to achieve the desired level of fraud reduction. Companies need to implement additional security safeguards to decrease card-not-present fraud, as seen in countries where both card issuers and merchants have done so successfully. Preparation for data breaches is crucial, with steps outlined by Experian to assist in post-breach activities and law enforcement cooperation. The effectiveness of existing post-breach consumer notification procedures should also be evaluated. Existing post-breach consumer notification procedures and legal thresholds for mandatory reporting to law enforcement need to be evaluated for adequacy and consistency. Law enforcement relies on notifications from affected companies to investigate breaches, but there is a lack of federal laws or guidelines, leading to varying state laws with different reporting triggers and definitions of personal information. Some states have narrow definitions of \"personal information\" for data breach reporting, while others have broader definitions. This variation in state laws poses challenges for companies operating in multiple states. There are calls for a single federal law to standardize data breach reporting nationwide, but some states are concerned it may offer less consumer protection. One proposed compromise is to allow states with stricter laws to override a federal law. The EMV transition in the United States faced delays due to disagreements over transaction verification methods, chip programming, and fee structures. High implementation costs for card issuers and merchants hindered the adoption of chip cards, despite industry negotiations and litigation resolving most issues. The transition to EMV chip cards in the United States has significant costs for financial institutions and businesses using POS readers. Industry observers estimate the transition will cost between $6 billion and $8 billion, with 75% likely to be paid by merchants. Manufacturing chip cards is 2 to 16 times more expensive than traditional stripe cards, costing between $1.00 and $4.00 per card. Personalizing chip cards is also twice as expensive. Issuers may pass these costs down to consumers. Issuers and merchants face significant costs for implementing EMV chip cards. Merchants need to purchase new POS equipment, costing between $100 to $600 each. Prior to the transition, only 25%-44% of retailers were expected to meet the deadline. Estimates show that at the time of the transition, only 7% to 15% of cards had EMV chips. Some experts predict that by the beginning of 2016, 90%-95% of cards could be chip cards, with about 33% of POS machines currently EMV compliant. Despite initial resistance, card issuers largely decided to implement chip-and-signature verification, but there is growing support for the use of PINs. In 2015, state attorneys general urged companies like MasterCard, Visa, and others to transition to chip and PIN technology. Visa and MasterCard resolved issues with dual debit applications in 2013. Regulatory uncertainty delayed debit transaction fee regulations. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) set rules for maximum debit card transaction fees in October 2011. The National Retail Federation appealed the ruling, claiming the fee cap was too high. A U.S. District Court judge rejected the FRB's regulations in July 2013, but the Court of Appeals later upheld them in March 2014. Merchants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court in August 2014. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the merchants' petition in January 2015, allowing the FRB's rules on debit card transaction fees to go into effect. Card issuers lost over three years of planning time due to the court case, causing a potential delay in issuing chip-based debit cards alongside chip-based credit cards. The FRB emphasized the importance of migrating all card-based products to chip technology to maximize fraud reduction benefits. Migrating all card-based products to chip technology simultaneously is crucial for reducing face-to-face fraud within a country's borders. In Canada, migrating credit before debit led to an increase in debit card fraud. Without market consensus or timely migration to chip-and-PIN in the United States, slow adopters may experience higher fraud levels. The impact of a court case on debit card replacement remains uncertain."
