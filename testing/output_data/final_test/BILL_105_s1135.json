    "content": "The Act titled as the \"Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997\" aims to promote the free flow of information within trade and professional associations. Trade and professional associations provide services to members regarding products and materials. Large class action lawsuits against manufacturers have led consumers to rely on associations for product information. Trade and professional associations are increasingly involved in product defect lawsuits, facing burdensome subpoenas and litigation. Members seek information on product defects and quality from these associations. Trade and professional associations face challenges in disseminating information due to the burden of responding to subpoenas in product defect lawsuits. This has a chilling effect on their ability to share information with members. The national scope of these issues requires federal intervention as state laws are insufficient. The Act aims to promote interstate commerce and protect due process rights by facilitating the flow of information on product defects among trade associations and their members.

The Act defines \"product\" as any object, substance, mixture, or raw material with economic value intended for sale or lease for commercial or personal use. The term \"product\" is defined as any object, substance, mixture, or raw material with economic value intended for sale or lease for commercial or personal use. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States. The term \"trade or professional association\" denotes an organization described in those improvements. Exclusions from the definition of \"product\" include tissue, organs, blood, and blood products used for therapeutic or medical purposes, except when subject to a standard of liability other than negligence under applicable State law, as well as electricity, natural gas, or steam. A \"professional association\" is an organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 3. QUALIFIED EXEMPTION FROM CIVIL LIABILITY. Trade or professional associations are generally not liable for harm caused by providing information on product quality, performance, or defects to their members. This exemption applies to civil liability under Federal or State law, except for harm caused by the association's own actions. Trade or professional associations are not liable for harm caused by providing false information with reckless indifference to the truth or falsity. This exemption applies to civil liability under Federal or State law, except for harm caused by the association's own actions. A trade or professional association can file a special motion to strike any claim in a judicial proceeding if the claim is based on an act for which the association is exempt from liability. Required procedures for this special motion to strike are outlined. Upon filing a motion under section 4, it is treated as a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court must hear it promptly. Discovery requests to or from the moving party are suspended until a decision is made, with the burden of proof on the responding party to show why the motion should be denied. Upon filing a motion under section 4, the court will determine the outcome based on the facts presented in the pleadings and affidavits. The court will dismiss the claim unless the responding party provides evidence that would convince a reasonable finder of fact that the moving party is not liable. If the moving party succeeds in getting the claim dismissed, they will be awarded costs incurred in making the motion. SEC. 6. QUALIFIED EXEMPTION FROM THIRD-PARTY DISCOVERY. A trade or professional association can only be subpoenaed in a civil action related to product quality, performance, or defects if the materials sought are directly relevant and not otherwise available. SEC. 7. SPECIAL MOTION TO QUASH A SUBPOENA. A trade or professional association can file a special motion to quash a subpoena if they are exempt from third-party discovery requests under section 6. Required procedures for this special motion are outlined in section 8. Upon filing a motion under section 7, the trial court must hear it promptly. Compliance with the subpoena is suspended while the motion is under consideration or during an appeal. The burden of proof lies with the responding party to show why the motion should be denied. The court will base its decision on the facts in the pleadings and affidavits. Upon filing a motion under section 7, the court shall grant a motion to quash a subpoena unless the responding party proves that the trade or professional association is not exempt. If the association prevails, they will be awarded costs incurred in connection with the motion. SEC. 9. RIGHT TO OBJECT UNDER RULE 45 OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. Nothing in this Act may be construed to impair the right of a trade or professional association to serve written objections under rule 45(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any similar rule or procedure under applicable State law. SEC. 10. QUALIFIED ASSOCIATION-MEMBER PRIVILEGE. In general, a member of a trade or professional association is not required to disclose confidential information related to litigation involving product quality, performance, or defects, if the information is considered confidential and communicated with the expectation of confidentiality. This exception does not apply in certain legal actions. A party seeking relevant information must prove to the court, with clear evidence, that the information is directly related to their action and is not obtainable elsewhere. SEC. 11. ELECTION OF STATE REGARDING NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\nThis Act does not apply to State court civil actions where all parties are citizens of that State, if the State enacts a statute electing to be exempt from this Act.\n\nSEC. 12. PREEMPTION; APPLICABILITY.\n\nThis Act supersedes State laws on matters it covers, and applies to civil actions in Federal or State courts, except where a State elects nonapplicability."
