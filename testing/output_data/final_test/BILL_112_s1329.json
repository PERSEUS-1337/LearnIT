The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to include an Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program. This program aims to provide education and training in advanced manufacturing through demonstration and pilot projects targeting skills development in communities with existing or expected growth in this sector. The Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Development Program aims to provide education and training in advanced manufacturing, focusing on skills development for incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed workers. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education.

To apply for a grant, eligible entities must submit an application to the Secretary as specified. The Secretary will determine the eligible entities for grants under the Education Act of 1965, including a description of each entity's capacity and expected participation. The education and training program will focus on developing skills demanded by advanced manufacturing firms. The education and training program will lead to a nationally portable credential and educate individuals on career advancement in advanced manufacturing. The program will benefit the economy by preparing individuals for existing or expected jobs in advanced manufacturing. The eligible entity must describe how they will prepare individuals for jobs in advanced manufacturing and expose workers to new technology skill sets through the program. They should also explain how evidence-based training models will be used to integrate academic instruction with on-the-job training in advanced manufacturing. The eligible entity must describe how they will coordinate activities with State and local boards, economic development officials, manufacturers, and labor organizations in carrying out the job training program in advanced manufacturing. Activities under the program may include classroom learning, on-the-job training, industry-recognized credential training, apprenticeship programs, coordination with educational partners, and distance learning. The program activities include classroom learning, on-the-job training, industry-recognized credential training, apprenticeship programs, coordination with educational partners, distance learning, and other training in advanced manufacturing as deemed appropriate by the Secretary. Goals include enhancing the skill sets of workers in communities with advanced manufacturing jobs, enabling them to obtain nationally portable credentials. The curr_chunk focuses on developing competencies in advanced manufacturing, strengthening partnerships with manufacturers and labor organizations, and assisting incumbent workers. The curr_chunk discusses the need to help workers develop skills in advanced manufacturing to improve employment opportunities and earnings. Performance measures will be negotiated with eligible entities to evaluate their success in meeting program goals. The performance measures for the program include tracking the number of workers receiving credentials, attaining basic skills for advanced manufacturing, and incumbent workers gaining skills through education. The program evaluates the performance of eligible entities by tracking workers' skills obtained through education and training, earnings growth, and other necessary indicators. The evaluation starts one year after the first funds disbursement. The Secretary will evaluate programs funded under this subsection and report to Congress every 2 years starting from 2 years after the initial evaluation. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 is amended to include a definition of \"employer- or industry-recognized and nationally portable credential\" as various types of credentials including educational certificates, occupational licenses, industry-sponsored certificates, and certificates from registered apprenticeship programs."
