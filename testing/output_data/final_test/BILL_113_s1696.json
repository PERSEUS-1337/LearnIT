    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Women's Health Protection Act of 2013\". The purpose of the Act is to protect women's health. Access to safe, legal abortion services is crucial for women's health and their ability to participate equally in society. However, access has been hindered in the US through various means such as blockades, insurance restrictions, and limitations on minors' access. These restrictions harm women by reducing the availability of services. Since 2010, there has been a significant increase in laws and regulations targeting abortion, threatening women's health and access to safe services. Congressional action is needed to address these restrictions and violations of constitutional protections. Many State and local governments are imposing restrictions on abortion that violate constitutional protections for women, including bans on abortions before viability. These restrictions are not based on science and do not improve the safety of abortion services or protect women's health. Many State and local governments are imposing restrictions on abortion that violate constitutional protections for women, including bans on abortions before viability. These restrictions harm women's health by reducing access to essential health care services, especially impacting low-income women, women of color, and those in medically underserved areas. Federal legislation is needed to ensure all women have access to safe abortion services, protected by Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment. The purpose of this Act is to safeguard women's health by maintaining the availability of abortion services. The Act aims to protect women's health by ensuring continued availability of abortion services without unnecessary restrictions. It does not address all threats to abortion access, such as clinic violence or insurance coverage limitations, which should be addressed separately by Congress. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include abortion as any medical treatment to terminate a pregnancy, abortion provider as a healthcare professional who performs abortions, government as entities acting under US or state law, and health care professional as licensed medical professionals. In this Act, an abortion provider is defined as a healthcare professional competent to perform abortions. Pregnancy refers to the period starting with the implantation of a fertilized egg. Viability is the point in a pregnancy where there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other US territories. SEC. 4. PROHIBITED MEASURES AND ACTIONS. General prohibitions on imposing restrictions that single out abortion services for more burdensome requirements than medically comparable procedures, do not significantly advance women's health or safety, and make abortion services harder to access include specific medical test requirements, limitations on task delegation, and restrictions on abortion providers. A limitation on abortion providers' prescribing or dispensing drugs based on medical judgment, telemedicine restrictions, facility requirements not imposed on similar medical procedures. Prohibited measures include unnecessary visits before abortion, restrictions on medical training for abortion procedures, and any actions that make abortion services harder to access. The legislation prohibits measures that hinder access to abortion services, such as unnecessary visits and restrictions on training. To prove unlawfulness, a plaintiff must show that the measure targets abortion services or impedes access based on specific factors. Factors considered include those that obstruct access to abortion services. Abortion services for paragraph (2)(B) include factors like interference with providers' care, delays in access, increased costs, and requirements for services. The factors to consider when evaluating a measure or action related to abortion services include the impact on necessitating additional trips to abortion providers, potential decrease in availability of services, imposition of harsh penalties compared to other healthcare professionals, and the cumulative effect when combined with other requirements or restrictions. Prohibitions on abortion prior to fetal viability are unlawful and shall not be imposed. Defense of a measure or action related to abortion services must significantly advance safety or health of women and have no less restrictive alternative. The Act prohibits abortion before fetal viability, allows it after viability if it poses a risk to the woman's life or health, restricts delays in obtaining immediate abortion for health reasons, and prohibits reasons-based restrictions on abortion before viability. The Act prohibits abortion before fetal viability and allows it after viability if it poses a risk to the woman's life or health. The Act does not apply to laws regulating physical access to clinic entrances, parental consent for minors seeking abortion, insurance coverage of abortion, or specific procedures. It applies to government restrictions on abortion services, whether enacted before or after the Act's enactment. SEC. 5. LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION. The provisions of this Act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. Nothing in this Act shall interfere with a woman's constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT. The Attorney General can file a civil action for injunctive relief against government officials enforcing unlawful restrictions under this Act. Individuals or entities affected by violations can also take legal action. Health care facilities or professionals can act on behalf of affected patients. In any legal action under this Act, the court may provide equitable relief, including injunctive relief. The court will also award litigation costs, such as attorney fees, to prevailing plaintiffs. The district courts of the United States have jurisdiction over these proceedings, regardless of whether administrative remedies have been exhausted. SEC. 7 of the Act prohibits any State or subdivision from enacting laws that conflict with the Act. SEC. 8 states that if any provision of the Act is found unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
