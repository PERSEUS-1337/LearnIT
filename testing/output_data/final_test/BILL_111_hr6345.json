The Personal Exemption Fairness Act of 2010 introduces regional cost-of-living adjustments in personal exemptions.

The multiplier is based on the cost-of-living differential for the calendar year in the taxpayer's area of residence. The Personal Exemption Fairness Act of 2010 introduces cost-of-living differentials for statistical areas in the United States for taxable years. The Secretary of Labor determines the cost-of-living for each area annually.
