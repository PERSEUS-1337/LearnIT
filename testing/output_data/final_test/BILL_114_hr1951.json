    "content": "The \"Offshore Fracking Transparency and Review Act of 2015\" imposes a moratorium on offshore fracking and acid well stimulation in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region until certain reports are published. A study on the conduct and impacts of hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation in the region is required. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study on hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region. This study will include an inventory of chemicals used, volumes of chemicals used and disposed of, risks of chemical spills, and analysis of chemical methods. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study on hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, including an analysis of chemical methods, quantification of chemicals entering the environment, and any other related matters deemed necessary. A report on the study must be submitted to Congress and published within 18 months of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the Interior will issue an environmental impact statement within 18 months regarding the impacts of offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency and appropriate State agencies. Public notice will be provided. SEC. 5. PUBLIC NOTICE.\n\nThe Secretary will notify State and local regulatory agencies and publish a notice in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving an application for offshore hydraulic fracturing or acid well stimulation in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, and within 30 days of the conduct of such activities under a permit.\n\nSEC. 6. COMPILATION AND DISCLOSURE OF ACTIVITIES. The Secretary of the Interior will maintain a list of offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, including dates, locations, and chemicals used for each treatment. The Secretary of the Interior will maintain a list of offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region, including details such as chemicals used, fluid volume, wastewater disposal, and treatment purpose/results. If any information is unavailable, an explanation will be provided. The list will be made public for transparency. The Secretary of the Interior will make a list of offshore hydraulic fracturing and acid well stimulation treatments in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf Region public, including details like chemicals used, fluid volume, wastewater disposal, and treatment purpose/results, available on the Department of the Interior's website. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, hydraulic fracturing is defined as an operation in a wellbore to increase hydrocarbon flow by fracturing rock. Acid well stimulation treatment involves using acids in well stimulation. The curr_chunk describes different types of well stimulation treatments, including hydraulic fracturing, acid matrix stimulation treatments, and acid fracturing treatments."
