    "content": "Congress is concerned about U.S. policy regarding China's role in weapons proliferation and obtaining China's cooperation in nonproliferation. The issue involves the threat of WMDs and missiles. Some argue that China's transfers violate international treaties and U.S. laws, posing a security risk. This CRS Report discusses the national security problem and U.S. policy response, including legislation and sanctions. Since 1991, Beijing has addressed concerns by increasing participation in nonproliferation regimes and issuing export control regulations. China tentatively agreed to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 1991 and reaffirmed the commitment in a joint statement with the United States in 1994. China tentatively agreed to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in 1991 and reaffirmed the commitment in a joint statement with the United States on October 4, 1994. The MTCR is a set of voluntary guidelines aimed at controlling the transfer of ballistic and cruise missiles capable of delivering a certain payload to a specific distance. There were concerns about China's adherence to the revised MTCR guidelines of 1993, particularly regarding the transfer of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction. China agreed to the MTCR Guidelines but not the Annex. Beijing promised to issue missile-related export controls and published regulations modeled on the MTCR in 2002. China applied to join the MTCR in 2004 but has not been accepted. China acceded to the NPT in 1992. China joined the Zangger Committee in October 1997 and promised not to start new nuclear cooperation with Iran. The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1172 in June 1998, urging states to prevent exports to India or Pakistan's nuclear programs. China applied to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group in May 2004 and was accepted as a member. China supported China despite congressional concerns, issuing its first public defense white paper in 1995 focusing on arms control and disarmament. China signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 1993 and deposited its ratification before it entered into force in April 1997. Export control regulations on chemicals were issued from 1993 to 1998, followed by regulations for export controls over dual-use biological agents and related technology in 2002. A white paper on nonproliferation was issued in 2003, stating control lists align with international committees. China expressed willingness to join the Missile Technology Control Regime in June 2004. China did not join the International Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation in 2002 or the Proliferation Security Initiative in 2003. PRC weapons proliferation has continued, with China being a significant supplier of WMD-related goods and technology. China, North Korea, and Russia are identified as key suppliers of dangerous technology for weapons of mass destruction and missile programs. China's state-owned defense corporations have been linked to Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs as well as Iran's missile programs. The reporting requirement for this information was changed from semi-annual to annual in 2004, with the latest unclassified report covering 2011 submitted by the Director of National Intelligence to Congress. The reporting requirement was later repealed in 2013. In 2014, a State Department official highlighted China's economy as the primary source of high-tech supplies. China's economy remains a key source of high technology and materials for programs in Iran and North Korea. US policymakers debated imposing sanctions on China in 1996 for technology transfers to Pakistan's nuclear program. Concerns persist about China's nuclear cooperation with Pakistan, including the construction of nuclear power plants. Despite these concerns, the Bush Administration supported China's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004. The Obama Administration has not raised strong concerns about China's expansion of nuclear projects, including assistance to Pakistan's nuclear facilities. China began building a nuclear power plant at Chashma and was suspected of helping Pakistan build an unsafeguarded, plutonium-producing reactor at Khushab. The Chashma reactor has IAEA safeguards but not full scope safeguards. Pakistan's efforts to acquire equipment, materials, and technology for its nuclear weapons program were highlighted in the DCI's June 1997 report. China's involvement in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was highlighted in various reports, including the DCI's June 1997 Section 721 report and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency's annual report for 1998. Despite concerns and condemnations from the international community, China continued to have ties with Pakistan's unsafeguarded nuclear program, including suspicions of providing equipment for a secret heavy water production plant at Khushab. China's involvement in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program was highlighted in reports, with suspicions of providing equipment for a secret heavy water production plant at Khushab. In November 2003, the DCI reported continued contacts between PRC entities and Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, despite the PRC's promise not to assist unsafeguarded facilities. Vice Admiral Lowell Jacoby testified in 2004 that PRC entities were involved with nuclear and missile programs in Pakistan and Iran, sometimes without the government's knowledge. China signed a contract to build a second nuclear power reactor in Pakistan, raising questions due to its ongoing nuclear cooperation with Pakistan. The contract was signed just before a decision by the Nuclear Suppliers Group on China's membership. The Chashma-2 reactor was exempted from full-scope safeguards, leading to monitoring by the United States and other countries. China later agreed to build two more reactors in Pakistan, with potential exemptions similar to those granted to India in 2008. In February 2010, China agreed to finance the construction of two more reactors in Pakistan. The deal was approved by Pakistan's government the following month, with PRC companies promising to build the reactors in June. Despite assurances of IAEA safeguards, the US raised concerns about the deal during a Nuclear Security Summit in April 2010. China would need an exception from the NSG's guidelines for the deal, which the US decided to vote against. Van Diepen testified that the Administration decided to vote against an exemption for China at a hearing on July 22 of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. The PRC Foreign Ministry claimed that the third and fourth nuclear reactors were \"based on\" the PRC-Pakistan agreement of 2003. PPG Paints Trading Company in Shanghai pled guilty to illegally exporting coatings to the Chashma-2 reactor in Pakistan. Wang Xun, a PRC national and U.S. resident, was arrested in Atlanta. The Commerce Department ordered sanctions against Wang. China Nuclear Industry Huaxing Construction Company pled guilty in a U.S. criminal case for illegal exports of coatings to the Chashma-2 reactor. The 2011 Section 721 Report highlighted PRC entities' involvement in Pakistan's nuclear programs. Assistant Secretary of State Blake urged China to adhere to NSG guidelines regarding new nuclear reactors for Pakistan. Despite concerns about safety standards, China's support for Pakistan's energy needs was acknowledged. The Carnegie Endowment criticized the design of new reactors from China, stating they would only cover a small portion of Pakistan's electricity shortfall. China's nuclear cooperation with Pakistan includes building reactors and providing loans for energy projects. Questions have been raised about China's involvement in Pakistan's nuclear program. The efforts of Abdul Qadeer Khan, former head of Pakistan's nuclear program, in selling uranium enrichment technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya were confirmed in early 2004. DCI George Tenet testified about Khan's nuclear trade network to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Concerns were raised about China's ties to the network, as China had received uranium enrichment technology from Khan in exchange for uranium hexafluoride gas, enriched uranium, and a nuclear weapon blueprint. Questions arose about China sharing intelligence with the US on Khan's technology transfers. In 2004, it was revealed that Abdul Qadeer Khan sold a nuclear bomb design to Libya, obtained from China in the 1980s. This raised concerns about Khan potentially selling the design to other countries like Iran and North Korea. Additionally, there were reports of China providing nuclear bomb technology to Pakistan, including a test conducted in 1990. The Bush Administration continued to investigate A.Q. Khan's nuclear trade, with concerns about proliferation to countries like Iran and North Korea. Sanctions were imposed on individuals and companies involved in Khan's network, but China was not named in the investigation. The issue of imposing sanctions on China was faced by the George H. W. Bush and Clinton Administrations in the 1990s to 2000. The Clinton Administration determined in 2000 that PRC entities transferred M-11 missiles and technology to Pakistan, but waived sanctions in exchange for a nonproliferation pledge. Despite this, the US remains concerned about PRC technology transfers aiding Pakistan's missile programs. In 2001, the George W. Bush Administration imposed sanctions on China for proliferating missile technology to Pakistan. The PRC helped Pakistan enhance its missile capabilities by providing missile components for Shaheen-1 and Shaheen-2 programs. Sanctions were imposed on China for proliferation of missile technology to Pakistan. PRC entities continued to support Pakistan's missile development efforts. The DNI's Section 721 Report for 2011 highlighted PRC entities supplying missile-related items to Pakistan, despite being labeled as \"primarily private.\" Concerns were raised about China's nuclear cooperation with Iran, with the US questioning if China upheld its promise to end such cooperation in 1997. Despite China's 1997 pledge to end nuclear cooperation with Iran, concerns remain about possible interactions. The Bush Administration sought PRC support for sanctions on Iran in 2004, with the PRC evolving to support some sanctions but not the use of force. The PRC has voted for multiple UNSC resolutions imposing sanctions on Iran while also investing in Iran's energy sector. China's cooperation in pressuring Iran is seen as essential for effective action. China's cooperation in pressuring Iran is crucial for a working U.S.-PRC relationship, with a focus on sanctions targeting Iran's energy investments. China aims to balance support for Iran with concerns from the U.S. and EU, while also advocating for negotiations and IAEA authority in Iran. China has urged direct talks between the U.S. and Iran to address diplomatic impasses and promote stability in the Middle East. China's cooperation in pressuring Iran is crucial for a working U.S.-PRC relationship. Options to alleviate China's dependence on Iranian oil include increasing imports from other countries and accessing investments in Western energy projects. Multilateral approaches are seen as more critical than bilateral dealings with Beijing. Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran provides China with diplomatic maneuvering room. China's nuclear cooperation with Iran offers diplomatic maneuvering room. Closer Russian alignment with the US and European countries could isolate China at the UNSC. Options for sanctions and use of force exist outside UNSC resolutions. Iranian front companies procured materials from China for secret nuclear weapons facilities. Experts from China worked at uranium facilities in Iran. The Washington Post and Nucleonics Week reported Iran's secret uranium enrichment plant at Natanz with technology from Pakistan and uranium supply from China. Iranian-PRC contract for uranium extraction in Yazd was confirmed by the head of the Iranian Atomic Organization. The DCI's Section 721 Report revealed undisclosed Iranian nuclear facilities. DCI George Tenet warned of Chinese firms backing Iran's nuclear program. In 2003 and 2004, concerns were raised about Chinese firms potentially supporting Iran's nuclear and missile programs, with some interactions continuing despite sanctions imposed under the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf highlighted these concerns in May 2004, indicating that while most sanctions related to non-nuclear transfers, there were also worries in the nuclear area. In May 2006, it was revealed that Iran used uranium hexafluoride gas from China to accelerate its uranium enrichment program. Chinese companies assisted Iran in procuring sensitive materials for its nuclear program, including graphite, tungsten copper, and high-strength alloys. In 2009, pressure gauges were ordered from Taiwan for centrifuges to enrich uranium for transfer to Iran. In 2010, China's Zhejiang Ouhai Trade was under investigation by the IAEA. In 2010, China's Zhejiang Ouhai Trade Corporation supplied sensitive valves and vacuum gauges to Iran for uranium enrichment. The French firm denied selling these products to China, and the PRC company denied the story. Sanctions were imposed on Javedan Mehr Toos in Iran for WMD proliferation. The United States has sought China's cooperation at the IAEA and U.N. to contain Iran's suspected nuclear weapon program. China's interests in Iran include economic ties for growth and opposing sanctions targeting energy deals, despite concerns about its support for Taiwan and supplying sensitive technology to Iran. China's reservations about sanctions stem from its desire to raise leverage against the U.S. and check its dominance in the region. China generally opposes sanctions targeting energy deals in Iran, as it could benefit from filling the void left by other countries pulling back. Chinese companies have imported crude oil from Iran, but any exploitation of sanctions for gains could harm international solidarity. China's import of crude oil from Iran decreased due to commercial negotiations over prices and payment terms. Despite the drop, China showed the ability to diversify its oil imports from other countries. In 2013, China's import of Iran's crude oil fell by 2.2% to 428,840 barrels per day, making Iran the sixth-largest foreign supplier of crude oil to China. However, China increased its import of fuel oil from Iran, exploiting a loophole in sanctions and providing revenue to Iran. China increased imports of crude oil from Iran after agreeing on the Joint Plan of Action in November 2013. Chinese state-owned companies like Sinopec and CNPC invested significantly in Iran's oil and gas sector, with promised investments totaling about $55 billion by the end of 2009. Progress in investments depended on acquiring gas liquefaction technology, with plans to build a natural gas liquefaction plant by 2016. Additionally, China signed a deal with a U.S. company to export liquefied natural gas to China. In 2007 or 2009, Chinese hackers conducted cyberespionage targeting Western energy companies. China invested in Iran's Yadavaran oil field, with Sinopec signing a $2 billion contract in 2007. China also signed a $16 billion deal in 2006 to produce LNG in Iran. In December 2006, China invested $16 billion in Iran's North Pars gas field to produce LNG. CNOOC signed the contract in May 2009. In January 2007, CNPC announced a $3.6 billion investment in Phase 14 at Iran's South Pars gas field. Royal Dutch Shell and Repsol considered a deal for Phases 13 and 14 at South Pars in 2007 but withdrew in June 2010. CNPC also signed a $1.8 billion contract in January 2009 to develop Iran's North Azadegan oil field. In March 2009, China's HuaFu Engineering Company signed a $3.2 billion contract to produce LNG at Phase 12 of the South Pars gas field. In June, CNPC signed a $4.7 billion contract for Phase 11, replacing Total of France. In August 2009, a state-owned insurance company indicated an $11.3 billion investment in Iran's oil refineries. Sinopec agreed in November 2009 to invest $6.5 billion in Iran's refineries. Japan had concerns about China's investment in the South Azadegan oilfield. Since 2009, CNPC has considered investing $2.5 billion in Iran. In 2014, CATIC agreed to invest $2.6 billion in petrochemical plants in Bushehr. Zhuhai Zhenrong began selling gasoline to Iran in 2008, supplying one-third of its imports by 2009. Chinaoil and Sinopec also exported gasoline to Iran. Zhuhai Zhenrong and LUKOIL exported gasoline to Iran in 2010. China's state-owned enterprises, including Zhuhai Zhenrong and ZhenHua Oil, have been supplying gasoline to Iran since 2008. By early 2010, these companies provided up to one-third of Iran's gasoline imports. Despite concerns about U.S. sanctions, Chinese companies continued to ship gasoline to Iran as of early 2012. Enforcement of U.S. sanctions against PRC companies, following the enactment of CISADA in 2010, China did not replace India in the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline agreement. By March 2012, ICBC backed out of arranging finances, but Chinese companies could still be contractors in the project. Concerns were raised by the U.S., Canada, Australia, EU, Japan, and South Korea about China's exploitation of sanctions limiting investments in Iran. In 2010, the U.S. enforced sanctions against Chinese companies for violating U.N. sanctions on Iran. The Obama Administration urged China to act responsibly and stop investments in Iran's energy sector. Robert Einhorn provided a list of Chinese companies suspected of violating sanctions and urged them to halt investments temporarily. The State Department urged companies, like CNPC, to halt investments in Iran temporarily. China was provided with specific concerns about PRC companies in Iran, leading to informal orders to slow down work in Iran's energy projects. Iran raised concerns about the pace of Chinese investments in energy projects, leading to suspensions and delays by CNPC, CNOOC, and Sinopec. Iran threatened CNPC with domestic replacements for delays in South Pars Phase 11 development. The U.S. urged companies like CNPC to temporarily halt investments in Iran. The Obama Administration took information about PRC companies seriously and provided it to China, with mixed results. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concerns about PRC entities not fully complying with sanctions on Iran, urging Beijing to implement all sanctions. China did not perceive the sanctions in the same way as the United States. Clinton testified to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that China did not see Iran as a threat and the US faced challenges in ensuring China's compliance with sanctions. Some members of Congress questioned applying sanctions to Chinese firms, with Senators urging President Obama to warn China about potential sanctions. Menendez expressed concerns to Secretary of State Clinton about PRC firms violating U.S. laws by conducting economic activities in Iran. NYK Line, a Hong Kong shipping company, halted trade with Iran. Under Secretary of the Treasury David Cohen visited Hong Kong and Beijing to seek cooperation in preventing Iran from using the global financial system for its nuclear programs. Cohen warned four PRC banks about the risks of doing business with IRISL. The Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) was warned by David Cohen about the risks of doing business with four PRC banks. China Shipping Container Lines (CSCL) and COSCO Container Lines stopped business with Iran in July 2013. President Obama imposed sanctions on Iran's petrochemical industry and expanded sanctions on the provision of goods, services, and technology to Iran's oil and gas business. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 imposed sanctions on Iran's financial sector. Despite opposition from China, other countries have joined the US in cutting business with Iran's energy sector. China voted for UNSC Resolution 1929 in June 2010, acknowledging the link between Iran's energy revenues and its nuclear program. Resolution 1929 acknowledged the link between Iran's energy revenues and its nuclear program. China reduced oil imports from Iran for commercial interests and energy security. Sanctions were imposed on CNPC's Bank of Kunlun for handling transactions for Iran's banks, leading to tensions between the US and China. The US imposed sanctions on China's Bank of Kunlun for handling transactions for Iran, leading to tensions between the two countries. Congress passed laws authorizing further sanctions against foreign energy dealings with Iran, including shipments of crude oil. China reduced oil imports from Iran under US and foreign pressure. China has evolved to vote for some sanctions at the UNSC under U.S. and foreign pressure. China's Foreign Minister argued for Iran's nuclear program to remain under the IAEA's handling. President Bush tried to persuade PRC ruler Hu Jintao not to block the IAEA from referring Iran's case to the UNSC. China abstained when the IAEA declared Iran was not complying with the NPT. In January 2006, Iran resumed uranium enrichment despite previous negotiations with Britain, France, and Germany. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick visited Beijing to discuss the Iran issue and China's role as a responsible stakeholder. Differences in diplomatic tactics were acknowledged during a news conference in Beijing. In January 2006, Iran resumed uranium enrichment despite previous negotiations with Britain, France, and Germany. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick visited Beijing to discuss the Iran issue and China's role as a responsible stakeholder. Differences in diplomatic tactics were acknowledged during a news conference in Beijing. At a special meeting in London on January 30, China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States agreed to report Iran's case to the UNSC at the special IAEA meeting in early February. China showed progress by supporting a resolution to report Iran to the UNSC on February 4. Despite the IAEA's report on Iran to the UNSC on March 8, China continued to favor handling the issue at the IAEA rather than the UNSC. On March 29, 2006, the UNSC issued a statement calling on Iran to suspend nuclear activities, verified by the IAEA. The US supported a new approach for incentives and costs for Iran's compliance, but China hosted a summit where Iran attended as an observer, causing displeasure. China, along with five other countries, issued a statement on July 12, 2006, proposing a two-stage approach for Iran's nuclear enrichment. Despite Iran's lack of response, China voted for Resolution 1696 on July 31, demanding Iran to suspend nuclear enrichment and warning of sanctions if Iran does not comply. China, along with other Security Council members, voted for Resolution 1737 on December 23, 2006, requiring Iran to suspend nuclear activities. China also supported Resolution 1747 on March 24, 2007, which banned Iran's arms exports. The United States raised concerns with China regarding its violation of UNSC Resolutions 1737 and 1747 by attempting to ship chemicals for ballistic missiles to Iran. Singapore intercepted the shipment, intended for a sanctioned Iranian organization, in cooperation with U.S. intelligence. The resolutions aimed to prevent transfers that could aid Iran's nuclear weapon delivery systems. Resolution 1747 called for restraint in transfers related to arms and missiles to Iran after the IAEA reported Iran's continued nuclear enrichment activities. The Bush Administration called for a third UNSC resolution with tougher sanctions on Iran, supported by China, the United States, France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom. However, China later refused to attend a meeting in Berlin on Iran's nuclear program, possibly due to displeasure over the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to Tibet's Dalai Lama. On November 13, IAEA's report and PRC Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi visited Tehran. China criticized sanctions as unhelpful. Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns expressed concerns about China's trade with Iran. China did not attend a meeting on sanctions in Brussels. The U.S. issued a new NIE on Iran's nuclear capabilities, finding Iran halted its weapons program in 2003 but resumed uranium enrichment in 2006. PRC's ambassador at the U.N. suggested the situation for imposing more sanctions changed. In the Section 721 Report to Congress for 2009, U.S. intelligence assessed that Iran maintained the option to develop nuclear weapons. China shifted to support a third sanctions resolution at the UNSC in January 2008 after talks with Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi attended a meeting on sanctions in Berlin but agreed to a draft UNSC resolution with compromise language that excluded new sanctions on Iranian banks and military units. The U.N. Security Council passed Resolution with Indonesia abstaining. In January, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1803 on March 3, 2008, imposing travel restrictions, bans on dual-use nuclear trade, and cargo inspections on Iran. China emphasized that the sanctions would not affect its normal business with Iran and called for negotiations. Despite U.S. efforts for further sanctions, Chinese leader Hu Jintao expressed support for Iran's peaceful use of nuclear energy during a meeting with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in September 2008. China also raised concerns linking diplomacy on Iran's nuclear program to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The PRC blocked U.S. efforts to set up a conference call among six countries to discuss Iran after U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were notified. However, PRC Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jieyi attended a meeting in Germany to discuss Iran's nuclear program. The Obama Administration later shifted policy to participate in talks with Iran, but China shielded Iran from tougher sanctions and reinforced its economic influence in Iran. The EU struggled to persuade China to support tougher sanctions on Iran. The Obama Administration sought closer cooperation with Russia to address Iran's nuclear program, leading to increased isolation for China. Russia proposed processing Iran's enriched uranium for a research reactor, while also discussing possible sanctions. Russia's delay in starting operations at the Bushehr nuclear reactor in Iran raised concerns. In 2009, Russia joined France and the United States in criticizing Iran's uranium enrichment program, increasing pressure on China to sanction Iran. Prior to a summit in Beijing, US officials warned China about Israel's concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program. China expressed support for an IAEA resolution critical of Iran's nuclear enrichment facility at Qom. In November 27, Iran's nuclear enrichment facility at Qom was censured. Israel urged China for cooperation on sanctions against Iran in 2010. The US urged Saudi Arabia and the UAE to increase oil supplies to China to reduce dependence on Iran. Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed Gulf states' concerns about Iran's nuclear program and asked Saudi king to urge China for UNSC sanctions. China faced international pressure for sanctions against Iran, but opposed targeting Iran's oil and gas industry. President Obama made progress with PRC leader Hu Jintao on UNSC Resolution negotiations. China's stance on UNSC sanctions against Iran was influenced by international pressure. Despite initial opposition to targeting Iran's oil and gas industry, China eventually voted for UNSC Resolution 1929 in June 2010. Secretary of State Clinton confirmed that China's support came after significant diplomatic efforts. Concerns arose about China potentially filling gaps left by unilateral sanctions imposed by the US and other nations. Days before Hu Jintao's state visit in Washington on January 19, 2011, the United States and EU discouraged China from joining Iran's invited tour of its nuclear sites, rather than IAEA inspections. China implied that it declined to visit and later stayed in solidarity with others in P5+1 talks with Iran. The U.S.-PRC Joint Statement called for full implementation of UNSC Resolutions on Iran but did not oppose Iran's nuclear activities, acknowledging Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy under the NPT. State Department official Robert Einhorn criticized China for its mixed implementation of UNSC sanctions on Iran and suspected Iran of obtaining nuclear-related items from China. Iran was suspected of obtaining nuclear-related items from China, with Malaysia seizing suspected cargo on a ship bound for Iran. The UN also investigated Iran's attempt to acquire banned materials from a company in China. Additionally, a Chinese company helped an Iranian citizen procure US materials for gas centrifuges. The IAEA reported concerns about Iran's undisclosed nuclear activities, including the development of a nuclear explosive device. China urged the IAEA not to report evidence of Iran's nuclear activities, voting for a resolution of concern but not escalating the issue to the UNSC. PRC entities transferred technology to Iran's missile programs during the Clinton Administration, with sanctions waived in 2000 despite continued proliferation activities. The Bush and Obama Administrations imposed sanctions on PRC entities for proliferation activities in Iran, questioning the effectiveness of sanctions. Concerns were raised about PRC's control over exports to Iran, including missile-related transfers. In 2009, a PRC person arranged the sale of a test chamber to Iran's Defense Industries Organization. The Section 721 Report for 2011 stated that PRC entities continued to supply missile-related items to Iran. The report highlighted PRC entities supplying missile-related items to Iran, as well as key components for Iran's ballistic missile production. Concerns were raised about PRC's involvement in North Korea's missile program, with suspicions of China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology's role. Lieutenant General Xiong Guangkai's visit to North Korea before a missile launch in 1998 raised further worries, leading to U.S. and Japanese support for missile defenses opposed by China. The NSA suspected China's involvement in North Korea's missile program, with reports of technology transfers and purchases of missile components. China's cooperation with North Korea on its space program, including the supply of specialty steel and gyroscopes, raised concerns about missile proliferation. The NSA discovered a PRC deal to supply missile-related items to North Korea through a Hong Kong company. The DCI confirmed PRC supplies to North Korea and noted North Korea's continued procurement of missile-related materials from foreign sources. This had direct implications for U.S. national security due to North Korea's nuclear weapons and delivery systems. The DNI's Section 721 Report of May 2007 revealed that PRC entities assisted North Korea's ballistic missile program. Taiwan raided Ho Li Enterprises in July 2010 for supplying dual-use machine tools to North Korea. By early 2011, North Korea built a new missile launch facility near China. The DPRK continued to procure missile-related materials from foreign sources, raising questions about China's control. After North Korea's failed missile launch in April 2012, a military parade in Pyongyang displayed a suspected Chinese transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) for an ICBM. This raised concerns about threats to U.S. security, violations of UNSC sanctions, China's credibility, U.S.-PRC cooperation, and potential application of U.S. sanctions. Representative Michael Turner raised questions about the suspected TEL transfer in a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and DNI James Clapper. After North Korea's failed missile launch in April 2012, concerns were raised about a suspected Chinese transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) for an ICBM displayed in a military parade in Pyongyang. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified about the DPRK's missile and nuclear threats and mentioned PRC's assistance to the DPRK's missile program. The State Department accepted China's denial of the allegations but raised the issue as a weapons proliferation concern in diplomatic channels. The Obama White House official downplayed PRC's help as \"poor performance\" in implementing sanctions, not a clear violation. The suspected Chinese transporter-erector-launcher (TEL) for an ICBM displayed in a military parade in Pyongyang was produced by a Chinese company linked to the state-owned aerospace defense industry. The transfer of the vehicles to North Korea in 2011 was marked as \"off-road trucks\" on shipping documents, and the Obama Administration did not impose sanctions on China for this transfer. The PRC has controls at its border with North Korea, and UNSC Resolution 1695 of 2006 required all States to prevent transfers of missile-related items. UNSC Resolutions 1695, 1718, and 1874 imposed bans on transfers of missile-related items, arms, and financial transactions to North Korea. Special Representative Glyn Davies discussed reinforcing sanctions during a visit to Beijing, emphasizing shared interests in peace, stability, and denuclearization between the US and China. The United States and China share interests in peace, stability, and denuclearization. Concerns were raised about PRC entities assisting North Korea's missile program, with the U.S. expecting China to enforce U.N. sanctions. China's entities were found to be involved in violations of sanctions, and South Korea suspected China of exporting bauxite to North Korea for missile production. North Korea acknowledged a secret uranium enrichment program to develop nuclear weapons during talks with U.S. officials in 2002. North Korea acknowledged a secret uranium enrichment program in 2002, which was not publicly disclosed by the Bush Administration until October 16, 2002. U.S. officials later restated concerns about North Korea's uranium enrichment program and estimated they had at least eight nuclear weapons by 2004. The Senate Intelligence Committee revealed in 2004 that North Korea had produced one or possibly two nuclear weapons in the mid-1990s. The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified in 2005 that North Korea's Taepo Dong 2 missile could potentially reach parts of the United States. Questions were raised about China's potential indirect contribution to North Korea's nuclear program through Pakistan. The New York Times and Washington Post reported in 2002 that U.S. officials believed Pakistan provided equipment for North Korea's uranium enrichment program in exchange for missiles. The Bush Administration knew Pakistan continued to supply nuclear technology to North Korea in 2002. Henry Sokolski called for Pakistan, Russia, and China to disclose their contributions to North Korea's nuclear program. The New York Times reported in 2004 on nuclear technology proliferation from Pakistan's Khan Research Laboratories, led by Abdul Qadeer Khan. Designs for uranium-enrichment centrifuges were transferred to China. DCI George Tenet confirmed North Korea's pursuit of a uranium enrichment program based on Khan's technology. Khan sold Libya a nuclear bomb design received from China in the 1980s, raising concerns about sales to Iran and North Korea. China had tested and developed the bomb design for missile delivery. China's involvement in nuclear proliferation has raised concerns, with reports of PRC firms supplying materials to North Korea's nuclear weapons programs. Instances include a PRC company selling dual-use chemicals to North Korea and the discovery of a North Korean freighter with Scud missile assembly line using parts from China or Japan. Questions have been raised about China's compliance with UNSC resolutions and enabling of DPRK's activities through cross-border trade. China's possible cooperation in interdiction, restrictions in the use of its ports and airfields, law-enforcement, and intelligence-sharing has become a salient question in light of the Bush Administration's PSI announced in May 2003. In December 2002, the Spanish and U.S. navies interdicted a North Korean ship with Scud missiles bound for Yemen, and the Spanish Defense Minister reported that the ship's last port of call was in China. An Iranian ship also stopped at the Tianjin port in China and picked up missile components before sailing on. In February and November 2002, a ship stopped at Tianjin port in China to pick up missile components before sailing to North Korea for missile and rocket fuel delivery. From April to July 2003, China allowed Iranian cargo planes to fly to North Korea multiple times to pick up suspected cruise missiles. The Bush Administration protested to Beijing about this. In September 2003, the State Department raised concerns with China about North Korean planes using Chinese airspace. In June 2005, China and a Central Asian country agreed to deny over-flight rights. In June 2005, China and a Central Asian country agreed to deny over-flight rights to an Iranian cargo plane that had landed in North Korea allegedly to pick up missile components. In November 2007, the Bush Administration raised concerns with China about an Iran Air plane flying from North Korea via Beijing's airport to Iran with missile jet vanes. In August 2008, India denied airspace to a North Korean plane scheduled to fly to Iran with suspected cargo related to weapons proliferation. These incidents raised questions about China's involvement in allowing overflights from North Korea and sharing intelligence with other countries. After North Korea's second nuclear test in May 2009, the United Arab Emirates seized a ship in August 2009. In August 2009, the United Arab Emirates seized a ship (ANL Australia) carrying North Korean weapons bound for Iran. The cargo was transferred from North Korea to a PRC ship in China's ports of Dalian and Shanghai before being loaded onto the ANL Australia. In December 2009, a plane carrying weapons from North Korea to Sri Lanka was intercepted in Thailand. South Africa also seized North Korean weapons bound for Congo in violation of UNSC Resolution 1874, with the shipment initially loaded in Dalian, China. China's port of Dalian has been a key transshipment point for North Korea's cargo. China has been a key transshipment point for North Korea's cargo, with instances of illicit arms shipments involving Iran and DPRK using Air Koryo and Iran Air. In 2011 and 2012, there were reports of North Korean ships and planes visiting Burma via China, as well as seizures of missile-related materials bound for Syria and Burma. In late 2012, North Korea agreed to supply Scud missile parts to Egypt through China. Questions have been raised about China's military relationship with North Korea, including PLA contingency planning and support for the DPRK regime. Concerns also exist about the PLA's knowledge of North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. The PLA's knowledge of the DPRK's missile and nuclear programs, plans to secure weapons and nuclear material, willingness to share information with the United States and U.S. allies, and aim to exert control that could complicate U.S. and ROK operations have raised questions. The relationship between the PRC and DPRK militaries has led to concerns about China's effectiveness in using leverage with Pyongyang. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell acknowledged talks about \"every\" aspect regarding contingencies in North Korea. In North Korea, Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell acknowledged talks about various aspects. A professor at Peking University warned that Beijing would not accept an implosion in Pyongyang or passively watch other countries gain control in North Korea. Some PRC leaders blame the United States for tensions on the Korean peninsula. China has shifted from pressuring North Korea to supporting the DPRK regime's security and survival. Wen Wei Po questioned the continued relevance of the PRC-North Korean alliance. China took steps to pressure North Korea by replacing paramilitary troops with PLA soldiers along the border in 2003. The PLA also constructed fences along the border to increase security and stem refugee flows. Despite some skepticism from the Defense Department, China's actions were seen as a potential hedge against uncertainty. China took steps to pressure North Korea by replacing paramilitary troops with PLA soldiers along the porous border and strengthening China's ability to stem refugee flows or respond to a breakdown of the North Korean regime. Additionally, China pursued military contacts with the United States and maintained traditional military friendship with North Korea. Despite the friendship treaty, the amount of military support that China provides to North Korea is minimal. The PLA hosted Admiral William Fallon's visit to the Shenyang Military Region in May 2006. PRC Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan visited North Korea in April 2006 but did not meet Kim Jong Il. General Cao criticized North Korea's missile test in July 2006. The PRC Foreign Ministry publicly criticized North Korea's nuclear test in October 2006. Following the DPRK's nuclear test in October 2006, the PRC Foreign Ministry expressed concerns about the impact on PRC-DPRK ties and denied being North Korea's ally. PLA and PAP troops were on high alert at the PRC-DPRK border. In November 2009, PRC Defense Minister Liang Guanglie visited North Korea for five days, emphasizing the historical friendship between the two countries. Liang did not discuss North Korea's nuclear program during the visit. In May 2010, an international report confirmed North Korea's attack on South Korea's naval ship, Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. China showed support for North Korea by opposing U.S.-ROK maritime exercises in the Yellow Sea. In August, China's Executive Vice Minister of Public Security visited North Korea to donate equipment. In February 2011, China's Minister of Public Security signed a cooperation agreement with North Korea. In April, the DPRK allegedly launched a cyberattack from China against South Korea's bank. In July, the PRC provided military trucks and jeeps to North Korea. In November 2011, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un met with PLA General Li Jinai. After Kim Jong Il's death, Hu Jintao expressed condolences and support for Kim Jong Un. In mid-2012, PLA and civilian forces held exercises near DPRK, with no reported DPRK participation. PRC Defense Minister's visit to Washington in August 2013 led to calls for U.S. flexibility towards North Korea. In December 2013, thousands of PLA soldiers conducted winter exercises near the border with North Korea. The PLA conducted exercises near the border with North Korea, raising questions about China's stance on North Korea's instability. The Bush Administration sought multilateral efforts for the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, with China playing a central role. Top PRC ruler Jiang Zemin agreed with President Bush on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula at a summit in 2002. China's role in addressing North Korea's nuclear weapons program is questioned, with concerns about its level of urgency compared to the US and its allies. There are debates on whether China's actions support regional stability or undermine it by backing a provocative North Korea. China balances various concerns, including maintaining a friendly relationship with the US, security policies, global standing, and wins and losses in its relationship with Washington. China's concerns about stability in relation to North Korea differ from those of the United States and others. While China emphasizes the need for peace and stability, suspicions arise regarding their preference for the status quo despite North Korea's actions causing instability. Beijing's cited concerns are contradicted by ongoing issues such as drug and human smuggling in 2012. China's concerns about stability in relation to North Korea differ from those of the United States and others. Despite Beijing's emphasis on peace and stability, ongoing issues such as drug and human smuggling in 2012 contradict their cited concerns. The PRC acknowledged repatriating certain DPRK citizens multiple times and initially did not respond urgently to multilateral cooperation sought by the United States. North Korea's actions, including expelling IAEA inspectors and withdrawing from the NPT, further escalated tensions. Bush and Powell highlighted China's considerable influence with North Korea in achieving common objectives. China's influence with North Korea was emphasized by Bush and Powell. Powell urged China to play an active role in the dispute, leading to China sponsoring multilateral talks to denuclearize the Korean peninsula and supporting tough UNSC resolutions against North Korea's actions. China also urged the US to provide aid to North Korea. The PRC urged the US to provide aid to North Korea, lift sanctions, and hold bilateral talks by 2007. Progress was seen with the shutdown of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor in the summer of 2007. Despite PRC's support, North Korea retained leverage for denuclearization stall, economic gains, repression, weapons proliferation, and nuclear tests. China hosted Trilateral Talks after pressuring North Korea in March 2003. China hosted Trilateral Talks with the DPRK and the US in April 2003, followed by the first round of the Six-Party Talks in August 2003. North Korea threatened to transfer or test nuclear weapons during these meetings. China also seized a shipment of tributyl phosphate suspected for use in nuclear weapons. A shipment of tributyl phosphate (TBP), a material used for nuclear weapons, was suspected by the CIA on a train bound for North Korea in 2003. China stopped a shipment of chemicals at the border with North Korea in September 2003. The Bush Administration sought multilateral talks before the end of 2003, but they were not held. During a meeting in Seoul, a Chinese diplomat questioned U.S. intelligence on North Korea's nuclear program. China then hosted the second round of Six-Party Talks. China hosted the second round of Six-Party Talks in February 2004, where North Korea denied having a uranium enrichment program. The talks did not show progress in freezing or dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons programs. Before the third round of talks, China questioned U.S. intelligence on North Korea's uranium enrichment. The third round took place in June 2004, with North Korea threatening to test a nuclear weapon. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice visited Beijing after the talks. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice informed Chinese leaders about A.Q. Khan's activities and North Korea's uranium program. Despite limited progress in talks, Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly emphasized the importance of multilateral diplomacy in addressing the North Korean nuclear threat. He mentioned the potential role of the United Nations Security Council, but noted China's reluctance to involve the UNSC. In early February 2005, President Bush sent Michael Green, the National Security Council's Senior Director for Asian Affairs, to Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul to increase diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang. In Beijing, Green presented urgent U.S. intelligence findings to President Hu Jintao, indicating that North Korea had processed uranium hexafluoride and sold some to Libya. In 2003, reports suggested that North Korea supplied uranium hexafluoride to Libya via Pakistan. In February 2005, North Korea announced its nuclear weapons production, leading to tensions and discussions on sanctions by the UNSC. China advocated for bilateral talks between the US and North Korea instead of sanctions. The Bush Administration pressured China to take action. The Bush Administration pressured China to use its leverage to bring North Korea back to the Six-Party Talks. Secretary of State Rice urged China to help restart the talks, mentioning the possibility of going to the U.N. Security Council. China refused to interrupt oil flows to North Korea, leading to tensions between the two countries. A PRC Foreign Ministry official blamed Washington for lack of cooperation and Bush for calling Kim Jong Il a \"tyrant.\" Hill stated that China had enough influence to bring North Korea back to talks but had not done so. Secretary Rice proposed a strengthened U.S.-PRC relationship and Deputy Secretary of State Zoellick would hold a \"Senior Dialogue\" with his PRC counterpart. PRC ruler Hu Jintao had requested \"strategic talks\" with President Bush. One day after North Korea announced its return to talks, Secretary Rice visited China before visiting U.S. allies. China announced the start of the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing on July 26, 2005, with inconclusive results leading to a recess until August 29. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf supported U.S. reports of North Korea's uranium enrichment program. President Bush's meeting with Hu Jintao was postponed due to Hurricane Katrina, eventually taking place on September 13. North Korea returned to the talks on September 13 after initially not complying. On September 13, China proposed a joint statement in New York recognizing North Korea's stance on a light water reactor without mentioning a uranium program. The United States, along with other countries, agreed to sign the Joint Statement of Principles on September 19, 2005, where North Korea committed to abandoning all nuclear weapons and programs. The U.S. clarified that dismantlement must be verifiable, nuclear programs included plutonium and uranium, and discussions on a light water reactor would happen at an appropriate time. At a House International Relations Committee hearing in October 2005, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen questioned Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill about PRC pressure regarding a light water reactor deal with North Korea. Hill acknowledged Beijing's pressure but emphasized the benefits of working with China. Despite earlier unacceptable PRC drafts, the joint statement was signed in September 2005. PRC Vice Premier Wu Yi visited North Korea shortly after, offering new economic aid. Wu Yi visited North Korea in October 2005, followed by Hu Jintao's visit in late October. Despite progress in the talks, the 5th round of the Six-Party Talks in November did not yield results on dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons. President Bush called for \"firm resolve\" while Hu Jintao advocated for \"greater flexibility.\" Hu Jintao later hosted Kim Jong Il in China in January 2006. In January 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao expressed support for the Six-Party Talks during a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The People's Republic of China proposed a meeting between Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill and North Korean negotiator Kim Kye-gwan in Beijing. Senators Reid, Levin, Biden, and Rockefeller criticized President Bush's policy towards North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile activities in a letter. Chairman James Leach also critiqued President Bush's approach at a hearing in March 2006. Chairman James Leach criticized President Bush's approach to the Six-Party Talks, calling for U.S. leadership, more dialogue, and greater flexibility in diplomacy. He suggested sending Assistant Secretary of State Chris Hill to Pyongyang, negotiating a permanent peace on the peninsula at a separate forum, and establishing direct contacts with North Korean officials. Leach argued against transferring the initiative to others and highlighted China's neutral stance in the talks, which struggled to produce results. The impasse in the Six-Party Talks continued in 2006, with China unable to prevent North Korea from test-firing ballistic missiles, including an ICBM. Congress expressed concerns, questioning China's role in the negotiations. Brigadier General John Allen testified that China tried to dissuade North Korea from destabilizing actions. In July 2006, North Korea conducted missile tests, including an ICBM launch that failed shortly after takeoff. China and Russia were seen as having the most leverage over North Korea, with Senator John McCain warning about their influence on relations. China's PLA Chief of General Staff expressed intent to expand cooperation with North Korea's military. President Hu Jintao of China expressed concerns to President Bush about the situation. In July 2006, PRC ruler Hu Jintao expressed concerns about the situation regarding North Korea's missile tests. China and the US supported different approaches in the UNSC, with China advocating for resuming Six-Party Talks. China sent a delegation to Pyongyang for a friendship treaty anniversary, but Kim Jong Il snubbed the PRC visitor. China's delegation failed to make progress in getting Pyongyang back to the talks, dropping their pursuit of a draft UNSC resolution. Despite similar goals, Beijing threatened to veto Tokyo's resolution, leading to the adoption of UNSC Resolution 1695 on July 15, 2006, condemning the DPRK's missile launches. On July 15, 2006, UNSC Resolution 1695 was adopted unanimously, condemning North Korea's missile launches and demanding suspension of its missile program. It required countries to prevent technology transfers to North Korea's missile or WMD programs and urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks. President Bush thanked Hu Jintao for his leadership on the resolution during the Group of Eight summit in St. Petersburg. Additionally, China froze North Korean assets at the Bank of China for counterfeiting the PRC currency in late 2005. Chairman Richard Lugar highlighted China's role in facilitating talks with North Korea while supplying energy and lifelines. He warned of destabilization caused by missile tests and urged China to reassess its regional priorities. Despite UNSC resolution, China criticized Japan's sanctions and refused to attend a meeting on the DPRK. In September 2006, the House and Senate passed the FY2007 NDAA conference report. In 2006, the House and Senate passed the FY2007 NDAA conference report requiring a North Korea Policy Coordinator, which was later repealed in the FY2008 NDAA. North Korea conducted a nuclear test on October 9, 2006, prompting strong reactions from China against the test. China expressed opposition to North Korea's actions, fearing instability. China strongly opposed North Korea's nuclear test in 2006, fearing instability on its periphery. The Director of National Intelligence confirmed the test, and President Bush declared it on December 7, 2006. China urged resuming Six-Party Talks and agreed to UNSC sanctions but opposed using force. The US and Japan compromised with China and Russia on targeted arms embargo and cargo inspections to prevent proliferation. China voted for Resolution 1718 on October 14, 2006. On October 14, 2006, China voted for Resolution 1718 imposing sanctions to prevent supply of weapons and items for DPRK's nuclear programs. Secretary Rice praised China's cooperation and expected full implementation of the resolution. China's commitment to DPRK's denuclearization was highlighted during Rice's visit to Beijing on October 20. China's enforcement of Resolution 1718 for DPRK's denuclearization was questionable, as it called for \"cooperative action\" in cargo inspection. PRC sanctions might not be effective in dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons. China's ban on luxury goods showed disapproval of Kim's regime, but North Korean elites still enjoyed shopping sprees in China. China increased the export of banned luxury goods to North Korea after voting for the resolution. China tightened inspections on cross-border traffic after voting for Resolution 1718 on North Korea's denuclearization. China's major state-owned banks suspended financial transactions with North Korea after the nuclear test, but later relaxed restrictions. Despite these limited actions, PRC trade with North Korea continued as usual. China had various options to respond to North Korea's nuclear test, such as limiting exports and imports, cracking down on smuggling, and cutting crude oil supplies. Despite some reported stoppages of supplies, China continued to provide diesel fuel aid to North Korea. In October 2006, a trilateral meeting was announced among China, North Korea, and the U.S. to resume the Six-Party Talks. China proposed \"working groups\" during the second phase of the fifth round of the Six-Party Talks in Beijing in December 2006. Assistant Secretary Hill reported no breakthrough, but separately, he traveled to Berlin for a bilateral meeting with North Korea to make progress. The U.S. showed willingness to use a \"bilateral mechanism\" to resolve the issue. On January 30, 2007, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Treasury Daniel Glaser resumed talks in Beijing with North Koreans on sanctions freezing assets at Banco Delta Asia. On February 13, 2007, six countries agreed to a Joint Statement for North Korea to shut down Yongbyon nuclear facility and discuss abandoning nuclear programs. Working Groups were established for denuclearization, U.S.-DPRK relations normalization, DPRK-Japan relations normalization, and economic issues. Following the Joint Statement in February 2007, promises were made for economic aid, ministerial meetings, and negotiations for permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. Assistant Secretary Hill updated on North Korea's progress in meeting the terms of the agreement, including concerns about their highly enriched uranium program. The North Koreans have not acknowledged having a highly enriched uranium (HEU) program. US intelligence initially had high confidence in North Korea acquiring material for uranium enrichment in 2002, but this confidence later decreased. Despite doubts raised by the People's Republic of China (PRC), the US intelligence community still believes North Korea pursued a uranium enrichment capability alongside plutonium production. The IC reported that North Korea has pursued a uranium enrichment capability for nuclear weapons with at least moderate confidence. Talks in 2007 saw North Korea demanding the release of frozen funds before diplomacy on nuclear program dismantlement resumed. Assistant Secretary of State Hill visited Pyongyang in June 2007. Assistant Secretary of State Hill visited Pyongyang in June 2007 and briefed reporters in Washington on U.S. goals for the disablement of the DPRK's Yongbyon nuclear reactor. The reactor was shut down on July 14 with IAEA verification, and the \"Six-Party Talks\" resumed on July 18-20. In September 2007, Hill announced an agreement for the DPRK to provide a full declaration of all nuclear programs and disable them by the end of the year. China supported the improved U.S.-DPRK relationship and provided 50,000 tons of heavy oil to North Korea. During the \"second session of the 6th round of the Six-Party Talks,\" China emphasized progress made by the Working Groups. A Joint Document issued on October 3, 2007, outlined the DPRK's agreement to disable nuclear facilities, including the Yongbyon reactor site, by December 31, 2007. The United States would lead disablement work and provide funding, while the DPRK committed to a complete declaration of all nuclear programs and reaffirmed its commitment to nonproliferation. The statement discussed normalization of U.S.-DPRK and Japan-DPRK relationships, PRC-sponsored Joint Document raised questions about implementation of nuclear nonproliferation commitments, including disposal of nuclear equipment, disablement of facilities, dismantlement, funding, declaration of nuclear weapons, clarification of programs, missile and nuclear proliferation, verification, monitoring, timelines for normalization, and other concerns of the U.S. and Japan. In November 2007, liaison officials were assigned in Pyongyang to monitor disablement at Yongbyon. Despite productive work, they were kicked out by the DPRK regime in April 2009. Assistant Secretary of State Hill visited Pyongyang in December 2007 with a letter from President Bush to Kim Jong Il. North Korea failed to provide a complete declaration of nuclear programs by the December 30, 2007 deadline. In early 2008, critics questioned China's lack of strong economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons. Former officials criticized China for covering for Kim Jong Il without consequences in its relations with the U.S. China's role in the impasse was increasingly scrutinized as it reportedly suspended food aid to North Korea. In 2008, DPRK Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan met with the United States in Beijing, Geneva, and Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs. North Korea agreed to declare its plutonium production but did not disclose its uranium enrichment program or the nuclear reactor in Syria. The State Department urged North Korea for a complete declaration for verification. Additionally, PRC Vice President Xi Jinping visited Pyongyang and offered aid to the DPRK regime. Secretary Rice defended the \"Six Party Talks\" and China's role, aiming to eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons. She mentioned North Korea's nuclear technology proliferation to Syria and uranium enrichment program, expressing concerns about new information on their capabilities. President Bush would notify Congress after North Korea's declaration of nuclear programs to China. President Bush planned to remove North Korea from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism and lift sanctions, pending verification of their nuclear declaration. Secretary Rice emphasized the need for rigorous verification involving on-site access, sample collection, forensic analysis, and interviews with North Koreans. A week after Xi Jinping's visit to Pyongyang, the DPRK complied with a partial declaration on its plutonium program. PRC Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei instructed the DPRK to submit its declaration to China and the United States for removal from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism and sanctions. President Bush promptly took action, removing North Korea from sanctions under the Trading with the Enemy Act and initiating the process to rescind its designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. Verification of the DPRK's nuclear programs will be addressed through the six-party talks. National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley acknowledged reliance on a \"process\" to establish a verification protocol within 45 days. U.S. officials witnessed the destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon. The Administration paid $2.5 million for the televised explosion and accepted North Korean concessions on uranium and proliferation. Bush agreed to keep the declaration secret at the request of China. Secretary of State Rice praised China's role and emphasized the need for a verification framework during her visit to Beijing in June. The Joint Document of October 2007 raised questions about implementation, including verification. Secretary Rice emphasized the need for verification and monitoring, but PRC Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi did not mention it. The Six-Party Talks resumed in July 2008 to discuss a verification protocol, but fell short of U.S. requirements. Despite this, Secretary Rice met with her DPRK counterpart in Singapore. President Bush did not remove DPRK from the terrorism list. In August and September, North Korea suspended disablement at Yongbyon and the US did not remove them from the terrorism list. Assistant Secretary of State Hill praised China's role in the talks and outlined the goal for DPRK's declaration verification. The US would remove North Korea from the terrorism list once a verification protocol was agreed upon. National Security Advisor Hadley admitted that North Korea's nuclear declaration was incomplete. National Security Advisor Hadley acknowledged that North Korea's nuclear declaration was incomplete. Despite this, the US announced a bilateral agreement with North Korea on verification measures, including sampling and forensics for plutonium, uranium, and proliferation programs. The agreement did not give a primary role to the IAEA. The State Department vaguely cited agreement in a joint document and \"certain other understandings\" for measures that \"will serve as the baseline for a Verification Protocol.\" Despite the lack of a verification protocol, a timeline, or an agreement at the \"Six-Party Talks,\" the Secretary of State rescinded the DPRK's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The DPRK denied agreeing to all U.S. verification measures, including sampling, after bilateral talks in Singapore. The \"Six-Party Talks\" in Beijing failed to reach an agreement. The \"Six-Party Talks\" in Beijing failed to secure the DPRK's agreement on a verification protocol, leading to criticism of China's role. Critics argue that the talks collapsed without addressing North Korea's nuclear weapons and strained U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea. The DPRK continued to proliferate nuclear technology to other countries, while U.S. administrations failed to prevent North Korea from advancing its nuclear and missile programs. China was criticized for not tightening aid to North Korea. In contrast to U.S. compliments to China, some criticized China for failing to tighten aid to North Korean military and party elite, and for not effectively using its leverage on Pyongyang. The question in 2009 was how the U.S. should work with China amid issues in the Six-Party Talks. Some suggested the U.S. should view China as less critical, focus on allies, and enhance Russia's role. Others argued for continued engagement with China due to DPRK's dependence on China and the goal of resolving tensions in Northeast Asia. The goal is to address tensions in Northeast Asia and crises, with differing views on China's approach towards North Korea. Henry Kissinger highlighted DPRK's negotiation tactics, while Kim Jong Il pledged denuclearization in a meeting with a Chinese official in 2009. On April 5, 2009, North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 missile, despite earlier claims of launching a satellite. This action raised concerns as satellites had detected preparations for the missile test in early February. North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 missile on April 5, 2009, violating UNSC Resolution 1718. The missile passed over Japan and the Sea of Japan, with its stages falling into the Pacific Ocean. President Obama called for action by the UNSC, as the U.S. considered the launch a violation of ballistic missile activities. The missile flew approximately 2,390 miles, but did not enter orbit. On April 5, 2009, North Korea violated UNSC Resolution 1718 by launching a Taepodong-2 missile that passed over Japan and the Sea of Japan. President Obama called for UNSC action as the missile did not enter orbit. China agreed to condemn the launch with a UNSC Presidential Statement on April 11. On April 13, the UNSC issued a statement condemning the launch and called for sanctions under Resolution 1718. In response, North Korea expelled U.S. officials, restarted nuclear facilities, and conducted a second nuclear test on May 25, 2009. The DNI reported that North Korea likely conducted an underground nuclear test in May 2009, yielding a few kilotons. The test was deemed more successful than a previous one in 2006. Following the test, the UNSC issued a statement condemning it as a violation of Resolution 1718, leading to discussions of new sanctions. South Korea also joined the U.S.-led PSI to address the destabilizing situation in the Korean peninsula. The situation in the Korean peninsula was destabilizing, leading to stronger steps against North Korea. South Korea joined the PSI, and China was urged to implement UNSC resolutions. PLA officials criticized North Korea's nuclear tests, raising questions about China's stance towards North Korea. In late May and June 2009, PRC policy analysts and academics in Beijing debated whether China should change its approach towards North Korea due to concerns about the DPRK's actions threatening China's interests. Some academics favored severe sanctions on North Korea while others opposed abandoning the special friendship with the DPRK. China was worried about the potential addition of more nuclear powers in the region, including North Korea, Japan, and South Korea. In June 2009, PRC policy makers debated changing their approach towards North Korea amidst concerns about the DPRK's actions. Official observers in Beijing remained conservative, focusing on the U.S. role in the region. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg met with Chinese officials to discuss the response at the UNSC and the broader Northeast Asian situation. In June 2009, China agreed to new sanctions on North Korea at the UNSC, leading to Resolution 1874 which expanded previous sanctions. The resolution banned DPRK's arms exports but allowed some arms imports, excluding small arms and light weapons. It also called for denial of services and inspections of ships carrying banned cargo, without the use of force and requiring consent of the flag state for inspections on the high seas. The UNSC Resolution 1874 expanded sanctions on North Korea, banning arms exports but allowing some imports. It called for denial of services and inspections of ships carrying banned cargo with consent of the flag state. China expressed opposition to North Korea's nuclear test and called for restraint, but concerns arose about its enforcement of sanctions and economic interests. Only in April 2009 were three North Korean entities sanctioned, followed by more designations in July 2009. China submitted a report to the UNSC promising to implement sanctions under Resolutions 1718 and 1874. China promised to implement sanctions under Resolutions 1718 and 1874, including controls on embargoed items for export to North Korea and freezing assets of listed individuals. However, China did not report specific steps and only pledged to \"refrain\" from exporting weapons to North Korea. Luxury goods were not included in the ban, and China opposed sanctions affecting North Korea's national development and international ties. Despite Resolution 1718's ban on luxury goods in 2006, the UNSC did not provide a list of banned goods for North Korea. In July 2009, Italy blocked an $18 million contract for two yachts suspected of going to Kim Jong Il. Japan arrested a South Korean resident for exporting pianos and cars to North Korea. The China Guangfa Bank was found to be engaged in business with North Korea's arms dealer. Two traders were arrested in Japan for exporting cosmetics to North Korea. In October 2008, expensive cosmetics and cars were smuggled from Japan and China to North Korea through Dalian Global. Dalian has been identified as a key trans-shipment point for the DPRK regime. In June 2009, the US Navy tracked a North Korean ship heading towards Burma after sanctions were imposed, but Burma refused entry, forcing the ship to return to North Korea. At the Defense Consultative Talks in Beijing, Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy did not discuss enforcement of the resolution against a ship off China's coast. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton raised concerns about military cooperation between North Korea and Burma at the ASEAN Regional Forum. China confiscated a rare metal being smuggled to North Korea. In the same month, China's NHI Shenyang Mining Machinery Company suspended construction of a bronze mine in North Korea with a company subject to U.N. sanctions. In August, the DPRK's Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, under U.S. sanctions, closed in Dandong, China. After the DPRK's nuclear test in October 2006, there were also reports of China's initial actions. On October 4, PRC Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang and signed bilateral agreements to provide economic and technical assistance. Kim Jong Il reportedly told Wen that North Korea would attend multilateral talks, depending on U.S.-DPRK talks on \"peaceful\" ties. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell visited Beijing on October 14 and praised U.S.-PRC coordination as \"tight and close.\" Despite a debate, China decided against a policy change towards North Korea, believing the nuclear program posed no direct threat to China but rather challenged U.S. interests. Critics suspect China prefers talks to maintain the status quo, while the U.S. and allies seek tangible results. China increased engagement with North Korea instead of isolating it. China's continued support for the DPRK regime led to less willingness to negotiate on its nuclear program. President Obama discussed the goal of eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons program during a summit with Hu Jintao in November 2009. The Administration also signaled for a robust bilateral dialogue. China's support for North Korea hindered negotiations on its nuclear program. President Obama aimed to eliminate North Korea's nuclear weapons during a summit with Hu Jintao in November 2009. Special Representative Stephen Bosworth visited Pyongyang in December 2009 to push for North Korea's return to the Six-Party Talks. Despite China's objections to arms sales to Taiwan in January 2010, Hu Jintao sent a representative to meet with Kim Jong Il in February to discuss the Six-Party Talks. North Korea's media did not mention the talks, posing a challenge to restarting negotiations. The \"Six-Party Talks\" were initiated after North Korea attacked South Korea's naval ship, Cheonan, killing 46 sailors. Despite discussions between Secretary of State Clinton and PRC State Councilor Dai Bingguo, progress was hindered. South Korea's investigation into the sinking of Cheonan revealed North Korea's involvement. At the G-20 summit, President Obama criticized China for its stance on North Korea. China, however, refused to directly condemn North Korea in negotiations. China refused to condemn North Korea directly in negotiations for a UNSC Presidential Statement issued on July 9. The UNSC condemned the \"attack,\" and later in July, the PRC's military and Foreign Ministry expressed opposition to U.S.-ROK exercises in the Yellow Sea. The State Department discussed with China the need to enforce sanctions against North Korea. Special Representative Wu Dawei was sent to Washington and other capitals in late August. PRC's Special Representative Wu Dawei visited Washington and other capitals to push for resuming the Six-Party Talks, proposing a three-step process. CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao met with Kim Jong Il, emphasizing \"peace and stability\" on the Korean peninsula. The Obama Administration shifted to calling the talks the \"six-party process\" due to DPRK's actions. Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the issue. The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing with testimony from the Departments of Defense and State regarding stability in the Korean peninsula amidst North Korea's artillery attack on South Korea. Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un attended a military parade in the DPRK, with support from China's Zhou Yongkang. China also hosted a DPRK military delegation in Beijing, with high-ranking PLA officers in attendance. In November 2010, the PRC faced pressure and isolation for supporting North Korea, blocking a UN report on DPRK's nuclear programs. Russian President expressed concern about North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Stanford University's Siegfried Hecker saw a DPRK uranium enrichment facility with 2,000 centrifuges. Questions arose about PRC's involvement in DPRK's uranium enrichment efforts. In November 2010, the PRC faced pressure for supporting North Korea's nuclear programs. The DPRK disclosed its uranium enrichment efforts, leading to concerns about foreign assistance. Subsequently, the DPRK launched an artillery attack on South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island, while a PRC delegation signed an economic agreement in Pyongyang. U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth condemned the DPRK's aggression and its uranium enrichment activities, but China called for \"consultations\" under the Six-Party Talks in response. In response to North Korea's provocations, the State Department called for consultations under the Six-Party Talks and urged China to fulfill its obligations. The Obama Administration sought to stabilize its relationship with China and pressured them to restrain North Korea and push for denuclearization. During a visit to Washington, PLA Air Force General Ma Xiaotian was urged to help end North Korea's provocations and promote denuclearization. During his visit to Seoul, Admiral Mullen publicly criticized China for its \"tacit approval\" of North Korea. President Obama spoke with PRC's Hu Jintao in December, with the White House blaming \"scheduling\" difficulties for the delayed discussion on North Korea. The PRC opposed a UNSC statement on North Korea on December 19, but called for \"maximum restraint\" the next day. The PLA hosted Defense Secretary Robert Gates in January 2011 to provide a positive atmosphere for Hu Jintao's state visit. Gates appreciated PRC's help in restraining North Korea but also warned North Korea through the U.N. channel. President Obama appreciated China's help in restraining North Korea but also warned that North Korea's nuclear weapons and ICBM programs posed a direct threat to the United States. In a joint statement with China, the US expressed concern about North Korea's uranium enrichment program, with Obama stating it violated international obligations. He also warned China that if they did not restrain North Korea, the US would increase its military presence in Northeast Asia. China blocked the release of a UN report on North Korea's uranium enrichment at a UNSC meeting. The U.N. Panel of Experts released a report on North Korea's uranium enrichment and compliance with U.N. resolutions. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell emphasized cooperation with U.S. allies in Asia, calling on China to enhance implementation of sanctions. China's support for the DPRK was noted, with Campbell advocating for a U.N. response to the DPRK's uranium enrichment program. Russia backed discussion at the UNSC, isolating China and the DPRK. China proposed a three-step process for resuming talks with North Korea and the Six-Party Talks. In May, the State Department called for the release of a report by a U.N. Panel of Experts, finding that Iran and the DPRK traded illicit missile technology. The PRC did not express \"concern\" about the DPRK's uranium enrichment program at a trilateral summit in Tokyo. Special Representative Bosworth held direct dialogue with the DPRK after a meeting in Pyongyang in December 2009. In December 2009, Special Representative Bosworth met with a DPRK delegation in New York. The US urged dialogue with South Korea and compliance with UN resolutions. Kim Jong Il reportedly discussed resuming Six-Party Talks with China. Talks in Geneva in October 2011 yielded no breakthrough. Glyn Davies visited Beijing in February 2012 for talks with the DPRK. On February 29, the US and DPRK issued statements on an agreement regarding missile and nuclear issues. On April 13, the DPRK launched a Taepo Dong-2 intercontinental ballistic missile, but the launch failed. The UNSC condemned the missile launch as a serious violation of Resolutions 1718 and 1874. In late November 2012, Xi Jinping sent Li Jianguo to Pyongyang with a message about Northeast Asian peace and stability. DPRK leader Kim Jong Un met with Li, but the next day North Korea announced a \"satellite\" launch. On December 11, North Korea conducted a successful test of the Taepo Dong-2 long-range missile, violating UNSC Resolutions 1718 and 1874. China reacted with rare reference to restrictions of UNSC resolutions. The National Security Council condemned North Korea's missile test as a violation of UNSC Resolutions 1718 and 1874. China called for a measured response. The Obama Administration considered actions to enhance regional security, which China views as containment. Financial assets could be targeted. China shifted focus to emphasize denuclearization. Xi Jinping emphasized denuclearization in a meeting with South Korea's president-elect envoy. China voted for UNSC Resolution 2087 condemning North Korea's actions. China, along with other UNSC members, voted for Resolution 2087 condemning North Korea's missile test and imposing sanctions. Despite tightened customs inspections, North Korea conducted a third nuclear test, prompting concerns about China's stance on the issue. Observers questioned if China would change its approach towards North Korea's destabilizing actions. The UNSC condemned North Korea's nuclear test and China conducted a military drill in response. China expressed opposition to the test but did not condemn it as a violation of UNSC resolutions. After negotiations, the UNSC approved Resolution 2094 to expand sanctions against DPRK entities and individuals. The House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on March 5 and 7, 2013 regarding North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. China's implementation of sanctions was emphasized, with calls for inspections of cargo and defining luxury goods. National Security Advisor Tom Donilon stated that no country, including China, should conduct \"business as usual\" with North Korea. The Obama Administration took steps to shape China's calculations and deter North Korea, including deploying additional Ground-Based Interceptors in Alaska and Japan. The U.S. deployed additional Ground-Based Interceptors in Alaska and Japan to deter North Korea. An unnamed U.S. official sent a signal to China about the consequences of North Korea's actions. China responded negatively, warning that stronger missile defenses and military alliances would only escalate tensions. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter mentioned flying B-52 strategic bombers to South Korea for exercises and extended deterrence. China's response to North Korea's nuclear program included enforcing UNSC sanctions, closing bank accounts, and calling for Six-Party Talks. China's exports of crude oil to North Korea increased in the first quarter of 2013, despite ongoing economic links and support from China. Despite debates within China and actions by North Korea against China's interests, including the kidnapping of fishermen, President Obama emphasized denuclearization in discussions with Xi Jinping. However, North Korea continued to assert its nuclear weapons status. On September 10, North Korea maintained its nuclear weapons status and showed reluctance towards denuclearization in the Six-Party Talks. China banned dual-use items for missile programs to comply with UNSC resolutions, but President Xi Jinping indicated a more relaxed stance on the Korean peninsula. The US did not agree with China's proposal to resume talks, raising concerns about DPRK's nuclear programs and considering options like pressuring China, imposing more sanctions, or enhancing cooperation with Japan and South Korea. After Kim Jong Un executed a relative and senior official, Chang Song Taek, in December, official PRC media in early 2014 signaled greater unease about the DPRK's nuclear program. Secretary of State Kerry urged Beijing to do more given its unique influence on the DPRK, mentioning China's supply of refined fuel and banking transactions. China took steps in 2013 to calm potential conflict. PRC leader Xi Jinping met with ROK President Park in Seoul on July 3-4, announcing the establishment of a direct telephone link between the PRC and ROK militaries. China also ceased selling crude oil to North Korea. China stopped selling crude oil to North Korea in January 2014, but supplies may have continued through non-commercial aid. Despite this, China was hesitant to pressure North Korea too much. North Korea expanded its Yongbyon enrichment facility, restarted a plutonium-producing reactor, and likely continued uranium enrichment. They also developed road-mobile ICBMs and long-range missiles capable of threatening the United States. Special Representative Davis testified at a House hearing on U.S. policy on North Korea, crediting China for banning certain exports to North Korea in 2013. PRC firms, along with North Korean and Russian entities, contributed to Syria's missile program according to a Pentagon report. Under Secretary of State John Bolton criticized DPRK and Russian aid to Syria's missile development but did not mention PRC help in a speech at the Heritage Foundation in 2002. The \"Section 721 Reports\" in 2010 revealed that PRC entities supplied missile-related items to Syria. The PRC's involvement in weapons proliferation to Syria raises policy issues for the U.S., including assessments of China's role, prioritization of nonproliferation, and strategies for obtaining China's cooperation. Previous administrations pursued engagement with Beijing, with President Clinton issuing certifications for a Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in 1998. The State Department waived sanctions and considered new satellite exports in exchange for missile-related concessions in 2000. Some officials and experts believe the United States has made progress in nonproliferation goals by waiving sanctions and considering new satellite exports in exchange for missile non-proliferation pledges from China. Critics argue for a tougher approach towards China's activities that undermine U.S. security interests, citing continued weapons proliferation activities and unreliable assurances from China. They emphasize the need for China to recognize nonproliferation for its own national interests and develop stronger export controls with potential U.S. assistance. Some argue for a stronger approach to stigmatize sensitive transfers and impose sanctions on China to better serve U.S. security interests. They believe the U.S. should not subsidize China's missile and nuclear industries, seeing U.S. leverage over China as stronger. Doubts persist about China's commitment to nonproliferation, citing weak export controls and government repression. Concerns are raised about China using sales as leverage against the U.S., especially regarding arms sales to Taiwan. Missile technology development in China may occur without the knowledge or approval of the government, as some state-owned enterprises are known to engage in proliferation activities. Testimonies from intelligence officials suggest that while some activities may be condoned by the government, there are instances where entities operate independently. Concerns have been raised about China's involvement in nuclear and missile programs, with doubts about their commitment to nonproliferation and the effectiveness of their export controls. The Bush Administration waived missile proliferation sanctions on PRC entities involved in nuclear and missile programs in Pakistan and Iran. The State Department raised concerns about proliferation activities in Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Pakistan to China. The House Armed Services Subcommittee required a report on PRC support and activities of Karl Lee, noting China's lack of response. China has made little effort to respond to activities of a PRC national facing U.S. sanctions for missile proliferation in Iran. The U.S. offered a reward for information leading to his arrest and unsealed an indictment against him. Several of his companies were added to U.S. sanction lists. The State Department stated that his activities threatened international stability and security. The United States and China are working closely on nonproliferation despite Lee's activities threatening international stability. U.S. leadership and a credible strategy are needed to address China's rising influence in world affairs. Policy issues focus on summitry, sanctions, and satellite exports. The Clinton Administration advocated for \"comprehensive engagement\" with China to advance U.S. security goals, including weapons nonproliferation. President Clinton granted Jiang Zemin summits in Washington and Beijing in 1997. During Clinton's presidency, he granted Jiang Zemin summits in Washington and Beijing in 1997 and 1998. China implemented regulations on nuclear export controls and joined the Zangger Committee. The 1998 summit in Beijing resulted in agreements on non-targeting nuclear weapons and joint statements on South Asia and biological weapons. China did not join the MTCR but was considering it. President Bush raised missile proliferation concerns in meetings in Shanghai and Beijing in 2001 and 2002. China implemented missile export control regulations in August 2002, modeled on the MTCR, and issued regulations for export controls over dual-use biological agents in October 2002. Despite being called an \"ally\" in the fight against terrorism by President Bush, China approached weapon nonproliferation as more of a U.S.-PRC relationship issue rather than a commitment to international standards. Some observers noted that President Bush did not strongly push China on weapons nonproliferation during his meetings with PRC leaders, despite imposing U.S. sanctions. President Bush did not discuss U.S. sanctions on NORINCO with President Hu Jintao during their meeting in France in 2003. Despite imposing sanctions, Bush did not mention weapons proliferation as an issue with China during their meeting in Thailand in October 2003. President Obama also utilized summitry and joint statements with China, but did not announce any new initiatives. President Obama did not announce significant breakthroughs in meetings with PRC leader Xi Jinping in 2013 and 2014. Despite threats from Iran and North Korea, weapons proliferation was not a top focus in resolving issues with China. In November 2014, the U.S. and China agreed to deepen cooperation on nonproliferation issues. The U.S. interest in PRC weapons proliferation increased after the 9/11 attacks, with a focus on seeking intelligence on Pakistan's nuclear weapons. The United States could seek intelligence from China on Pakistan's nuclear weapons and cooperation to prevent further instability in South Asia. The Administration may consider maintaining or strengthening its response to proliferation issues, including potentially lifting sanctions on China. President Bush's National Strategy to Combat WMD focused on counter-proliferation, nonproliferation, and response, with missile defense playing a critical role in countering the proliferation threat. China has opposed U.S. deployment of missile defense systems and threatened to increase its nuclear missile force. Concerns include spurring an arms race, negating deterrence capabilities, and violating the MTCR. The PRC warned of continuing missile proliferation activities if the U.S. provides missile defense to Taiwan. Top PRC arms control official Sha Zukang warned of withholding cooperation on arms control and nonproliferation in response to U.S. deployment of NMD. The Washington Post reported on the deployment of NMD, while China's proliferation activities and missile buildups continued. President Bush announced the Proliferation Security Initiative in 2003 to enhance multinational efforts in interdiction and intelligence-sharing. China's reluctance to cooperate in counter-proliferation efforts stems from past negative experiences with U.S. inspections and doubts about U.S. intelligence credibility after the Iraq war. China has not joined the PSI and did not attend a meeting with original members and additional countries. Norway, Denmark, Singapore, and Canada joined a meeting in Washington in December 2003, following Premier Wen Jiabao's visit. Despite concerns from China about military interception, there was cooperation with the US in interdiction efforts. The 9/11 Commission urged the US to encourage China to join the Proliferation Security Initiative. In 2004, the 110th Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, urging China to join the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The bill became law on August 3, 2007, emphasizing the need for the US to assist China in strengthening export controls. Testimonies from the Departments of Commerce and State highlighted limited exchanges in this area. After President George H. W. Bush approved the sale of 150 F-16A/B fighters to Taiwan in September 1992, China ended its participation in arms control talks. In November 1992, China delivered 34 M-11 missiles to Pakistan. During the 1998 summit in Beijing, the Clinton White House considered a deal where the US would deny missile defense sales to Taiwan in exchange for China stopping missile sales to Iran, but no agreement was reached. The Far Eastern Economic Review reported that no agreement was reached on arms control talks with China. A PRC Foreign Ministry official criticized the US for selling arms to Taiwan while accusing China of violating commitments. Wen Wei Po linked weapons nonproliferation to US arms sales to Taiwan. Despite challenges, the US sought China's cooperation in international nonproliferation efforts. The US has faced challenges in gaining China's cooperation in international nonproliferation efforts while maintaining its policy towards Taiwan. There have been debates about using satellite exports to incentivize China's cooperation in missile nonproliferation. Since 1988, licenses have been granted to export satellites for launch by China Great Wall Industry Corporation, despite concerns about missile proliferation. In the Clinton Administration, there were discussions about this issue leading up to the 1998 US-PRC summit. The U.S.-PRC summit in 1998 proposed expanding space cooperation, increasing satellite launches, and supporting China's membership in the MTCR in exchange for PRC missile export controls. Sanctions were waived in 2000, but were imposed in 2001 on the China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation for missile technology proliferation to Pakistan. In 2003, sanctions were imposed on NORINCO for missile proliferation, banning satellite exports to China. In 2009, Congress passed the NDAA with Section 1248 requiring a report on satellite export control. The Obama Administration submitted an interim report in 2011. The Obama Administration submitted an interim \"Section 1248 Report\" in 2011, discussing reform of space export control policy. The final report was issued in 2012, recommending moving some satellites and components from the USML to the Commerce Control List. Congress passed the NDAA for FY2013 with Section 1261 to remove satellites from the USML but continued to prohibit transfers to the PRC, DPRK, and state sponsors of terrorism. Policy debates on PRC technology transfers focus on imposing sanctions, tightening legislation, and targeting state-owned defense organizations. Decisions on sanctions impact U.S. credibility on non-proliferation issues, even if transfers don't violate treaties. Laws like the Export-Import Bank Act and Arms Export Control Act guide U.S. nonproliferation policy. The curr_chunk discusses various acts and executive orders related to nonproliferation, including the Iran Nonproliferation Act and the Iran Sanctions Act. There are debates on the effectiveness of sanctions in curbing dangerous PRC sales, with some advocating for a cooperative approach instead. Some argue that current sanctions against the PRC are ineffective in countering proliferation practices, while others believe sanctions are necessary to signal U.S. resolve and credibility. By 2006, Chinese entities under U.S. sanctions sought training to improve export controls, showing the impact of sanctions on their business. The Clinton Administration agreed to waive missile proliferation sanctions on China in 2000, but issues arose due to continued transfers. The United States protested China's non-compliance in 2001, leading to discussions on imposing sanctions. Secretary of State Powell highlighted unresolved issues with China's implementation of the agreement in July 2001. On July 28, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed sanctions on PRC entities for transferring ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, and cruise missiles to Pakistan and Iran. China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation (CMEC) faced sanctions for proliferation of missile technology to Pakistan. The Bush Administration imposed sanctions on China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation (CMEC) for transferring missile technology to Pakistan, leading to a denial of licenses for satellite exports to China. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice urged China to stop honoring contracts signed before November 2000, and in August 2002, China published missile export control regulations. On August 25, 2002, the PRC published missile export control regulations just before Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage arrived in Beijing to discuss ties with the United States. Armitage welcomed the regulations but further discussions were needed. Questions remained about enforcement and reductions in PRC proliferation practices. President Bush did not waive sanctions imposed in September 2001 due to concerns about enforcement and effectiveness of the controls. The regulations raised questions about the roles of MOFTEC and Ministry of Foreign Affairs in controlling missiles and dual-use items for military use. The PRC's regulations on missile-related exports do not have a strong presumption to deny transfers of Category I items or any missiles intended for WMD delivery. Senator Fred Thompson inserted a section in the FY2003 NDAA to require semi-annual reports on foreign entities contributing to weapons proliferation. President Bush stated he would withhold information if it could harm foreign relations, national security, or the Executive Branch's authority. The State Department imposed sanctions on NORINCO for missile proliferation in 2003, banning export licenses and U.S. government contracts for two years. The Bush Administration waived sanctions on imports for national security reasons, despite the \"Helms Amendment\" denying exports of satellites to China. The Bush Administration imposed sanctions on NORINCO in 2003 for missile proliferation, with waivers on import sanctions for national security reasons. Despite no new nonproliferation cooperation from China, by 2006, Chinese entities sought U.S. training to enhance export controls. Sanctioned entities like NORINCO set up Internal Compliance Programs in collaboration with government ministries. In December 2008, NORINCO and CMEC's presidents signed statements on adherence to weapons nonproliferation and export control. However, in July 2011, NORINCO, CPMIEC, and China Xinxing Import and Export Company attempted to sell arms worth $200 million to Libya's Muammar al Qadhafi, despite UNSC sanctions. Options for Congress include maintaining, deleting, or amending the \"Helms Amendment\" to address missile proliferation sanctions. In late 2009 and early 2010, sanctioned PRC entities exported products to U.S. firms or through U.S. ports to other countries. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on CPMIEC Shanghai Pudong Company. Senator Fred Thompson introduced the \"China Nonproliferation Act\" in the 106th Congress, which required annual reviews, sanctions, and the use of the U.S. securities market as a policy tool. In the 107th Congress, Senator Thompson inserted a section in the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization. In the 107th Congress, Senator Thompson added a section to the FY2003 Intelligence Authorization Act requiring annual reports on PRC and foreign companies involved in weapons proliferation and fundraising in U.S. markets. The 108th Congress repealed this reporting requirement in the FY2004 Intelligence Authorization Act. President Reagan signed the U.S.-PRC Agreement for Nuclear Cooperation in 1985, with Congress approving it but requiring certifications and a report on PRC weapons proliferation. President Clinton signed certifications on China's nuclear nonproliferation policy and practices to implement an agreement with the PRC. The agreement aimed to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, particularly to Iran. Additionally, a sanction imposed after the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989 was waived. At the 1998 summit, an agreement on nuclear cooperation was signed between the DOE and the PRC State Planning Commission. This included bringing PRC scientists to U.S. national labs, universities, and nuclear facilities. On February 28, 2005, Westinghouse submitted a bid to sell four AP1000 nuclear power reactors to China with the NRC's approval. The Bush Administration supported the bid, but critics raised proliferation concerns. Representative Bernard Sanders introduced Amendment 381 to prohibit funds from the Export-Import Bank for a nuclear project in China. The House adopted the amendment and passed the bill on June 28, 2005. In June 2005, H.R. 3057 was passed without Section 589. In December 2006, a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Westinghouse. Policy makers have options for nuclear cooperation with China, with a call for cautious monitoring. In 2014, negotiations began for a potential renewal of the nuclear cooperation agreement. In 2014, negotiations began for a potential renewal of the nuclear cooperation agreement with China. Congress may consider whether PRC practices in nuclear proliferation justify continued cooperation in nuclear power. Sanctions could impact U.S. exports, while import controls on products from PRC military entities involved in proliferation are also options. Export controls are seen as a policy tool to leverage U.S. technology in dealings with Beijing. Technology provides leverage with Beijing, focusing on WMD threats. U.S. arms sales to China banned since Tiananmen Crackdown. Efforts include strengthening nonproliferation regimes and encouraging China's participation. China's cooperation tied to desire for great power status and responsible leadership. China's participation in nonproliferation efforts is debated due to concerns about obstruction of export controls, arms control, and ties to Taiwan. Options for U.S. policy include supporting or opposing China joining various international groups. President Clinton's National Security Council proposed a \"China missile deal\" in 1998 to expand space cooperation with Beijing and support China's membership in the MTCR in exchange for effective PRC missile export controls. Critics raised concerns about potential exemptions from sanctions and relaxed export controls for China. Congress passed the FY2000 NDAA, urging the President to seek an agreement on this issue. The NDAA (P.L. 106-65) urged the President to obtain an agreement with China on MTCR adherence and not allow China to join without meeting conditions. China applied to join the MTCR in 2004 but was not accepted. China joined the Zangger Committee in 1997 and issued new export control regulations on dual-use nuclear items in 1998. China's application to join the NSG in 2004 raised concerns due to its nuclear cooperation with Pakistan. The Bush Administration supported China's membership despite debates over its commitment to nonproliferation. The House International Relations Committee questioned whether China should be allowed to join the NSG. The Bush Administration debated supporting China's NSG membership despite concerns about its nuclear cooperation with Pakistan and Iran. Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf testified that China's NSG membership would add multilateral influence on its nuclear technology export policies, but acknowledged Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and the preference for no country to provide benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation to Pakistan. Wolf also noted that the Chashma-2 plant would be under IAEA safeguards, but NSG exempts full-scope safeguards for contracts signed before membership. The Administration did not request Beijing to influence Islamabad for tighter export controls. They had not seen the contract for Chashma-2 or received full information on nuclear cooperation projects with China. The NSG accepted China as a member despite concerns about additional reactors provided to Pakistan. China's grandfathering of Chashma-3 and -4 reactors raised credibility issues for the NSG. China began a nuclear testing moratorium in 1996. China signed the CTBT in 1996 but doubts arose after the US Senate rejected the treaty in 1999. The US sought PRC cooperation on a global ban on fissile materials production. Both countries agreed to work towards a verifiable convention on banning fissile materials. President Obama and President Hu committed to ratifying the CTBT in 2009. The U.S. and China agreed to pursue ratification of the CTBT and support negotiations on the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed to establish a \"Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security\" in China. Congress passed the NDAA for FY2011, limiting funds for setting up a center of excellence outside the former Soviet Union. The Defense Secretary submitted a report with required information, including costs paid by the PRC for activities under the Cooperation Threat Reduction Program and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Program. The NDAA for FY2012 stipulated limits on funds for the U.S.-China Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security until a review of the PRC's capacity and activities was reported to Congress. The NDAA for FY2012 imposed limits on funds for the U.S.-China Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security until Congress received a report on China's missile program. China had the world's most active land-based ballistic and cruise missile program, including the development of an anti-ship ballistic missile. Former Pentagon officials suggested expanding the INF Treaty to include China in response to its missile buildup. The INF Treaty should be expanded to include China in response to its missile buildup, particularly concerning Taiwan and Asian allies."
