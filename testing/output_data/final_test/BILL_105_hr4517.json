    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Habitat Enhancement Act\" and includes findings related to migratory bird habitats. The Congress acknowledges the decline of neotropical migratory bird populations, with 90 North American bird species listed as endangered or threatened. The United States is responsible for maintaining healthy populations of 778 species of migratory nongame birds and 58 species of migratory game birds. Neotropical migratory birds face conservation challenges due to their migration across international borders. Mexico lists 390 bird species as endangered or vulnerable. Healthy bird populations benefit agriculture by controlling insects, preventing economic losses. Conservation efforts need to be established at migration routes and stopover areas. To address the decline of neotropical migratory bird populations, joint efforts of nations and the private sector are needed. Establishing a Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation fund can provide support for projects aimed at protecting critical habitat and promoting conservation partnerships. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation programs, and provide financial resources. The Act defines key terms such as CITES, Commission, and conservation, emphasizing the importance of methods to prevent extinction of neotropical migratory birds. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund is established for conservation efforts, CITES enforcement, community participation in law enforcement, conflict resolution, and community outreach and education. The Secretary of the Interior oversees the Fund.

The Secretary uses funds from the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to provide financial assistance for approved conservation projects. Priority is given to projects proposed by relevant wildlife management authorities, the CITES Secretariat, and other individuals. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund provides financial assistance for conservation projects. Project proposals can be submitted by relevant wildlife management authorities, the CITES Secretariat, or experts in neotropical migratory bird conservation. Proposals must include details such as project leader, objectives, qualifications of team members, estimated funds and time needed, and support from relevant governmental entities. The Secretary reviews project proposals for eligibility, including matching funding sources and necessary information. Within 30 days, the proposal is shared with the Commission for consultation and approval within 6 months. The Secretary, after consulting with the Commission, requests written comments on project proposals from relevant countries, approves or disapproves the proposals, and notifies the submitter, Commission, and countries. Approval criteria include enhancing conservation programs for neotropical migratory birds. The Secretary considers project proposals to develop scientific information on neotropical migratory bird habitat, populations, and threats, as well as promote cooperative projects with other entities. Projects enhancing sustainable conservation programs for long-term bird conservation are prioritized. Recipients of assistance must provide periodic reports on their projects. The project section requires periodic reports to the Secretary and the Commission, including necessary information for evaluating progress. Priority is given to projects with matching funds for approval. SEC. 6. NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION FUND. Establishment of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund in the Treasury's general fund to receive donations and appropriations. The Secretary of the Treasury can use the Fund for assistance without further appropriation, with a limit of 3% for administration. Acceptance and use of donations are allowed. The Secretary can accept donations to provide assistance under section 5, which will be transferred to the Treasury for deposit into the Fund. Authorization of appropriations for the Fund is set at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2002, with funds remaining available until expended."
