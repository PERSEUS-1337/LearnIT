    "content": "U.S. foreign assistance is carried out by various federal government agencies including the State Department, USAID, and the Department of Defense. Presidential initiatives like the LIFE Initiative and PEPFAR have expanded foreign aid efforts. In 2007, the Department of Defense disbursed about 60% of U.S. foreign assistance. More than 20 U.S. government agencies, including the Department of State, are responsible for 10% of foreign aid spending. There is a lack of coordination in foreign assistance activities, with proposals for reform in Congress to address this issue. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aims to improve coordination and reduce redundancy in foreign assistance efforts. The report discusses the need to maximize coordination, minimize redundancy, and advocate for increased resources in foreign assistance reform. It highlights the involvement of multiple agencies in U.S. foreign aid programs and the coordination mechanisms in place. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorized the consolidation of foreign assistance programs under USAID and emphasized utilizing expertise from various federal agencies for technical assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 emphasized coordination of foreign aid programs under USAID, with the Department of State tasked with overseeing economic and military assistance. However, new aid programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Peace Corps operate outside State Department authority. The Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Peace Corps are independent aid agencies, along with other federal agencies providing foreign assistance. Examples include USDA's technical assistance on food safety, DOI's multinational species conservation, and HHS's CDC activities to fight diseases globally. Recent trends show increased U.S. foreign assistance spending, raising concerns about aid fragmentation and the need for better coordination. Foreign assistance disbursements in current dollars have significantly increased since the September 11, 2001 attacks, reaching over $45 billion in FY2007. The number of federal agencies involved in foreign aid has also grown, with various agencies reporting aid expenditures between FY2001 and FY2007. Growth rates varied among agencies during this period. Between FY2001 and FY2007, foreign assistance disbursements increased significantly, with DOD aid levels rising over 500% to $27 billion, mainly due to military assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. HHS also saw a substantial increase in disbursements, from $96 million to $1.77 billion by FY2005, driven by PEPFAR and responses to various health crises. State and USAID disbursements increased at a slower rate during the same period. In FY2001 to FY2007, foreign assistance disbursements increased significantly. DOD aid levels rose over 500% to $27 billion, driven by military assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. State and USAID disbursements increased at a slower rate, with USAID's portion dropping to 23% and DOD's doubling to 60% by FY2007. Peace Corps was an exception, with disbursements falling below FY2001 levels. The increasing portion of assistance disbursed by U.S. military entities since FY2002 can be largely attributed to dramatic increases in military and reconstruction assistance associated with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Excluding funding to these two countries more than doubles the share of aid disbursed by State, from 11% to 25%, and gives DOD the third largest share, after USAID and State. Much of the funding disbursed by DOD is military assistance, for which State plays a key role in allocation. Outside of spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, the trend towards greater DOD involvement in foreign assistance has raised widespread concerns. Figure 2 shows that DOD's share of foreign aid disbursement in FY2007 was 21%, down from 29% in FY2001. However, there was a 369% increase in DOD non-military assistance disbursements between FY2001 and FY2007, making DOD a significant player in development assistance. With the decline in Iraq Relief & Reconstruction Funds and the Iraq Security Forces Fund, DOD's portion of foreign assistance disbursements is expected to decrease in FY2008 and FY2009. Concerns have been raised about potential duplication of efforts among different agencies administering foreign aid. Critics argue that the decentralized U.S. aid structure leads to inefficiency and confusion, with 15 U.S. agencies in Afghanistan working independently in the energy sector. Each agency has its own rules and procedures, creating a burden on recipient countries. In Mozambique, different U.S. agencies with conflicting rules cause problems and confusion for implementing partners. Foreign aid programs in Mozambique, including PEPFAR, are implemented by five U.S. agencies, leading to faulty communication. Some argue that coordination is necessary for aid effectiveness, while others believe decentralization allows for better understanding of specific programs. Some experts debate the effectiveness of administering aid through multiple domestic agencies versus a consolidated aid agency. USAID is the primary agency for long-term development assistance programs, including child health, education, and micro-enterprise programs. For more details on specific foreign assistance programs, refer to CRS Report R40213. USAID implements various programs including disaster relief, education, and micro-enterprise programs, as well as democracy promotion and post-conflict stabilization activities. It also handles strategic economic assistance funded through the State Department, focusing on foreign policy objectives. Foreign assistance activities, including refugee assistance, democracy promotion, post-conflict stabilization, international narcotics control, and economic assistance to strategic allies, are overseen by the State Department to align with U.S. foreign policy priorities. State Department allocates economic assistance through USAID and military assistance through the Department of Defense, ensuring coordination with other agencies for implementation. The Department of Defense (DOD) provides foreign assistance through security assistance accounts for weapons, training, and support for peacekeeping operations. DOD also offers humanitarian and economic aid, including health care, reconstruction, and food aid, often in conjunction with military operations to establish local support or address humanitarian needs in crisis situations. The U.S. military provides a wide range of assistance in crisis situations using funds from the Iraq Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Fund (IRRF) and security assistance accounts for Iraq and Afghanistan. However, this assistance is expected to decline as funds are spent. For more details on DOD foreign assistance activities, refer to CRS Report RL34639. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also provides international assistance related to disease control, global health, and research through the Centers for Disease Control. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides international assistance for disease control, global health, and research through the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health, as well as refugee assistance. HHS has expanded its foreign assistance with programs like PEPFAR, tuberculosis and malaria eradication, and disease outbreak responses. HHS implements global health research and surveillance programs using its own funds. The Department of Agriculture funds food aid programs administered by USAID. The USDA administers food assistance programs for overseas school food programs and maternal, child, and infant nutrition programs. The Treasury is responsible for U.S. contributions to multilateral development organizations, focusing on long-term development. The Treasury provides technical assistance to developing countries on economic reforms and debt relief, similar to USAID and MCC activities. MCC, established in 2004, focuses on targeted aid for economic growth and poverty alleviation in countries with good governance. MCC funds large grants based on government performance indicators, with a focus on infrastructure improvements. Host governments lead in designing and implementing compact agreements with MCC support, aligning projects with country priorities. USAID programs are typically carried out by U.S. contractors, while MCC's \"threshold\" program assists countries not yet eligible for compacts. The Peace Corps, established in 1961, sends American volunteers to developing countries for various community-based projects, promoting education, economic development, healthcare access, environmental restoration, and agricultural productivity. Peace Corps projects, though similar to USAID efforts, have unique objectives. The Peace Corps, established in 1961, sends American volunteers to developing countries for community-based projects promoting education, economic development, healthcare access, environmental restoration, and agricultural productivity. While USAID programs are typically carried out by U.S. contractors, the Peace Corps has unique objectives related to promoting cross-cultural understanding and goodwill through personal contact with volunteers. Additionally, other federal departments and agencies disburse funds for foreign assistance activities related to their expertise, such as the Environmental Protection Agency providing technical assistance for international environmental management and the Department of Energy assisting with nuclear non-proliferation. The Department of Energy, Department of Labor, Department of Justice, African Development Foundation, Inter-American Foundation, Export-Import Bank, Department of Commerce, and U.S. Institute of Peace all provide various forms of assistance to foreign countries. This includes nuclear non-proliferation efforts, child labor reduction programs, HIV/AIDS awareness, training on identity theft and cybercrime, small grants to community organizations, loan guarantees for trade credits, technical assistance on commercial law development, and promoting international peace through educational programs and conferences. The U.S. Institute of Peace promotes international peace through various programs and the Department of Homeland Security provides technical assistance on customs enforcement. Appendix A lists agencies reporting foreign assistance disbursements from FY2001 to FY2007. Most foreign assistance funding is appropriated through the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. Coordination of policy and implementation in the field lacks a single overarching mechanism. The U.S. lacks a single overarching mechanism for coordinating foreign assistance policies and programs. Various coordination systems exist, including National Security Council policy committees and inter-agency staff exchanges. Extensive coordination mechanisms are established in high-priority situations like reconstruction in Iraq. The National Security Council's policy coordination committees play a key role in government policy coordination. The Obama Administration renamed the International Development and Humanitarian Assistance PCC to the \"Interagency Policy Committee for Development (Development IPC).\" It is co-chaired by NSC Director Gayle Smith and USAID Acting Administrator Alonzo Fulgham, focusing on aid effectiveness, economic growth, investing in people, public-private partnerships, and public diplomacy. Various informal Sub-PCCs within the Development PCC were created under the Bush Administration as needed, such as the Investing in People Sub-PCC for collaboration on water and health issues. The Civilian-Military Cooperation Sub-PCC was established in 2008 to coordinate foreign assistance activities among Department of Defense and civilian agencies. Lack of overarching authority limits effective coordination, with agencies protecting their own authority and funding. Disputes are resolved at lower levels to avoid being overruled by superiors. Obama Administration has yet to determine if new subcommittees will be established. In 2006, the Bush Administration created the Director of Foreign Assistance (DFA) position to increase coherence of foreign aid programs. The DFA coordinated U.S. assistance programs, aligning them with American strategic objectives and transforming recipient countries' economic development paths. Until January 2009, the DFA also served as the Administrator of USAID. The DFA has authority over most State and USAID programs, providing guidance to other agencies managing foreign aid activities. However, major programs like the Millennium Challenge Corporation and OGAC are outside its authority. Analysts believe the DFA controls too small a portion of foreign aid to effectively coordinate development assistance programs. State Department and USAID disbursements represent only about 30% of total U.S. foreign assistance in 2007. The FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 budget requests were jointly developed by State Department and USAID teams to improve coordination and coherence in foreign assistance programs. The F Bureau's guidance on operational plans requires describing how other U.S. government agencies are contributing to foreign assistance goals. However, some agencies feel this coordination adds unnecessary work. State and USAID officials feel that the F structure prioritizes decision making in Washington over their role in policy formulation and priority setting. To support the F Process, a new data information system called FACTS was developed in December 2006. FACTS collects foreign assistance and planning data, but currently only details programs under the authority of DFA. Another system, FACTS Info, was deployed in October 2008 to analyze and report data on U.S. foreign assistance programs, currently used only by State and USAID. The FACTS Info system aims to include data from all agencies involved in foreign assistance, but faces challenges due to different procedures. DFA is negotiating for cooperation by asking agencies to submit past assistance data for entry into the database. This move is intended to align past resources and activities, creating a more comprehensive historic data on U.S. foreign assistance activities by country. The F Bureau has implemented a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) pilot program to coordinate assistance at the country level. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) pilot program aims to improve strategic planning for State and USAID programs at the country level. Agencies in 10 pilot countries are developing a 15-page CAS document outlining U.S. foreign assistance goals for a five-year period. Draft strategies for all countries were submitted by January 2009, with nine approved and one under review as of July 2009. The Department of State plans to conduct an after-action review to identify best practices for future assistance coordination. No timeline has been set for implementing CAS worldwide. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) pilot program aims to improve strategic planning for State and USAID programs at the country level. Agencies in 10 pilot countries are developing a 15-page CAS document outlining U.S. foreign assistance goals for a five-year period. The Assistance for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia account (AEECA) was created in 2009 by combining the Freedom Support Act (FSA) and Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) regional aid programs. The Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia oversees AEECA, ensuring consistency with U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Coordinator focuses on establishing credible economic and democratic reform measures and linking performance data with budget planning. The Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia oversees reform measures, performance data, and budget planning for U.S. assistance programs in the region. Observers suggest establishing similar coordinators in other regions, but critics may see it as adding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Office of the Global Aids Coordinator could serve as a model for cross-agency coordination. The U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator oversees coordination among government agencies and international organizations to combat HIV/AIDS in PEPFAR focus countries. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization was created to improve crisis response in failed states. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) was created to lead, coordinate, and institutionalize U.S. Government civilian capacity for post-conflict situations. It implements National Security Presidential Directive 44 to coordinate the government response in post-conflict environments. However, S/CRS has faced challenges such as insufficient resources, borrowed personnel, and dependence on Department of Defense funding. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) was created to lead and coordinate U.S. Government civilian capacity for post-conflict situations. It has faced challenges such as insufficient resources and dependence on Department of Defense funding. Concerns have been raised about overemphasizing the military's role in post-conflict reconstruction, with the Obama Administration requesting $323 million for the State Department in FY2010 to address these concerns. In recent years, State and USAID have improved coordination with the Department of Defense through the creation of an Office of Military Affairs in 2005. This formal structure includes military liaison officers from Combatant Commands and the Special Operations Command assigned to USAID, and senior USAID development officials assigned to the Commands and the Pentagon. Some are concerned about the perceived militarization of foreign aid, while others argue that this coordination ensures development officials have a voice in assistance activities. The Department of Defense plays a role in foreign assistance by training and equipping foreign military and maritime security forces, primarily for counterterrorism support. Coordination between State and DOD is required for these programs, serving as a potential model for other assistance programs and agencies. The review process for foreign assistance programs involves approval from both DOD and Department of State officials, with input from U.S. embassies and military commands. More than 20 nations provided official development assistance in 2007, with the United States accounting for 18.5% of the total value. Many nations contribute a higher percentage of their gross domestic income to foreign aid. The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) is considered one of the most efficient aid agencies globally, with broad authority over development policy. Critics argue that the DFID model may not be suitable for U.S. development programs due to its singular focus on poverty alleviation. The UK's Department for International Development (DFID) has a singular focus on poverty alleviation, which has led to improved recruitment of high-quality personnel. Since its creation in 1997, DFID has decentralized aid management, giving field offices more authority and strengthening relationships with host countries. This model could be of interest to U.S. policymakers looking to rebuild USAID's manpower as part of foreign aid reform. Germany has a Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development independent of the Federal Foreign Office, responsible for policy development. Implementation is done through two separate organizations. The Netherlands and Denmark integrate foreign assistance programs into their ministries of foreign affairs. The Policy Coherence Unit was established in 2002 to contribute to policy formation in non-development fields and address policy incoherence. An example of its work is the Memorandum on Coherence Between Agricultural and Development Policy signed in 2002. The Netherlands also created a Homogeneous Budget for International Cooperation in 1995 to ensure all foreign assistance is part of the same planning framework. France and Japan have decentralized foreign assistance structures, with France creating a new system in 1998. France established the Inter-Ministerial Committee for International Co-operation and Development (CICID) in 1998 to coordinate its international development programs. Japan manages coordination through a Council of Overseas Economic Cooperation, while Canada uses two sub-cabinet level agencies for bilateral assistance. The U.S. foreign aid system lacks formal inter-agency coordination, unlike other countries such as France, Japan, and Canada. Various proposals have been made to improve the coherence and coordination of U.S. foreign aid, including legislative actions and executive branch reforms. Many analysts believe that current U.S. foreign assistance activities cannot be effectively coordinated or consolidated. Many experts believe that a modern national foreign assistance strategy is essential for effectively coordinating U.S. foreign aid activities. The lack of a national strategy has led to incoherent development policies and aid programs. Several bills in Congress aim to address this issue, while Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review to establish clear national objectives for diplomacy and development. Some experts suggest a single foreign assistance entity to improve coordination and effectiveness of American foreign aid. Options include designating USAID or the State Department as the lead agency for coordinating all foreign aid. This could strengthen development programs alongside diplomacy and defense. With USAID still led by an Acting Administrator many months into the Obama Administration, development advocates are concerned about the lack of leadership. Congress could establish a new cabinet-level foreign assistance department, like the UK, to improve coordination of aid programs. Experts emphasize the need for authority to enforce coordination across federal agencies to overcome resistance. The idea of a White House/NSC committee representing all primary departments is also being considered. President establishing a White House/NSC committee to oversee aid activities, with greater authority than the existing NSC IPC. The committee would coordinate aid efforts across departments and agencies, creating a national strategy. Maintaining this committee would improve interagency communication and policy review. A quadrennial international development review, similar to the Quadrennial Defense Review, could be conducted under the direction of the USAID Administrator. Congress could mandate this review and other coordination mechanisms. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 calls for a quadrennial review of diplomacy and development programs. Secretary of State Clinton also plans to implement a quadrennial review. U.S. foreign aid is used for diplomatic and development purposes, dating back to the Marshall Plan. Challenges arise when aid allocation conflicts with development goals. Aid effectiveness is hindered by unclear aid purposes. Critics often blame USAID for development failures, damaging its reputation and morale. Observers suggest the U.K's success is due to a focus on poverty reduction. A realignment separating long-term development programs from those driven by diplomatic and security priorities could improve clarity, coordination, and evaluation of effectiveness. The effectiveness of foreign aid programs can be better evaluated if the use of aid for U.S. national security is more transparent. The distinction between strategic and development aid is often unclear, as assistance to key allies for strategic purposes may overlap with traditional development projects. Some experts argue that separating development assistance from security rationale could reduce political support for essential development programs. Consolidating authority in Washington may improve coordination of foreign assistance, but there are differing opinions on the emphasis that should be placed on this. Some argue for greater coordination of foreign assistance at the country level, giving more authority to Ambassadors. In embassies without an Ambassador, coordination efforts were more difficult. Senate may address aid coordination during ambassadorial confirmation. One way to improve county-level coordination of aid is to support the CAS program with a timeline for evaluation and a plan for global deployment. Centralizing reporting requirements to USAID could also enhance aid coordination among agencies involved in foreign assistance. Congress could mandate uniform reporting of foreign assistance activities by all agencies to a central office for public access, potentially reducing administrative burdens and improving coordination among agencies. A proposal for a common mechanism for program review in U.S. foreign assistance suggests auditing all programs by the USAID Inspector General, as outlined in the Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act. This approach aims to ensure consistent evaluation of programs across agencies, similar to the model of the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction. In the 111th Congress, foreign assistance reform proposals have been introduced in both the House and Senate. H.R. 2139, the Initiating Foreign Assistance Reform Act of 2009, directs the President to develop a National Strategy for Global Development. Critics argue that a cross-agency auditing requirement could increase bureaucracy and divert funds from program implementation. The National Strategy for Global Development, outlined in H.R. 2410, aims to coordinate U.S. government departments and agencies in implementing global development policies and programs to reduce poverty and promote economic growth. The bill emphasizes interagency coordination and collaboration with international organizations and host country governments. The Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009, introduced by Chairman Berman in 2009, requires the President to establish a national strategy for U.S. diplomacy and development by 2010. It also mandates a Quadrennial Review of Diplomacy and Development. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2009 to coordinate efforts and update programs. The Foreign Assistance Revitalization and Accountability Act of 2009, introduced by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry and Ranking Member Richard Lugar, aims to establish an Independent Evaluation and Research Innovation Group for Foreign Assistance to improve coordination of foreign assistance programs by Federal agencies."
