    "content": "The dispute in Kingdomware revolves around the interpretation of Section 8127(d) of Title 38 of the United States Code, specifically regarding the \"Rule of Two\" for contracting with SDVOSBs and VOSBs. The \"Rule of Two\" focuses on contracting with at least two small businesses. VA believes Section 8127(d) doesn't require set-asides for VOSBs when using Federal Supply Schedules. Many VOSBs challenge VA's interpretation that set-asides are not required for Federal Supply Schedule orders, citing Section 8127(d) which uses the word \"shall\" for VOSB set-asides. The word \"shall\" is seen as a command, obligating agencies to set aside contracts for small businesses. The interpretation of Section 8127(d) regarding VOSB set-asides for VA contracts is being debated, with VOSBs arguing for mandatory set-asides. Various principles of statutory interpretation are being used to determine Congress's intent in enacting the legislation. Kingdomware Technologies challenged VA's interpretation of Section 8127(d) by filing a bid protest with the GAO in 2012. GAO ruled in favor of Kingdomware, stating that VA must set aside contracts for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is satisfied. GAO ruled in favor of Kingdomware, stating that VA must set aside contracts for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is satisfied, rejecting VA's argument that purchases through the FSS can be made as long as goals are met. The GAO recommended that VA conduct market research to determine if the procurement could be set aside for VOSBs, but VA declined to follow the recommendation. Kingdomware filed a bid protest with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which disagreed with the GAO's interpretation of the law. The court found that VA's interpretation of the relationship between FSS purchases and VOSB set-asides in the 2009 regulations was permissible, despite some ambiguity. The court gave deference to VA's consistent and uniform approach over time, as Congress had not directly addressed the issue, leaving a gap for VA to fill. The court affirmed VA's interpretation of the relationship between FSS purchases and VOSB set-asides, stating that Congress had not directly addressed the issue, allowing VA to fill the gap. The Federal Circuit viewed Section 8127(d) as requiring VA to use contracts set aside for VOSBs only to meet its annual goals for VOSB contract dollars. The majority's view is that VA is not obligated to set aside contracts for VOSBs unless specific criteria are met, as it would contradict Congress's discretion in setting goals. One judge dissented, arguing that VA is required to set aside contracts for small businesses when certain conditions are met. The dissenting judge disagreed with the majority's interpretation of VA's obligations under Section 8127(d), arguing that the language regarding \"for purposes of meeting [VA's goals]\" does not limit VA's obligations. Kingdomware sought a rehearing, which was denied by the Federal Circuit, leading to a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. The case was initially scheduled for oral arguments but was removed from the calendar for further briefing on mootness. Both parties argued that the case was not moot. The Supreme Court rescheduled oral arguments in the Kingdomware case for February 22, 2016, after both parties argued that the case was not moot. Kingdomware and its amici, including 41 Members of Congress, maintain that VA is required to set aside contracts for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is satisfied because Section 8127(d) uses mandatory language. They argue that the reference to set-asides being \"[f]or purposes of meeting\" VA's goals is prefatory and does not limit VA's obligations. Kingdomware and its supporters argue that prefatory language in VA regulations does not limit the requirement for set-asides for small businesses under Section 8127(d). They believe that ambiguous statutes involving veterans' benefits should be interpreted in favor of veterans, citing statutory and legislative history. The 1999, 2003, and 2006 acts, along with the legislative history of the 2006 act, support the argument for set-asides for small businesses. The government's stance on VA's interpretation of Section 8127(d) differs from previous filings, maintaining that VA's view is entitled to Chevron deference. The government argues that VA's regulations state that purchases through the FSS are not subject to set-asides for small businesses. They claim that Section 8127(d) only applies to new contracts, not orders under existing contracts like FSS contracts. Requiring contracts to be set aside for VOSBs whenever the Rule of Two is satisfied would create practical difficulties for VA and render other provisions of Section 8127 superfluous. The government argues that Section 8127(d) does not require set-asides for small businesses on FSS orders, citing practical difficulties for VA. They believe the principle of construing statutes in veterans' favor does not apply here. The Supreme Court's Kingdomware decision could clarify the interpretation of Section 8127(d) and its implications. The Supreme Court's Kingdomware decision could have practical implications for VA procurements and VOSBs seeking contracts through FSS set-asides. The case involves statutory interpretation principles like plain meaning, deference to agency interpretations, and legislative history. The Court's opinion may elaborate on these principles. The Court could elaborate on the principle regarding prefatory material in the Kingdomware case, where the interpretation of Section 8127(d) is debated. Kingdomware argues that the \"for purposes of\" language is prefatory and does not change VA's obligations for set-asides for small businesses. The Court could clarify the distinction between prefatory and operative language in Section 8127(d) regarding muzzling dogs for rabies control. The government initially argued that the language about \"goals\" in Section 8127(d) is operative, but later abandoned this argument. The Court may also address the application of statutory interpretation principles if Section 8127(d) is deemed ambiguous. The Court may address the application of statutory interpretation principles regarding construction in favor of veterans in the Kingdomware case. Kingdomware argues that VA should set aside contracts for VOSBs when the Rule of Two is met, while the government contends that the principle does not apply as the statute does not involve veterans' benefits. The Court may address the degree of deference to be given to VA's interpretation of Section 8127(d) in the Kingdomware case. Both Kingdomware and the government have argued that any deference to VA's view should be limited due to the way VA presented its interpretation in the 2009 regulations. The government argues that VA's interpretation in the regulations should be given Chevron deference, as it is set forth in the regulations themselves, specifically in their placement and numbering. This interpretation relates to purchases through the FSS under Part 8 of the FAR not being subject to small business set-aside requirements in Part 19 of the FAR. The government argues that VA's regulations implementing 8127(d) in Parts 808 and 819 of the VAAR suggest that Section 8127(d) does not apply to purchases through the FSS. If the Court adopts this argument, it could have broad implications for procurement practices. The Supreme Court's decision in Kingdomware may impact VA's procurement processes and opportunities for VOSBs. The exact effects will depend on the Court's ruling and VA's response. The VA's procurement processes and spending, including through the FSS, may need to consider set-asides for VOSBs. This would require market research to determine if the Rule of Two could be satisfied for each procurement. Historically, VA may not have been actively seeking VOSBs before making purchases through the FSS. Using a small business set-aside for purchases formerly made through the FSS would require additional work by VA personnel, including market research and processing applications from vendors seeking certification as VOSBs. Market research is crucial for acquisition planning to analyze capabilities in the market to meet agency needs. Market research techniques in the FAR include contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry, reviewing recent market research results, publishing formal requests for information, querying databases for relevant information, participating in online communication, and obtaining source lists from other contracting activities. Market research techniques in the FAR involve obtaining source lists from other contracting activities or agencies, reviewing product literature, conducting presolicitation conferences, and utilizing various resources such as FPDS-NG, FedBizOpps, GSA's FSS website, and VA's OSDBU. The VAAR regulation requires staff to use the VIP database for market research, along with other information, to determine if offers can be expected from VOSBs. Factors affecting VA's workload include maintaining a database of certified VOSBs, with 1,971 VOSBs as of February 3, 2016. The VA's database contains 1,971 certified VOSBs. Canvassing businesses in the database could save time in procurements, but including non-certified VOSBs may increase Rule of Two compliance. VOSBs must be certified by VA for set-asides. Requiring set-asides for VOSBs could incentivize non-certified VOSBs to seek certification, increasing the pool of eligible businesses. The addition of newly certified VOSBs would expand the pool of eligible businesses for set-asides. GSA has 37 schedules offering various goods and services. Requiring set-asides for VOSBs could incentivize non-certified VOSBs to seek certification, potentially impacting VA and GSA-administered schedules. The VA's acquisition workforce may not have the capability to handle the increased workload efficiently. Reports indicate a shortage of trained acquisition personnel, hindering agencies from managing complex and expensive acquisition programs and contracts. Both GAO and VA's Office of Inspector General have found evidence of inadequate staffing and training for contract monitoring within the department. The VA's acquisition workforce may lack the capacity to handle increased workload efficiently due to a shortage of trained personnel. Reports show a significant number of vacant positions for contract monitoring within the department, raising concerns about their ability to manage a potential increase in workload. Additionally, a requirement for VA to make purchases through contracts set aside for VOSBs could incentivize non-certified VOSBs to seek certification, leading to a higher verification workload for the agency. The verification process for a VOSB is rigorous and time-consuming, confirming the veteran owner's ownership, management role, experience, and company registration. Documents like financial statements and tax records are required for the application. In FY2015, VA accounted for $19.9 billion of the executive branch's procurement spending, placing it among the top five agencies. Small businesses received $6.3 billion, while other-than-small businesses received $13.6 billion. Approximately $3.4 billion was spent on purchases. In FY2015, VA accounted for $19.9 billion of the executive branch's procurement spending, with $3.4 billion spent through the FSS. VA uses its own FSS contracts and GSA's FSS contracts for procurement. VOSBs are among the vendors awarded FSS contracts, but not all VOSBs have FSS contracts. Only vendors with FSS contracts are eligible for orders placed under them. Section 8127 aims to increase opportunities for VOSBs and SDVOSBs to contract with VA by setting annual goals for contract dollars awarded to them and using specific procedures for awards. This could shift purchases to VOSBs or change which VOSBs perform work for VA, but the overall goal is to increase contracting opportunities for VOSBs and SDVOSBs. The VA's prime contracting goals for VOSBs and SDVOSBs in FY2014 and FY2015 were 12.0% and 10.0% respectively, which were exceeded. Any increase in VA contract dollars with these businesses would reflect in meeting these goals."
