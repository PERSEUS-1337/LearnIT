    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fiscal Accountability and Transparency in Infrastructure Spending Act of 2011\". It includes definitions for various terms used in the Act. The Act defines key terms such as \"agency,\" \"alternate infrastructure type bidding,\" and \"life-cycle cost analysis.\" The term \"major infrastructure projects\" refers to various construction projects with a total Federal cost of at least $5,000,000, including highways, transit, rail, airports, and military projects. The \"Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide\" is a software and guide developed for pavement design. The pavement design guide and software, developed for major infrastructure projects, provide a uniform basis for designing flexible, rigid, and composite pavements using mechanistic-empirical approaches. SEC. 3. LIFE-CYCLE COST ANALYSIS. Each agency must obtain a life-cycle cost analysis for major infrastructure projects before using funds, based on standards developed by the Office of Management and Budget. The analysis can be obtained from State or local governments, or private sector entities. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will issue guidance within 6 months of the Act's enactment to help agencies implement these requirements. The Director must develop a circular for infrastructure projects, providing public notice and considering specific principles. Any analysis obtained must cover a 50-year period and use actual cost data. Life-cycle analysis transparency is required for agencies. Life-cycle analysis obtained by an agency must be posted on the agency's website within 72 hours. The Act allows for flexibility in awarding contracts for infrastructure projects on the National Highway System and other major infrastructure programs through alternate bidding procedures. Additionally, it mandates the use of the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide for initial design phases of projects authorized under title 23, United States Code."
