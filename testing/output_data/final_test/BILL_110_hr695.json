Individual taxpayers trust the IRS to handle their sensitive information responsibly, but there are concerns about potential misuse by private collection agencies. The \"Taxpayer Abuse and Harassment Prevention Act of 2007\" aims to protect taxpayer information from unauthorized disclosure to private collection agencies. More than 26 million Americans have been victims of identity theft through misuse of personal information. Disclosure of taxpayer information to third-party vendors increases the risk of identity theft, as the IRS has shown an inability to protect taxpayer data under existing contracts. The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 prohibits IRS employees from being evaluated based on collections to prevent abusive tactics. Private tax collection agencies can receive up to 25% recovery fee, leading to aggressive tactics. Congress previously canceled a pilot program due to violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and loss of $17 million. A 2002 report by the IRS Commissioner identified an additional $30 billion in taxes owed annually that could be collected with increased funding for IRS personnel. Earmarking $300 million for specific IRS collection functions could result in a $9 billion annual revenue increase, with a return of $30 for every $1 spent. Private collection agencies were seen as a new tool by the IRS Commissioner, but their use could actually lead to increased costs for taxpayers.
