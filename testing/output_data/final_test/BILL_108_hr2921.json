    "content": "The Act titled \"Genetically Engineered Pharmaceutical and Industrial Crop Safety Act of 2003\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that pharmaceutical and industrial crops are genetically engineered plants used to produce medical or industrial products. The Department of Agriculture has issued permits for 10 food crops genetically engineered for biopharmaceuticals. Over 300 field trials have been conducted in the US, with corn being the most tested crop. Other crops include soybean, tobacco, rice, and wheat. Many novel substances produced in pharmaceutical and industrial crops have high biological activity for specific medical or industrial purposes. These substances are not meant for food or environmental use. Risks from these crops depend on factors like chemicals, exposure levels, and duration. Contamination by untested bioactive nonfood substances is a major concern for human, animal, and environmental health. Pharmaceutical and industrial crops pose significant risks to the food supply chain, including liability for contamination, costly recalls, market losses, reduced prices, and loss of confidence among foreign importers and consumers. This necessitates a zero tolerance standard for these crops. The Department of Agriculture and experts acknowledge the inevitability of contamination in human food and animal feed by pharmaceutical and industrial crops. Regulations focus on mitigating gene flow rather than prevention, with some experts suggesting the establishment of tolerances despite potential risks. Regulations are urgently needed to prevent pharmaceutical and industrial crops and their byproducts from contaminating human food or animal feed. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"genetically engineered plant\" as a plant containing genetically engineered material or produced from a genetically engineered seed. \"Genetically engineered material\" refers to material altered at the molecular or cellular level by techniques not possible under natural conditions. The term \"genetically engineered seed\" refers to a seed containing genetically engineered material or produced with it, achieved through methods other than traditional breeding or natural processes. The term \"pharmaceutical crop\" refers to genetically engineered plants designed to produce medical products, while \"industrial crop\" refers to plants designed to produce industrial products. This includes crops intentionally treated with genetically engineered material to produce specific substances. Regulation of production of pharmaceutical and industrial crops. Regulations prohibit the cultivation of pharmaceutical and industrial crops until final regulations are in place. Open-air cultivation and use in common human foods or animal feeds are also prohibited. The USDA will establish a tracking system to regulate the growing, handling, transportation, and disposal of these crops to prevent contamination. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue regulations. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue regulations to enforce prohibitions on cultivating pharmaceutical and industrial crops, designate prohibited common foods, and establish a tracking system. SEC. 5. CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION. The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to assess civil penalties against those who violate section 5, with each violation treated as a separate offense. The maximum penalty for a violation is $1,000,000, taking into account factors such as the gravity of the violation, culpability, business size, and past offenses. The Secretary must provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing before assessing a penalty. The Secretary can assess civil penalties for violations under section 5, with each violation considered separately and a maximum penalty of $1,000,000. The person has the right to a hearing before the penalty is imposed, and can seek judicial review within 30 days of the order. The Secretary can assess civil penalties for violations under section 5, with each violation considered separately and a maximum penalty of $1,000,000. If a person fails to pay a civil penalty, the matter will be referred to the Attorney General for collection action in United States district court. The validity and appropriateness of the penalty imposed by the Secretary cannot be reviewed in the collection action. The National Academy of Sciences will report to Congress on alternative methods for producing pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals in controlled facilities to avoid contamination risks."
