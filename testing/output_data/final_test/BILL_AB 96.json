    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts laws to protect elephants and rhinoceroses from illegal poaching and wildlife trafficking, in response to the worldwide concern for these iconic species. The legislation aims to strengthen existing laws at the international, federal, and state levels to prevent cruelty and extinction of these animals. California has prohibited the ivory trade since 1977, but a loophole has allowed illegal sales to thrive in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A new section is added to the Fish and Game Code defining terms for educational or scientific institutions involved in the trade. The new section added to the Fish and Game Code defines terms related to ivory and rhinoceros horn, including their sale and total value. It is illegal to purchase, sell, possess with intent to sell, or import with intent to sell ivory or rhinoceros horn, except for specific exemptions such as law enforcement activities, authorized permits, or musical instruments with historical documentation. Exemptions for ivory and rhinoceros horn include antique items less than 5% of the volume, with historical documentation proving they are at least 100 years old, and for educational or scientific purposes by institutions if legally acquired before January 1, 1991, and not transferred for profit after July 1, 2016. Possession of ivory or rhinoceros horn in a retail or wholesale outlet is evidence of intent to sell. Criminal penalties for violations include fines ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to 30 days for a first conviction with a total value of $250 or less. For a first conviction with ivory or rhinoceros horn valued over $250, the offense is a misdemeanor with a fine of $5,000 to $40,000, or up to one year in jail. For a second offense or subsequent convictions with ivory or rhinoceros horn valued at $250 or less, the penalty remains the same. For a second or subsequent conviction with ivory or rhinoceros horn valued over $250, the offense is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $10,000 to $50,000 or two times the total value of the ivory or rhinoceros horn, imprisonment for up to one year, or both. An additional administrative penalty of up to $10,000 may also be imposed. The chief of enforcement issues a complaint alleging a violation, relevant facts, and proposed penalty amount for administrative civil penalties. The complaint and order is served by personal notice or certified mail, informing the party of the right to request a hearing within 20 days. If no hearing is requested, the order imposing the administrative penalty becomes final. The director controls the hearing proceedings, which are informal and not bound by strict evidence rules. A final order must be issued within 45 days, served by certified mail. Judicial review can be sought within 30 days. Administrative penalties are due within 60 days after judicial review or 20 days after the order becomes final. (g) Court may pay half of fine, up to $500, to informant leading to conviction. Informant cannot be law enforcement. (h) Seized ivory or rhinoceros horn forfeited upon conviction, can be used for education, donated, or destroyed. (i) Penalties collected deposited in Fish and Game Preservation Fund for law enforcement. Section 5 of Chapter 692 of the Statutes of 1976 is repealed. The provisions of this act are severable. No reimbursement is required by this act. This act shall become operative on July 1, 2016."
