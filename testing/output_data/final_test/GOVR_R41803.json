    "content": "Interagency coordinative arrangements and activities are increasing in number and prominence across various policy areas due to the rise in governmental responsibilities, complex programs, and the need for better crisis response. This report examines formal collaborative efforts among federal agencies to enhance joint cooperation and address shared responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) study explores various types of collaborative activities and interagency coordination, including integration, mergers, networking, and partnerships. It addresses the rationales for interagency collaboration, challenges in assessing success, and factors influencing collaborative activities. The study builds on a collection of materials covering different aspects of interagency collaboration, past and present. Interagency collaboration involves various types of activities and arrangements among agencies, as studied by congressional committees, CRS, executive branch entities, GAO, commissions, associations, and scholars. Collaboration can encompass cooperation, coordination, integration, networking, and partnerships, as defined by the Government Accountability Office. Interagency collaboration involves different types of activities among agencies, such as cooperation, coordination, integration, networking, and partnerships. The Government Accountability Office defines collaboration as joint activities by multiple organizations to produce more public value. This broad interpretation has led to the discovery of numerous collaborative activities, even within specialized areas, with at least six identifiable types of arrangements. Despite the lack of agreed-upon detailed definitions, generalized operational understandings can be developed for these interagency activities. Interagency collaboration involves various activities like cooperation, coordination, merger, and integration. Collaboration relies on voluntary participation, coordination involves a lead agency directing operations, merger transfers agencies to another organization, and integration brings agencies together. Interagency collaboration involves various activities like cooperation, coordination, merger, integration, networks, and partnerships. Collaboration relies on voluntary participation, coordination involves a lead agency directing operations, merger transfers agencies to another organization, and integration brings agencies together on a temporary basis. Networks involve the federal government and other levels of government, while partnerships feature public-private partnerships with various entities involved. Interagency collaboration involves different types of organizations such as not-for-profit, for-profit, government-sponsored enterprises, and government-chartered corporations. These entities may overlap, coexist, or be required in the same authorization without clear definitions. This can lead to hybrids with various activities and arrangements within the same structure, making it challenging to separate them. The lack of commonly accepted definitions in the public sector adds to the complexity of interpreting and using collaborative enterprises. The public sector lacks precise definitions for concepts like interagency collaboration, leading to different interpretations and terminology within agencies. Differences in understanding and use of these concepts can vary between military and civilian sectors, affecting the frequency and purpose of arrangements. This can result in varying interpretations and names for collaborative efforts, such as public-private partnerships. Public-private partnerships and other collaborative arrangements in the public sector can vary in prominence and understanding, with terminology evolving over time. Interpretations of collaboration from decades ago may differ from current usage, and criteria for identifying partnerships can be broad and inconsistent. This inconsistency in terminology and usage can lead to challenges in implementing federal policies. Interagency coordination is distinguished from collaboration by the presence of a lead agency with formal authority over the process and participants. Coordination is more top-down, with a leader directing multiple organizations to work together towards a common goal. This distinction is not always absolute and may not apply to all collaborative arrangements. In collaborative arrangements, participants have a degree of voluntarism, leading to a horizontal cooperative arrangement among peers. Unlike coordination, collaboration lacks a lead authority, which can result in some members not participating adequately, potentially jeopardizing the enterprise. In interagency coordinative arrangements, a lead official or agency has formal authority to direct other members, creating a hierarchical structure. Examples show differences between collaboration and coordination, with various levels of arrangements such as high-level council responsibilities, operational agreements, and agency head directives. A 2010 memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the Department of Defense (DOD) is an illustration of such arrangements. The 2010 memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to increase collaboration in strategic planning for cybersecurity, mutual support for capabilities development, and synchronization of operational activities. This agreement will enhance national cybersecurity efforts and the overall capacity of both DHS's homeland security and DoD's national security missions. The MOA between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aims to improve efficiency in requirements formulation, requests for products and services, technical assistance, coordination, and performance assessment for cybersecurity missions. The agreement outlines specific responsibilities, obligations, and benefits for both departments without giving direct authority over each other. Another collaborative arrangement involves the Homeland Security Council, established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The Homeland Security Council advises the President on homeland security matters, assesses objectives and risks, oversees federal policies, and performs other directed functions. The Federal Government aims to streamline assistive technology research and universal design principles to avoid duplication of efforts. Collaboration is seen in grants for child abuse prevention programs and in an information-technology project called \"Forge.mil\" under the Defense Information Systems Agency. Forge.mil is a web-based collaborative software development platform for DoD employees and private sector contractors with appropriate security clearances. It enables rapid development and deployment of new products and services on the Global Information Grid, promoting collaboration among stakeholders throughout the development life-cycle. The Secret Service has lead authority in National Special Security Events, with the Presidential Threat Protection Act granting them specific powers for security operations. The Attorney General also has cross-agency powers for apprehending fugitives. The Attorney General has the authority to establish permanent Fugitive Apprehension Task Forces with the U.S. Marshals Service to locate and apprehend fugitives. Additionally, a program for the Chesapeake Bay's protection and restoration is overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency through a Federal Leadership Committee. The Committee oversees programs and activities for the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, chaired by the EPA Administrator. The Director of National Intelligence has extensive authority over the U.S. intelligence community. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) serves as the head of the intelligence community and principal adviser to the President on intelligence matters related to national security. The DNI has budgetary, spending, and personnel powers to oversee and direct the National Intelligence Program independently. The DNI also has statutory authority to direct and coordinate intelligence community operations and activities, giving unrivaled control over interagency coordination. The Director of National Intelligence has the authority to provide guidance for the National Intelligence Program budget, ensure effective budget execution, manage appropriations, monitor program implementation, establish objectives for intelligence collection and analysis, and direct intelligence community activities. The Director of National Intelligence oversees the collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of national intelligence, manages personnel policies, promotes service in multiple intelligence elements, eliminates waste and duplication, and performs other functions within the intelligence community. The Director of National Intelligence oversees intelligence functions, ensures information availability, and protects sources. Collaboration and coordination in practice can be complex. In collaborative efforts, some participants may have more influence than others, leading to unequal power dynamics. A lead agency or officer can set priorities and guide activities, potentially dominating the agenda. In contrast, a coordinative approach may struggle to ensure full compliance due to a lack of perceived authority or resources. Collaboration within a formal structure can still occur, with a lead officer overseeing the process. In a coordinative arrangement, a lead officer consults with other participants to determine policies, processes, assignments, and duties. Decisions may be made collectively, with the lead officer ratifying some choices. Ambiguity arises between collaboration and coordination, especially with entities like \"czars\" in government roles. The term \"czar\" can exaggerate their influence and fail to differentiate between different types of officials. In government roles, there are two categories of presidential appointees: those with Senate confirmation and statutory authority for coordination, like the Director of National Intelligence, and those without Senate confirmation who are limited to collaborative roles but can still exert influence in certain situations, such as during crises or major policy initiatives. The President plays a key leadership role in crisis situations and major policy initiatives. Interagency collaboration has a long history in the U.S. government, with examples of shared responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions. These collaborations vary in terms of scale, duration, success, rationale, and restrictions. In 1794, President George Washington and Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton led a militia force to respond to the Whiskey Rebellion. In the 1840s, Indian reservations were managed by the Indian Bureau and the Department of War. Secret Service protection of the President began in 1894 and involved various military and law enforcement agencies. In the early 1900s, Secret Service detectives from the Department of the Treasury were loaned to conduct investigations for other departments, including the Interior and Justice. Enforcement of Prohibition in the 1920s involved multiple federal agencies and state/local authorities. Throughout the 20th century, various agencies such as the Coast Guard, Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, and others have been involved in controlling U.S. borders to prevent illegal immigration and smuggling of contraband, including illicit drugs. This effort has led to reorganizations and mergers of agencies, with expanded responsibilities in international relations and national defense post-World War II. The National Security Act of 1947 reorganized the federal government during the early Cold War, establishing the National Security Council, Director of Central Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. Interagency collaboration has since expanded to include security at National Special Security Events. In the late 1990s, the Secret Service began leading efforts to coordinate homeland security functions for large-scale events in the US. This was heightened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, leading to the creation of the Office of Homeland Security and later the Department of Homeland Security. Changes in the intelligence community also occurred post-9/11. Significant changes in the intelligence community post-9/11 included the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence in 2004 with coordinative powers over 16 components. Other examples of revamped programs include the Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration program and federal medical care programs utilizing interagency mechanisms for dental care for low-income children. Collaborative efforts involving federal and state organizations, public-private partnerships, and interagency law enforcement endeavors have expanded beyond national security and homeland security to include various policies and programs such as environmental protection, natural resource conservation, disaster response, financial sector restructuring, medication safety, consumer goods regulation, social welfare programs, and security clearances. These efforts also encompass activities like apprehending fugitives, combating credit card fraud, identity theft, human trafficking, and illicit drug activities. The contemporary era has seen advancements in collaborative arrangements and activities for various reasons, including the growth of governmental responsibilities, pressures to reduce expenditures, increases in cross-cutting programs, and the need to restructure responses to crisis situations. This has led to calls for improved collaboration and coordination among agencies with shared responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions. Interagency collaboration is essential due to multiple rationales and dimensions, leading to policy-oriented benefits and possible advantages for individual participants. Collaborative efforts can result in mutual benefits, support for vested interests, and improved capabilities, products, and services. Interagency collaboration is crucial for avoiding fragmented policymaking and implementation, preventing uncertainty and competition among agencies with overlapping responsibilities. It also fosters long-term relationships and mutual benefits among participants. Interagency collaboration is essential for avoiding fragmented policymaking and implementation by aligning committee jurisdictions and encouraging joint efforts to bring diverse expertise and resources to problem-solving. Interagency collaboration enhances awareness of different perspectives in dealing with common problems, leading to expanded horizons and improved policy formulation and implementation. Interagency conflict, such as turf battles, arises from competition over various factors, hindering cooperation. Interagency collaboration can enhance productivity and efficiency by reducing redundancy and duplication of effort among agencies. This collaborative process helps agencies become aware of different ways of conducting operations and activities, leading to improved policy implementation and lower costs. Interagency collaboration reduces redundancy and duplication, increasing efficiency and promoting cost-saving techniques. It also helps agencies become aware of cross-cutting programs and best practices, leading to improved policy implementation. Changing organizational cultures from agency-centered to interagency-oriented can lead to more collaborative endeavors. Lessons learned from such experiences can transfer to other policy areas, resulting in increased information-sharing and more relevant information being transmitted in real time. Bureaucratic and administrative cultures within an organization influence its internal operations, including hiring and promoting personnel and providing incentives for certain operations. Transforming organizational cultures to be more interagency-oriented can lead to collaborative efforts, redesigning incentives, and creating joint enterprises. This shift can improve information-sharing and support joint efforts between agencies. Collaborative arrangements between agencies can enhance oversight of programs and projects by providing a more comprehensive perspective that covers multiple entities involved in an enterprise. This can help prevent piecemeal approaches and improve policy implementation through joint efforts. Oversight efforts, including reviews by various entities and the House Rules for the 112th Congress, aim to improve policy implementation by identifying and eliminating duplicative programs. Independent oversight units like GAO are mandated to identify duplicative programs annually. The Inspector General Reform Act of 2008 directs the Council of the Inspectors General for Integrity and Efficiency to coordinate interagency audits and evaluations. Fragmented congressional oversight leads to agency officials being spread thin and facing competing priorities. Collaborative ventures among agencies could streamline processes, reduce duplication of efforts, and improve working relationships. While positive rationales exist, concerns may arise regarding performance matching promises and conflicting goals like effectiveness, efficiency, and economy. Start-up costs and downtime could also be potential challenges. Interagency arrangements for collaborative ventures may lead to higher initial expenditures due to start-up costs and possible downtime. Additional funding may be required for joint ventures to improve productivity collectively. However, these arrangements could hinder performance in other areas by taking away from participants' other responsibilities and priorities. Interagency arrangements for collaborative ventures may incur costs in terms of funding, resources, personnel, and attention. Participants may need to offset these by adding new resources, sharing workloads equitably, or increasing efficiency. Concerns may arise regarding private sector organizations lacking the capacity for public-private partnerships and the risk of government agencies being \"captured\" by private industry. Public-private partnerships can lead to government agencies being \"captured\" by private industry, forming \"iron triangles\" or \"subgovernments.\" This can result in a \"shadow government\" where agencies lack the capacity to perform their duties due to extensive outsourcing. The private sector's extensive outsourcing in public-private partnerships can lead to difficulties in managing and overseeing contractors, potentially resulting in a lack of expertise, neutrality, and commitment to effective oversight. This could create conflicts of interest and increase the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse. Difficulties in managing and overseeing private contractors in public-private partnerships can lead to conflicts of interest, waste, fraud, and abuse. Restrictions on government access to information and complexities in contracting can hinder effective oversight, making it challenging to determine responsibility and project effectiveness. High expectations for collaborative efforts may undervalue improvements, and some partnerships may lack capacity. Some observers believe that collaborative efforts may lack capacity and capability, making effective interagency coordination elusive. Assessing the success of such arrangements is difficult due to a lack of systematic analyses and comparisons. Two studies, one from 1937 and one from 2010, provide information on interagency collaborative activities. Reliable assessments of success and failure are challenging due to various factors, including how success is defined and determined. Comparing different types of interagency arrangements or new collective structures with decentralized ones can help in evaluating their effectiveness. Success in collaborative ventures can be hindered by the challenge of defining and measuring success. Different types of collaborations may require different criteria for success. The perceived success of a project is influenced by initial expectations and objectives. Success is not always absolute and can vary depending on the evaluator. The evaluation of interagency arrangements is influenced by various conditions and factors, such as the qualifications of agency officials or evaluators. External factors like changes in the environment can impact collaborative efforts. Assessments of public-private partnerships must consider conditions like skills of the unemployed and job market dynamics. Interagency collaborative efforts are influenced by factors like availability of jobs, support services, and organizational tensions. Conflicts can arise between agencies, congressional committees, and branches of government, impacting the success of collaborative arrangements. Various factors determine the strength and sustainability of these collaborations. Interagency collaborative efforts are influenced by factors like availability of jobs, support services, and organizational tensions. These factors determine the strengths and weaknesses of collaborations at systemic, structural, and individual levels. Factors include transformations in governmental responsibilities, changes in the political environment, urgency and complexity of the problem, expectations, and extent of merger or reorganization. Factors influencing interagency collaborative efforts include agency merger or reorganization, selection of lead agency, powers and resources available, autonomy of components, organizational and bureaucratic cultures, competition with other missions, jurisdictional rivalries, and support for collaboration versus agency autonomy. Factors influencing interagency collaborative efforts include collaboration versus support for agency autonomy, oversight by Congress and the executive, incentives and benefits of participation, disincentives and costs, level and type of involvement, capacity and expertise of agencies, leadership skills, and confidence in participants. In 1937, a Select Committee was created to investigate the Executive branch. In 1937, a Select Committee was created to investigate the Executive branch. The panel commissioned a study by the Brookings Institution, which emphasized the need for coordinating mechanisms to prevent duplication and inefficiency in government agencies. This issue of coordination is still relevant today, as highlighted by President Obama in 2011, who called for consolidation of programs to streamline government operations. In efforts to streamline government operations, legislative initiatives have proposed consolidating programs to eliminate inefficiencies and duplication. The House of Representatives has mandated committees to include proposals to cut or eliminate outdated or duplicative programs in their oversight plans. The Government Accountability Office conducts annual reports to identify areas of potential duplication and fragmentation within government agencies. The first GAO report identified 34 areas with overlapping objectives or services, fragmented government missions, and hundreds of federal programs across major departments. Eliminating duplication could save billions annually and improve efficiency. Concerns about inefficiencies have grown due to increased government responsibilities and complexities in public policies, exacerbated by recent crises highlighting existing inadequacies. The response to crises and pressures to reduce federal programs has led to support for new interagency collaborative arrangements. Objectives now include reducing policy fragmentation, improving effectiveness, increasing efficiency, mitigating conflict, enhancing productivity, and streamlining oversight among federal agencies. Interagency collaboration aims to promote joint efforts and cooperation among federal agencies with shared responsibilities. Six principal types include collaboration, coordination, integration, mergers, networking, and public-private partnerships. However, challenges arise due to the lack of clear definitions and inconsistent use of these concepts across diverse governmental organizations. Despite the lack of clear definitions and inconsistent use of terms, interagency arrangements are increasingly adopted and promoted. Evaluating their success is challenging due to changing conditions, intervening developments, and various influencing factors such as political environment and resources. Conducting valid assessments and comparisons between different arrangements or over time is difficult. Interagency collaborations involve factors like environment, resources, leadership, and operational experience. Evaluating their success is challenging due to changing conditions and various influencing factors.
