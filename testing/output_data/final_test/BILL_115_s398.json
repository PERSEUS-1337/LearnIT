    "content": "APALACHICOLA, CHATTAHOOCHEE, AND FLINT RIVER PROJECTS. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects include various dams and reservoirs in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The term \"freshwater flows\" is also defined in this section. The term \"freshwater flows\" refers to the quality, quantity, timing, and variability of freshwater necessary to support and reestablish ecological integrity, fisheries, and wildlife in the Chattahoochee River, Apalachicola River, floodplain, and Apalachicola Bay. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Army. The goal is to restore diverse fish, wildlife, and plant populations in the Chattahoochee River and Apalachicola River ecosystems, including endangered, threatened, and at-risk species, while preventing harmful impacts. The Secretary of the Army will ensure freshwater flows in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects. A study will be conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to evaluate existing data and provide recommendations on maintaining freshwater flows. The study must be completed within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will issue revised water control manuals for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects within 2 years to maintain freshwater flows. The Secretary will ensure operational modifications to maintain freshwater flows in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint project reservoirs, with system-wide balance in conservation storage. An independent peer review of water control manuals will be conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. The Secretary will obtain final approval for water control manuals from the EPA Administrator and the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service before issuance. Compliance with the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 is required for independent peer reviews conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint projects involve the Wildlife Service, NOAA Administrator, and US Geological Survey. Federal and State laws still apply, and the project aims to conserve fish and wildlife populations in the rivers and floodplains. The project aims to conserve fish and wildlife populations in the Chattahoochee River floodplain by restoring natural systems and mimicking natural flows."
