    "content": "Unsupervised representation learning using Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs) has shown promise in utilizing unlabeled data to learn general representations. However, VAEs are outperformed by supervised learning for recognition tasks. To address this, PatchVAE is proposed, which focuses on learning repeating and consistent patterns in data at a patch level. This approach introduces a bottleneck formulation in the VAE framework to encourage mid-level style representations. Experimental results show that PatchVAE outperforms vanilla VAEs in recognition tasks. Supervised learning dominates visual recognition tasks due to the need for large labeled datasets, contrasting with insights from developmental psychology on unsupervised learning. However, in fields like healthcare and robotics, where annotated data is scarce, learning from few labeled images is challenging. Unsupervised learning in computer vision involves discovering patterns from unlabeled data through generative modeling and self-supervised learning. Generative models aim to learn the probability distribution of data and can draw samples or evaluate likelihoods. While generative models are useful for compact image representation, they may not be as effective for visual recognition tasks. Self-supervised learning is a popular way to learn representations from unlabeled data in computer vision. It aims to establish proxy tasks for recognition without human supervision, unlike generative modeling which focuses on reconstructing images. However, a fundamental limitation is the need to define proxy tasks that mimic desired recognition, which may not always be possible or generalizable. In this paper, the focus is on enabling unsupervised generative modeling with VAEs to learn useful image representations by capturing only the interesting parts of images that are repetitive across the dataset. This approach avoids reconstructing the entire image and instead focuses on regions that occur frequently and consistently across many images. In an encoder-decoder based generative model, the PatchVAE approach uses discrete and continuous latents to learn repetitive parts in images for better recognition. Losses favoring foreground with repetitive patterns result in improved representations for recognition. The PatchVAE approach utilizes discrete and continuous latents to learn repetitive parts in images, improving recognition. Results on various datasets show the effectiveness of PatchVAE in unsupervised representation learning for recognition tasks. Generative models like VAEs, PixelRNN, PixelCNN, and GANs have been effective in learning compressed image representations and generating high-quality samples. Combining VAEs and GANs allows for learning image data distribution and generating quality samples simultaneously. Our work provides a structured approach for VAEs to learn representations beyond low-level features, enhancing visual recognition tasks. We focus on incorporating inductive biases in generative models like VAEs to improve their suitability for visual recognition. Our work focuses on improving VAEs for visual recognition tasks by incorporating inductive biases. We follow best practices in self-supervised learning to evaluate learned representations using an encoder network and independent single layer networks for generating part visibility and appearance parameters. Our work builds upon the VAE framework proposed by Kingma & Welling (2013), which assumes a generative model for data where latent z is sampled from a prior p(z) and data is generated from a conditional distribution G(x|z). The model is learned by minimizing the negative variational lower bound (ELBO) using an encoder Q(z|x) and a decoder G(x|z). The VAE framework involves mapping latents to the data space using neural networks. By incorporating a weight factor \u03b2 for the KL Divergence term, the model aims to learn a generative model for images with disentangled representations. The latents z represent low dimensional generating factors in the VAE architecture. The VAE framework involves mapping latents to the data space using neural networks. The latents z represent low dimensional generating factors. However, standard VAE representations may not be ideal for recognition as they capture all details, not just the 'interesting' aspects. To address this, a formulation is proposed to encode only repetitive parts of an image, i.e., patches that occur often in images. This approach aims to learn semantic representations without relevant supervision. The VAE framework provides a way to map images to latent space, making it suitable for encoding repetitive patches in images. The \u03b2-VAEs were chosen for their simplicity and popularity. A modification in error computation biases towards foreground high-energy regions. The goal is to encourage the encoder network to encode only highly repetitive parts of an image, like faces or wheels, rather than random noise patches. The text discusses how the representation f is transformed into patch latent codes to predict frequently occurring parts in an image. These patch latent codes encode parts at specific grid locations and are used to reconstruct the image. The \u03b2-VAE framework is adapted to learn these local latent codes for single and multiple parts in an image. The text explains the process of using encoder and decoder networks to estimate posterior distributions for part appearance and visibility in images. The decoder network reconstructs the image using sampled part appearance and visibility values. The 3D representation is constructed by placing the part appearance at each location where the part is present. The text describes a deconvolutional network that generates an image based on stochastic input. The model resembles variational autoencoders but differs in using discrete latents for part visibility, patch-based bottleneck for latents, and feature assembly for the generator. Training follows the \u03b2-VAE setup, maximizing the variational lower bound to train the encoder and decoder jointly. The appearance of a part is captured by a zero-mean Normal distribution with diagonal covariance, while the presence is captured by another distribution. The text discusses the implementation details of training a deconvolutional network with discrete latents for part visibility. The ELBO for the approach is defined, with emphasis on using L2 reconstruction loss and KL Divergence loss for training. The relaxed-bernoulli approximation is used for learning part visibility distributions. During training, the model uses weighted average of part appearance features at locations with part visibility > 1, ensuring a common representation for similar looking parts. Sampling z app once and replicating it at locations with visibility = 1 enforces the model to predict similar looking parts and learn a common representation. During training, the model uses a single gaussian distribution to map variable appearances of semantic concepts to feature representations. The framework is extended to use multiple parts with N \u00d7 2 encoder networks. The image generator samples from these networks to construct the final patch latent code. Training details and assumptions of posteriors follow previous sections. The text chunk discusses the visualization of concepts captured by parts in images, showcasing diverse examples and categories. It also mentions the importance of considering semantic representations in training for tasks like image compression and de-noising. In training for tasks like image compression and de-noising, regions in an image are weighed based on gradient energy to prioritize important concepts like \"windows,\" \"wheels,\" and \"faces.\" This weighted loss approach is similar to gradient-energy biased sampling used in previous studies. In image training, weight masks are used for important concepts like \"windows,\" \"wheels,\" and \"faces.\" An adversarial training strategy from GANs is also considered to train VAEs, resulting in better recognition capabilities for \u03b2-VAE and PatchVAE. The proposed model is evaluated on CIFAR100, MIT Indoor Scene Recognition, and Places datasets. The learning paradigm involves training the model unsupervised on images excluding the test set, then using part of the encoder network for supervised classification. Different training strategies are studied for the classification stage using specific architectures for different datasets. The model is trained unsupervised on images, excluding the test set, with different training strategies for classification using specific architectures for various datasets. The training details include using ADAM optimizer, initial learning rates, minibatch sizes, and specific epochs for different datasets. Classification results are presented for CIFAR100, Indoor67, and Places205 datasets. The model is initialized with representations learned from unsupervised learning for classification on CIFAR100, Indoor67, and Places205 datasets. Different baseline models like \u03b2-VAE and BiGAN are compared with similar backbone architectures. In Table 1, top-1 classification results on CIFAR100, Indoor67, and Places205 datasets are reported for different training strategies. The PatchVAE framework generally outperforms the \u03b2-VAE counterpart, showing better representations for recognition. Better reconstruction losses improve both \u03b2-VAE and PatchVAE models. Fine-tuning the last residual block along with two conv layers further enhances performance. PatchVAE outperforms VAE in all settings except for CIFAR100 with just L2 loss. Better reconstruction losses improve PatchVAE over \u03b2-VAE. Fine-tuning all but the first conv layer shows PatchVAE performing better on Indoor67 and Places205 datasets, while \u03b2-VAE performs slightly better on CIFAR100. PatchVAE representations are significantly better than BiGAN on all datasets, but BiGAN performs better on two out of four datasets when fine-tuning pre-trained weights. Results using pre-trained weights in supervised ImageNet show PatchVAE's performance. Large-scale ImageNet benchmark results are reported using ResNet18. The PatchVAE framework outperforms \u03b2-VAE in various settings, with improved performance seen through better reconstruction losses. Fine-tuning specific layers in the classification network shows PatchVAE's superiority on different datasets. The proposed weighted loss benefits both approaches, as shown in Table 2. Additionally, experiments with different hyperparameters and datasets like CIFAR100 and Indoor67 were conducted for further analysis. The PatchVAE framework shows superior performance compared to \u03b2-VAE, with improved reconstruction losses. Experiments on CIFAR100 and Indoor67 datasets reveal the impact of the number of patches and parts on discriminative power. Increasing the number of patches enhances performance on CIFAR100 but has little effect on Indoor67, possibly due to the smaller dataset size. The number of channels in the appearance feature for each patch also influences the latent representation capacity. The PatchVAE framework outperforms \u03b2-VAE with better reconstruction losses. Experiment results on CIFAR100 and Indoor67 datasets show the impact of patch visibility parameters on classification performance. Increasing patch visibility prior can deteriorate classification performance. Patch visibility weight \u03b2 vis is crucial in PatchVAE framework. Choosing the right weight is important as it affects the learning capability of patches. If \u03b2 vis is too low, more patches can fire at the same location, harming learning. On the other hand, if \u03b2 vis is too high, the decoder will not receive any patches for reconstruction, leading to poor performance in both reconstruction and classification tasks. PatchVAE constrains the encoder to learn repetitive and consistent patches, resulting in better representations for recognition compared to vanilla VAEs. Losses favoring high-energy foreground regions are shown to be better for unsupervised learning of representations. The curr_chunk discusses the visualization of weighted loss in image reconstruction, highlighting specific regions of interest. It also mentions the dataset and training details of CIFAR100, which consists of 60000 color images in 100 classes. The CIFAR100 dataset contains 60000 color images in 100 classes, with 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The Indoor67 dataset has 15620 images in 67 categories, while the Places205 dataset has 2.5 million images in 205 categories. The ImageNet dataset has 1.28 million training images and 50k validation images across 1000 categories. The generator network architecture includes deconvolution layers with batch normalization, and when using GAN loss, a discriminator with convolution layers is added. In Section 4, the proposed model was evaluated on CIFAR100, Indoor67, and Places205 datasets with different input image sizes. PatchVAE can handle various input sizes uniformly, while VAE and BiGAN require different architectures. The encoder architecture consists of a fixed neural network backbone common to all models discussed in the paper. Tables 6 and 7 display the encoder architectures used in different models. The backbone architecture for different models in the paper consists of a single conv layer followed by 2 residual blocks, referred to as Resnet-9. The encoder architecture varies depending on the model, with a pyramid-like network used for the decoder. The final non-linearity in each decoder is tanh. Tables 8 and 9 show the decoder architectures for different models."
