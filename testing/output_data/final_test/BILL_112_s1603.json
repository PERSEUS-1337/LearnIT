    "content": "The \"Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011\" may be cited as the Open Fuels Standard. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011, also known as the Open Fuels Standard, amends Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, by adding a new section 32920 which defines advanced alternative fuel blends as mixtures containing a high percentage of ethanol, methanol, or other alcohols or liquid fuels mixed with gasoline or drop-in fuel. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 defines advanced alternative fuel blends as mixtures certified by the Secretary, and fuel choice-enabling vehicles as automobiles capable of operating on specific fuel blends. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 defines advanced alternative fuel blends as mixtures certified by the Secretary, and fuel choice-enabling vehicles as automobiles capable of operating on specific fuel blends, including ethanol, gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, electricity, hybrid electric engines, and biodiesel-diesel mixtures meeting established standards. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 requires automobile manufacturers to have a certain percentage of fuel choice-enabling vehicles in their annual inventory, with specific criteria for the fuel blends allowed, including biodiesel and alternative fuels with limited petroleum content. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 mandates that a minimum of 80% of vehicles in model year 2018 and beyond must be capable of using alternative fuel blends, subject to certification by the Secretary of Transportation and the EPA Administrator. The certification process considers technological feasibility, consumer costs, automobile safety, and air quality impacts. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 requires vehicles to use alternative fuel blends, with certification by the Secretary of Transportation. Manufacturers can request exemptions for small-scale production. The Open Fuels Standard Act of 2011 allows manufacturers with annual covered inventory fewer than 10,000 vehicles to be exempt from the requirement. The Secretary may establish a credit trading program for manufacturers exceeding the requirement to earn and sell credits. Starting in 2018, vehicles used to qualify for the open fuels standard cannot receive the dual fuel credit. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with other agencies, will develop a model label for pumps dispensing advanced alternative fuels. The label will provide a single metric for consumers to evaluate fuel value, energy density, and expected performance, with warnings against using the fuel in inappropriate engines. The Secretary of Transportation will develop a model label for pumps dispensing advanced alternative fuels, evaluating the need for standardized fueling equipment to prevent incompatible fuel blends from being dispensed to vehicles. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 1 year of enactment to implement the open fuels standard."
