    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Brownfield Redevelopment Reserve Act\" and introduces special rules for hazardous waste remediation reserves under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Act introduces special rules for hazardous waste remediation reserves under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Taxpayers can deduct payments made to a Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, with limitations on the amount that can be paid each year. Amounts distributed from the Reserve are included in the taxpayer's gross income. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve allows taxpayers to deduct qualified hazardous waste costs when economic performance occurs. The Reserve is established by the taxpayer and is exempt from taxation unless it ceases to be a Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, established by taxpayers, is subject to taxes under section 511. Contributions to the Reserve must be deductible under subsection (a) and can only be used to pay qualified hazardous waste costs. The Reserve is subject to regulations against self-dealing, treated as a trust under section 501(c)(21). The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve, subject to taxes under section 511, must comply with regulations against self-dealing. If the Reserve violates the rules, the Secretary can disqualify it, and it will be deemed to have distributed all its funds. If the Reserve fails to spend its funds within 10 years of establishment, it will also be deemed to have distributed all its funds. The Hazardous Waste Remediation Reserve must comply with regulations to avoid penalties. If funds are not used for qualified hazardous waste costs within 10 years, a penalty of 10 percent will be imposed on the distributed amount. The term 'qualified hazardous waste costs' refers to expenses related to assessing and remediating environmental contamination on a taxpayer-owned site. Controlled groups under certain tax sections are treated as one entity, with allocated dollar amounts as determined by the Secretary. The taxpayer is deemed to have made a payment to the Reserve on the last day of a taxable year if the payment is made within 2\\1/2\\ months after the close of the taxable year. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart C of part II of subchapter E of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments for hazardous waste remediation reserves under section 468C will apply to taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act."
