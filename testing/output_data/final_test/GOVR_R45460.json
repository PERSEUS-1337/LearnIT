It sets up a national framework for states and territories to manage coastal resources, allowing them to become eligible for federal grants and perform reviews of federal agency actions in coastal areas. Concerns about environmental degradation led to the passage of the act, and with over a third of the U.S. population living in shoreline counties in 2010, the importance of coastal management continues to grow. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was enacted by Congress in 1972 to manage coastal resources. It addresses concerns about environmental degradation and the increasing population in shoreline counties. The report focuses on the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP) and discusses the impacts of coastal development, natural resources, and potential changes to CZMA grant programs. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) was enacted by Congress in 1972 to manage coastal resources through the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP). The report discusses states' participation in the program to access federal grants and recent issues for Congress. CZMA has been amended 11 times, but the national policies declared by Congress have remained consistent, focusing on preserving, protecting, and enhancing coastal resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) aims to assist states and territories in managing coastal resources, considering ecological, cultural, and economic factors. It encourages the preparation of special area management plans, public participation, and cooperation among various agencies. The Act also emphasizes coordination with federal, state, and international organizations for coastal management information and research, and adapting to changing circumstances affecting coastal resources. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages states and territories to consider ocean uses that may affect the coastal zone. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management implements CZMA's national policies. States and territories determine the details of their coastal management programs, including boundaries, issues of interest, and policies. Local governments implement these programs through land use regulations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management administers CZMA provisions through national programs like NCZMP, NERRS, and Digital Coast. The focus is on the NCZMP, which encourages coastal states to develop and implement coastal zone management programs. States joining the NCZMP must develop CMPs containing policies for resource protection and coastal development management. States in the NCZMP are eligible for federal grants and can review federal actions for consistency with state policies. The Secretary must approve the state's Coastal Zone Management Program (CMP) to receive benefits from the National Coastal Zone Management Program (NCZMP). Participants are evaluated every three years to ensure progress. 35 states and territories are eligible to participate, with 34 currently involved. Participation grants access to federal grant programs and the ability to review federal actions for consistency with state policies. The Coastal Zone Management Program (CMP) allows coastal states to apply for federal grants and review federal actions for consistency with state policies. Grant programs have evolved over time to include funding for program development, coastal energy impacts, research, and technical assistance. NOAA has allocated over $2 billion in grants since 1972 for various coastal management purposes. NOAA has allocated over $2 billion in coastal zone management-related grants to eligible coastal states and territories since 1972. States have received varying amounts of grant funding based on factors such as their participation in the program, size, population, and success in competitive grant programs. In FY2017, Congress appropriated $85 million to NOAA for coastal management grants, with the majority allocated for Section 306 grants. The CZMA grant program authorizations of appropriations have expired, but Congress continues to fund the programs. CZMA Section 307 requires federal actions affecting coastal uses to be consistent with approved CMPs. Federal agencies must submit a consistency determination to potentially affected participants. Legislation and NOAA regulation define terms related to consistency review. The coastal zone is defined as coastal waters and adjacent shorelands, including islands, wetlands, and beaches. The zone extends to the outer limit of state ownership and inland to control shorelands and areas vulnerable to sea level rise. Identification of coastal zone boundaries is required in approved Coastal Management Plans. The effect on coastal use or resources refers to any foreseeable impact from federal activities or assistance. The effects of federal actions on coastal use and resources are determined through the effects test. Enforceable state policies control land and water use in the coastal zone. Federal actions subject to consistency reviews include agency activities, license or permit activities, outer continental shelf plans, and federal assistance to state and local governments. NOAA requires submission of lists of these actions for review. Interstate coastal effect refers to the impact of federal actions in one state on coastal use or resources of another state with an approved Coastal Management Program. States must identify federal actions for approval by NOAA for consistency reviews. Participant reviews are context-specific, with different rights and responsibilities for federal agencies, applicants, and participants. Details include who determines effects, participant review period length, and the impact of objections. The resolution of participant objections to consistency determinations depends on the federal action in question. For federal agency activities and development projects, participants can request mediation from the Secretary of Commerce or OCM. The federal agency may proceed if it provides a legal basis for consistency or concludes its action is fully consistent with participant policies. The federal agency cannot authorize actions if a participant objects to the consistency certification, unless the Secretary of Commerce overrides the objection. Appeals can be made to the Secretary, who will review and may override objections if the action aligns with CZMA objectives or is necessary for national security. NOAA states that participants review thousands of federal consistency determinations annually, primarily for federal license or permit activities. Since the first Coastal Management Program (CMP) was approved in 1978, there have been 45 consistency decisions subject to secretarial appeals. The Secretary overrode participant objections in 14 cases and agreed with participants in 31 cases. An additional 65 appeals were settled or withdrawn, and 33 requests for appeals were dismissed on procedural grounds. As of April 2018, there were no appeals pending. Congress may continue to consider the effects of natural and man-made changes on the coast, the effectiveness of CZMA implementation, and the expired CZMA grant program authorizations of appropriations. These concerns have been considered in previous Congresses and/or have been recently raised by government agencies and various coastal stakeholders. Congress may also examine CZMA in light of continued population and infrastructure growth along the coast, as well as coastal hazards such as flooding and erosion. Coastal shoreline counties were home to over 123 million people (39% of the U.S. population) in 2010, with an expected growth of 10 million people by 2020. The ocean and Great Lakes economy accounted for 2.3% of total employment and contributed $320 billion to the total U.S. gross domestic product. The ocean and Great Lakes economy accounted for 2.3% of total employment and contributed $320 billion to the total U.S. gross domestic product in 2015. Shoreline communities are experiencing growth amid ecosystems like beaches, reefs, and wetlands, which are being impacted by sea level changes, climate change, and other factors. Congress has proposed bills to address climate change preparedness and \"working waterfronts\" under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Some bills proposed by Congress aim to expand grant programs to new locations and groups not currently eligible. Scholars suggest revisions to the Coastal Zone Management Act to address coastal changes. Congress may review NOAA's implementation of the Act and consider necessary changes. The effectiveness of the Act, particularly the National Coastal Zone Management Program, is under scrutiny. The effectiveness of CZMA implementation, including the NCZMP, has been evaluated by various entities such as the Department of Commerce inspector general, the Office of Management and Budget, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and scholars. Evaluations have identified issues with monitoring and measuring program success, specific grant programs, and NOAA's implementation of CZMA. GAO reported limitations in NOAA's coastal zone management performance measurement system, weaknesses in stakeholder selection for state program evaluations, and limited use of performance data. NOAA agreed with GAO's recommendations, but it is unclear if all changes have been fully implemented. In a 2016 study, GAO found that state coastal zone managers generally had positive views of NOAA's actions under CZMA to make marine coastal ecosystems more resilient to climate change. Some concerns have been raised about the implementation of CZMA programs, particularly regarding the proper implementation of Section 6217 provisions, which established the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) to reduce polluted runoff to coastal waters. NOAA and EPA jointly administer the CNPCP. Several states have yet to receive final approval for their Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) under the CZMA Section 306, including Alabama, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. In 2009 and 2016, private organizations sued NOAA and EPA for granting funds to Oregon and Washington. NOAA and EPA are currently working with conditionally approved states to address remaining program conditions. Congress has continued to appropriate funding for CZMA grant programs despite expired authorizations of appropriations. Since 1995, CZMA coastal zone management grant programs have had expired authorizations for appropriations. Legislation has been enacted to reauthorize appropriations for various grant programs, with proposed legislation seeking to increase appropriations for certain programs. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $75 million to the NCZMP for coastal zone management grants despite expired authorizations. NOAA's FY2019 budget proposal aims to eliminate all coastal management grants, focusing on supporting states' participation in the National CZM program through technical assistance services. Stakeholders argue for more funding, citing the critical importance of financial assistance provided by NOAA according to a 2016 GAO survey. Financial assistance provided by NOAA for coastal zone management is deemed critical by zone managers, who find the available funding insufficient to address states' needs. The NOAA Regional Coastal Resilience grant program received 132 applications requesting $105 million in FY2015, with only $4.5 million available for grants. Some argue against appropriations to grant programs, making authorizations for appropriations unnecessary."
