The Director will develop selection criteria for National Science Scholars based on their potential to complete a program in science, math, or engineering and their motivation for a career in these fields. Criteria may also consider financial need, promoting diversity, and measuring nominees' potential and motivation. The Secretary and the Director will jointly publish selection criteria in the Federal Register for National Science Scholars. Each State must establish a nominating committee composed of educators, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to nominate students for the awards. The committee will submit at least four nominations to the President. The President shall receive nominations of at least four individuals from each congressional district, with at least half being female, ranked in order of priority. The President will select two National Science Scholars per district each year, with at least one being female. Selections will be announced before January 1st, with notifications sent to Members of Congress before the public announcement. The President will present scholarships in a public ceremony. Congressional districts include parts of states represented by Members of the House of Representatives. Additional scholarships will be awarded to initial recipients who meet requirements. Scholarship proceeds will be disbursed to institutions of higher education on behalf of students.
