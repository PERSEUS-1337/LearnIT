    "content": "The \"Truth in Cigarette Labeling Act of 2006\" prohibits claims regarding tar or nicotine yield levels of cigarettes. Congress finds that cigarette manufacturers have falsely marketed cigarettes as \"light\", \"low-tar\", and other misleading labels, leading smokers to believe they are less harmful. This misrepresentation misleads smokers into choosing these cigarettes as an alternative to not smoking. The Federal Trade Commission has also stated that tar and nicotine ratings on cigarettes cannot accurately predict the actual amount of tar and nicotine a person receives. Recent studies have shown that cigarettes falsely marketed as \"light\" or \"low-tar\" do not reduce health risks and may actually increase the risk of tobacco use. Misleading marketing of cigarettes with deceptive health descriptors is a reason for the government to ensure truthful representations about cigarettes. The term \"brand\" refers to a variety of tobacco products distinguished by various factors, including type of tobacco, tar and nicotine content, flavoring, size, packaging, and branding elements. The term \"cigarette\" encompasses tobacco in any form that is functional for smoking, and deceptive health descriptors on cigarette packaging are prohibited to prevent misleading consumers about the risks of smoking. The prohibition on using health descriptors on cigarette labels and advertising will take effect 120 days after the enactment of the Act. Roll-your-own tobacco is defined as tobacco suitable for making cigarettes based on its appearance, type, packaging, or labeling. The Act prohibits cigarette manufacturers from using federal trade commission testing data for claims or representations. Violations will be treated as unfair or deceptive acts under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission enforces the Trade Commission Act in the same manner as the Federal Trade Commission Act, with the same jurisdiction and powers."
