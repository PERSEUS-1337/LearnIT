    "title": "AB 1246",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following: Section 6254.32 of the Government Code establishes that recordings from body-worn cameras are confidential and can only be disclosed to the person recorded. Definitions for \"body worn camera\" and \"peace officer\" are provided in the section. The Legislature finds that the need to protect individual privacy from public disclosure of body-worn camera images outweighs the public's right to access such information. The Legislature finds that protecting the privacy of individuals captured by body-worn cameras on local peace officers enhances public safety and individual rights, aligning with the California Constitution. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution. Section 832.7 of the Penal Code is amended to read. Section 832.7 of the Penal Code is amended to ensure the confidentiality of peace officer or custodial officer personnel records. Information from these records can only be disclosed in specific circumstances, such as investigations conducted by authorized entities. Complaining parties have the right to receive a copy of their own statements when filing a complaint. The Penal Code allows departments to share complaint data about officers without identifying individuals involved. The Penal Code permits departments to disclose factual information regarding a disciplinary investigation involving peace or custodial officers if the officer or their representative publicly spreads false information about the investigation. Disclosure is limited to facts in the officer's personnel file that refute the false statements made public. The department must notify the complainant of the complaint's outcome within 30 days, but this notification is not legally binding. This section does not impact the disclosure of information from a peace or custodial officer's personnel file as per Section 1043 of the Evidence Code."
