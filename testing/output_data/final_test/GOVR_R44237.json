The kits can vary across jurisdictions but generally include instructions, bags, swabs for DNA collection, a comb for hair samples, blood collection devices, and documentation forms. Forensic medical exams also involve collecting a complete medical history, conducting a full-body physical examination, and documenting any injuries sustained during the assault. Forensic medical exams for sexual assault victims involve collecting samples, documenting injuries, and securing physical evidence. Law enforcement agencies handle the transfer and testing of evidence kits, with varying procedures and timelines across jurisdictions and laboratories. DNA analysis requests for rape kits can take varying amounts of time to complete, with some labs needing more than nine months. The evidence from rape kits can be used in criminal investigations to establish elements of a crime, DNA links between individuals, and may be stored in databases for future cases. Forensic testing of sexual assault evidence can take several days, and a backlog of untested kits may exist in some cases. When people mention a \"rape kit backlog,\" they are referring to untested kits that have not been submitted to a laboratory or are delayed for testing. The issue mainly lies with kits submitted to crime labs but remain untested. In a study of the Detroit rape kit backlog, over 75% of backlogged kits had never been tested. Limited resources and police discretion contribute to the backlog of untested rape kits. The backlog of untested rape kits is a significant issue, with limited resources and police discretion contributing to the problem. Forensic laboratories face backlogs not only for sexual assault kits but also other types of DNA evidence. The cost to test a rape kit varies by jurisdiction, with estimates ranging from $400 to $1,500. The demand for DNA testing is increasing, leading to a strain on resources for both law enforcement agencies and laboratories. The cost to test a rape kit can range from $400 to $1,500. Police may choose not to pursue forensic investigation for various reasons, such as lack of probative value in the evidence or if the suspect's identity is already known. The National Institute of Justice reported that many law enforcement agencies do not submit sexual assault evidence collection kits (SAKs) for testing due to reasons like unidentified suspects or lack of prosecutor request. Procedures for analyzing SAKs vary by jurisdiction, leading to delays in testing or backlogs in crime laboratories. Many agencies struggle with backlogs of untested sexual assault evidence collection kits (SAKs) as crime labs are busy with current cases. The exact number of unanalyzed SAKs nationwide is unknown, partly due to the lack of a national data collection system. Tracking SAKs is often done in outdated, non-electronic formats, and the availability of computerized systems is a longstanding issue. A grassroots organization is attempting to estimate and track rape kit backlogs through public records requests, although their data is incomplete. The Joyful Heart Foundation has identified approximately 40 jurisdictions with rape kit backlogs ranging from hundreds to thousands of kits. Questions arise on whether all kits should be tested, including old cases, and if testing should be prioritized based on the statute of limitations or the nature of the assault. In recent years, the federal government has addressed the SAK backlog by providing financial support, conducting or funding research to address the backlog, and testing a limited number of SAKs from local law enforcement agencies that had not been submitted previously. Congress appropriated $41 million in FY2015 for the Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations program. The Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations program, administered by the Department of Justice, aims to create a coordinated community response to ensure resolution of cases through a victim-centered approach. It provides funding to address the backlog, test and track kits, report performance metrics, access training, engage in policy development, and improve practices related to the criminal justice process and victim support. NIJ provides funding to state and local crime laboratories through its DNA Backlog Reduction program to process forensic DNA samples. This funding cannot be used for unsubmitted SAK backlogs but can help process biological evidence from submitted SAKs. Research on SAK backlogs is limited, and NIJ funded research in Houston, TX, and Detroit, MI, to address this issue. NIJ funded research in Houston, TX, and Detroit, MI, to address the issue of unsubmitted SAKs. Multidisciplinary teams were formed in both jurisdictions to tackle the large number of unsubmitted SAKs. These teams included police officers, crime lab analysts, prosecutors, and victim advocates to facilitate the process of solving sexual assault crimes. The Detroit team conducted a census of 11,300 untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) collected from 1980 to 2009. Out of these, 1,595 SAKs were tested, with 785 yielding DNA profiles that could be uploaded to CODIS. 455 hits were identified, revealing the DNA identification of suspects, including 127 serial assaults. The Houston Police Department (HPD) found 6,663 untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) in their custody, including 4,000 stored in a freezer. A sample of 500 kits was selected for analysis in an NIJ-sponsored project. NIJ is partnering with the FBI crime lab to process and test a limited number of SAKs from local law enforcement agencies. The goal is to better understand issues related to DNA identification of suspects. The partnership between NIJ and the FBI aims to improve the handling of sexual assault kits (SAKs) by analyzing kits from law enforcement agencies. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 addressed the SAK backlog by expanding VAWA grants to strengthen forensic response and reduce rape kit backlogs. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 expanded VAWA grants to address sexual assault, including reducing rape kit backlogs and directing funds to programs that address sexual assault. It also incorporated the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2013, amending the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. Prior to the passage of the SAFER Act, Debbie Smith grants could only be used to test biological evidence submitted to crime labs and enhance their DNA analysis capacity. Congress may need to assess the SAK backlog and consider changing the federal response as agencies capture the problem's scope. This could involve funding preventative measures and setting time limits for testing SAKs. Congress may need to establish time limits for testing SAKs and request research on the impact of backlog reduction efforts on crime victims."
