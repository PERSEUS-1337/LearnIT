Section 203(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include certain physicians who have served in medically underserved communities under section 214(l). An alien is described in this subparagraph if they have completed service requirements of a waiver or exemption requested under section 214(l), plus an additional 2 years at the location identified in the waiver or exemption. The Secretary of Health and Human Services identifies a shortage of healthcare professionals, including alien physicians who completed service before the Conrad State 30 Improvement Act. This does not prevent alien physicians from filing petitions with the Secretary of Homeland Security for classification or adjustment of status. The alien physician can file a petition with the Secretary of Homeland Security for classification or adjustment of status before completing the required service or working full-time for 5 years in a designated shortage area.

The responsibility now lies with the Secretary of Homeland Security, not the Attorney General. Section 214(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allocate waivers and exemptions to all States based on specific criteria. If a certain threshold is met in the previous fiscal year, additional waivers and exemptions will be allotted for each subsequent fiscal year. The text discusses the allocation of waivers and exemptions to all States based on specific criteria, with provisions for increasing or decreasing allotments based on the total number of waivers and exemptions granted in previous years. The text outlines requirements for aliens granted waivers or exemptions, including entering into an employment agreement specifying on-call hours, compensation, malpractice insurance, and work locations. An alien granted a waiver or exemption must not add work locations without approval, and cannot have a non-compete provision. If their employment ends, they have 120 days to apply for new employment in designated shortage areas.
