    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Employment Access for Recidivism Reduction Nationwide\" or the \"EARN Act\". Enhancing incentives under the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The Secretary of Labor will work to reduce backlogs for employers applying for certifications, increase awareness of tax credits for hiring individuals facing barriers to employment, and use the Internet for processing certification requests for the work opportunity credit. A report must be submitted within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Labor will submit a plan to Congress outlining steps to achieve the purposes of the Act. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2014 to carry out this section. The Secretary of Labor aims to increase fidelity bonds purchased by States through the Federal Bonding Program by 25%. $1,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2009-2014 for this purpose. Additionally, there is an increased work opportunity credit for qualified ex-offenders hired under certified programs. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to increase the credit for hiring qualified ex-felons under certain programs. The credit is based on the number of days the ex-felon is employed, with a limit on the total credits allowed for all taxpayers. The credit limitation for hiring qualified ex-felons under certified programs is $10,000,000. The Secretary allocates the credit among taxpayers with approved programs, ensuring ex-felons are paid wages at least 150 percent of the amount by the taxpayer. The subsection specifies that individuals must be paid wages equal to or greater than 150 percent of the Federal minimum wage and receive health care benefits meeting certain standards. Rules similar to those in other subsections apply, and the provision expires two years after enactment. The subsection requires individuals to be paid wages at least 150% of the Federal minimum wage and receive specified health care benefits. A report must be submitted to Congress within 3 years on the credits allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. The report will include the number of taxpayers who applied for certification, received certification, and claimed a credit under the Code. The report to Congress must include the total amount of credits allowed under section 51(l) of the Internal Revenue Code, the number of qualified ex-offenders who participated in a program and continued to be employed at various intervals, and the total number of qualified ex-offenders who participated in a program and were incarcerated within a 36-month period. The amendment applies to individuals incarcerated within a 36-month period starting from the date of hire under the program, and it is effective for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
