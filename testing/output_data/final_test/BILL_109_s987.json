    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring Safety to Indian Women Act\". Congress acknowledges the high rates of domestic and sexual assaults experienced by Indian women, the lack of data on domestic violence in Indian country, the jurisdiction of Indian tribes and the Federal Government to prosecute offenders, and the limitations of the Major Crimes Act in prosecuting domestic violence. Federal prosecutors can prosecute domestic violence assaults unless they result in serious bodily injury or death. National studies show that domestic violence disturbance calls are the most dangerous for law enforcement officers. Limited arrest authority of Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal law enforcement agencies hinders response to domestic violence. Lack of criminal history information for tribal ordinance offenders hampers efforts to address domestic violence. The purposes of this Act are to obtain data on rates of domestic violence against Indian women, close gaps in Federal laws to address domestic violence, address safety concerns for tribal police officers, and prevent serious injury or death of Indian women.
