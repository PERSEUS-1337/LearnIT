    "content": "The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) created OSHA and the OSHRC to oversee occupational safety and health. OSHA is responsible for enforcing the act, while the OSHRC reviews OSHA enforcement actions. The act has limitations, such as not applying to working conditions regulated by other federal agencies. The OSH Act allows states to control occupational safety and health regulation through state plans if approved by OSHA. It applies only to employment in U.S. states and territories and generally excludes federal, state, or local government employment. The OSH Act applies to employers with employees and mandates workplace safety standards enforced through complaints, inspections, and citations by OSHA. It does not apply to federal, state, or local government employment. OSHA must prove violations of the General Duty Clause or standards with employer knowledge. The General Duty Clause requires employers to provide a safe workplace free from hazards. Congress intended it as a broad catchall provision due to the impracticality of issuing safety standards for every type of employer. The General Duty Clause is a catchall provision by Congress to protect worker health and safety in the absence of specific OSHA standards. Compliance with OSHA standards can preempt the General Duty Clause, but if a standard is inadequate, employers must still comply with the Clause. OSHA must prove that a workplace hazard exists to establish a violation of the General Duty Clause. OSHA must prove that a workplace hazard exists to establish a violation of the General Duty Clause. The clause requires that a workplace condition poses a hazard to an employee, even if there is no actual harm. Feasible means must exist to reduce or eliminate the hazard, and the employer must have actual or constructive knowledge of the hazard for a violation to occur. To establish a violation of the General Duty Clause, OSHA must prove that a workplace condition is a hazard that could potentially injure or kill an employee. The condition must be more than \"utterly implausible\" to cause harm, but there doesn't need to be a significant chance of injury. OSHA must show that the hazard is recognized in the industry or known by the employer to be hazardous. Accepted industry standards or publications acknowledging the hazard can be used as evidence, as well as the employer's actual knowledge of the hazardous condition. OSHA can establish an employer's actual knowledge of a hazardous condition through evidence such as previous accidents, injuries, or employee complaints. Actual knowledge can lead to a General Duty Clause violation even if the industry does not recognize the hazard. If OSHA proves a recognized hazard causing serious harm or death to employees, the probability of harm occurring is irrelevant. OSHRC focuses on the level of harm employees would face in an accident. OSHRC considers the level of physical harm employees would face in an accident, regardless of the probability of the accident occurring. In a case at Waldon Health Care Center, OSHRC found serious harm likely due to the small chance of employees catching Hepatitis B, which can lead to death or serious injury. Previous incidents are not necessary to establish harm, but can be sufficient evidence. Courts generally defer to OSHRC determinations that a recognized hazard is likely to cause serious injury or death. Congress intended the General Duty Clause to protect employees against preventable hazards only. OSHA must prove that a recognized hazard is preventable by showing feasible means of reducing it exist. Litigation on this matter typically unfolds in two steps. OSHA must establish feasible means of abatement to reduce risks to employees. This involves showing specific actions that could materially reduce hazards, such as physical or procedural changes. Feasibility can be demonstrated by industry standards or successful implementations by similar employers. The burden is on OSHA to prove the feasibility of abatement actions. OSHA must establish feasible means of abatement to reduce risks to employees by showing specific actions that could reduce hazards. Employers can rebut OSHA's evidence by proving suggested means of abatement are infeasible or ineffective, such as being cost prohibitive or causing greater harm. The employer presented evidence that extending the casings of a vertical conveyor through the roof of a building to prevent secondary explosions and fires would weaken the roof. OSHRC found OSHA's suggested means of abatement infeasible as it could risk roof collapse. OSHA must prove employer's knowledge of the violation to hold them accountable under the General Duty Clause. OSHRC has held that OSHA does not have to prove that an employer knew the requirements of the act or knew that a condition violated the act to establish an employer's knowledge. Rather, OSHA must show that the employer knew of the physical conditions giving rise to the violation. Proving actual knowledge is generally straightforward: OSHA can do so through evidence showing that the employer knew that the violating condition existed. Demonstrating an employer's constructive knowledge of a violating condition is less straightforward, requiring OSHA to prove that the employer could have known about the condition through reasonable diligence. OSHA can establish constructive knowledge by showing the employer lacked a safety program or the condition was plainly visible. The duration of a violating condition is important in determining discoverability; the longer it exists, the more likely it could have been found through reasonable diligence. For example, in R.P. Carbone Construction Co., employees lacked fall protection for two weeks, which was plainly observable, leading to a finding of lack of reasonable diligence. The employer's lack of fall protection for employees at a site for two weeks could have been discovered through reasonable diligence. A supervisor's knowledge of a condition can be imputed to the employer, except when the supervisor's own conduct caused the violation and it was not foreseeable. The Fifth Circuit ruled that if an employer has safety policies in place, a supervisor's knowledge of their own violative conduct cannot be imputed onto the employer. Employers must comply with OSHA occupational safety and health standards, which include specific and general standards. OSHA bears the burden of proving violations of these standards. OSHA must prove employer violation of standards by showing applicability, non-compliance, and employee access. Knowledge of cited conditions is crucial. OSHRC considers employer activity when determining standard applicability. Employers must determine which OSHA standards apply to their activities, with specific standards taking precedence over general ones. Compliance is required even without OSHA action or citations. Employers must comply with OSHA standards applicable to them, but can obtain exemptions through variances. Variances excuse failure to comply with standards after OSHA grants them, not retroactively. OSHA can grant temporary, permanent, experimental, and national defense variances. The OSH Act allows employers to apply for temporary variances from OSHA standards if they cannot comply by the effective date. Employers must show inability to comply, protection of employees, and a plan for compliance. Employees must be notified and given a chance to participate in a hearing before a variance is granted. The OSH Act allows employers to apply for temporary variances from OSHA standards. Temporary variances expire when the employer complies with the standard or after one year, with the possibility of renewal twice. Employers can also apply for permanent variances under specific conditions, requiring evidence that their practices provide the same level of health and safety protection as compliance with the standard. OSHA must determine this after inspection and, if necessary, a hearing. Before OSHA can grant a permanent variance, affected employees must receive notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, a hearing on the application for a permanent variance. Permanent variances generally do not have an expiration date but can be modified or revoked at any time. OSHA can grant variances for employers to participate in experiments demonstrating novel workplace health and safety techniques, which must be approved by OSHA or the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the OSH Act, OSHA can grant variances for national defense reasons, lasting up to six months with the possibility of renewal. Employers are required to maintain records of workplace injuries and illnesses, report them to OSHA, and disseminate information to employees as per OSHA regulations. The act gives OSHA authority to enforce record-keeping and reporting requirements for workplace incidents. OSHA requires employers to maintain records and report non-minor work-related injuries, deaths, and illnesses. Employers must follow OSHA's recordkeeping regulations for workplace incidents, which apply to most employers with exceptions for those with 10 or fewer employees. The recordkeeping requirements under OSHA do not apply to employers with 10 or fewer employees or those falling within specific low hazard retail, service, finance, insurance, or real estate employer groups. These exempted groups include hardware stores, gasoline service stations, used car dealers, and apparel and accessory stores. Employers with multiple establishments must differentiate between exempted and non-exempted establishments for recordkeeping purposes. Employers with 11 or more employees must maintain workplace injury and illness records for certain establishments, such as factories, but not for exempted establishments like apparel stores. Even if exempt, employers may still need to keep records for surveys or requests from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Records are only required for work-related, new cases of injuries and illnesses as defined by regulations. An injury or illness is work-related if caused, contributed to, or aggravated by a workplace event. Covered employers must keep records of \"new cases\" where the employee has not previously had a similar injury or illness affecting the same body part, or if they have, fully recovered in between. A qualifying injury or illness includes death, days away from work, restricted work, medical treatment beyond first aid, loss of consciousness, or a significant diagnosis by a healthcare professional. Employers are required to report serious work-related injuries to OSHA, including deaths, hospitalizations, amputations, or loss of an eye. Reports must be made within specific timeframes and can be done via telephone or electronic submission at OSHA.gov. Employers must report workplace injury and illness data to OSHA outside of inspections, such as when selected for an annual survey. Selected employers in certain industries must complete and return the survey form to OSHA, even if exempt from injury and illness recordkeeping requirements. OSHA proposed a rule in November 2013 to eliminate the annual survey. OSHA proposed a rule in November 2013 to eliminate the annual survey of employers and instead require them to electronically submit injury and illness data. Employers with 250 or more employees would submit data four times a year, while those with 20 or more employees in designated industries would submit annually. All employers would have to submit data to OSHA if required. Employers, regardless of size, must submit injury and illness information to OSHA upon notification. OSHA will make this information publicly available, excluding data protected by certain laws. Employers are required to communicate employee rights and obligations by displaying OSHA posters, posting injury and illness summaries, citations, and petitions for abatement date modifications. The OSH Act mandates that employers inform employees of their rights and obligations under the act by displaying the OSHA poster at worksites. The poster includes information on reporting hazards, requesting inspections, and accessing OSHA citations. Employers must prominently display the poster in areas where employee notices are typically posted. Employers must post OSHA poster and annual summaries of injury and illness records in conspicuous places. They must also immediately post any citations received in a prominent place. When OSHA issues a citation for violating a safety standard, the employer must post it in a prominent place for affected employees to see. The citation must remain posted until the violation is resolved or for three working days. Contesting the citation does not exempt the employer from posting it, but they can also post a notice explaining their reasons for contesting it. If the employer petitions to change the abatement date, they must also post the petition as required by OSHA regulations. OSHA allows employers to petition to modify the abatement date if they are unable to comply due to factors beyond their control. The employer must post the petition for 10 working days in a visible location for affected employees. OSHA has the authority to inspect worksites, but the entrance and inspection must be reasonable and conducted at reasonable times. OSHA inspections must be conducted at \"reasonable times\" and in a \"reasonable manner,\" with employers having the right to challenge the inspection's reasonableness. Inspections are subject to the Fourth Amendment, requiring a warrant without employer permission. Unreasonable conduct by OSHA can be an affirmative defense for employers, who must prove prejudice from OSHA's actions. The reasonableness of an inspection is determined on a case-by-case basis. The employer reported building code violations to OSHA, leading to an inspection. OSHA cited the employer for the same hazards as the city building inspector, which was deemed unfair. OSHA inspections are limited by the OSH Act and the Fourth Amendment, requiring a warrant for inspection without employer consent. In a specific case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an employer who refused entry to an OSHA inspector citing Fourth Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled that OSHA inspectors generally need a warrant to conduct inspections without employer consent, as mandated by the Fourth Amendment. Inspections can proceed with employer consent or if they meet the requirements of the OSH Act and warrant regulations. OSHA conducts two types of inspections: unprogrammed and programmed. Unprogrammed inspections are initiated in response to specific incidents, such as employee complaints or serious accidents. Employees can request an inspection if they believe there is imminent danger or a violation of health/safety standards. Employees can request an OSHA inspection by submitting a written request detailing the grounds for inspection. OSHA will determine if there are reasonable grounds for the alleged violation. If deemed necessary, OSHA will conduct an inspection; if not, the employee will be informed. Appeals can be made internally, but OSHA's decision is final. OSHA also conducts inspections based on referrals, separate from employee complaints. OSHA conducts inspections based on referrals from third parties, media sources, and other government agencies. Unprogrammed inspections can also result from reports of serious injuries, which employers are required to report. These incidents are thoroughly investigated to determine OSHA compliance. Under the OSH Act, OSHA conducts programmed inspections for specific industries and maintains the Site-Specific Targeting Program for high-risk worksites. Unauthorized advance notice of an inspection can result in fines and prison time. Advance notice is only allowed in specific circumstances according to OSHA regulations. OSHA regulations allow advance notice of inspections only in specific circumstances to ensure compliance with the OSH Act. Inspections are typically conducted during regular working hours, unless special circumstances require otherwise. Inspectors must present credentials, explain the purpose of the inspection, and employers must keep injury and illness records. During an OSHA inspection, the inspector can request injury and illness records from the employer within four hours. Employers and employees can have representatives present during the inspection, with the option for additional representatives if deemed necessary by the inspector. Third parties may also serve as employee representatives if deemed reasonably necessary for an effective inspection. Inspectors have the authority to deny any representative from accompanying them. During a worksite inspection, OSHA inspectors can collect samples, take pictures, consult with employees, and address imminent dangers. If necessary, federal district courts can intervene to restrain dangerous workplace conditions. During an OSHA inspection, inspectors must maintain confidentiality of trade secrets unless disclosure is necessary for enforcement or in legal proceedings. Orders can be issued to protect trade secret information from further disclosure. During a closing conference at the end of an OSHA inspection, the inspector discusses any violations found and informs the employer and employee representatives of their rights and obligations. If violations are identified, citations and penalties may be issued according to the OSH Act. Penalties vary depending on the type of violation, and OSHA reviews the inspector's report to determine the outcome of the inspection. OSHA reviews the inspector's report to determine violations of the OSH Act or OSHA standards. If a violation is found, OSHA must issue a citation within six months, detailing the violation and providing an abatement date. A notice of proposed penalty may also be issued. The OSH Act or OSHA standards violations are categorized into three levels of seriousness: serious, non-serious, and de minimis. Penalties vary based on the violation type and seriousness level. Violations can result in increased penalties for willful violations, failure to abate harm, or repeated violations. A violation is considered serious if there is a \"substantial probability\" of death or serious harm to an employee. Penalties become final if not appealed within 15 working days of notification. Courts and OSHRC have clarified that for OSHA to establish a serious violation, there must be a substantial probability of death or serious harm in realistic circumstances. If an employer is unaware of a violation despite reasonable diligence, it may not be considered serious. Penalties for serious violations are capped at $7,000, while non-serious violations have different penalties. The OSH Act distinguishes between serious and non-serious violations. Non-serious violations under the OSH Act are those that do not have a direct and immediate relationship with occupational health and safety, and do not pose a substantial probability of death or serious harm. OSHA may issue penalties up to $7,000 for non-serious violations, unlike serious violations which have a cap of $7,000. De minimis violations occur when an employer complies with a proposed standard that provides equal or greater employee protection, or deviates slightly from a standard's specific requirements in a way that does not impact safety and health. De minimis violations do not result in citations or penalties under the OSH Act. OSHA issues a notice instead of a citation for these violations, which do not pose a direct threat to employee safety. Willful violations involve intentional disregard or plain indifference to safety requirements. Employers can be found to have willfully violated the OSH Act if they intentionally disregard or show plain indifference towards employee safety requirements. OSHA must prove that the employer's state of mind was such that they would not care about the violation, even if they were aware of it. Employers who reasonably and in good faith believed their conduct was not in violation of the act are not considered to have willfully violated it. It is generally more challenging for OSHA to prove a willful violation of the General Duty Clause compared to an OSHA standard violation. Employers who willfully violate the OSH Act face penalties ranging from $5,000 to $70,000. If a violation causes an employee's death, the employer can be fined up to $10,000 or face imprisonment. Repeat offenders may face higher fines or longer imprisonment. OSHA can issue a Notification of Failure to Abate if an employer fails to correct a cited violation by the abatement date. To prove Abate to withstand review, OSHA must show the original citation became a final OSHA order and the violative conditions still existed upon re-inspection. If OSHA meets its burden, an employer can raise defenses like lack of notice or that the violation did not violate the OSH Act. Failure to Abate can result in a penalty of up to $7,000 per day past the abatement date. Failure to remedy an existing violation that has already been cited can lead to a repeated violation if a new violation is \"substantially similar\" to the previous one. OSHA can establish similarity by showing both violations result from the same standard non-compliance. The burden then shifts to the employer to prove differences in conditions or hazards. Violations of specific standards increase the likelihood of similarity. OSHA can issue penalties of up to $70,000 for repeated violations. Employers have 15 working days to contest a citation or notice of proposed penalty. Employees can protest the abatement date of a citation if they believe the allotted time is unreasonable. The abatement time for employee protests is subject to a 15-working-day constraint, similar to employers' rights. OSHA notifies OSHRC of protests, which then undergo an independent review process. A protest goes to an ALJ, who issues a decision. Parties can petition OSHRC for further review if affected by the ALJ's decision. OSHRC may also review an ALJ's decision at its discretion. If OSHRC does not order review within 30 days, the decision becomes final. After a decision by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), OSHRC issues a final order. Appeals can be made to the U.S. Court of Appeals within 60 days. OSHA can also appeal OSHRC orders. Court of Appeals reviews OSHRC's findings based on substantial evidence."
