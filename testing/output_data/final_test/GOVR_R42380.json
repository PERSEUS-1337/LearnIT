    "content": "Recent developments in China's banking system suggest that the Chinese government is influencing banks to invest in strategic natural resources, potentially giving Chinese companies an unfair advantage in global markets. Concerns also arise about the inefficiencies in lending practices leading to speculative bubbles and non-performing loans, which could impact the economy and potentially affect the United States. China's economic reforms have increased the role of banks in the nation's economy, aligning with the government's economic policy changes. China's banking system is transitioning to a more commercially-driven model, causing concerns about its impact on China's financial system, economy, and the global economy. Some U.S. banks feel Chinese banks have an unfair advantage due to regulatory issues and China's failure to fully open its financial market as agreed upon in its WTO accession agreement. China's banking system is transitioning to a more commercially-driven model, causing concerns about its impact on China's financial system, economy, and the global economy. Some U.S. banks feel Chinese banks have an unfair advantage due to regulatory issues and China's failure to fully open its financial market as agreed upon in its WTO accession agreement. There are concerns about the extent to which China's banks operate based on commercial considerations versus advancing the government's agenda, the efficiency and solvency of China's banking system, and the government's use of banks to subsidize key companies and industries. This report addresses these concerns and their implications for U.S. relations with China and concludes with a discussion of the main implications for Congress. China's banking system in China has evolved from being government-owned and isolated to a more commercially-driven model with multiple institutions and agencies. The objective of banking reforms is to incentivize financial institutions to operate competitively, although government directives still play a significant role. China's banking system has evolved from government-owned to a more commercially-driven model with various categories of banks. These include wholly state-owned banks, equitized commercial banks, local banks with government stockholders, and joint-stock commercial banks with low government ownership. Each category has different characteristics and major banks. China's banking system has evolved to include different categories of banks, such as wholly state-owned policy banks like Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. There are also smaller wholly state-owned policy banks like Bank of Communications, China Development Bank, Export Import Bank of China, and Huaxia Bank. Additionally, there are underground banks in China that operate illegally. China began transforming state-owned banks into joint-stock corporations, a process known as \"equitization.\" Only three wholly state-owned banks remain in China - Agricultural Development Bank of China, China Development Bank, and China Exim Bank. Each bank has a distinct mission, with Agricultural Development Bank supporting agriculture and rural areas, and China Development Bank traditionally raising funds for large infrastructure projects. Plans for China Development Bank's IPO have been on hold for over two years. China Development Bank (CDB) has diversified its investments to become a commercial bank, while China Exim Bank focuses on promoting Chinese exports and importing advanced machinery. Both banks have a board of directors appointed by China's State Council. Five state-owned policy banks have been transformed into joint-stock companies, operating as commercial banks. The five equitized banks in China have majority non-tradable shares held by government entities, including the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance. Tradable shares are sold on stock markets to various investors, including foreign banks. The banks have diversified their financial services after converting to joint-stock companies. The equitized commercial banks in China have diversified their financial services and are investing overseas. The banks operate as for-profit entities with less interference from the central government. Results have been mixed, but these banks are among the most dynamic and innovative in China, dominating the banking sector. Local banks, including city commercial banks, make up a variety of financial institutions in China. City commercial banks in China, also known as \"city commercial banks,\" were initially established by provincial and municipal governments to handle local projects. They have since transformed into joint-stock companies, with local governments often being the largest shareholders. As of 2009, local governments owned an average of 18.5% of shares in these banks, with the majority owned by other Chinese banks, corporations, foreign banks, and a limited number by employees and private investors. There were 147 city commercial banks in China by the end of 2010, according to the CBRC's annual report. City commercial banks in China, smaller in size compared to state-owned policy banks and equitized banks, benefit from ties to local government for handling finances. They excel in assessing local companies' credit-worthiness and compete with larger banks, making them innovative financial institutions. Local banks also include village and township banks, rural commercial banks, and rural credit cooperatives. The Chinese government started transforming rural banks in 2004. The Chinese government began transforming rural credit cooperatives into joint-stock companies in 2004. By the end of 2010, there were various rural financial institutions in China, including village and township banks, rural commercial banks, rural cooperative banks, and rural credit cooperatives. Domestic banks could buy 100% of existing rural credit cooperatives, while private and foreign investors could purchase up to 20%. China Minsheng Bank is the largest Chinese joint-stock commercial bank. China Minsheng Bank, established in Beijing in 1996, is the largest Chinese joint-stock commercial bank. By the end of 2010, there were 360 foreign banking establishments operating in China with combined assets valued at $1.74 trillion yuan. The total banking assets in China were valued at $1.74 trillion yuan by the end of 2010. Local incorporation for foreign banks in China is becoming more attractive due to the emerging product range, including RMB bonds. However, the process is costly, requiring a minimum registered capital of 1 billion yuan plus additional funds for each branch. New regulations mandate locally incorporated banks to maintain a 75% loan-to-deposit ratio by the end of 2011. Illegal entities, such as underground banks and credit guarantee agencies acting as banks, operate in China's financial sector. Some investment brokers and private fund managers in China provide illegal commercial and personal loans, while pawn shops offer illegal banking services. China's underground banks attract deposits with higher rates and help conceal wealth. Small and medium-sized businesses turn to underground banks for loans when legal banks are inaccessible or slow. These underground banks provide credit to individuals and businesses with limited approval chances from legal banks. China's underground banks offer loans at high interest rates, mainly used for short-term borrowing to avoid excessive charges. They resort to unorthodox methods like kidnapping to collect overdue payments. The Chinese authorities have shut down over 500 underground banks since 2002, cracking down on illegal capital flow. The underground banking crisis in Wenzhou, China, involved illegal funds amounting to $31 billion. A central bank survey revealed that 60% of local businesses and most households had loans with underground banks, leading to defaults and businesses being unable to service their loans from legitimate commercial banks. This crisis highlighted the potential impact of underground banks on the regional credit system. The Wenzhou underground banking crisis in China involved illegal funds amounting to $31 billion, leading to defaults and businesses being unable to service their loans to commercial banks. Premier Wen Jiabao, PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, and Finance Minister Xie Xuren visited Wenzhou to assess the situation. The CBRC announced measures to curb the use of underground banks, while the Chinese banking system is dominated by five equitized banks owning nearly half of the sector's total assets. The Chinese banking system is dominated by five equitized banks, with the largest being the Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The 12 joint-stock commercial banks hold 15.6% of the market, while the 147 city commercial banks have 8.2% of banking assets. The over 3,300 rural financial institutions have the third largest share of the market at 11.2%. China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is responsible for formulating and implementing monetary policy. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is responsible for formulating and implementing China's monetary policy. It oversees all banking institutions along with the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). The Ministry of Finance (MoF) manages fiscal policies and the government's budget. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) supervises foreign exchange transactions and reserves. The PBOC was nationalized in 1949 and became a separate entity in 1979, reporting directly to the State Council. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) was nationalized in 1949 and became a separate entity in 1979, reporting directly to the State Council. The banking functions of the PBOC were transferred to state-owned policy banks, which were later transformed into joint-stock commercial banks through \"equitization\". The PBOC's main purpose now is as China's central bank. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is China's central bank with responsibilities including formulating and implementing monetary policy, issuing and regulating the circulation of the renminbi (RMB), regulating financial markets, managing foreign exchange and gold reserves, operating the payment and settlement system, and conducting financial analysis. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) manages monetary policy by setting reserve requirements, discount rates, and controlling the money supply. It also uses benchmark interest rates and credit limits for Chinese banks. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, the PBOC primarily adjusts reserve requirements to signal tightening or loosening bank lending. For example, in response to inflation concerns in 2010 and 2011, the PBOC increased reserve requirements multiple times. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) increased reserve requirements six times in 2010 and another six times in the first half of 2011, resulting in a total increase of 6.0% over 18 months. By June 20, 2011, China's reserve requirement stood at 21.5%. On August 25, 2011, the PBOC expanded deposit reserve requirements to block banks from circumventing the tightening of the money supply. Despite these actions, China's consumer price index (CPI) remained high, reaching 6.5% in July 2011. The PBOC also adjusts benchmark interest rates for deposits and loans, but less frequently than reserve requirements. The PBOC raised benchmark interest rates twice in 2010 and six times in the first half of 2011. On July 7, 2011, the PBOC increased the benchmark interest rate on one-year time deposits to 3.5% and the one-year lending rate to 6.56% to curb inflation. The PBOC historically restricted banks' commercial activities by allocating credit quotas. The PBOC did not publicly announce credit quotas for 2011 but provided banks with growth rate targets of 13 or 14% for credit. Total outstanding loans in China rose by 15.7% in 2011, slightly above the target rate. Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has supported the liberalization of China's banking sector, advocating for market-based interest rate reform. China granted banks more autonomy in setting interest rates since 1992, with financial institutions operating on a commercial basis by 2010. Following the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, China established the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to oversee the country's banks and protect depositors and consumers. Shang Fuling was appointed as CBRC Chairman in 2011, replacing Liu Mingkang. Shang had previously served as Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Shang Fuling, former Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, is now leading the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC). The CBRC aims to cautiously reform China's banking sector, attributing the 2007-2008 global financial crisis to excessive deregulation in the US. Shang's priorities for 2012 include defending the bottom line and improving risk control. The priorities outlined by Chairman Shang for the China Banking Regulatory Commission include defending the bottom line, improving risk control, strengthening external supervision, deepening financial reform, promoting economic restructuring, and closing down illegal financial activities. The Ministry of Finance in China has gradually lost responsibility and authority in the financial sector, with its main functions now focused on fiscal policies, budget administration, tax collection, debt issuance, accounting regulations, data collection, and economic research. The Ministry of Finance in China used to supervise the activities of the PBOC and other financial institutions. It still holds authority over some banks through equity holdings and influence on major banking policies. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange manages China's foreign exchange and reports to the State Council and the PBOC. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) manages China's foreign exchange reserves, approves overseas investments, and keeps investment holdings secret. It primarily invests in U.S. Treasury bonds but is starting to diversify its portfolio. SAFE makes small investments in companies in Australia, France, and the United Kingdom, holding equity positions in companies like Barclays, British Gas, Cadbury, and others. It regulates Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIs) allowing non-Chinese entities to invest in China with an authorized Chinese custodian bank. As of April 2011, SAFE approved $20.69 billion in investment quotas for QFIIs. China Securities Regulatory Commission published draft regulations in 2011 allowing QFIIs to trade in stock index futures for hedging purposes. China agreed to gradually open its financial markets to foreign competitors under its 2001 WTO accession agreement. Foreign banks have national treatment for listed banking services in China, with some exceptions like automobile financing. They can provide various financial services such as accepting deposits, making loans, issuing credit cards, and more. The Chinese government has passed laws and regulations since 2001 to facilitate this opening up of the financial markets. Since 2001, China has implemented WTO obligations by passing laws and regulations for foreign-funded banks. China's State Council issued Decree No. 478 on November 11, 2006, outlining regulations for foreign bank operations in China. The regulations distinguish between different types of foreign banks and their branches, each with specific minimum capital requirements. Foreign-funded banks must have a minimum of 1 billion yuan in registered capital and 100 million yuan in non-callable operating capital, while branches of foreign banks have their own requirements. Foreign banks operating in China must meet specific capital requirements. For example, branches of foreign banks need a minimum of 200 million yuan in operating capital. Owners of foreign-funded banks must have at least $10 billion in assets, while foreign banks establishing a branch in China must have $20 billion in assets. The approval process involves submitting application documents to China's banking regulatory agencies, who must make a decision within six months. Additional information may be required within six months of the initial decision. China's banking regulatory agencies have up to two months to approve or reject the second submission. Foreign banks in China must meet specific capital requirements, with branches needing a minimum of 200 million yuan in operating capital. Foreign banks must have been profitable for two consecutive years prior to applying for services denominated in renminbi. Foreign banks must also comply with asset-liability ratio requirements, including a limit on the ratio of outstanding loans to deposits not exceeding 75 percent. The 2006 regulations provide greater market access to foreign banks in China. The 2006 regulations in China increased market access for foreign banks by eliminating special privileges, such as tax deductions for doubtful debts. Concerns have been raised by the U.S. government and banks about limited market access for U.S. banks and protection of Chinese banks from competition. Despite efforts to comply with WTO obligations, barriers to entry for U.S. banks remain due to China's laws and regulations. The U.S. Trade Representative's assessment of China's WTO compliance was supportive of U.S. banks. Eight U.S. banks were operating in China as of December 2011. Citibank and JPMorgan Chase established subsidiary banks, while others have branches or representative offices. USTR identified four shortcomings in China's fulfillment of WTO obligations related to banking, including capital requirements and foreign equity ownership limitations. The USTR report highlighted concerns about restrictions on foreign banks in China, including limited ownership to 25%, slow approval processes for new banks/branches, and difficulties in accessing renminbi-denominated deposits. U.S. banks operating in China share these concerns and seek full access to the domestic currency business. Some U.S. banks face challenges in meeting the loans-to-deposit ratio due to limited access to renminbi-denominated deposits. Chinese regulators are reportedly requiring U.S. banks to open branches in less desirable cities to expand in more lucrative areas. Despite competition from Chinese banks, some U.S. banks plan to expand in China, with Citigroup aiming for 100 branches in 2-3 years. U.S. banks are particularly interested in expanding into China's \"second-tier\" cities. U.S. banks are keen on expanding into China's \"second-tier\" cities to serve the growing middle class. Regulatory reforms in Chinese banks aim to make them profit-driven institutions, but their relationships with the government remain complex. China's three state-owned policy banks in China have specific functions in the financial markets, similar to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae in the US. The Agricultural Development Bank of China serves the agricultural sector, the China Development Bank finances development projects, and the Export Import Bank of China supports imports and exports. These banks receive capital from the government to operate. The policy banks in China receive capital from the government or issue bonds to raise funds. These bonds are backed by the Chinese government, allowing the banks to raise capital at a lower cost. They provide loans for projects designated by bank management, emphasizing their role in implementing China's State Council policies. President Zheng Hui of the Agricultural Development Bank of China highlighted the bank's successful implementation of China's major economic and financial policies in the 2010 annual report. In China, the Agricultural Development Bank and China Ex-Im Bank focus on supporting agriculture and trade. The ADBC provided loans for agricultural production, while China Ex-Im Bank's activities were trade-related. Both banks aim to improve risk management and adhere to government directives. China Development Bank (CDB) has resisted equitization since 2007 under Chairman Chen Yuan's leadership, expanding its activities beyond financing China's major projects. CDB operates dynamically, acting like a commercial bank when needed and leveraging its policy bank status when advantageous. China Development Bank (CDB), under Chairman Chen Yuan's leadership, has expanded its activities beyond financing major projects, operating dynamically as a policy bank when advantageous. CDB's lending activities have broadened to include providing credit for domestic projects collateralized by local government investment corporations (LICs) and supplying loans for international investments by state-owned entities. China Development Bank (CDB) has expanded its lending activities to include providing credit for domestic projects through local government investment corporations (LICs) and supplying loans for international investments by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), particularly in energy and natural resources. CDB was the first major Chinese bank to finance local infrastructure projects using LICs, allowing local governments to secure loans for projects through land collateralization. China Development Bank (CDB) has been successful in providing credit for domestic projects through local government investment corporations (LICs) and supporting international investments by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The cumulative value of LIC borrowing by the end of 2009 was 11.4 trillion yuan, raising concerns about the strength of China's commercial banks due to high real estate prices and the risk of a property bubble. CDB was also a pioneer in implementing China's \"Going Out\" strategy, providing a $230 million line of credit to Sinochem for acquiring Atlantis in 2003. China Development Bank (CDB) secured a $230 million line of credit to acquire Atlantis, a subsidiary of Norwegian Petroleum Geo-Service (PGS). CDB collaborated with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to draft annual plans for overseas projects, leading to a significant increase in overseas loans to nearly $100 billion by 2009. Additionally, CDB was designated by the State Council to finance the China-Africa Development Fund, aimed at promoting economic cooperation between the two regions. China Development Bank (CDB) has been criticized for its role in securing access to energy and mineral resources in Africa for China, with limited developmental benefits for African countries. The relationships between CDB, the Chinese government, and the companies it lends money to are complex, involving multiple actors with different motivations. Despite media portrayals, the reality is that these transactions serve CDB's agenda of increasing profits, expanding international business, and functioning as a policy bank. China Development Bank (CDB) operates as a policy bank, advancing State Council goals of enhancing China's energy access and diversifying foreign exchange reserves. CDB's loans support China's national oil companies in acquiring assets abroad. After transforming into joint-stock companies, China's equitized banks operate like commercial banks, raising capital through deposits, loans, and IPOs. The equitized banks in China were able to raise capital through an IPO of stock, but the government still maintains control over them. Banking regulations restrict their financial services, credit extension, and interest rates. The 2010 annual reports show that the banks' largest assets were corporate loans, with personal loans mainly being mortgage loans. They also had significant investments in securities and other financial assets. In 2010, China's equitized banks had significant holdings of government and corporate bonds, maintained balances with financial institutions, and had customer deposits as the main liability. The banks took in deposits from corporations, individuals, and other entities, using the funds for loans and investments. The five equitized banks were successful, with the Agricultural Bank of China reporting net profits of 94.9 billion yuan ($14.9 billion) in 2010. In 2010, Chinese equitized banks reported significant profits. Bank of China (BOC) had net profits of 9.7 billion yuan ($1.5 billion), Bank of Communications reported 39.0 billion yuan ($6.1 billion), China Construction Bank (CCB) reported 134.8 billion yuan ($21.2 billion), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) reported 166.0 billion yuan ($26.1 billion). Despite partial privatization, the central government still influences these banks' operations. Bank officers in Chinese equitized banks are appointed by the Communist Party Organization Department and often come from central government or Party agencies. Their career opportunities are tied to official agency assessments, making them more responsive to the central government than shareholders. Central government agencies may pressure bank officials to provide loans for specific projects. Despite claims of operating on a commercial basis, officials report using modern risk assessment procedures for lending practices. Bank officials in Chinese equitized banks are influenced by the PBOC and CBRC to adjust lending practices according to government priorities, such as supporting SMEs or controlling credit growth. Past relations with state-owned and larger private companies impact lending patterns, favoring established corporations. No specific loans to individual companies were mentioned, but banks tend to favor past creditors over new ones. During the 2008 financial crisis, Chinese equitized banks resisted government pressure to lend to SMEs due to perceived higher risk compared to larger companies. The PBOC and CBRC pushed for more loans to SMEs to stimulate the economy, but banks were cautious about non-performing loans and lending to riskier companies. The dynamic between the government and banks mirrored the relationship with CDB. The equitized banks in China strive to balance profit goals with economic policy objectives set by the government. They also consider the financial needs of major clients like SOEs and private corporations to ensure loan repayment and maintain good relations with influential figures. City commercial banks, transformed into private joint stock companies, interact with the government at the provincial or municipal level while being supervised by the PBOC and CBRC. The city commercial banks in China have shares owned by various entities, including local government agencies, investment companies, and individual investors. Share ownership is often concentrated among a small group of shareholders, with the top 10 shareholders holding a significant percentage of the banks' shares. These top shareholders are often investment companies associated with corporations, as well as some local government agencies. For example, the Bank of Chongqing had Dah Sing Bank of Hong Kong as one of its top 10 shareholders. The city commercial banks in China have a board of directors and appointed bank officers responsible for operations. The board includes senior officials from major shareholders and government agencies, with members having experience in banking or local government. The close ties between bank officials and local government suggest responsiveness to local preferences. Financial statements show smaller size and lower reliance on loans compared to equitized banks, with more reliance on investments. The city commercial banks in China rely more on investments like reverse repurchase agreements, with a focus on serving the local business community. They have lower levels of personal deposits compared to equitized banks and maintain financial ties to their region. Leading borrowers are predominantly from the city or province where the banks are located. Harbin Bank has a significant personal loan portfolio focused on mortgages. Some city commercial banks, like Bank of Beijing, Bank of Shanghai, and Bank of Tianjin, have been allowed to open branches outside their home city or province. This indicates a desire for these banks to expand beyond their traditional regional role. Shareholders of China's city commercial banks, including local government agencies and larger corporations, may push for higher profits and returns on investments, creating challenges for bank officers. China's joint-stock commercial banks have a variety of ownership structures. Originally established as commercial banks during China's economic reforms, they were later transformed into joint-stock companies. The original state entities that owned the banks remained major stockholders after the conversion. State entities that owned the bank remained major stockholders after the conversion, with the option to divest their shares. Foreign entities purchased significant holdings in some banks after they listed H shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The number of shareholders varied among the banks, with some having only a few while others had over a million. Major shareholders typically had representation on the bank's board of directors. China's joint-stock commercial banks have senior management appointed by the board of directors, with most having a background in banking. Their balance sheets show similarities to city commercial banks, with loans as the largest assets and significant holdings of reverse repurchase agreements. Deposits are the main liabilities, with some banks having deposits make up over three-quarters of their liabilities. These banks operate on a commercial basis but may face pressure to allocate loans and resources in ways that differ from optimal business practices. China's joint-stock commercial banks have senior management appointed by the board of directors, with most having a background in banking. Their balance sheets show similarities to city commercial banks, with loans as the largest assets and significant holdings of reverse repurchase agreements. Deposits are the main liabilities, with some banks having deposits make up over three-quarters of their liabilities. These banks operate on a commercial basis but may face pressure from government and private shareholders to provide preferential treatment to certain entities. The governance system of all Chinese banks involves senior bank officers appointed by the Chinese Communist Party, who also hold ranks in the government hierarchy. The professional careers of senior bank officers in Chinese joint-stock commercial banks are determined by the CCP, with potential moves into positions within the Party, central or local governments, or other banks based on performance. Board of Directors include senior bank officials, major shareholder appointees, and \"independent directors,\" some of whom are also senior officials in governmental financial agencies or foreign nationals. The board of supervisors for Chinese banks, much like in U.S. banks, oversee senior bank officials, set general policies, and include individuals appointed by the CCP, labor union, major shareholders, and external supervisors. They monitor financial activity, risk management, and performance of bank officials. Some believe China's banks operate as tools of the government, with loans distributed according to government directives. The central government in China interferes in the operations of banks by allocating credit limits, regulating interest rates, and instructing banks to provide credit to selected businesses as part of economic policies. However, recent developments show that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) no longer allocates credit limits to individual banks and banks have more freedom in setting interest rates. The PBOC now controls the money supply through changes in reserve requirements and interest rates. The PBOC no longer sets credit limits for individual banks and interest rate ceilings have been eliminated. Bank managers are finding ways to bypass regulations. Chinese banks have modern risk management systems and allocate resources based on commercial criteria, but are sometimes pressured by the central government to align credit allocation with national economic policy. China's banks have shifted to a commercially based business model, but face pressures from local governments and overseas investors. The CBRC is drafting additional reforms for the governance of commercial banks. The CBRC is drafting reforms for the governance of commercial banks in China, including provisions such as prohibiting shareholder interference, banning preferential loans, and defining duties of the board and senior management. The CBRC is drafting reforms for the governance of commercial banks in China, including requirements for external auditors, performance evaluation and compensation standards, and minimum information disclosure. These guidelines aim to promote risk/return assessments based on international best practices. The adoption of more commercially based management has led to the resurgence of non-performing loans and insolvency fears in China's banking system. China's banks are facing a potential increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) due to unresolved NPLs from the past, new NPLs linked to local government debt, and exposure to underground banking. While stress tests show most banks can withstand a property price drop, city commercial banks are more vulnerable. Regulators are taking steps to prevent a sharp rise in NPLs and discussing how to handle insolvent banks. Government micromanagement led to major banks drowning in NPLs, exacerbated by defaults from local governments and state-owned enterprises. To rescue the banking sector, 1.4 trillion yuan in NPLs were transferred to newly created AMCs at full face value in 1999 and 2000. In 2004 and 2005, a second round of NPLs totaling 1.6 trillion yuan were transferred to the AMCs at a discount. The total NPL transfers from Chinese banks to the AMCs eventually reached nearly 3.6 trillion yuan. The AMCs were tasked with recovering the debt through various means and were to be disbanded after 10 years. Each AMC received 10 billion yuan in initial capital from the Ministry of Finance. The AMCs issued bonds in 2000 to raise capital, with major banks buying them to bring NPLs back onto their books. PBOC provided loans to AMCs, who tried to recover NPL value by selling loan portfolios to investors like Bank of America and Citigroup. Recovery rate fell below expectations, with AMCs disposing of 866.3 billion yuan by 2006. The CBRC reported a 30% recovery rate for the four AMCs, which had disposed of 866.3 billion yuan in loans with a cash recovery of 180.6 billion yuan. China's banking officials decided to reevaluate the AMCs' operations, leading to changes allowing them to engage in a broader range of asset management activities and selling minority interests to domestic investors. Three major Chinese banks acquired significant shares in dubious AMC bonds, raising concerns about their financial strength. Despite government efforts to improve banks' balance sheets, unresolved NPLs resurfaced as AMC bonds, posing ongoing financial risks. China's banks face challenges from unresolved loans and potential financial troubles. The source of potential financial troubles for China's banks stems from the post-global financial crisis stimulus program, flaws in local government financing, and credit decisions. A new local finance innovation called \"local government funding platforms\" is contributing to a possible increase in NPLs for China's banks. The 2008 global financial crisis led to a 4 trillion yuan stimulus program by the Chinese government to boost economic growth and infrastructure investment. Local governments in China faced challenges funding 70% of the stimulus program due to limited ways to raise revenues. Unable to issue bonds, they utilized \"local government funding platforms\" where separate entities called \"local investment companies\" were created to finance projects. These companies were granted land or development rights by the local governments. Local investment companies (LICs) in China were granted land use or development rights by local governments to raise capital through loans or bonds. By June 2011, 6,576 LICs had accumulated a total debt of 4.97 trillion yuan. These companies borrowed 6 trillion yuan by September 2009, with 14% of new credit in China in 2009 going to local government funding platforms. The loans were often collateralized by the underlying land value. China's credit market struggled to absorb the national stimulus program, leading to inflated real estate prices and excessive provision of credit by banks to local government funding platforms. The national stimulus program in China led to inflated real estate prices and excessive provision of credit by banks to local government funding platforms. Bank managers initially favored larger state-owned enterprises for credit, prompting the PBOC to urge banks to distribute credit more evenly. However, banks struggled to assess the risks of the increasing loan volume, leading to a potential rise in non-performing loans. In 2011, the City of Wenzhou faced economic challenges despite being a pioneer in private enterprise development in China. The Wenzhou financial crisis in China during the 1980s involved private entrepreneurs fleeing town to escape creditors due to financial ruin from loans obtained through \"underground banks.\" Premier Wen Jiabao and PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan visited the city to address the crisis, revealing vulnerabilities in China's banking system. Private companies turned to underground banks for credit, with estimates of the market size reaching up to 4 trillion yuan ($630 billion). The \"underground\" loan market in Wenzhou varied in size, reaching up to 4 trillion yuan ($630 billion) with interest rates as high as 180%. However, the CBRC estimated rates between 14% to 70%, compared to 7% to 8% offered by Chinese banks. A survey found 89% of households and 60% of businesses in Wenzhou were involved in underground banking. The unregulated nature of these banks allowed for rapid growth before the Wenzhou financial crisis. The tightening of monetary policy in China reduced credit availability, leading to speculative behavior in real estate and stocks. Businesses and individuals engaged in underground lending at higher interest rates, including government officials and bank officers. The collapse of underground banks in Wenzhou posed a threat to China's banking system. The collapse of underground banks in Wenzhou led to a rise in non-performing loan rates for Chinese banks. Concerns about underground banking resurfaced before Chinese New Year, with China Daily publishing multiple stories on the credit crunch for private enterprises and the government's response to economic problems. The collapse of underground banks in Wenzhou caused a surge in non-performing loan rates for Chinese banks. Concerns about underground banking resurfaced before Chinese New Year, with China Daily reporting on the credit crunch for private enterprises and the government's response. The CBRC took early action in 2009 by warning banks and local governments about the potential rise of NPLs and requiring commercial banks to review and restructure loans to reduce non-payment risks. Additionally, stress tests were conducted on China's banks to assess their stability. The CBRC conducted stress tests on China's banks to assess their ability to withstand a decline in property values. Initial tests in 2009 showed a 30% drop would increase NPL rates by 2.2% and reduce profits by 20%. Subsequent tests in 2011 examined a 50-60% drop, with Chairman Liu Mingkang stating banks could handle a 40% decrease. New requirements were introduced for managing lending practices. The CBRC introduced new requirements for Chinese banks' lending practices, known as the \"Three Rules and One Guideline,\" to tighten loan management. The rules aim to control credit dispersal, provide credit only as needed, enforce loan contracts, and supervise loans throughout the lending process. Additionally, a pilot program approved by the State Council allows certain provinces and municipalities to issue bonds for fundraising. The pilot program supervised by the Ministry of Finance allows local governments to issue bonds. Each local government has been given a bond quota, with the potential for expansion to more local governments. China's financial regulators have taken steps to monitor and regulate underground banking risks, including providing financial stability support to banks and companies affected by the Wenzhou crisis. Firewalls have been established to reduce exposure to underground banking risks. China's financial leaders are considering long-term solutions to underground banking risks, with PBOC Governor Zhou mentioning the role of \"informal financing\" in supporting the real economy. Suggestions include developing long-term finance vehicles, registering private loans, and training banks to assess risks better. Despite concerns, China's banking sector was deemed strong at the end of 2010, with all major banks profitable and a low NPL rate. China's banking sector showed a profit with a low NPL rate, but signs of underlying problems persisted. Net profits increased by 34.5% while NPL values decreased by 12.8%. China's NPL ratio was 1.0%, higher than Hong Kong and Taiwan but lower than South Korea and Thailand. Some Chinese banks reported a notable increase in overdue loans, raising concerns for the CBRC and market analysts. Only the Agricultural Bank of China did not report a rise in overdue loans among the equitized banks. The National Audit Office revealed that local government debt in China exceeded 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) by the end of 2010, with Moody's estimating it could be as high as 14.2 trillion yuan ($2.2 trillion). Moody's warned that 1.84 trillion yuan ($290 billion) of the debt would become due in 2012, urging China to develop a plan to avoid a rise in NPL rates for banks. Fitch Ratings predicted China's NPL rate could reach 5% to 15% depending on the government's response. The NPL rate in China is projected to rise to 15% in the next few years, with the potential for it to reach 12% according to a Credit Suisse study. Financial institutions are concerned about local government debt creating a major NPL problem, prompting China's financial regulators to prepare additional measures to address the issue. The CBRC has urged banks to prevent loan risks associated with local government funding platforms and to strictly follow government policies. The Ministry of Finance is considering transferring debt from local governments to the central government and new companies. The CBRC is looking into new regulations tying a bank's reserve requirement to its loan portfolio quality. Other initiatives include reforming laws on insolvent financial institutions, establishing a deposit insurance system, and deregulating interest rates. The CBRC may also extend bank loans to local governments long-term. These changes aim to hold banks accountable for their financial responsibilities. The Chinese government is implementing banking reforms to make banks responsible for their financial situation and reduce the central government's exposure to potential costs. Allegations of Chinese banks providing subsidized loans to state-owned enterprises have been made, but the government claims recent reforms have ended these practices. Scholars argue that lending patterns post-2007 financial crisis show evidence of change. The Chinese government's banking reforms have shifted lending patterns post-2007 financial crisis, indicating a move away from directing banks to provide preferential credit to state-owned enterprises. Allegations of bank subsidies to SOEs have raised concerns about unfair trade practices, with the U.S. government presenting evidence to support these claims. The U.S. government has presented evidence to the WTO alleging that China is providing subsidies through credit, with specific cases of preferential policies and loan subsidies. The documents require Chinese banks to review credit applications for government programs promoting scientific projects or hi-tech enterprises based on commercial criteria. Allegations of preferential loan programs for Chinese enterprises are also found in CVD petitions submitted to the ITA. The ITA assessments found insufficient evidence to investigate loan subsidy claims, including preferential loans to SOEs and export-oriented enterprises. A notable CVD case in 2007 involved coated free sheet paper from China, where China's history of non-performing loans to SOEs was cited as evidence of its non-market economy status. However, economic reforms, including banking system reforms, were noted as steps towards market economy status. China's economic reforms, including reforms of its banking system, are seen as sufficient to consider CVD petitions against China. Scholars and analysts argue that Chinese banks provide preferential loans to state-owned enterprises. State-owned banks are required to make loans at below market interest rates and forgive those loans. SOEs in China have significant advantages due to their access to credit and debt forgiveness from state-owned banks. According to experts, China's state-owned banks provide significant financial subsidies to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through concessional export credits and export credit guarantees, totaling up to $100 billion annually. This is achieved through interest rate controls and lending bias, resulting in de facto subsidization of SOEs. Additionally, the lack of emergence of non-state financial institutions has perpetuated these unintended subsidies. The emergence of non-state financial institutions has perpetuated unintended subsidies in China. Economist Adam S. Hersh highlighted the influence of local government officials in directing credit allocation by Chinese banks, supporting both government-owned and private-owned companies for economic and export growth. Not all domestic bank credit supports state-owned enterprises (SOEs) non-commercially, with firms receiving bank loans in China showing higher productivity. The book \"Inside China, Inc.\" by Erica Downs discusses the role of China Development Bank (CDB) in overseas investments by Chinese enterprises in energy and natural resources. CDB balances profitability with advancing Chinese government policy priorities, accepting lower interest rates due to government backing. Chinese officials acknowledge past government involvement in loan allocation to state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The government previously played an active role in allocating loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with preferential terms. However, Chinese commercial banks now autonomously decide on commercial loans. Xiao Gang, chairman of the Bank of China, refutes claims of government intervention in bank lending, stating that major state-owned banks have undergone equitization and reform. Xiao Gang, chairman of the Bank of China, denies government intervention in bank lending practices, emphasizing that major state-owned banks have autonomously increased lending without government orders. He asserts that decisions are made by the board or management, refuting claims of preferential loans to selected enterprises by the Chinese government. The Chinese government is suspected of providing preferential loans to selected enterprises, particularly state-owned enterprises (SOEs), through directing banks to offer lower interest rates. Evidence shows that a significant portion of credit is extended to SOEs, indicating possible government subsidies. In 2001, state-owned commercial banks allocated most new loans to SOEs, totaling 67.5% of total new loans. Observers suggest that SOEs received preferential credit access post-2007 crisis, but Nicholas R. Lardy argues that bank loans in 2009-10 benefitted private firms and households as well. The Chinese government has taken steps to address criticisms of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) receiving a disproportionate share of commercial credit. A new regulation issued by the CBRC in October 2011 incentivizes Chinese banks to offer loans to small enterprises by allowing deductions for loans under 5 million yuan and reducing the weight of these loans in calculating asset risk. The goal is to increase the growth rate of loans to small enterprises above the national average. Chinese banks allocate credit based on various factors, including government control and historical lending practices. Policy banks prioritize national development projects, while commercial and city banks tend to favor known clients like large SOEs and local governments. This leads to a perception of Chinese banks subsidizing SOEs. Chinese banks have historically provided loans to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) at lower interest rates compared to other types of companies in China. Prior to financial reforms in 1997, the government fixed interest rates for bank loans, with SOEs receiving loans at lower rates than other enterprises. Interest rates on loans were gradually liberalized in the following years, allowing banks to set their own rates. Interest rates on loans in China were gradually liberalized, with banks determining rates within a range set by the PBOC. The ceiling on interest rates was eventually eliminated, but a benchmark rate was still set. Caixin reported that SOEs had an average interest rate of 1.6%, while private companies had 5.4%. The study covered the years 2001 to 2005 and calculated the effective interest rate paid on loans by dividing declared interest payments by outstanding loan value for each enterprise. The Unirule report compared effective interest rates of SOEs and private enterprises, showing variations from 2.46% to 2.86% for SOEs and 3.81% to 4.84% for private enterprises. The difference between the two ranged from 0.95% to 2.41% over five years. A 2009 study by the Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Policy found that SOEs were charged 225 basis points less than private companies and 157 basis points less than the average interest rate in the sample. The authors found that State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) have lower costs of debt compared to private enterprises, with the difference attributed to factors like asset size. If SOEs were to pay market interest rates, their profits would be wiped out, indicating they still benefit from credit subsidies. The authors also highlight issues related to the alleged subsidization of SOEs by Chinese banks. The study discusses the alleged subsidization of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) by Chinese banks, pointing out that SOEs in China are reluctant to pay back their loans. The relationship between SOCBs and SOEs has been politically influenced, affecting credit allocation. Lardy suggests that the seemingly low interest rate loans provided by Chinese banks to SOEs are due to fixed deposit rates with a margin. China's government policy of low interest rates on deposits indirectly affects interest rates on loans due to competition among banks. There are plans to liberalize interest rates, but the timing and method are uncertain. PBOC Governor Zhou advocates for market-based interest rate reform to give financial institutions autonomy in pricing their products. Financial institutions, except policy ones, operate commercially with pricing autonomy. China's banking system operates on a commercial basis with pricing autonomy. Efforts are being made to promote market-based reform of interest rates, with calls to remove interest rate ceilings on deposits. This could have implications for Sino-U.S. relations and Congress, as China's credit policies have been criticized for subsidizing Chinese companies and hindering U.S. competitiveness in global markets. China's banking system in China is undergoing reforms to liberalize its financial sector, potentially creating opportunities for U.S. banks. Congress may explore ways to encourage banking reforms in China to facilitate market penetration for U.S. banks. Currently, U.S. entities can address inappropriate bank subsidies in China by submitting a CVD petition. The 112th Congress may consider modifying U.S. laws governing CVD petitions to address inappropriate bank lending practices, including preferential loans and unwarranted credit provision. Congress may also press the Obama Administration to respond to allegations of bank subsidization at international meetings. Additionally, Congress may ask the U.S. Department of the Treasury to investigate Chinese banks' lending practices to determine their impact on Chinese enterprises and investment. The 112th Congress may consider modifying U.S. laws governing CVD petitions to address inappropriate bank lending practices in China. Premier Wen Jiabao called for banking reforms in China, while PBOC Governor Zhou prioritized financial stability in monetary policy. The balance between reforms and stability remains uncertain. Wen's proposed banking reforms in China could open up opportunities for U.S. financial service providers. Discussions on China's banking sector reforms and compliance with WTO agreements are likely to continue in future bilateral talks. China may raise concerns about market access for its banks in the U.S., citing complex approval procedures and alleged discrimination. The 111th Congress passed legislation related to these issues. The 111th Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, creating a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and consolidating bank regulation. China closely monitored this act and its impact on U.S. compliance with Basel III. Potential reforms in China's financial system may be influenced by lessons learned from the Dodd-Frank Act. The role of the 112th Congress in this issue is yet to be determined. Congress is advised on major bilateral meetings like the S&ED and the JCCT. The USTR must report annually on China's WTO compliance. Congress could hold hearings on China's financial reforms and consider legislation to ensure China fulfills WTO obligations in opening its financial services sector to foreign banks."
