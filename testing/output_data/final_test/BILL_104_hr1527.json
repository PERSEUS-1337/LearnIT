    "content": "SKI AREA PERMIT RENTAL CHARGE. The Secretary of Agriculture charges rental fees for ski area permits on National Forest System lands. Rental charges are calculated based on specific acts and permit types, with the option for permittees to choose a different calculation method. The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) is calculated based on the permittee's gross revenues from lift ticket/ski area pass sales, ski school operations, and revenue from ancillary facilities on National Forest System land. The final rental charge is determined by multiplying the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) by specific percentages for each revenue bracket. The ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula is based on specific percentages of adjusted gross revenue, ranging from 1.5% for revenue below $3,000,000 to 4.0% for revenue exceeding $50,000,000. This formula is used to calculate the permit fee for ski area operations on National Forest System land. The SAPF formula for ski area permit fees is based on adjusted gross revenue percentages, ranging from 1.5% to 4.0%. The rental charge for ski areas on national forest lands is calculated based on slope transport feet percentage and adjusted gross revenue figures, which are annually adjusted based on the national Consumer Price Index. The Secretary must report to the Committee on these adjustments. The Secretary must report annually to Congress on whether the ski area permit rental charge is fair market value and provide recommendations for any modifications. The rental charge is due on June 1 each year and can be paid on a schedule determined by the Secretary in consultation with the permittee. The payment schedule should align with the permittee's schedule prior to the enactment of this Act to reduce costs. The Secretary shall provide the permittee with standardized forms and worksheets each year for rental charge calculation. The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this section shall become effective on June 1, 1996, covering receipts retroactive to June 1, 1995. Rental charges paid prior to the enactment of this Act will be credited towards the new rental charge due on June 1, 1996. The rental charge for individual permittees will be based on the higher of the previous year's charge or the calculation according to the new Act for the upcoming permit years. Adjusted gross revenue for 1995-1996 will also be considered. If an individual permittee's adjusted gross revenue falls more than 10 percent below the base year, the rental charge paid shall be calculated according to the Act. Revenue from operations on non-national forest land shall not be included in the rental charge calculation. Terms \"revenue\" and \"sales\" refer to actual income and exclude certain items to reduce administrative costs. In cases where a ski area permittee does not have revenue qualifying for rental charge payment, they must pay an annual minimum rental charge of $2 per national forest acre. If the new rental charge results in an increase greater than one half of one percent of the permittee's adjusted gross revenue, it will be phased in over a five year period. This is to reduce federal costs in administering the provisions. To reduce federal costs, reissuing a ski area permit for similar activities does not require a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. SEC. 2. WITHDRAWALS. All lands within ski area permits issued under specific Acts are automatically withdrawn from mining and leasing laws for the permit's duration. Upon permit expiration, the withdrawal is canceled, and the land is restored for appropriation under public land laws. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 30, 1996."
