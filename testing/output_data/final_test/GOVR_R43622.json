    "content": "Federal regulations are a significant means by which statutes are implemented, often resulting from congressional delegation of rulemaking authority to agencies. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) is a notable example of this delegation, with over 40 provisions explicitly requiring or permitting the issuance of rules. These rules have a major impact on how the ACA is implemented, as highlighted by experts who emphasize the importance of effective implementation for the success of the legislation. The ACA requires effective implementation through federal or state officials writing regulations and making appointments. Congress delegates rulemaking authority to agencies, determining their discretion in crafting rules. Some ACA provisions are specific, while others permit agencies to issue rules at their discretion. The ACA grants agencies the authority to issue regulations and establish guidance for implementing the legislation. Rulemaking and lawmaking are considered equivalent, with agencies effectively legislating when issuing rules. Congressional oversight ensures delegated authority is exercised appropriately. Oversight of rulemaking under the ACA involves monitoring the substance and process of rule issuance by agencies. Congress can track upcoming rules by reviewing the Unified Agenda published by the Regulatory Information Service Center. This helps Congress conduct effective oversight of regulations issued under the ACA. The Unified Agenda, published by the General Services Administration (GSA) for the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), helps agencies meet transparency requirements under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866. It ensures agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register, involving the public and resolving conflicts early in the regulatory process. The executive order requires agencies to involve the public and officials in regulatory planning. Each agency must prepare a regulatory plan for significant actions expected in the upcoming fiscal year, listed in the Unified Agenda in three categories: active, proposed, and final rule stages. The Unified Agenda categorizes regulatory actions into \"active,\" \"completed,\" and \"long-term\" actions. Entries include data elements like the issuing agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action description, timetable, and priority level. There are no penalties for issuing a rule without prior notice. The Spring 2014 edition of the Unified Agenda, published on May 23, 2014, is the seventh edition compiled and issued by RISC since enactment of the ACA. It helps Congress and the public know about upcoming regulatory actions, providing federal agencies with a systematic method to alert the public about their proposed rules. Federal agencies submit data to RISC prior to publication, with some items possibly updated during the OIRA review process. The Spring 2014 edition of the Unified Agenda, published on May 23, 2014, provides information on upcoming proposed and final rules and long-term regulatory actions expected to be issued pursuant to the Affordable Care Act in the next 12 months. Agencies reported 14 proposed rules, 17 final rules, and four long-term regulatory actions related to the ACA. The details of these upcoming rules and actions are listed in the report's Appendix. The Spring 2014 edition of the Unified Agenda listed 14 ACA-related rules in the \"proposed rule stage,\" with ten expected to be issued by components of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) each issued one rule. Two proposed rules were expected from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The final two proposed rules will be issued jointly by CMS, DOL's EBSA, and Treasury's IRS. Notable rules under the ACA may be listed in the agency's regulatory plan or meet specific statutory or executive order definitions of significance. Executive Order 12866 mandates agencies to include important regulatory actions in the fall edition of the Unified Agenda. The Spring 2014 Unified Agenda listed three economically significant rules to be issued by CMS, including rules on long-term care facilities, benefit and payment parameters. None of the proposed rules were included in the regulatory plan. The agencies listed upcoming proposed rules, including an HHS/OIG rule on Medicare and State Health Care Programs fraud and abuse, an HHS/CMS rule on State Option To Provide Health Homes for Enrollees With Chronic Conditions, and an HHS/OCR rule on Nondiscrimination Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The upcoming proposed rules include various regulations such as \"Refugee Medical Assistance,\" \"Amendments to Regulations Under the Americans With Disabilities Act,\" and \"Ninety-Day Waiting Period Limitation.\" These rules may impact small entities and are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Several proposed rules impacting small entities have been published, including regulations on long-term care facilities, Medicaid programs, Americans with Disabilities Act, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, excepted benefits, and waiting period limitations. Additionally, rules on Medicare and state health care programs fraud and abuse have been proposed by HHS/OIG. Several proposed rules impacting small entities have been published, including regulations on long-term care facilities, Medicaid programs, Americans with Disabilities Act, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, excepted benefits, and waiting period limitations. An HHS/OIG rule on \"Fraud and Abuse; Revisions to the Office of Inspector General's Exclusion Authorities\" and an HHS/CMS, DOL/EBSA, and TREAS/IRS rule on \"Ninety-Day Waiting Period Limitation Under the Affordable Care Act\" have been issued. Additional upcoming proposed rules include an HHS/CMS rule on \"Reform of Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities and Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (QAPI) Program\" and EEOC rules on \"Amendments to Regulations Under the Americans With Disabilities Act\" and \"Amendments to Regulations Under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.\" Other proposed rules listed in the Unified Agenda are expected to be issued in 2014 or 2015. The Spring 2014 edition of the Unified Agenda listed 17 upcoming final rules to be issued by various agencies such as HHS, FDA, CMS, TREAS/IRS, DOL's OSHA, ATBCB, and VA. Notable upcoming final rules include three ACA regulations. The final rules listed in the Unified Agenda include two HHS/FDA rules on food labeling and an ATBCB rule on accessibility standards for medical diagnostic equipment. Seven entries in the final rule section are considered economically significant or major. The agency plans to publish several rules in the coming months, including those on food labeling in vending machines and restaurants, face-to-face requirements for home health services, covered outpatient drugs, prospective payment system for health centers, adoption of operating rules for HIPAA transactions, and eligibility notices.

The HHS/CMS plans to publish rules on various topics, including reporting and returning overpayments, Medicare Shared Savings Program, eligibility notices, and third-party payment of Qualified Health Plan premiums. Some rules have already been published, while others are expected to be released soon. The HHS/CMS plans to publish rules on various topics, including reporting and returning overpayments, Medicare Shared Savings Program, eligibility notices, and third-party payment of Qualified Health Plan premiums. An additional five upcoming final rules were expected to be issued in May or June 2014, but had not yet been issued as of June 19, 2014. The remaining final rules listed in the Unified Agenda are expected to be issued sometime during 2014 or 2015. The Spring 2014 edition of the Unified Agenda listed four long-term actions related to the ACA, with unclear expected dates for these actions. These actions include proposed rules on \"340B Civil Monetary Penalties for Manufacturers,\" \"340B Drug Pricing Program; Administrative Dispute Resolution Process,\" \"340B Ceiling Price Regulations,\" and an \"undetermined\" action on \"Automatic Enrollment in Health Plans of Employees of Large Employers Under FLSA Section 18A.\" None of these rules were considered \"major\" or \"economically significant.\" The agencies considered two actions to be \"other significant\" under Executive Order 12866, not expected to be \"economically significant\": an HHS/HRSA rule on \"340B Drug Pricing Program; Administrative Dispute Resolution Process\" and a DOL/EBSA \"undetermined\" action on \"Automatic Enrollment in Health Plans of Employees of Large Employers Under FLSA Section 18A.\" None of the long-term actions were expected to impact small entities, possibly due to the preliminary nature of the rules. Congressional oversight ensures agency rules align with legislative intent and rulemaking requirements. The Unified Agenda is a key tool for Congress to oversee rules issued under the ACA. Congress can conduct oversight through hearings, meetings with agency officials, and requesting evaluations from the Government Accountability Office. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review and potentially disapprove federal agencies' final rules through expedited legislative procedures. Covered rules under the CRA include various types of documents that agencies make binding on the public. Congress can use the expedited procedures specified in the CRA to disapprove these rules after they are submitted by agencies. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove federal agencies' rules using expedited procedures. Congress can present CRA resolutions of disapproval to the President for signature or veto. However, the CRA has been rarely used in the past 18 years, as it may be challenging to overturn a presidential veto. Congress can also use regular legislative procedures to disapprove rules, but it may be more difficult to enact such legislation. Congress has the power to influence the regulatory process through provisions in agencies' appropriations bills. These provisions can include restrictions on certain rules, regulatory activities, or enforcement. This legislative strategy stems from Congress's control over agency actions and the necessity of appropriations bills to pass. The use of regulatory appropriations restrictions by Congress has varied over time. The report's Appendix contains a table listing proposed and final rules from the Spring 2014 Unified Agenda. It includes details such as the issuing department, rule title, abstract, and expected issuance date. Entries are organized by agency and only include rules related to the Affordable Care Act."
