While pipelines are generally safe, they can pose risks due to the transportation of hazardous materials. Concerns have been raised about the potential for physical attacks and cyber infiltration on pipeline systems, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Cyber infiltration of SCADA systems in U.S. pipelines has raised concerns about potential disruptions and attacks. Recent incidents and heightened congressional concern have highlighted the need for cybersecurity measures. TSA has the authority to regulate pipeline security but has not issued specific regulations yet. The need for cybersecurity regulations for pipelines, including the debate between mandatory regulations and voluntary measures, is a key concern. Federal programs and private sector initiatives addressing pipeline cybersecurity are reviewed in this report. The pipeline sector is vulnerable to intentional damage by physical or cyber attacks on SCADA systems. Federal security warnings have identified pipelines as potential terror targets in the United States since 9/11. Attention was initially focused on physical threats, but cybersecurity risks are now a significant concern. Several actual plots involving physical pipeline attacks on U.S. soil have been reported, including instances where Al Qaeda encouraged attacks on U.S. pipelines using weapons or explosives. Members of a terrorist group were arrested for planning to blow up jet fuel pipelines at JFK Airport, and a U.S. citizen was convicted of conspiring with Al Qaeda to attack pipelines in Alaska and the eastern U.S. In separate incidents, individuals were arrested for planting explosive devices under natural gas pipelines in Oklahoma and Texas. The January 2011 federal threat assessment concluded that the terrorist threat to the U.S. pipeline industry is low, but there are concerns about cyber threats to SCADA systems used in pipeline networks. SCADA systems collect real-time data for monitoring and controlling network operations. SCADA systems in the pipelines sector collect real-time data from sensors throughout the network to control equipment like valves and pumps. The system provides continuous feedback and safety alarms for operating conditions. Communication links can use various methods like landlines, wireless, and the Internet. With advancements, SCADA technology now requires less human intervention and uses more intelligent automation. SCADA systems in pipeline operations are becoming more vulnerable to outside intrusion due to advancements in technology. Specific security weaknesses include standardized control system technologies with known vulnerabilities, increased connection to external networks, insecure communication connections, and the public availability of sensitive information. Once accessed by a knowledgeable attacker, a SCADA system can be exploited in various ways. A SCADA system in pipeline operations can be exploited by a knowledgeable attacker in several ways, including issuing unauthorized commands, sending false information, disrupting control system operation, making unauthorized changes to software, and propagating malicious software. These cyber attacks could potentially disrupt pipeline service, damage equipment, or cause hazardous releases into the environment. Several recent pipeline accidents in the United States have been linked to SCADA-related problems, leading to catastrophic consequences. In 2010, a natural gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, CA, resulted in 8 deaths, 60 injuries, and 37 homes destroyed due to erroneous SCADA pressure readings. Another incident in Marshall, MI, saw a pipeline spill release 819,000 gallons of crude oil into a river, with SCADA control center deficiencies contributing to the delayed spill response. The mishandling of pressure alarms delayed spill response and increased spill size in a 1999 gasoline pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA. SCADA system unresponsiveness led to operational problems and pipeline failure. In 2012, cyber intrusions targeted U.S. natural gas pipeline operators, posing risks of physical consequences from cyber attacks. In 2011, McAfee reported coordinated cyber attacks originating from China against global energy companies, involving spear-phishing and exploitation of software vulnerabilities. The Stuxnet worm, identified in 2010, targeted specific Siemens industrial SCADA systems and was developed through a joint US-Israeli effort to target Iranian computer systems. The Stuxnet worm, developed through a joint US-Israeli effort, targeted Iranian computer systems and may serve as a model for future malicious programs. Computer security specialists warn of new software tailored to exploit SCADA system weaknesses. Pipeline SCADA systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber threats, but federal agencies and operators have programs in place to address these risks. The US pipeline security program was initiated after the September 11, 2001 attacks. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 established the Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Transportation (DOT) after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks. The agency was later transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. TSA is responsible for regulating pipeline security in collaboration with the DOT, as directed by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has primary responsibility and regulatory authority for the security of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines in the United States. The Pipeline Security Division (PSD) within TSA's Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement (OSPIE) leads pipeline security activities with 13 employees funded by TSA's general budget. TSA's regulatory activities rely on voluntary industry compliance with security guidance and best practices, including cybersecurity provisions. TSA conducts security reviews of the largest pipeline operators to evaluate their security plans and facilities. The DHS and TSA work with pipeline operators to ensure compliance with security guidance and cybersecurity measures. The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and the American Petroleum Institute have their own cybersecurity guidelines for pipeline control systems. Operators participate in DHS-sponsored cybersecurity training. The Department of Energy operates the National SCADA Test Bed Program in partnership with national laboratories to address control system security challenges in the energy sector. Sandia Laboratories also conducts defensive cybersecurity assessments for government, military, and commercial customers. Congress has raised concerns about the adequacy of TSA's voluntary approach to pipeline security and cybersecurity. The Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 required the DOT Inspector General to assess security standards for gas and oil pipelines. The 2008 IG's report highlighted that TSA's security guidance is not mandatory and needs covert testing of cybersecurity measures, including SCADA systems and sensitive information protection. The 2008 IG's report emphasized the need for mandatory cybersecurity regulations for pipelines, as proposed in the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. However, the pipeline industry has expressed concerns about the redundancy and necessity of such regulations. TSA's authority to regulate pipeline cybersecurity is already in place, and voluntary measures may be preferred over mandatory regulations. Enhancing security without imposing regulatory requirements is a focus for TSA officials regarding pipeline security. They argue that current security measures are sufficient and that mandatory regulations could be counterproductive. TSA believes in achieving better security through voluntary guidelines and maintaining a cooperative relationship with industry partners. The Energy Sector Control Systems Working Group emphasizes the limitations of cybersecurity standards in securing the energy sector against evolving risks. Compliance with standards may not be enough to prevent cyber intrusions, requiring additional management practices, performance metrics, and intelligence access for effective cybersecurity programs. TSA's voluntary approach to pipeline security is deemed sufficient, but Canadian authorities may require more support measures for maximum effectiveness. Canadian pipeline regulators have mandated security regulations for petroleum and natural gas pipelines, including cross-border pipelines serving export markets in the United States. The National Energy Board of Canada adopted cybersecurity standards into regulations due to the critical importance of energy infrastructure protection. The Canadian pipeline system is smaller and operated by fewer companies compared to the U.S. system. Canada has mandated security regulations for its smaller pipeline system, raising questions about why the U.S. has not done the same. The TSA's Pipeline Security Division has limited capabilities with only 13 full-time employees and lacks specialized computer system expertise for cybersecurity activities. Congress has expressed concerns about the resources available for the nation's pipeline security program. The TSA's Pipeline Security Division has limited capabilities with only 13 full-time employees and lacks specialized computer system expertise for cybersecurity activities. Congress has expressed concerns about the resources available for the nation's pipeline security program, questioning whether the agency can develop and implement new security regulations effectively. The TSA's Pipeline Security Division faces challenges in developing cybersecurity capabilities due to limited resources. The pipelines sector is vulnerable to cyber attacks, with recent intrusions targeting U.S. pipeline computer systems. TSA has the authority to issue cybersecurity regulations for pipelines but may lack the resources to enforce them effectively. The TSA faces challenges in developing cybersecurity capabilities for pipelines due to limited resources. While voluntary cybersecurity standards have been effective in protecting U.S. pipelines, the lack of formal cybersecurity plans and reporting requirements makes it difficult for Congress to assess the level of cybersecurity. The public must rely on the pipeline industry's self-interest to protect itself from cyber threats, raising questions about the sufficiency of current measures and the potential need for formal regulations. If current voluntary measures for pipeline cybersecurity are deemed insufficient by Congress, they may direct TSA to develop regulations and provide additional resources to enhance security, as the TSA Pipeline Security Division may lack the necessary capabilities."
