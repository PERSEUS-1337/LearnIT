    "content": "The \"Ports-to-Forts Act of 2012\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the Act. The \"Ports-to-Forts Act of 2012\" acknowledges the vital role of seaports in national interests, particularly in supporting military mobilization, trade flow, and job creation. The Commercial Strategic Seaport Grant Program aims to ensure secure military movements through seaports while addressing concerns about potential conflicts between military and commercial needs. The growth of commercial cargo has raised questions about the adequacy of seaport infrastructure for national security requirements. The Act highlights the need for improved infrastructure readiness for the Department of Defense. The Maritime Administrator may grant funds to States or port authorities for repair or construction activities at commercial strategic seaports. To be eligible, applicants must submit a certification ensuring proper use of grant funds within a year of notice publication. The Administrator will publish notice in the Federal Register for grant applications under subsection (a). Incomplete or unacceptable applications will be rejected, with reasons provided. Rejected applicants may reapply within the 1-year period. State or port authorities receiving grants under subsection (a) can only use funds for repair or construction activities related to commercial strategic seaports, including infrastructure like bridges, roads, and rail systems. Reporting requirements must be met annually after receiving the grant. The State or port authority must submit progress reports and expense lists for repair or construction activities related to commercial strategic seaports annually. The Maritime Administrator can use Department of Defense appropriations for these activities. The term \"port authority\" refers to a local port authority with jurisdiction over a commercial strategic seaport. The term \"State\" refers to each of the several States of the United States and Guam."
