    "content": "SECTION 1. TAX CREDIT FOR EDUCATION EXPENSES AT 2-YEAR COLLEGES. An amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include a tax credit for education expenses at 2-year colleges under SEC. 25A. Tax credit allowed for qualified higher education expenses paid by an individual during the taxable year, limited to $1,500 per student. The credit is reduced by any nontaxable federal assistance such as scholarships or grants. Qualified higher education expenses are defined for this purpose. The term 'qualified higher education expenses' refers to tuition and fees required for enrollment in a 2-year degree program at an institution of higher education, excluding expenses related to sports, games, or hobbies unless part of the degree program. The term 'qualified higher education expenses' include reasonable living expenses while away from home and do not cover nonacademic fees like student activity fees or insurance expenses. The $1,500 amount in subsection (b)(1) is subject to inflation adjustment. The term 'institution of higher education' refers to an institution meeting specific criteria, including being described in section 1201(a) of the Higher Education Act. The dollar amount for qualified higher education expenses is adjusted annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year, with rounding rules applied if necessary. The Higher Education Act of 1965 defines qualified higher education expenses for the credit. No double benefit is allowed for expenses with a deduction under another provision. Special rules limit the taxable year for the credit. The credit for qualified higher education expenses is allowed only for attendance at an institution of higher education during the taxable year. Prepayments for expenses related to attendance starting in the following taxable year are also eligible. Adjustments are made for scholarships and veterans' benefits. The credit for qualified higher education expenses is reduced by amounts received for scholarships, veterans' benefits, or payments for educational expenses exempt from income taxation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations for carrying out this section, including recordkeeping and reporting requirements. A conforming amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Effective Date: The amendments for education expenses at 2-year colleges apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1996."
