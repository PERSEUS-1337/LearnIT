    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 14714 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to state that mental health plan contractors must bear the financial risk for providing necessary mental health services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries. The mental health plan must not transfer the obligation for specialty mental health services to the county if it is not administered by a county. They can purchase services from the county and establish protocols for beneficiaries to obtain non-Medi-Cal reimbursable services. Protocols must also be established for transferring beneficiaries who have lost Medi-Cal eligibility to the county for care under specific divisions. The mental health plan is responsible for providing access to benefits and services to Medi-Cal beneficiaries in the county, regardless of their residence. The plan must adhere to the same definition of medical necessity and offer a minimum scope of benefits, unless federal approval is obtained and complies with state and federal laws. Any contract under this chapter can be renewed if the mental health plan meets requirements, failure to do so may lead to nonrenewal. Renewal decision may be based on correction of deficiencies, timely submissions, or other contract conditions. If a mental health plan fails to meet contract requirements, the department must notify relevant parties of funds to be sequestered. The plan can request a hearing if needed and must give 180 days notice before terminating or not renewing the contract. The Director of the Department of Managed Health Care may exempt a mental health plan from the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 upon request, with exemptions subject to appropriate conditions. This does not diminish the director's authority under the Knox-Keene Act, nor reduce the obligations of a licensed mental health plan contractor to comply with its requirements. The director, in consultation with the Department of Managed Health Care, will assess the need for licensure or standards under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. The department oversees mental health plans to ensure quality, access, cost efficiency, and compliance with data and reporting requirements. It monitors services, expenditures, and legal compliance independently of the mental health plan contractor. County employees have discretion in admitting individuals for care or providing care under this chapter. If a county discontinues operations as the mental health plan, the department shall approve any new mental health plan that considers affiliation with nonprofit community mental health agencies. Counties' obligations are limited by Chapter 3 of Division 5, with a maximum obligation for services to non-Medi-Cal eligible persons. Section 14717.1 is added to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Section 14717.1 of the Welfare and Institutions Code emphasizes the importance of ensuring timely access to specialty mental health services for foster children placed outside their county of original jurisdiction. The Legislature aims to address any barriers to care that may arise in these situations. The California Health and Human Services Agency will coordinate with relevant departments to issue policy guidance on facilitating specialty mental health services for foster children outside their original county. This aims to ensure timely access to care and address any barriers that may arise. The transfer of responsibility for specialty mental health care services for foster youth is improved with presumptive transfer, ensuring continuity of care. Conditions and exceptions are applied consistently statewide, with individualized waivers available. Judicial review is allowed for disagreements on transfer determinations. Expedited transfer procedures are in place within 48 hours of placement outside the original county. Presumptive transfer of specialty mental health services for foster children occurs when a child is placed in a county different from the original jurisdiction after July 1, 2017. A foster youth residing in a county different from the original jurisdiction after June 30, 2017, can request transfer of responsibility for specialty mental health services. If a foster child continues to live outside the original county after December 31, 2017, jurisdiction must be transferred by the child's first status review hearing in the 2018 calendar year. Presumptive transfer of specialty mental health services responsibility can be waived on a case-by-case basis if certain exceptions exist. Requests for waiver can be made by the foster child, their caregiver, county probation agency, child welfare services agency, or any other party with a legal duty to the child's health or welfare. The county probation or child welfare agency, in consultation with the child, parent, and professionals, determines if waiver of presumptive transfer is appropriate. The person requesting the exception and other parties involved will be notified of the agency's decision. The individual or party disagreeing with the county agency's decision on presumptive transfer may request judicial review. The court will consider the best interest of the child in confirming or denying the transfer. Presumptive transfer may be waived in certain situations, such as disrupting care continuity or family reunification efforts. The foster child's residence must be within 30 minutes of their mental health care provider. A waiver for presumptive transfer requires a contract with a specialty mental health provider and timely services for the child. Requests for waivers and objections must be documented in the child's case plan. The mental health plan in the county where the foster child resides must accept the assessment completed by the county of original jurisdiction. Additional assessments can be conducted if the child's needs change or an updated assessment is required to determine treatment and services needed. Upon presumptive transfer, the mental health plan in the county of the foster child's residence will take over responsibility for authorizing and providing specialty mental health services and payments. The foster child will be included in the county of residence caseload for claiming purposes from specific government accounts. The State Departments of Social Services and Health Care Services will adopt regulations by July 1, 2019, to implement the changes. They may use written instructions until regulations are in place. Approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may be sought if necessary before implementing the section. The department must request CMS approval by January 1, 2017, for implementation of the section. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be made to local agencies and school districts if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
