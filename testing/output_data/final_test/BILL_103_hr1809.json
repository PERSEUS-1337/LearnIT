    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act\" and includes findings. The Congress finds that paper and related products make up 40% of the total US waste-stream, with 90% of old newspaper waste not being recycled. This has led to a surplus of old newspaper waste, causing a decline in the market for recycled newsprint. The current market price for old newspaper waste has dropped from $30 per ton to a cost or loss of $10 per ton, while the cost of disposal and landfilling ranges from $20 to $60 per ton for new newsprint. The cost of recycling old newspaper waste is substantially less than disposal, with a current cost of $20 to $60 per ton. Increasing demand for old newspaper waste is necessary to address the surplus and create stable markets for recyclers. A minimum recycling requirement can help create a market reflecting societal costs, while including disposal costs in unrecycled products is essential for an efficient market. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency needs additional authority to address these issues. The Agency needs more authority to boost recycling of old newspaper waste and stimulate demand. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS TO RECYCLE NEWSPRINT. Amends the Solid Waste Disposal Act to include new requirements for recycling newsprint. Beginning 18 months after the enactment of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act, newsprint producers or importers must recycle an amount of newsprint determined by multiplying the newsprint produced or imported by the recycling percentage established by the Administrator. This can be done through de-inking newsprint, purchasing recycled newsprint, or buying recycling credits. The Administrator will establish a recycling percentage each year, starting at 20% and increasing by 2 percentage points annually for ten years. Producers or importers of recycled newsprint can create credits for used newsprint recycling, while producers or importers of newsprint can purchase these credits. Producers or importers of newsprint can purchase recycling credits from recyclers to comply with regulations. The regulations include requirements for maintaining records of old newsprint receipt and de-inking for recycling. Producers and importers of newsprint must notify relevant agencies of their capacity and imports, maintain records of sales, and provide certifications for accuracy. Producers and importers of newsprint must maintain records of recycled newsprint quantities, prices, and sales for compliance. They are required to report annually to the EPA on recycled content newsprint production, credits acquired and distributed. Additional regulations may be included by the Administrator for qualifications. The Administrator may establish regulations for recyclers, importers, and producers to ensure compliance with the recycling credit system. A recycling credit is a legal record of newsprint recycling through de-inking. The Administrator must submit an interim report to Congress on the implementation of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act within 6 years of its enactment. The Administrator must submit a final report to Congress 10 years after the enactment of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act, evaluating the impact on the newsprint industry, environment, and recycling percentage. This section applies to individuals producing or importing over 10 tons of newsprint annually. The Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act requires the Administrator to promulgate regulations within 18 months of enactment. Failure to do so will result in a 20 percent recycling percentage requirement. Violators may face civil penalties up to $2,500 per violation. The Administrator must give written notice and opportunity for a hearing before issuing a civil penalty. The penalty amount considers the violation's nature, extent, and violator's ability to pay. The Administrator has the authority to adjust or waive penalties as needed. The civil penalty imposed can be deducted from any amounts owed by the United States to the charged person. An aggrieved person can petition for judicial review within 30 days of the assessment order. Failure to pay the penalty may result in consequences. The Attorney General can recover the assessed penalty with interest in a district court if no petition for judicial review is filed or after a final judgment in favor of the Administrator. The validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty are not subject to review in such an action. The Administrator will submit a plan to Congress for high-grade paper recycling within three years of the Newsprint Recycling Incentives Act. The plan will assess the feasibility and desirability of recycling post-consumer high-grade paper, including incentive-based methods like a credit system. The Administrator will implement the high-grade paper recycling plan within one year of submission. The plan includes methods for recycling various types of paper. The term 'high grade paper' refers to specific types of paper. Additionally, a technical amendment is made to the table of contents for the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Authorization is given to the Environmental Protection Agency to appropriate $1,200,000 for newsprint recycling requirements. The funds will be used to hire at least six full-time employees and will remain available until expended."
