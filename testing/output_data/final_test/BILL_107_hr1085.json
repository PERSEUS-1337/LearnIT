    "content": "The \"Mining Claim Maintenance Act of 2001\" is referenced as the short title. Any mention of the \"general mining laws\" in this Act refers to specific chapters in title 30 of the United States Code. Title I of the Act addresses mining claim fees, including maintenance fees. The holder of each unpatented mining claim must pay a $100 claim maintenance fee to the Secretary of the Interior annually by August 31. This fee replaces the assessment work requirement in the general mining laws. The fee must be paid before the assessment year begins, and the location fee under section 102 is due within 90 days of location. The claim maintenance fee for unpatented mining claims must be paid annually by August 31, replacing the assessment work requirement. A waiver may be granted for patent applicants who meet specific criteria. Claimants holding 10 or fewer mining claims may choose to perform assessment work instead of paying the maintenance fee if they are producing hard rock minerals with specific revenue criteria. Claimants with 10 or fewer mining claims can opt to do assessment work instead of paying maintenance fees if they meet certain criteria, including disclosing valuable mineralization and having minimal surface disturbance. Claimants with 10 or fewer mining claims must conduct assessment work and certify it to the Secretary of the Interior by August 31 each year. The term \"related party\" includes the claimant's spouse, dependent children, and individuals with control relationships. Control can be through common directors, officers, or stockholders. The term \"related party\" includes individuals with control relationships through common directors, officers, or stockholders, a voting trust, holding company, or investment company. SEC. 102 of the text introduces a location fee of $25.00 per claim for new mining claims. SEC. 103 maintains co-ownership provisions with adjustments for claim maintenance fees. SEC. 104 addresses consequences for failure to pay. Failure to pay the claim maintenance fee or location fee on time results in forfeiture of the mining claim by the claimant, deemed null and void by law. Other requirements are outlined in SEC. 105. (a) Federal Land Policy and Management Act Requirements state that the requirements of section 314(b) of the Act shall remain in effect with respect to claims and sites for which fees are required. (b) Section 2324 of the Revised Statutes is amended to include waivers granted under the Mining Claim Maintenance Act of 2001. (c) The Secretary of the Interior will adjust fees required by this title to reflect changes. The Secretary of the Interior will adjust fees required by this title every 5 years based on the Consumer Price Index. Claimants will be notified of any adjustments made, and the new fees will apply starting in the assessment year following the adjustment. The Secretary of the Interior will establish regulations to implement the provisions of this title promptly after its enactment. After the date of enactment of this Act, no patent shall be issued for any mining claim unless certain requirements are met, including filing a patent application before September 30, 1994, and complying with specific regulations for vein, lode, and placer claims. If these requirements are met, the claim holder is entitled to a patent as they would have been before the Act was enacted. The claim holder is entitled to a patent as they would have been before the Act was enacted, unless determinations are withdrawn or invalidated by the Secretary or a court of the United States. SEC. 202 of the Act states that no patent shall be issued for any mill site claim unless certain conditions are met, including filing a patent application before September 30, 1994, and complying with all requirements by that date. If these conditions are met, the claim holder is entitled to a patent unless determinations are withdrawn or invalidated."
