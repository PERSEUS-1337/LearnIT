    "content": "The federal material support statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339A and 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339B, have been central to the Justice Department's terrorist prosecution efforts. These statutes outlaw providing material support for designated offenses by terrorists and to designated terrorist organizations. Congress has expanded and clarified the scope of these statutes since the mid-1990s. Section 2339A was passed as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, and Section 2339B was added as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The federal material support statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339A and 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339B, have been crucial in prosecuting terrorists. Section 2339B recognizes the fungibility of financial resources and material support, allowing individuals to provide funds, goods, or services to terrorist organizations. The USA PATRIOT Act amended these sections in 2001, increasing the maximum imprisonment term and adding \"expert advice or assistance\" as proscribed support. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 expanded the definition of \"material support or resources\" in the federal material support statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339A and 18 U.S.C. \u00a72339B. It clarified definitions and added examples, including \"training\" and \"expert advice or assistance.\" Congress later expanded the predicate offense list and adjusted deadlines for interlocutory appeals. In 2015, the maximum penalty for violations of Section 2339B was increased. In 2015, the maximum penalty for violations of Section 2339B was increased from imprisonment for not more than 15 years to imprisonment for not more than 20 years. Section 2339A outlaws support or concealing support for terrorist crimes, including providing material support or resources with the intent for use in terrorism offenses. The Dictionary Act defines that \"person\" and \"whoever\" include entities like corporations in federal law. Courts use this statute to interpret federal criminal cases, holding corporations criminally liable for actions by their officers or agents. Common law required both a guilty mind (mens rea) and a guilty act (actus reus) for a crime. The absence of a mens rea in certain criminal offenses led to less severe punishments, as seen in regulatory misconduct cases. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a mens rea requirement, especially when the defendant must have knowledge of traditionally lawful conduct. A \"knowing\" mens rea standard is generally required by the government. The government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the facts constituting the offense, but not necessarily that they knew their conduct was unlawful. The word \"provide\" in Section 2339A is interpreted to mean supplying something for sustenance or support. Material support under Section 2339A includes any property or service, excluding medicine and religious materials. Section 2339A prohibits providing support for terrorism, including various tangible and intangible items like currency, weapons, and transportation. The support must be given with knowledge or intent for use in terrorist activities. The law applies to aiding in the preparation, commission, or escape from specific terrorist offenses. Section 2339A prohibits providing support for terrorism, including various tangible and intangible items like currency, weapons, and transportation. The support must be given with knowledge or intent for use in terrorist activities. The law applies to aiding in the preparation, commission, or escape from specific terrorist offenses. Predicate offenses listed in Section 2339A include bombing a federal building or murdering a federal official. Attempts, conspiracies, and aiding and abetting are also outlawed under this section. Attempt requires intent to commit the offense and an unsuccessful completion of it. An attempt to provide material support for terrorism requires an intent to commit the offense and a substantial step towards its completion. It is punishable by imprisonment for up to 15 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. It is irrelevant if the underlying offense was impossible to commit. Conviction for conspiracy to violate Section 2339A requires proof of entering into a conspiracy with the objective of providing support or resources for a predicate offense. No First Amendment violation occurs when evidence of conspiratorial statements is introduced at trial. Forming an agreement to engage in criminal activities is not protected speech. The offense of conspiracy to provide material support is complete upon assent, and each conspirator is liable. The conspiracy to provide material support carries penalties of up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Conspirators can be punished for both conspiracy and providing support if their scheme succeeds. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a72, anyone aiding a violation of Section 2339A can be punished as if they committed the offense themselves. Aiding and abetting a federal crime is punishable as if the defendant committed the offense themselves. Liability under Section 2 only applies if someone else commits the substantive offense. Convictions under Section 2339A can result in up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The Sentence Guidelines influence the actual sentence imposed. The Sentencing Guidelines influence the actual sentence imposed, with courts determining the recommended range. Appellate court review can be sought for procedural and substantive reasonableness. Section 2339A convictions are treated as aiding and abetting offenses, with a terrorism adjustment available. The federal crime of terrorism involves offenses intended to promote terrorism and has various legal consequences, including property confiscation and being a predicate offense for money laundering and RICO prosecutions. Section 2339A prosecutions for federal crimes of terrorism have an eight-year statute of limitations and may result in pre-trial detention. Convicted defendants could face a lifetime term of supervised release. The extraterritorial jurisdiction of Section 2339A extends abroad, following the application of its predicate offenses, with some uncertainty about its exact scope. The Court clarified that federal laws apply domestically unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Section 2339A allows for venue in any federal district where the offense occurred or as provided by law. It also allows for trials where the accused is brought into the US or aided in committing the offense. Section 2339A allows for venue in any federal district where the offense occurred or as provided by law. It also allows for trials where the accused is brought into the US or aided in committing the offense. Section 2339A condemns providing material support for crimes that may be committed in a terrorism context, and violations may constitute \"acts of international terrorism\" for civil actions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a72333. Section 2339B condemns providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations that engage in offenses, with key elements including knowingly providing support to designated organizations engaging in terrorism. Section 2339B prohibits providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations, requiring proof of knowingly supporting designated terrorist entities. The law defines \"provide\" as supplying sustenance or support, with the term \"material support or resources\" encompassing a broad range of assistance. Section 2339B prohibits providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations, requiring proof of knowingly supporting designated terrorist entities. The definition of \"material support\" includes a wide range of assistance, excluding medicine and religious materials but encompassing currency, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice, safehouses, false documentation, weapons, explosives, personnel, and transportation. The law also provides limited immunity for those who provide support with approval from the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations is a crime under Section 2339B, requiring proof of knowingly supporting designated terrorist entities. The Secretary of State designates entities as foreign terrorist organizations based on criteria related to engaging in terrorist activities that threaten national security. The Secretary of State designates entities as foreign terrorist organizations based on criteria related to engaging in terrorist activities that threaten national security. Organizations may challenge their designation, with the Secretary having the authority to revoke it. Defendants charged with providing support to designated organizations cannot challenge the designation in court. The definition of \"terrorism\" for Section 2339B is premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatants. The term 'terrorist activity' under Section 2339B refers to unlawful acts involving hijacking, sabotage, seizing individuals for coercion, or violent attacks on internationally protected persons. Section 2339B of Title 18 outlaws terrorist activities such as violent attacks on internationally protected persons, assassinations, and the use of biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons with intent to endanger individuals or cause property damage. It also prohibits attempts and conspiracies to commit these offenses. An attempt to commit an offense requires intent and a substantial step towards its completion. It is not a defense if the underlying offense was impossible to commit. Providing material support for terrorism is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and/or a fine. Conspiracy to provide material support in violation of Section 2339B is the agreement to provide such support. The offense is complete upon assent; the support need only be planned, not delivered. Each conspirator is liable for the conspiracy and any foreseeable offense committed in furtherance of the scheme. The penalties for conspiracy to provide material support are imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000 (up to $500,000 for an organization). Unlike attempt, conspirators are held accountable for the completed substantive offense. Conspiracy to provide material support under Section 2339B can result in imprisonment for up to 20 years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Liability under Section 2 attaches if someone else commits the substantive offense. Consequences of Charge or Conviction for violating Section 2339B include up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The Sentencing Guidelines can result in a sentencing range of 63 to 78 months for offenders with a clean record, but terrorism-related offenses can lead to a higher sentence of 210 to 262 months. Sentencing courts have some flexibility but may face review for unreasonable sentences. The sentence imposed for violating Section 2339B can be deemed procedurally or substantively unreasonable. Procedural unreasonableness may result from a Guideline miscalculation, while substantive unreasonableness can stem from being overly lenient or severe based on the offense and defendant's circumstances. Section 2339B violations can be classified as federal crimes of terrorism if they aim to influence government conduct through intimidation or coercion. This classification has various consequences, including confiscation of property involved in the offense and serving as predicate offenses for money laundering and RICO prosecutions. The prosecution of a Section 2339B offense has an eight-year statute of limitations and may result in pre-trial detention for accused individuals. Conviction for a federal crime of terrorism can lead to a lifetime term of supervised release. Federal criminal law is generally territorial, but Section 2339B has both a descriptive and general statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction. The extraterritorial jurisdiction of Section 2339B includes jurisdiction over offenses committed by U.S. nationals, aliens with permanent residence, stateless persons residing in the U.S., offenders brought into the U.S. after committing the offense, offenses occurring within the U.S. or affecting interstate commerce, and aiding or abetting individuals under this jurisdiction. The extraterritorial jurisdiction of Section 2339B includes offenses committed by U.S. nationals, aliens with permanent residence, stateless persons residing in the U.S., offenders brought into the U.S. after committing the offense, offenses occurring within the U.S. or affecting interstate commerce, and aiding or abetting individuals under this jurisdiction. The legislative history of the 2004 legislation provides no explanation for the inclusion of apparently overlapping statements regarding jurisdiction. Congress may have intended extraterritorial application in any situation falling under either provision. Section 2339B allows civil suits by the Attorney General or Secretary of the Treasury to enjoin violations. Violations of Section 2339A or 2339B may be considered acts of international terrorism under Section 2333, allowing for treble damages for those injured. Financial institutions must report assets held for foreign terrorist organizations under Section 2339B(a)(2). Financial institutions must report assets held for a foreign terrorist organization to the Secretary of the Treasury, with penalties for non-compliance. Section 2339B(f) includes procedures for protecting classified information during civil proceedings."
