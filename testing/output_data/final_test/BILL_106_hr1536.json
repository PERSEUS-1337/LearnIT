    "content": "The Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999 establishes expected market prices for agricultural commodities, fixes premium amounts for additional coverage, and includes pilot projects for cost of production risk protection, rating methodologies, and livestock coverage. It also addresses disaster declarations, assigned yields for new lands and crops, and the composition of the Corporation's board of directors. The Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999 establishes expected market prices for agricultural commodities for insurance purposes. Section 508(c) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish the expected market price of agricultural commodities for insurance purposes. The expected market price shall not be less than the projected market price determined by the Corporation, but may be based on the actual market price. The expected market price of agricultural commodities for insurance purposes is determined by the Corporation. For revenue and similar plans, it is the actual market price at harvest time. For cost of production plans, it is the projected cost of producing the commodity. SEC. 3. FIXING ADEQUATE PREMIUM AMOUNTS FOR ADDITIONAL COVERAGE. Section 508(d)(2) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to adjust premium amounts for additional coverage between 65% and 75% of the average yield at 100% of the expected market price. Premium amounts for additional coverage equal to or greater than 75% of the average yield indemnified at 100% of the expected market price must be sufficient to cover anticipated losses under all policies with that level of coverage and include an amount for operating and administrative expenses determined by the Corporation. The premium amounts for coverage equal to or greater than 75% of the average yield indemnified at 100% of the expected market price must cover anticipated losses under all policies with that level of coverage and include an amount for operating and administrative expenses determined by the Corporation. SEC. 4. PAYMENT OF PORTION OF CROP INSURANCE PREMIUM BY CORPORATION. Section 508(e) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to require the Corporation to pay a part of the premium to encourage producer participation in crop insurance plans. The Corporation may also make discretionary payments for approved insurance plans. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to require the Corporation to pay a portion of the premium to encourage producer participation in crop insurance plans. Additional coverage less than 65 percent of the average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price will receive a specific amount based on premium and expenses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now mandates the Corporation to subsidize a portion of the premium to boost producer involvement in crop insurance plans. For coverage between 65-75 percent of the average yield at 100 percent of the expected market price, the amount will be 50 percent of the premium plus operating and administrative expenses. The Federal Crop Insurance Act requires the Corporation to subsidize premiums for coverage above 75 percent of the average yield at 100 percent of the expected market price. The subsidy amount is 55 percent of the premium to meet specific requirements. The Federal Crop Insurance Act requires the Corporation to subsidize premiums for coverage above 75 percent of the average yield at 100 percent of the expected market price and operating/administrative expenses. Section 508(h)(2) is amended by removing the second sentence. The text chunk discusses the effect of a disaster declaration on the determination of a producer's actual production history. The definition of a designated disaster area is amended to include areas covered by a Presidential declaration of major disaster or determined to be a disaster area by the Secretary. This impacts yield determinations for producers' actual production history. The amendment to Section 508(g) of the Act allows producers to exclude crop years from their actual production history if the county where the crop was grown was included in a designated disaster area due to damaging weather. SEC. 6. Assigned yields for newly acquired lands and new crops. The amendment allows producers to receive a 100 percent transitional yield for newly acquired land or new crops. SEC. 7. Cost of production risk protection pilot project. Section 508(h)(6) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow producers to select a coverage level not exceeding 90 percent of the cost of production determined by the Office of Risk Management for their farm location. The cost of production for crop insurance coverage is determined by the Office based on data from a land-grant college or university in the state where the producer's farm is located. SEC. 8. RATING METHODOLOGIES PILOT PROJECT. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include a pilot project for rating methodologies. The Office of Risk Management will review current methodologies and develop new ones by September 30, 2000, considering the risk pool of producers not participating in the Federal crop insurance program. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include a pilot project for rating methodologies, with a focus on producers opting for catastrophic risk protection. Section 507(c) is amended to clarify exceptions related to section 508(h)(8). SEC. 9. LIVESTOCK COVERAGE PILOT PROJECT. A pilot project will be carried out by the Corporation in selected counties, allowing livestock producers to opt for federally reinsured coverage. SEC. 10. BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CORPORATION. Section 505 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish a Board of Directors for the Corporation, consisting of members from various sectors including agricultural producers, crop insurance, and reinsurance businesses, as well as government officials. The Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to establish a Board of Directors for the Corporation, with members appointed by the Secretary and serving staggered 4-year terms, not exceeding 2 consecutive terms. The Board selects a member to serve as Chairperson."
