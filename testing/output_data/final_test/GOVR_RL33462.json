    "content": "Since 1984, Congress has designated 49 national heritage areas (NHAs) to recognize and assist efforts to protect, commemorate, and promote natural, cultural, historic, and recreational resources that form distinctive landscapes. NHAs emphasize the interaction of people and their environment, telling the story of residents shaped by the landscape. Each NHA has unique cultural attributes and may have had a fundamental economic activity as its foundation. NHAs vary in appearance and expression based on distinctive cultural attributes. Congress designated the first heritage area in 1984, the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, to combine land uses, management programs, and historical themes for grassroots preservation and economic development. The idea of balancing nature and industry resonated with many states and communities. Interest in establishing heritage areas has grown since the creation of the first NHA in 1984, especially in the eastern United States. The number of heritage areas more than doubled from 2004 to 2009, with many proposals introduced in Congress. However, the number of measures to study or establish heritage areas has decreased in recent Congresses, possibly due to the establishment of a large number of NHAs in earlier Congresses and changes in House and Senate rules. The increase in interest in establishing heritage areas since 1984 has led to a significant number of NHAs being created. However, recent Congresses have seen a decrease in proposals to study or establish new NHAs, possibly due to the large number already in existence and changes in House and Senate rules. Some members and administrations are advocating for a standardized process and criteria for designating NHAs, while opponents argue that NHAs threaten private property rights and are burdensome. NHAs represent a shift in land protection roles, with local management and funding from various sources. They aim to promote economic development and preserve natural and cultural heritage. While the NPS provides support, NHAs are not part of the National Park System. Congressional designation of heritage areas is seen as a cost-effective alternative to creating new park units. The National Park System consists of 409 diverse units, including national parks, monuments, historic sites, battlefields, and preserves. National Heritage Areas mainly consist of private properties, with some including publicly owned lands. Laws establishing NHAs typically do not allow for federal land acquisition, with ownership remaining private, state, or local. However, in some cases, Congress has authorized federal land acquisition within heritage areas. Many laws establishing NHAs include provisions to address concerns about potential loss of private property rights. The process of NHA designation involves studying the suitability and feasibility of designating an area, followed by enacting legislation. Laws allow property owners within NHAs to opt out of participating in activities. There is no comprehensive statute for NHA designation criteria, funding, and management. The process of designating a National Heritage Area (NHA) involves studying the suitability and feasibility of an area, followed by enacting legislation. Studies address resources reflecting American heritage, public-private partnerships, community support, management entities, and financial resources for the area. The process of designating a National Heritage Area involves studying the area's suitability and feasibility, enacting legislation, and identifying a management entity and financial resources. The NPS provides guidance to entities conducting studies and assists communities in crafting a regional vision for heritage preservation and development. The specifics for establishing and managing a heritage area are typically outlined in its enabling legislation. NHAs usually involve partnerships among the NPS, states, and local interests, with a designated management entity coordinating the work. This entity could be a state or local government agency, nonprofit corporation, or federal commission, developing and implementing a management plan in collaboration with partners. Plans vary based on legislation and local needs, identifying resources, themes, and policies. NHAs involve partnerships among the NPS, states, and local interests, with a designated management entity coordinating the work. The management plan outlines policies, implementation strategies, restoration needs, recreational opportunities, funding goals, and partner roles. Once approved by the Secretary of the Interior, the plan becomes the blueprint for managing the heritage area. Implementation is primarily through voluntary actions, with the NPS providing various types of assistance. A cooperative agreement is typically entered into with the designated management entity to help plan and organize the area. The compact for National Heritage Areas (NHAs) outlines goals, defines roles, and channels federal funds to management entities. Funding for NHAs comes from various sources, including philanthropic organizations, individuals, and governments. Federal appropriations are typically provided to the management entity for rehabilitation, tours, exhibits, public awareness, and special programs. National Heritage Areas receive federal funding for rehabilitation, tours, exhibits, public awareness, and special programs. The NPS provides training courses for sustainability, including entrepreneurial funding strategies and strategic planning. Evaluation of heritage areas is conducted before federal funding authorization expires to determine future NPS involvement. The NPS evaluates heritage areas to make recommendations on its future role. P.L. 110-229 required assessments of accomplishments, management entities, investments impact, and management structures for sustainability. The NPS developed a methodology to assess NHAs and has submitted evaluations for nine areas to Congress. The NPS is evaluating various heritage areas, including Silos and Smokestacks, Augusta Canal NHA, Essex NHA, and others. Supporters believe heritage areas are important for preserving history and cultural landscapes, especially in communities facing economic challenges or population changes. Advocates see NHAs as unifying forces that promote pride, cooperation, and stewardship among the public. Heritage areas, known as NHAs, are seen as promoting cultural tourism, community revitalization, and economic development. They offer entertaining and educational experiences for tourists through activities like stories, music, and boat rides. Increased tourism benefits local communities by boosting the economy. Some supporters prefer NHAs over other forms of land conservation because they are typically locally administered and remain in nonfederal ownership. Some proponents view managing federal areas as costly and prefer small investments in heritage areas, which have been successful in attracting funds. Property rights advocates oppose heritage areas, citing lack of local support and concerns about federal control over nonfederal lands. They advocate for notification of private property owners within proposed heritage areas to protect property rights. Opponents of heritage area legislation are concerned about federal government adherence, approval requirements from the Secretary of the Interior, overly prescriptive management plans, potential federal land acquisition, and the lack of a clear framework for establishment and funding. Critics call for defined criteria, clarification of NHA roles, and worry about increased NPS obligations with more heritage bills. Some critics argue that federal funds should be allocated to existing NPS park units instead of creating new heritage areas. Concerns include the need for accountability in managing federal funds, challenges in providing necessary infrastructure for increased tourism, and potential degradation of resources due to tourism and development. Improvements in leadership and organization of management entities are also recommended for successful NHAs. Some NHAs face challenges in attracting funds due to differing opinions on their sustainability and economic impact. Each Congress considers bills to designate heritage areas, with some legislation addressing funding expiration for existing NHAs. Some NHAs face challenges with funding authorizations expiring, but they can still be managed with funding from other sources. P.L. 114-113 extended authorizations for certain NHAs and increased maximum lifetime funding for others. Several bills in the 114th Congress aimed to make changes to existing National Heritage Areas (NHAs). For example, S. 936 would remove funding limitations for the Ohio & Erie Canal NHA, while H.R. 2879 and S. 1662 proposed expanding the Abraham Lincoln NHA in Illinois. H.R. 3004 sought to extend the authorization for the Gullah/Geechee Heritage Corridor management entity. Additionally, H.R. 581 aimed to establish a National Heritage Areas System for governing NHAs. The bill H.R. 581 aims to establish a National Heritage Areas System for governing NHAs designated by Congress. It clarifies that NHAs are not part of the National Park System and sets criteria for evaluating areas for NHA designation. The NHA System would expire 10 years after enactment, and the Secretary of the Interior would conduct feasibility studies for potential NHAs. The bill H.R. 581 establishes a National Heritage Areas System for governing NHAs designated by Congress. It outlines the process for developing NHA management plans, including stakeholder involvement, resource inventory, goals, strategies, financial sustainability, and implementation plans. Designation of an NHA by Congress requires a completed management plan and approval by the Secretary of the Interior. The bill H.R. 581 establishes a National Heritage Areas System for governing NHAs designated by Congress. It outlines the process for developing NHA management plans, including stakeholder involvement, resource inventory, goals, strategies, financial sustainability, and implementation plans. The bill also lists the purposes for which federal funds can be used with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, such as making grants, entering into agreements, hiring staff, and supporting partners. It seeks to protect private property owners and existing regulatory authorities. Authorization for appropriations for various purposes is provided for each NHA. The bill H.R. 581 establishes a National Heritage Areas System for governing NHAs designated by Congress. It outlines the process for developing NHA management plans, including stakeholder involvement, resource inventory, goals, strategies, financial sustainability, and implementation plans. Federal funds are contingent on matching requirements, with evaluations and reports to Congress on NHAs required. The Obama Administration supports legislation for evaluating and designating heritage areas. The National Park Service and Obama Administration support legislation for establishing a National Heritage Area program with standardized timeframes and funding. Opposition to the program comes from advocates of private property rights. Opponents of the National Heritage Area (NHA) system express concerns about potential restrictive regulations and loss of private land ownership. They worry that heritage area management entities could influence local legislators to change zoning laws. Additionally, there are concerns about the increased federal funding commitment that could come with establishing NHAs. Testimony on H.R. 445 in the 113th Congress addressed these issues, including the Administration's desired funding level for the NPS Heritage Partnership Program. In recent years, Congress has allocated funds to National Heritage Areas (NHAs) using formula-based criteria. For FY2016, the total appropriation for NHAs was $19.8 million, with funding allocated under a three-tier system: $150,000 for Tier I areas developing management plans, $300,000 for Tier II areas with approved plans, and FY2015 funding levels for longstanding areas. The FY2016 appropriation for heritage areas was $0.5 million less than FY2015, totaling $20.3 million. Funding for national heritage areas fluctuated from FY2012 to FY2016, ending $2.4 million higher. The Administration proposed a reduction to $10.0 million for FY2016, with little explanation. Congress directed the NPS to submit a plan providing alternatives for funding. In FY2016, Congress directed the NPS to submit a plan with alternatives to minimize impacts on heritage areas due to proposed funding changes."
