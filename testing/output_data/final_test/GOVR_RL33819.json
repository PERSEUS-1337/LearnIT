    "content": "On December 17, 2008, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro offered to exchange imprisoned Cuban political dissidents for five Cubans imprisoned for espionage in the United States since 2001. The State Department responded that the jailed dissidents in Cuba should be released immediately without any conditions. Additionally, on November 26, 2008, Castro expressed willingness to meet with President-elect Barack Obama at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On November 24, 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on USAID's Cuba democracy program, recommending increased staff for monitoring activities and assessment of grantees' adherence to controls and regulations. Hurricane Paloma struck Cuba on November 8, 2008, causing significant damage. Ra\u00fal Castro reported total damages from recent hurricanes and tropical storms since August amounted to $10 billion. From mid-August through September 10, 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, along with Tropical Storms Hanna and Fay, caused widespread damage in Cuba. The hurricanes severely affected the housing sector, with almost 500,000 homes damaged and over 63,000 destroyed, as well as the power grid and agricultural sector. The United States provided assistance through non-governmental organizations, as direct offers of aid to the Cuban government were rejected. Cuba requested that U.S. companies be allowed to sell relief supplies to the country. Several legislative initiatives were introduced in the aftermath of the hurricanes. Several legislative initiatives were introduced after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike caused damage in Cuba, including S.Amdt. 5581 (Dodd) to S. 3001, H.R. 6913 (Flake), and H.R. 6962 (Delahunt) to temporarily ease U.S. embargo restrictions. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed easing travel restrictions to Cuba for agricultural and medical goods in the FY2009 Agriculture Appropriations bill, but no action was taken. Additionally, the FY2009 Department of State Appropriations Act included provisions for Cuba, such as providing $1 million for preliminary work by the Department of State. The bill recommended full funding for Cuba broadcasting and democracy programs, with regular evaluations for cost effectiveness. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed easing restrictions on payment terms for agricultural goods, travel related to commercial and agricultural goods, and family travel in the FY2009 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill. No action was taken on the measure. On July 11, 2008, the GAO criticized the practices of the International Broadcasting Bureau and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting for awarding noncompetitive contracts to private U.S. commercial stations for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The House Appropriations Committee approved provisions in the FY2009 bill to ease restrictions on family travel and U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. On June 19, 2008, the European Union permanently lifted diplomatic sanctions on Cuba, which had been temporarily suspended since 2005. Cuban Foreign Minister welcomed the decision, and the U.S. State Department officials viewed positively the benchmarks set by the EU for dialogue with Cuba. On June 13, 2008, Cuba deported a U.S. citizen wanted for sexual exploitation of a minor and child pornography. Cuba was placed on the Tier 3 list in the 2008 Trafficking in Persons Report for not cooperating in the fight against trafficking. Cuba rejected the report, stating it distorted Cuban reality to justify the U.S. embargo. Cuba is already ineligible for most U.S. assistance due to aid sanctions. On May 21, 2008, the Senate passed S.Res. 573 recognizing Cuba Solidarity Day and the struggle of the Cuban people. President Bush called for improvements in Cuba, including access to the Internet. The U.S. would allow Americans to send mobile phones to family in Cuba. Cuba accused the U.S. Interests Section chief of carrying funds to dissidents. In April 2008, Cuba announced changes to the state's wage system. In March 2008, Cuban government lifted restrictions on electronic consumer products and cell phones, reformed the agricultural sector for production boost, and allowed Cubans to stay at tourist hotels. The State Department criticized Cuba for human rights abuses. President Bush called for the release of political prisoners for improved U.S.-Cuban relations. On March 5, 2008, the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere held a hearing on Cuba following Fidel Castro's resignation. Ra\u00fal Castro was selected as President of the Council of State, with Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Venture as the First Vice-President and official successor. Fidel Castro announced he would not accept the position. On February 24, 2008, Cuba's legislature selected members of the 31-member Council of State. Four political prisoners were released and sent into forced exile to Spain. Fidel Castro was elected to the National Assembly of People's Power on January 20, 2008. Cuba announced signing two international human rights agreements on December 10, 2007. On December 10, 2007, Cuba announced signing two international human rights agreements, welcomed by Amnesty International. However, concerns were raised about Cuba's policies towards political dissidents. In a separate incident on December 4, 2007, Cuban security officials raided a Catholic Church hall in Santiago, detaining 18 dissidents. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report on U.S. enforcement of the Cuba embargo on November 30, 2007. The Government Accountability Office recommended re-evaluating resources for inspecting passengers from Cuba at Miami International Airport and reassessing resource allocation for investigating violations of the Cuba embargo. A hearing was held on Luis Posada Carriles, linked to the 1976 Cuban bombing. President Bush awarded Cuban dissident Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, focusing on the case of Luis Posada Carriles, allegedly involved in the 1976 Cuban airliner bombing. The President proposed new initiatives to support the Cuban people, including providing computers and Internet access, inviting oppressed Cuban youths to scholarship programs, and creating a multi-billion dollar Freedom Fund for Cuba. President Bush called for democratic transition in Cuba, emphasizing free speech, assembly, and elections. The U.S. administration's stance on Cuba remained consistent, with increased funding for democracy programs approved by the Senate. On July 27, 2007, the House rejected an amendment to the 2007 farm bill that would have eased restrictions on the commercial sale of agricultural products to Cuba. Ra\u00fal Castro acknowledged the insufficiency of Cuban salaries and called for structural changes to increase efficiency and production. Ra\u00fal Castro acknowledged the need for structural changes to increase efficiency and production in Cuba. He criticized U.S. trade sanctions and offered to engage in dialogue with the United States. The Senate approved a provision for general licenses for travel to Cuba for the sale of U.S. agricultural and medical goods. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported that lifting trade restrictions could significantly increase the U.S. share of Cuba's agricultural imports. The U.S. International Trade Commission reported that lifting trade restrictions could increase U.S. travel to Cuba to between 550,000 and 1 million from 171,000 in 2005. Independent journalist Armando Betancourt Reina was sentenced to 15 months in prison. The House passed H.R. 2829, preventing Treasury Department funds from implementing a policy tightening in 2005.

The report recommended $33.681 million for Cuba broadcasting, $5.019 million below the Administration's request. A federal judge in Texas dismissed immigration fraud charges against Luis Posada Carriles, linked to bombings in Cuba. The judge cited mistranslated testimony and manipulated evidence by the U.S. government. Posada was released from jail in New Mexico on April 19, 2007, and placed under house arrest in Miami. Cuban authorities thwarted a hijacking from Havana to the U.S. by military recruits on May 3, 2007. Cuba criticized U.S. immigration policy for inciting violence. Cuba expelled U.S. fugitive Joseph Adjmi on April 25, 2007, who had evaded a mail fraud conviction in the 1960s. Additionally, on April 24, 2007, Cuba released six dissidents arrested in 2005 after serving their sentences. In April 2007, Cuba released six dissidents who were arrested in 2005 after serving their sentences. One of Cuba's longest-serving political prisoners, Jorge Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, was released after 17 years in prison. Leading dissident groups in Cuba declared unity in their struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy. The Cuban government conducted secret trials in April 2007, sentencing human rights activist Rolando Jim\u00e9nez Posada to 12 years in jail and independent journalist Oscar S\u00e1nchez Madan to four years. Cuba extradited alleged Colombia drug cartel leader Luis Hernando G\u00f3mez Bustamante to Colombia in February 2007, who was later extradited to the United States in July 2007 to face drug trafficking charges. Additionally, in February 2007, Cuba released three political prisoners who had been held since July 2005 before a planned protest at the French Embassy. In February 2007, three political prisoners held since July 2005 were released before a planned protest at the French Embassy. Ren\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Manzano, Julio C\u00e9sar L\u00f3pez, and Ra\u00fal Martinez were among those released. Ra\u00fal Castro was noted to be firmly in control as Cuba's acting president in 2007 and officially became President of the Council of State in 2008, succeeding his brother Fidel Castro. Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded his brother Fidel as President of the Council of State in 2008 due to Fidel's poor health. Ra\u00fal had been the officially designated successor for many years and took over key positions in the government, including First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party and Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. Despite the change in government, Fidel still holds the title of First Secretary of the PCC. Ra\u00fal announced the PCC's sixth congress would be held in 2009. The PCC's sixth congress is scheduled for the end of 2009, with speculation that Fidel Castro may be replaced as the party's head. Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, a hard-line communist party ideologue, has been appointed as the Council of State's First Vice President, making him the official successor to Ra\u00fal Castro. Carlos Lage, responsible for Cuba's economic reforms in the 1990s, retained his position as a Vice President on the Council of State. General Julio Casas Regueiro, a key military officer, became one of its five vice presidents and the new Minister of the FAR, replacing Ra\u00fal Castro. The military's role in the government increased with several military officers and confidants of Ra\u00fal joining the Council. General Julio Casas Regueiro replaced Ra\u00fal Castro as Minister of the FAR and became chairman of GAESA, the Cuban military's holding company. Other military appointments to the Council included Gen. Alvaro L\u00f3pez Miera and Gen. Leopoldo Cintra Fr\u00edas. Cuba's political succession from Fidel to Ra\u00fal has been stable, with signs of potential economic changes under Ra\u00fal's leadership. Ra\u00fal emphasized the need for structural changes in the Cuban economy to increase efficiency and production. The Cuban government has implemented economic changes under Ra\u00fal Castro's leadership to increase efficiency and productivity. While there have been some improvements, tight control over the political system remains unchanged. Observers note a decrease in political prisoners, but dissidents argue that repression persists. The Cuban government under Ra\u00fal Castro continues harsh treatment of the opposition, showing no signs of easing tight control over the political system. The selection of Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado as First Vice President further indicates this stance. This follows economic changes aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity, with some improvements noted but political repression still a concern. The Cuban Revolution led to a socialist government, with Fidel Castro declaring himself a Marxist-Leninist in 1961. The Cuban Communist Party, led by the Castro brothers, reaffirmed its commitment to a single-party state in 1997. The Constitution outlines the government structure, with power centralized in the Political Bureau. The National Assembly of People's Power holds legislative authority, with the President of the Council of State serving as the head of state. The President of the Council of State in Cuba is both the head of state and government, with executive power vested in a Council of Ministers. Fidel Castro served in this role until 2008. National Assembly elections have had limited candidate choices, while municipal elections are competitive with runoff elections if no candidate receives over half the votes. In 2007, municipal elections in Cuba took place in October, with runoffs held later that month. Over 15,000 local officials were chosen, leading to the nomination of candidates for provincial assemblies and the National Assembly of People's Power. National Assembly elections occurred in January 2008, with Fidel Castro being elected as one of the delegates. The new Assembly was set to select members of the Council of State and its President in February 2008. Fidel Castro announced his decision not to be re-elected as President of the Council of State in February 2008, confirming his departure from leading the Cuban government. Observers had speculated about Cuba's future after Fidel, with the most likely scenario being continued leadership under Ra\u00fal Castro. Continued leadership under Ra\u00fal Castro was seen as the most likely scenario after Fidel Castro's departure. Ra\u00fal was designated as Fidel's successor in the party and led the FAR, which controlled the government's security apparatus and had a significant role in Cuba's economy. A military-led government was considered a possibility if a communist successor failed due to internal divisions or political instability. A democratic transition government was viewed as the least likely scenario, as the Castro government had suppressed independent civil society, limited the private sector, and prevented the development of a unified political opposition. Cuba has a poor record on human rights, with the government sharply restricting freedoms of expression, association, assembly, movement, and other basic rights. The government has cracked down on dissent, arrested activists and journalists, and staged demonstrations against critics. Despite some hope for a relaxation of oppressive tactics after the Pope's visit in 1998, attacks on dissidents have continued. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights reports systematic violations of citizens' fundamental rights by the Cuban government. The State Department's 2007 human rights report highlighted numerous serious abuses by the Cuban government, including arbitrary arrests, harassment of political opponents, beatings of detainees, denial of fair trial, harsh prison conditions, and interference with privacy. The government tightly controlled Internet access, limiting citizens to government-approved institutions. The Cuban government tightly controls Internet access, allowing citizens to access it only through approved institutions or foreign diplomatic offices. In March 2003, the government cracked down on activists, imprisoning 75 democracy activists, including journalists, librarians, and union leaders. Currently, 55 of these political prisoners remain incarcerated, with the most recent release in February 2008, sending four political prisoners into forced exile in Spain. In 2007, the Cuban government released several political prisoners, including prominent dissidents like Ren\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Manzano and Jorge Luis Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez. Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, who had been imprisoned for 17 years, was one of Cuba's longest-serving political prisoners. In August 2007, two more political prisoners were released after serving much of their sentences: Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez and Lazaro Gonzalez Adan. The independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation documented at least 219 political prisoners in July 2008, a decline from previous numbers. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported a decrease in political prisoners from 234 in January 2008 to at least 219 in July 2008. Despite this reduction, human rights activists, like Elizardo S\u00e1nchez, claim that the government continues to repress dissidents through threats, police searches, interrogations, and short detentions. The police state in Cuba is still prevalent, affecting various aspects of national life. The Cuban government took positive steps by lifting a ban on Cubans staying at tourist hotels, symbolically ending \"tourism apartheid.\" The Ladies in White, a human rights group formed in 2003, peacefully protests for the release of political prisoners. The Ladies in White, a human rights group formed in 2003, peacefully protests for the release of political prisoners in Cuba. They attend Mass at St. Rita's church in Havana, walk silently to a nearby park, and received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2005. In 2008, members were removed from a park for demanding the release of imprisoned husbands. Cuban journalist Guillermo Fari\u00f1as Hern\u00e1ndez received the 2006 Cyber Dissident award for hunger striking for broader Internet access. President Bush awarded Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007. In 2008, Cuban blogger Yoan\u00ed S\u00e1nchez gained international attention for her critical website Generaci\u00f3n Y. She was awarded Spain's Ortega y Gasset award for digital journalism, but the Cuban government denied her an exit permit to accept it. Two Cuban independent journalists imprisoned since 2003 received awards from international press rights groups in late 2008. In late 2008, two Cuban independent journalists, H\u00e9ctor Maseda Guti\u00e9rrez and Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez Alfonso, received international press freedom awards. Guti\u00e9rrez wrote a memoir while in prison, and Gonz\u00e1lez had started an association for independent journalism. By December 2008, 23 journalists were imprisoned in Cuba, and Cuban human rights activists were detained before the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In December 2008, Cuban President Ra\u00fal Castro offered to exchange imprisoned Cuban political dissidents for five Cubans jailed for espionage in the US since 2001. The Cuban Five are considered \"Heroes of the Republic\" by Cuba's National Assembly. The Varela Project aims for political reform in Cuba through a national plebiscite. The State Department called for the immediate release of jailed dissidents in Cuba without conditions. The Varela Project in Cuba, led by Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, aims for political reform through a national referendum. In May 2002, organizers submitted over 11,000 signatures to the National Assembly, surpassing the required amount. Former President Jimmy Carter praised the project for promoting peaceful law changes through direct voting. In response, the Cuban government held its own referendum, leading to constitutional amendments. The Varela Project in Cuba, led by Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, aimed for political reform through a national referendum. Despite a 2003 crackdown, activists persisted in collecting signatures for democratic reforms. Pay\u00e1 also initiated the National Dialogue project in 2003 to engage Cubans in discussions on democratic transition and various societal issues. The Assembly to Promote Civil Society in Cuba, led by prominent human rights activists, held meetings in Havana in 2005. Despite some restrictions, it was the largest gathering of Cuban dissidents since the 1959 revolution. The Assembly issued a ten-point resolution calling for political and economic change, including the release of political prisoners and respect for human rights. The resolution in Cuba called for the release of political prisoners, respect for human rights, and the abolition of the death penalty. Despite economic decline in the early 1990s, Cuba saw improvement from 1994 onwards with annual economic growth averaging 3.7%. Strong economic growth was recorded from 2005-2007, benefiting from tourism, nickel, and oil sectors, as well as support from Venezuela and China. Cuba receives support from Venezuela and China through investment commitments and credit lines. Venezuela provides Cuba with over 90,000 barrels of oil daily through a preferential agreement, with oil subsidies amounting to over $3 billion a year in 2006. Venezuela also helped upgrade an oil refinery in Cienfuegos in 2007. Economic growth slowed to 4.5% in 2008 due to declining nickel prices, rising food import costs, and hurricane damage. Cuba takes pride in achievements in health and education, with a life expectancy of 77.7 years and high adult literacy rates. In Cuba, life expectancy is 77.7 years, adult literacy is nearly 100%, and infant mortality is the lowest in Latin America at 6 per 1,000 live births. Economic reforms began in 1993, allowing Cubans to use U.S. dollars, engage in self-employment, and form agricultural cooperatives. In 1994, Cuba opened agricultural markets for farmers to sell produce and permitted artisan markets. Private food catering, including home restaurants, was allowed in 1995. A new foreign investment law was approved in 1995, allowing fully owned investments by foreigners. Free trade zones were established in 1996 with tariff reductions. In 1997, legislation was enacted to reform the banking system and establish a new Central Bank. In 2004, the Cuban government imposed regulations and new taxes that affected self-employed individuals, leading to the closure of some home restaurants. Restrictions were placed on the use of dollars by state companies, with a 10% surcharge for exchanging dollars to \"convertible pesos.\" Dollar bank accounts could no longer receive new deposits, and convertible pesos were no longer on par with the U.S. dollar. When Ra\u00fal Castro took provisional power in July 2006, expectations arose for economic policy changes in Cuba. In a speech in July 2007, he acknowledged the insufficiency of Cuban salaries and the need for structural changes to increase efficiency and production. There were discussions about potential economic reforms and increasing foreign investment in the country under Ra\u00fal's leadership. Some observers anticipated significant economic reforms, while others noted only minor changes in his first year in power. After Ra\u00fal Castro's speech in July 2007, Cuban public expectations for economic reform increased. Thousands of meetings were held where Cubans discussed low salaries, housing issues, and advocated for more private businesses. The government faced the risk of public frustration and social unrest if no policy changes were made. In early February 2008, a video of a meeting between Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n and university students circulated online, showing signs of increased public frustration. In 2008, a meeting between Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n and university students highlighted Cuban youth's disillusionment with low wages and travel restrictions. Ra\u00fal Castro's government announced economic changes, including lifting restrictions on consumer product sales. In 2008, Cuba announced economic reforms including lifting restrictions on consumer products like microwaves, DVD players, and cell phones. The government focused on agricultural reform to boost food production by giving farmers more autonomy and shifting decision-making to the local level. Additionally, the state's wage system was revamped to increase productivity and address economic challenges. Cuban state companies have until August to revise salary structures to reward hard-working employees. The issue of low wages in Cuba is linked to the challenge of unifying the two official currencies. Those with access to convertible pesos are better off than those who do not. Several factors could restrain economic policy change in Cuba, including Fidel Castro's influence, oil subsidies from Venezuela, and the fear of sparking political change. Economic reforms are likely to be gradual to maintain social and political stability. Ra\u00fal Castro did not announce additional economic reforms in his July 26, 2008 speech, but acknowledged the need to resolve problems affecting the population. He emphasized the goal of increasing salaries based on job performance, stating that socialism means social justice and equality of rights and opportunities, not salaries. U.S.-Cuban relations deteriorated in the early 1960s when Fidel Castro established a repressive communist dictatorship and aligned with the Soviet Union. The U.S.-Cuban relationship has been marked by tense and hostile events, including covert operations, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuban support for insurgencies, the Mariel boatlift, and the shootdown of U.S. planes in 1996. The U.S. has maintained economic sanctions against Cuba since the early 1960s, including trade and financial restrictions. The Cuban Assets Control Regulations (CACR) and subsequent legislation like the Cuban Democracy Act (CDA) and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 have strengthened these sanctions. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, also known as the Helms/Burton legislation, imposes strict sanctions on Cuba. It prohibits U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricts vessels that have engaged in trade with Cuba within the last 180 days from entering U.S. ports. This law codified the Cuban embargo, limiting the executive branch's ability to lift the embargo without congressional approval until certain democratic conditions are met. The Helms/Burton legislation imposes strict sanctions on Cuba, including prohibiting U.S. subsidiaries from trading with Cuba and restricting vessels that have engaged in trade with Cuba from entering U.S. ports. The law also holds any person or government liable for monetary damages in U.S. federal court if they traffic in U.S. property confiscated by the Cuban government. Additionally, there are support measures for the Cuban people, such as private humanitarian donations, medical exports, democracy-building efforts, and U.S.-sponsored broadcasting to Cuba. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 allows for agricultural exports to Cuba with restrictions on financing. The Clinton Administration made changes to U.S. policy towards Cuba after the Pope's visit in 1998, including resuming direct flights, cash remittances, and streamlining procedures for medical supplies. President Clinton announced further measures in 1999, broadening cash remittances to all U.S. residents. The Bush Administration continued the two-track U.S. policy towards Cuba, emphasizing stronger enforcement of economic sanctions and tightening restrictions on travel, remittances, and humanitarian gift parcels to Cuba. The Bush Administration tightened restrictions on travel, remittances, and gift parcels to Cuba in 2004 and 2005. President Bush endorsed recommendations to hasten the end of Cuba's dictatorship and committed $59 million to implement key measures, including support for democracy-building activities and airborne broadcasts to Cuba. In 2004 and 2005, the Bush Administration tightened economic sanctions on family visits, travel, and humanitarian assistance to Cuba. New regulations were implemented by the Treasury and Commerce Departments. In 2005, further restrictions were placed on how U.S. agricultural exporters could be paid for their sales. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice appointed Caleb McCarry as the State Department's new Cuba Transition Coordinator to support a free Cuba. The Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba was reconvened in December 2005 to identify additional measures to help Cubans hasten the end of the dictatorship. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba issued a report in July 2006, recommending $80 million over two years to support Cuban civil society, fund education programs, break the Cuban government's information blockade, and expand access to independent information. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba recommended additional funding of $24 million to expand access to independent information through the Internet and $15 million to support international efforts at strengthening civil society and transition planning. They also suggested funding of not less than $20 million annually for Cuba democracy programs until the dictatorship ceases to exist, doubling the current amount spent. The report outlined detailed plans for the U.S. government, international community, and Cuban community abroad to assist a Cuban transition government in addressing humanitarian and social needs, conducting free and fair elections, and moving towards a market-based economy. The Commission for Assistance to Free Cuba recommended additional funding for independent information and civil society support. The report outlined preparatory steps for the U.S. government to assist a Cuban transition government, including addressing humanitarian needs, conducting elections, and moving towards a market-based economy. Some Cuban dissidents welcomed U.S. assistance, while others emphasized the need for Cubans to solve their own problems. Miriam Leiva, a founding member of the Ladies in White, expressed concern that the Commission's report could lead to the imprisonment of dissidents in Cuba. She criticized the report for assuming what a Cuban transition should be before U.S. assistance is provided, stating that only Cubans should decide on such matters. President Bush reaffirmed the U.S.'s commitment to supporting the Cuban people's desire for democracy and freedom in response to Fidel Castro temporarily ceding power to his brother Ra\u00fal in 2006. President Bush reaffirmed U.S. support for the Cuban people's aspiration for democracy and freedom, urging them to work for democratic change. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated this support and stated that all Cubans desiring peaceful democratic change can count on U.S. assistance. Despite concerns about a potential migration crisis, there was no unusual traffic after Castro ceded power to his brother, with the U.S. Coast Guard prepared to respond if needed. In August 2006, Secretary of State Rice encouraged positive change in Cuba and discouraged risky sea travel. Ra\u00fal Castro expressed willingness to normalize relations but criticized U.S. policy as arrogant. Assistant Secretary Shannon reiterated a U.S. offer to work with Congress on Cuba. The Bush Administration was willing to lift U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba if they made political reforms. Ra\u00fal Castro offered to negotiate with the United States based on principles of equality and mutual respect. Ra\u00fal Castro reiterated an offer for dialogue with the United States based on principles of equality and mutual respect, criticizing U.S. trade sanctions on Cuba. The Bush Administration established working groups to manage U.S. policy towards Cuba, focusing on diplomatic actions, strategic communications, and democratic promotion. In August 2006, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence announced the creation of the Mission Manager for Cuba and Venezuela to coordinate intelligence efforts. In September 2007, President Bush called for free speech, assembly, and elections in Cuba as it transitions from dictatorship. U.S. officials express support for democratic change in Cuba, acknowledging the need for a transition to democracy. President Bush also addressed Cuba's future in a policy speech on October 24, 2007. President Bush's policy speech on Cuba on October 24, 2007, emphasized maintaining sanctions as long as the Cuban regime controls the political and economic life of its people. He proposed initiatives like providing computers and Internet access through NGOs, offering scholarships to Cuban youths facing oppression, and creating an international Freedom Fund for Cuba. President Bush announced a new effort to develop a multi-billion dollar Freedom Fund for Cuba, led by Secretary of State Rice and Secretary of Commerce Gutierrez. The fund aims to help the Cuban people rebuild their economy and transition to democracy, with contributions from foreign governments and international organizations. Monies will be available if the Cuban government shows commitment to fundamental freedoms. The President also addressed Cuban military, police, and government officials, urging them to embrace change. President Bush urged Cuban officials to embrace change and offered support for a democratic transition in Cuba. He praised the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland for their support to Cuba's democratic opposition and called on other nations to show public support for dissidents by opening their embassies to pro-democracy leaders and providing access to the Internet and books. President Bush called for a democratic transition in Cuba, urging the release of political prisoners, respect for human rights, and free and fair elections. He emphasized that Cuba needed to make changes for improved relations with the United States. President Bush reiterated his call for the Cuban government to improve life for the Cuban people, including opening up access to the Internet and allowing Americans to send mobile phones to family members in Cuba. Different schools of thought exist on how to achieve the objectives of U.S. policy toward Cuba, with some advocating for maximum pressure on the Cuban government and others supporting a constructive engagement approach to lift some U.S. sanctions. Some advocate for lifting U.S. sanctions hurting the Cuban people and engaging in dialogue, while others call for normalizing U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Fidel Castro's departure could prompt a re-examination of U.S. policy towards Cuba, with two main approaches: maintaining isolation while supporting the Cuban people, or influencing the Cuban government and society through increased engagement. Advocates for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba argue that increased travel, trade, and diplomatic dialogue could lead to peaceful reform on the island. They emphasize the need to prevent violent change in Cuba to avoid a mass exodus to the U.S. and potential civil war involvement. Supporters also highlight international backing for lifting the U.S. embargo. Advocates for easing U.S. sanctions on Cuba argue for peaceful reform through increased travel, trade, and diplomatic dialogue. They stress the importance of preventing violent change to avoid mass exodus and civil war involvement. Supporters also cite international support for lifting the U.S. embargo. Opponents believe the current two-track policy of isolating Cuba while supporting the Cuban people is the best approach for political change. They argue that the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 outlines steps for normalization of relations and caution against softening policy without concrete Cuban reforms. Opponents of softening U.S. policy on Cuba argue that maintaining sanctions is crucial for promoting democracy and human rights on the island. They believe that Cuba's economic struggles are due to failed policies, not the U.S. embargo. In 2008, Cuba was hit by two hurricanes and two tropical storms, causing widespread damage. In early September, Tropical Storm Hanna caused flooding in eastern Cuba. Hurricane Ike struck on September 7, severely affecting both eastern and western parts of the island. The hurricanes caused significant damage, with almost 500,000 homes damaged and over 63,000 destroyed. Hurricane Paloma struck Santa Cruz el Sur on November 8, 2008, leading to an estimated $10 billion in damages since August. The U.S. provided $100,000 in emergency relief funds to Cuba for Hurricane Gustav and another $100,000 for Hurricane Ike. Despite offering additional assistance and a $5 million aid package, the Cuban government rejected the offers. USAID also offered $2 million in plastic sheeting for disaster relief. The USAID Administrator offered $2 million in relief items to Cuba, with $3 million in cash to be provided through NGOs. The State Department proposed $6.3 million in roofing materials and shelter kits for 48,000 people, but Cuba declined. The U.S. increased authorizations for NGOs to provide up to $10 million each for hurricane assistance. Cuba rejected a U.S. offer to send a disaster assessment team, citing their own experts in the country. Cuba requested the United States to allow U.S. companies to sell relief supplies for housing and electrical repairs, and to grant private commercial credit for food purchases. Despite a U.S. offer of $2 million in supplies, Cuba insisted on the sale of relief supplies. Observers called for temporary relaxation of restrictions on family travel and remittances. Several legislative initiatives were introduced to temporarily ease U.S. embargo restrictions on family visits, remittances, and gift parcels to Cuba. Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Howard Berman asked President Bush to suspend restrictions for 90 days, while Senator Dodd proposed allowing unrestricted family travel and easing remittance restrictions for a 180-day period. The legislative initiatives introduced aimed to ease U.S. embargo restrictions on family visits, remittances, and gift parcels to Cuba. This included allowing unrestricted family travel, removing limits on remittances, expanding allowable items in gift parcels, and permitting U.S. cash sales of food, medicines, and relief supplies to Cuba. Two bills were introduced in the House to prevent tightened restrictions on gift parcels and provide humanitarian relief to Cuba for a 180-day period. The U.S. eased restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, allowing any American to send remittances and expanding allowable items in gift parcels. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been contentious for decades, with arguments for lifting the ban including concerns about Cuban families, influencing conditions in Cuba, and abridging the rights of Americans. The Cuba travel ban is opposed due to concerns about supporting Castro's government financially, existing legal provisions for humanitarian travel, and the President's authority to restrict travel for foreign policy reasons. The Bush Administration has increased enforcement of restrictions on Cuba travel, including eliminating certain educational exchanges and tightening restrictions on family travel and remittances. In 2004, the Bush Administration imposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, targeting family travel and private humanitarian assistance. OFAC cracked down on religious organizations promoting licensed travel to Cuba in 2005. The Administration suspended licenses of travel service providers and religious organizations in 2006, leading to concerns about more restrictive licenses for religious travel. In 2004, the Bush Administration imposed restrictions on travel to Cuba, targeting family travel and private humanitarian assistance. Among the June 2004 restrictions that remain in place are limitations on family visits and cash remittances. Family visits are now restricted to one trip every three years under a specific license, with restrictions on immediate family members only. Cash remittances are further restricted, with quarterly remittances of $300 limited to immediate family members and prohibited for certain government officials and members of the Cuban Communist Party. Authorized travelers are also limited in the amount of remittances they can carry to Cuba. Authorized travelers to Cuba have faced restrictions on the amount of remittances they can carry, with the limit reduced from $3000 to $300. Gift parcels are now limited to immediate family members and certain individuals are denied gifts. The contents of gift parcels are also restricted, excluding items like seeds, clothing, and fishing equipment. The per diem allowance for family visits has been reduced to $50 per day. Travelers are no longer allowed to bring merchandise back into the United States, except for informational materials. Fully-hosted travel by individuals not under U.S. jurisdiction is now prohibited. The tightening of Cuba travel and remittance restrictions has sparked mixed reactions. Supporters believe the restrictions deny the Cuban government crucial dollars, while opponents argue they only lead to more suffering for the Cuban people. Concerns have been raised about the consequences of the new restrictions, such as the status of U.S. students receiving full scholarships at the Latin American School of Medicine in Havana. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have been vocal about the impact of the restrictions on the scholarship program. The Black Caucus, key in establishing the scholarship program for U.S. students, expressed concern over potential impacts of new OFAC regulations on medical education. OFAC later licensed medical students in August 2004 to continue studies and travel. U.S. International Trade Commission's report in July 2007 projected a significant rise in U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba if travel restrictions were lifted. Congressional attempts to ease travel restrictions to Cuba from 2000-2004 were ultimately unsuccessful. In the first session of the 110th Congress, there were provisions in appropriations bills that would have eased restrictions on travel to Cuba for agricultural and medical goods, but these provisions were not included in the final enacted measures. The Senate versions of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill and the FY2008 Agriculture appropriations bill had provisions to ease travel restrictions to Cuba. In the second session of the 110th Congress, there were also appropriations bills with provisions to ease travel restrictions to Cuba. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2009 did not include provisions to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba, despite earlier efforts in the House version of the bill to allow for more liberalized family travel once a year to visit extended family members. The Senate Appropriations Committee version of the bill, S. 3260, included provisions to ease restrictions on family travel and travel to Cuba for agricultural and medical sales. It would allow for a general license for such travel instead of a specific license requiring permission from the Treasury Department. This is similar to a provision in the FY2009 Agriculture Appropriations bill. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to ease Cuba travel restrictions, including H.R. 654, S. 721, Section 254 of S. 554, H.R. 217, H.R. 624, H.R. 177, H.R. 757, and H.R. 1026. These bills proposed lifting overall economic sanctions, easing restrictions on educational travel, family travel, remittances, and facilitating the sale of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to ease Cuba travel restrictions, including H.R. 654, S. 721, Section 254 of S. 554, H.R. 217, H.R. 624, H.R. 177, H.R. 757, and H.R. 1026. These bills proposed lifting overall economic sanctions, easing restrictions on educational travel, family travel, remittances, and facilitating the sale of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba. H.R. 2819 (Rangel) and S. 1673 (Baucus) would have lifted restrictions on travel to Cuba, while other initiatives introduced after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike aimed to temporarily ease U.S. embargo restrictions in areas such as travel and remittances. U.S. commercial agricultural exports to Cuba have been allowed for years with restrictions and licensing requirements. The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (TSRA) allows for one-year export licenses for selling agricultural commodities to Cuba, with transactions conducted in cash in advance or with financing from third countries. TSRA also authorizes travel to Cuba for business related to agricultural sales, but denies access to U.S. private commercial financing or credit. OFAC clarified that for \"payment of cash in advance\" for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, vessels can leave U.S. ports once a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba, aiming to prevent seizure of goods at the U.S. port. This clarification was welcomed by supporters of overturning OFAC's previous amendment. Cuba has purchased almost $2.6 billion in agricultural products from the United States since late 2001. U.S. exports to Cuba increased from $7 million in 2001 to $404 million in 2004, with fluctuations in subsequent years. U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba reached $608 million in the first 10 months of 2008 due to rising food prices and increased food needs after natural disasters. The U.S. Senate Committee on Finance requested a report stating that if trade restrictions with Cuba were lifted, the U.S. share of Cuba's agricultural, fish, and forest imports would increase. Some groups advocate for further easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba, arguing that it would benefit the Cuban population's health and nutrition. U.S. agribusiness companies support the removal of restrictions to tap into a market worth over $700 million annually. Agricultural exporters also seek to change U.S. restrictions to sell agriculture and farm equipment to Cuba. Some argue that easing restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba would benefit smaller U.S. companies. Opponents believe that maintaining restrictions helps ensure payment for agricultural exports to Cuba and prevents support for the Castro regime. In December 2007, Congress approved the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161), dropping provisions easing Cuba sanctions. This included a provision preventing the Treasury Department from implementing the policy requiring cash in advance for U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba. The Senate Appropriations Committee-approved bill included provisions to ease travel to Cuba for the marketing and sale of agricultural and medical goods. The Administration stated that the President would veto any measure weakening current restrictions against Cuba. In another session, the House rejected an amendment to the 2007 farm bill that would have eased restrictions on the commercial sale of agricultural goods. The 2007 farm bill amendment aimed to ease restrictions on commercial sales of agricultural products to Cuba by clarifying payment terms, authorizing direct transfers between U.S. and Cuban financial institutions, and issuing U.S. visas for related activities. However, provisions to ease restrictions on agricultural exports to Cuba were not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2009. The bill, H.Rept. 110-920, included provisions easing restrictions on U.S. agricultural exports, with a provision prohibiting funds from being used to enforce an amendment to the Cuban embargo regulations. The Senate version, S. 3260 (S.Rept. 110-417), also eased restrictions on payment terms for agricultural goods sales to Cuba and travel related to commercial sales of agricultural and medical goods. In the Senate Appropriations Committee version of the FY2009 Agriculture Appropriations bill, provisions were proposed to ease restrictions on the sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, but none were enacted into law. Other legislative initiatives in the 110th Congress aimed at facilitating sales of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba were introduced, including H.R. 1026, which would have allowed for general license authority for travel-related expenses and temporary visas for Cuban nationals involved in purchasing U.S. agricultural goods. In the 110th Congress, legislative initiatives aimed at facilitating sales of U.S. agricultural products to Cuba were introduced, including bills clarifying \"payment of cash in advance,\" authorizing direct transfers between Cuban and U.S. financial institutions, establishing an agricultural export promotion program, and increasing the airport ticket tax for travel to or from Cuba. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on S. 1673 on December 11, 2007, regarding bills lifting economic sanctions on Cuba and travel restrictions related to agricultural sales. A provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure prevents the U.S. from accepting payment for trademark registrations from Cuban or foreign nationals connected to confiscated assets in Cuba without the original owner's consent. The provision in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations measure prohibits U.S. courts from recognizing trademarks without the original owner's consent. This was enacted due to a dispute between Pernod Ricard and Bacardi Ltd. over the Havana Club rum trademark. The European Union challenged the U.S. law at the WTO, which ultimately found it violated TRIPS. In January 2002, the WTO found that the trademark sanction violated TRIPS Agreement. The US agreed to comply by January 3, 2003, but no legislative action was taken. In 2005, the EU agreed not to retaliate immediately, but reserved the right to do so later. In 2006, the US Patent Office cancelled Cuba's Havana Club trademark registration. Some advocate amending Section 211 to apply to U.S. companies, while others call for its repeal due to endangering U.S. trademarks in Cuba. In the 110th Congress, multiple initiatives addressed this issue. In the 110th Congress, legislative initiatives were introduced to address the repeal of the Section 211 trademark sanction, with some proposing a narrow fix to comply with the WTO ruling. However, no action was taken on these measures. The EU-U.S. bilateral agreement in July 2005 reduced pressure on Congress to act, while concerns about Cuba's development of offshore oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico have been raised among some Members of Congress. According to industry analysts and the U.S. Geological Survey, Cuba's offshore sector may hold significant crude oil reserves, with estimates ranging from 1.6 billion to 20 billion barrels. Several foreign oil companies, including Repsol, Norsk-Hydro, and ONGC, have signed agreements for exploration in Cuba's deepwaters. Additionally, Petrobras has signed a cooperation agreement with Cuba's state oil company for potential exploration and production. Petrobras signed an oil exploration agreement with Cuba's state oil company, Cupet, in late October 2008. Concerns have been raised about potential environmental damage to the Florida coast due to oil development close to the United States. Repsol plans to drill a second well in mid-2009, with reports suggesting Cuban oil could be on the market by 2013. China's involvement in Cuba's oil sector has been focused on onshore extraction, not offshore deepwater drilling. In the 110th Congress, legislative initiatives were proposed to impose sanctions on investments in Cuba's offshore oil development, but no action was taken. The proposed measures would have excluded aliens who invested in Cuba's petroleum resources and required sanctions on those who made significant investments. In the 110th Congress, legislative initiatives were proposed to impose sanctions on investments in Cuba's offshore oil development, but no action was taken. The bill would have excluded aliens who have contributed to Cuba's petroleum resources and nullified a Maritime Boundary Agreement. Other initiatives would have allowed U.S. companies to work with Cuba for oil exploration, but no action was taken on these measures. Cuba's geographic location has been exploited by drug traffickers using its waters and airspace. Cuban officials have expressed concerns over drug transit through their waters and airspace. The government has implemented measures to combat the drug problem, including legislation to increase penalties for traffickers and cooperation with other countries on anti-drug efforts. Cuba has bilateral counternarcotics agreements with 33 countries and conducts Operation Hatchet for maritime and air interdiction. Narcotics smuggling through Cuban territory decreased in 2006. Cuba aggressively enforces internal drug enforcement programs. Cuba aggressively enforces internal drug enforcement programs and cooperates with other countries on anti-drug efforts, including a successful seizure of cocaine in 1996. Cooperation has increased since 1999 with improved communication links and the stationing of a U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist in Havana. The U.S. Coast Guard Drug Interdiction Specialist (DIS) stationed at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has increased coordination with Cuban authorities since September 2000. The State Department's 2008 report highlighted the DIS's role in narcotics cooperation, including joint operations like intercepting a drug-laden aircraft and conducting container inspections at the port of Havana in 2007. Cuban authorities have provided the DIS with exposure to their counternarcotics efforts, sharing investigative information and debriefings on drug trafficking cases. Cuba has cooperated with the United States in combating drug trafficking by deporting fugitives and extraditing drug traffickers. The cooperation is done on a case-by-case basis, not through a bilateral agreement. In 2007, Cuba extradited drug trafficker Luis Hernando G\u00f3mez Bustamante to Colombia, which was praised by U.S. officials. G\u00f3mez Bustamante was later extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges. U.S. anti-drug cooperation with Cuba was commended in 2008 despite political differences. Congressional bills had conflicting provisions on funding for counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba, but none were enacted. In December 2007, conflicting provisions on counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba were dropped from the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The House version prohibited assistance to Cuba, while the Senate version allocated $1 million for cooperation on counternarcotics. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1 million for preliminary work on counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba in the FY2009 State, Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The funding would be contingent on Cuba having procedures in place to protect against the loss of innocent life in drug interdiction operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1 million for counternarcotics cooperation with Cuba in FY2009. Cuba was added to the State Department's list of states sponsoring terrorism in 1982, but Fidel Castro stated in 1992 that support for insurgents abroad was no longer happening due to the breakup of the Soviet Union. The breakup of the Soviet Union led to Cuba losing billions in subsidies, causing economic decline. Cuba is on the State Department's terrorism list and opposes US counterterrorism policies. It maintains relationships with state sponsors of terrorism like Iran and Syria, providing safe haven for terrorist groups. Cuba has mediated with Colombian insurgent groups and remains a concern for terrorism. Cuba has been involved in mediating with the ELN and has a history of providing safe haven to U.S. fugitives. In recent years, Cuba has deported several U.S. citizens wanted for various crimes, including sexual exploitation of a minor and child pornography. In recent years, Cuba has deported several U.S. citizens wanted for crimes, including sexual exploitation of a minor and child pornography. Legislation in the 110th and 109th Congress aimed to extradite fugitives from Cuba to the U.S. for prosecution, but no action was taken. Additionally, a provision in House-passed H.R. 2601 would have funded the dissemination of information on U.S. fugitives in Cuba. Critics argue that keeping Cuba on the terrorism list is a Cold War relic, diverting attention from serious threats. Supporters point to Cuba's history of supporting terrorism and hosting fugitives. Cuba has been targeted in terrorist incidents, such as the 1976 plane bombing. In 1976, a Cuban plane was bombed, killing 73 people. In 1997, bombings in Havana and Varadero beach area resulted in casualties. Cuban exiles were implicated in funding the attacks. In 2000, anti-Castro activists were arrested in Panama for a plot to kill Fidel Castro. Three of the men were pardoned in 2004. Mireya Moscoso pardoned four men, including Posada Carriles, before the end of her presidential term. Three of the men, U.S. citizens, received support from the Cuban American community in Florida. Posada sought asylum in the U.S. due to fear of persecution for opposing Fidel Castro. He had been imprisoned in Venezuela for the 1976 Cuban airliner bombing, escaped in 1985, and was linked to bombings in Havana in 1997. Posada Carriles withdrew his asylum application in 2005 after being arrested by ICE for illegally entering the US. Venezuela requested his extradition, but a judge ruled he could not be deported due to risk of torture. ICE later decided to keep him detained in Texas. In November 2006, a federal judge ordered the government to provide evidence justifying the continued detention of Posada, who was indicted on seven counts for lying about entering the US illegally in 2005. The Cuban government insists he should be charged with terrorism. Another grand jury in New Jersey is investigating his alleged role in the 1997 bombings in Cuba. FBI agents have been gathering evidence in the case. Posada was transferred from an immigration facility in El Paso to a county jail in New Mexico. Posada was released from jail in New Mexico on April 19, 2007, and allowed to return to Miami under house arrest. A federal judge in Texas dismissed immigration fraud charges due to mistranslated testimony and manipulated evidence. Justice Department prosecutors filed an appeal with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. Both Cuba and Venezuela denounced Posada's release as a terrorist. Panama's Supreme Court ruled his 2004 pardon unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled Posada's 2004 pardon unconstitutional. In mid-July 2008, a Panamanian court requested Posada's extradition. The House Subcommittee on International Organizations held a hearing on the Posada case in November 2007. The United States has provided assistance to increase information flow on democracy, human rights, and free enterprise to Cuba through USAID, the State Department, and NED. USAID's Cuba program supports U.S.-based NGOs to promote democracy, civil society, and solidarity with human rights activists. In recent years, funding for democracy and human rights projects in Cuba has ranged from $5 million to $21.4 million annually, largely through Economic Support Funds (ESF). The Administration requested $9 million in ESF for FY2007 to support these initiatives. USAID plays a significant role in promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba. The appropriations bill, H.R. 5522, recognized USAID's work in promoting democracy and humanitarian assistance for Cuba. The Senate version recommended $2.5 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs, $6.5 million less than requested. Ultimately, $13.3 million was provided in FY2007, $4.3 million more than requested. For FY2008, Congress fully funded $45.7 million in ESF for democracy assistance for Cuba. In FY2008, $45.33 million will be provided for Cuba democracy programs, more than four times the amount in FY2006. This increase is to support Cuban civil society, expand international awareness, and aid in a democratic transition. The State Department's FY2008 Congressional Budget Justification recommended $80 million over two years for Cuba's transition to democracy. Both the House and Senate passed versions of the FY2008 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. In FY2008, the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act fully funded the Administration's request for $45.7 million in ESF for Cuba democracy programs. The House and Senate approved increases in funding to meet the Administration's request, with the Senate approving $30.7 million. The FY2009 State Department appropriations requested $20 million in ESF to implement program recommendations for Cuba, supporting human rights activists, journalists, Afro-Cubans, women, youth, and student activists. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the request but also called for regular evaluations of program effectiveness. No final action was taken in the 110th Congress, with foreign operations funding continuing under a short-term resolution until March 6, 2009. NED's democratization assistance for Cuba had been funded through the annual CJS appropriations until FY2008. NED funding for Cuba has increased steadily over the years, with $2.4 million allocated for 17 projects in FY2005. In FY2006, 13 projects received almost $1.5 million, including $0.4 million from the State Department ESF. By FY2007, 12 projects were funded with almost $1.5 million, mostly from the State Department. A 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office highlighted significant issues in the U.S. democracy assistance program for Cuba from 1996-2005, emphasizing the need for better management and oversight. The GAO highlighted issues with the U.S. democracy assistance program for Cuba, citing inadequate internal controls and oversight. Representative William Delahunt requested the GAO study, and a White House aide resigned due to alleged misuse of funds. Sixto pled guilty to stealing nearly $600,000. The GAO report praised USAID's efforts to improve oversight of its Cuba democracy program since 2006, including awarding grants competitively, hiring more staff, and enhancing financial services for grantees. Another group, Grupo de Apoyo a la Democracia, is also under investigation for misuse of funds. The GAO report commended USAID for improving oversight of its Cuba democracy program since 2006, but noted staffing issues hindering effective grant oversight. Recommendations included ensuring adequate staffing levels for monitoring activities and assessing overall efforts to reduce grantee risks. The Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) report in May 2008 criticized the spending of U.S. assistance for Cuba on operating expenses by grantees. Recommendations included allocating 75% of funds to direct aid for Cuban civil society and providing cash aid to dissidents and political prisoners' families. Radio and TV Mart\u00ed, U.S.-government sponsored broadcasting to Cuba, started in 1985 and 1990 respectively. The United States supports the right of the Cuban people to access information through various media, including radio and television broadcasting. The Broadcasting Board of Governors oversees entities like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to provide accurate news and promote freedom in Cuba. The Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) manages Radio and TV Marti, broadcasting from Florida. Radio Mart\u00ed broadcasts on short and medium wave channels for 24 hours six days per week. TV Mart\u00ed broadcasts daily on satellite and the internet, also available on cable stations in Latin America. The move of OCB from Washington D.C. to south Florida was completed in 1998. In July 2005, TV Mart\u00ed's blimps in Cudjoe Key, Florida were destroyed by Hurricane Dennis. From 2004 to 2006, TV Mart\u00ed was transmitted via Commando Solo, a C-130 aircraft. In August 2006, OCB started using a private aircraft to broadcast TV Mart\u00ed six days a week. By October 2006, Aero Mart\u00ed was launched, transmitting live broadcasts for five hours daily from Monday to Saturday evenings. OCB has had two private aircraft transmitting broadcasts since mid-FY2007. In December 2006, OCB contracted with two U.S. commercial stations to transmit Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The OCB contracted with two private U.S. commercial stations to transmit Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. Radio Mamb\u00ed in Florida broadcasted Radio Mart\u00ed programming for one hour five days a week, while WPMF in Miami aired TV Mart\u00ed newscasts and news updates. The contracts were extended for an additional six months in June 2007, but the Radio Mamb\u00ed contract expired in early 2008. TV Mart\u00ed continues to be shown on Channel 38. In early 2008, Radio Mart\u00ed's contract expired, while TV Mart\u00ed still airs on Channel 38. Both programs have faced controversies over adherence to broadcast standards and funding cuts. In December 2006, reports highlighted issues with cronyism and bias in OCB's operations. In February 2007, the former director of TV Mart\u00ed pled guilty to receiving kickbacks. Various government studies and audits have been conducted on Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized the practices of the International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) and Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) in awarding contracts to Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca, citing a lack of transparency and accountability. However, a State Department/BBG Office of Inspector General report in June 2007 noted significant improvements in OCB's operations under director Pedro Roig, with streamlined operations and improved broadcast quality. Quality reviews showed marked improvements in production quality over the past two years. The report praised the improved production quality and content of television broadcasts over the past two years by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). It recommended a review of leases with Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca to assess their value and suggested the need for a long-term strategic plan to meet the future needs of the Cuban audience. The OIG report praised the improved production quality and content of television broadcasts by the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). It recommended a review of leases with Radio Mamb\u00ed and TV Azteca and suggested a long-term strategic plan to meet the future needs of the Cuban audience. The report also mentioned anecdotal evidence of increased viewership of TV Mart\u00ed in Cuba, based on a survey of Cuban arrivals showing high listening rates for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The OIG report highlights that 17% of recent Cuban arrivals had watched TV Mart\u00ed, with a survey by the US Interests Section in Havana showing increased viewership. However, some observers argue that TV Mart\u00ed is hardly viewable in Cuba due to government jamming efforts. John Nichols, a communications professor, found the signal to be unusable during his visit to Cuba in 2007. TV Mart\u00ed has low viewership in Cuba, with past week viewership estimated between 0.1% and 0.3% and past month viewership around 0.5%. Radio Mart\u00ed, on the other hand, has higher listenership, with 1% to 2% in the past week and 4% to 5% in the past month. Despite significant funding for broadcasting to Cuba, TV Mart\u00ed's viewership remains minimal. The Bush Administration requested $34.4 million for broadcasting to Cuba in FY2009. Funding for Cuba broadcasting has varied over the years, with amounts allocated for Radio and TV Mart\u00ed. The Broadcasting Board of Governors stopped making this distinction in its annual budget requests since FY2005. In FY2007, $36.279 million was requested for Cuba broadcasting, including $2.7 million for a broadcasting aerostat for TV Mart\u00ed. The House passed H.R. 5672 in June 2006 for FY2007 Science, State, Justice, Commerce funding. In FY2007, the House passed H.R. 5672 to fund Cuba broadcasting under the International Broadcasting Operations account. The bill recommended $36.102 million for Cuba broadcasting, including $2.7 million for improving transmission capabilities via aerostat for TV Mart\u00ed. The Senate version of the bill also recommended full funding of $36.279 million. Final action was not completed before the end of the 109th Congress, but funding was ultimately provided in the 110th Congress through continuing resolutions, totaling $33.9 million for FY2007. The Administration requested $38.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2008. The Administration requested $38.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2008, including $3.2 million to enhance programming. $1.2 million would improve Radio and TV Mart\u00ed program production in OCB's Miami facility, while $2 million would be used for transmission leases. Congress provided $33.408 million for Radio and TV Marti in the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was less than the Administration's request. The Administration requested $38.7 million for Cuba broadcasting in FY2008, but Congress provided $33.408 million, which was less than the request. For FY2009, the Administration requested $34.392 million for broadcasting to Cuba, slightly more than provided by Congress in FY2008. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended fully funding the Administration's request for Cuba broadcasting in FY2009. The 110th Congress did not finalize FY2009 appropriations, but approved funding until March 6, 2009. Cuba and the United States reached migration accords in 1994 and 1995 to prevent mass exodus. In response to Castro's threat of another Mariel boatlift, President Clinton changed U.S. migration policy in 1994 to prevent fleeing Cubans from entering the United States. In 1994, the United States and Cuba reached a bilateral agreement to stem the flow of Cubans fleeing to the United States by boat. The agreement ensured safe, legal, and orderly Cuban migration to the U.S., with a minimum of 20,000 legal migrants each year. The U.S. discontinued granting parole to all Cuban migrants reaching its shores, while Cuba agreed to prevent unsafe departures. In May 1995, the United States and Cuba reached an accord where the U.S. would parole over 30,000 Cubans housed at Guantanamo into the U.S. but intercept future Cuban migrants at sea and return them to Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard has since interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to Cuba. The U.S. Coast Guard has interdicted thousands of Cubans at sea and returned them to their country. Cubans who reach shore can apply for permanent resident status under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. The \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy has been criticized for encouraging risky migration. The number of Cubans interdicted at sea has fluctuated in recent years, with a peak of 3,197 in 2007. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of Cuban migrants intercepted at sea, with over 1,000 interdicted in late June 2008. Cuba and Mexico are negotiating a migration agreement to curb irregular flows. U.S. prosecution of migrant smugglers in Florida has also increased, with reports of violent incidents involving Cuban migrants and Coast Guard officials. The Cuban government has taken action against alien smuggling, imposing prison sentences of up to three years. Following Fidel Castro's temporary ceding of power in 2006, the Department of Homeland Security urged Cubans to stay on the island and announced measures to discourage risky sea travel to the United States. Measures were also implemented to deter Cubans from turning to alien smuggling for entry into the U.S. The United States has implemented measures to support family reunification for Cuban migrants, increasing the number admitted annually to about 21,000. Cubans attempting illegal entry will be ineligible under the new policy. Cuban medical personnel working in third countries can now enter the U.S along with their families. A mass migration response exercise, Operation Vigilant Sentry, was conducted in Florida to prepare for potential mass migration from Cuba in case of government collapse. Operation Vigilant Sentry was a mass migration response exercise conducted in Florida to improve migrant-interdiction skills and intercept vessels heading to Cuba. Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States had only awarded 10,724 visas for permanent legal migration in FY2007, falling short of the agreed annual minimum of 20,000 due to Cuba's restrictions on the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The United States has held shipping containers with supplies for the diplomatic facility in Havana and refused to issue temporary visas for technical personnel. In response, the Department of Homeland Security created the Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program to expedite family reunification through legal migration channels. The Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program aims to facilitate safe migration to the United States and discourage dangerous maritime journeys. Talks between the U.S. and Cuba on migration accords have been stalled since 2004 due to Cuba's refusal to address key issues identified by the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard and Cuba's responsibilities regarding repatriation of Cubans interdicted at sea, U.S. diplomats' travel monitoring, and accepting Cuban nationals determined inadmissible to the U.S. Talks between the two countries on migration accords have been stalled since 2004 due to Cuba's refusal to address key issues identified by the U.S. The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay has been a U.S. base since 1903, with a treaty in force that requires mutual agreement for termination. Cuba's response to the cancellation of talks was that the U.S. decision was irresponsible, and they were prepared to discuss all raised issues. The Guantanamo Bay base has had various missions over time, including controlling Caribbean sea lanes during the Cold War and housing Cuban and Haitian refugees in the 1990s. Since a 1995 accord, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted Cuban migrants at sea, with some being granted asylum in a third country. The Guantanamo Bay base's mission evolved with the U.S.-led global campaign against terrorism post-9/11. Captured Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were sent there during the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Despite Cuban objections to the U.S. presence, they agreed to house detainees. The Cuban government expressed concerns about prisoner treatment and denounced \"atrocities\" at the base in January 2005. In January 2005, Guantanamo Bay was denounced for \"atrocities\" committed there. Some Members of Congress called for the closure of the detention facility. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to close Guantanamo within a year or 120 days. The FY2008 defense authorization bill required a report on transferring detainees, but was vetoed by the President. The FY2008 defense authorization bill, H.R. 4986, signed into law in January 2008, contains a provision on Guantanamo in Section 1067. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996 states that U.S. policy regarding Guantanamo will be reevaluated once a democratically elected Cuban government is in place. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law in December 2007, includes provisions related to Cuba.
