    "content": "The 112th Congress is scrutinizing federal real property management to reduce expenditures and increase revenue. Agencies own many unneeded or underutilized buildings that could be sold or redeveloped for savings. The Government Accountability Office has identified the wasteful practice of leasing new space instead of constructing buildings. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has repeatedly identified wasteful practices in federal real property management. Legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress to address this issue, including the Civilian Real Property Realignment Act of 2011 (CPRA, H.R. 1734). This bill aims to save billions of dollars through improved asset management, potentially reducing the deficit or supporting other policy priorities. The Civilian Real Property Realignment Act of 2011 (CPRA) established an independent commission to assess federal real property and recommend actions for reducing unneeded holdings. The bill had a broad scope, applying to space owned and leased by executive branch agencies and government corporations, excluding certain properties like military installations and those owned by the United States Postal Service. It encompassed real property asset management functions such as consolidation and reconfiguration. The Civilian Real Property Realignment Act of 2011 (CPRA) focuses on realigning federal real property portfolios through actions like consolidation, reconfiguration, and disposal of unneeded properties. Federal agencies would develop recommendations for reducing operating costs and submit them to the General Services Administration and the Office of Management and Budget. The Civilian Real Property Realignment Act of 2011 (CPRA) aims to realign federal property portfolios by consolidating, reconfiguring, and disposing of unneeded properties. The GSA Administrator and OMB Director would develop criteria for realignment based on nine principles, including alignment with agency mission, cost savings, and community impact. The bill requires the OMB Director to establish utilization rate standards for government-owned and -leased space, with potential actions to improve space utilization. Recommendations would be reviewed and revised by the OMB Director and GSA Administrator before submission to a Civilian Property Realignment Commission. The GSA and OMB Director review agency recommendations for real property management, disposal, and acquisition. GSA handles federal property disposal and acquisition, oversees the Federal Buildings Fund, and maintains the Federal Real Property Profile database. The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) database contains data on excess and surplus properties, their condition, and maintenance costs. OMB chairs the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), providing guidance on real property management. GSA and OMB work closely with agencies on real property issues and may have the expertise to evaluate and revise agency recommendations before submission to the Commission. The OMB and GSA have experience in developing government-wide real property guidance. However, GSA has been criticized for ineffective property management, raising concerns about its role in developing criteria for CPRA recommendations. The CPRA includes the establishment of a Civilian Property Realignment Commission to assess agency inventories and make recommendations to the President on property realignment. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission would consist of nine members appointed by the President, with expertise in various fields. The Commission would analyze agency real property inventories and recommendations from the Administrator and OMB Director, and terminate after six years. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission would analyze agency property inventories and recommendations, hold public hearings, develop an accounting system, and submit a report to the President. The Commission aims to develop consensus but may include recommendations supported by a majority. It would establish a website for posting recommendations and require GAO to publish a report on realignment selection. Congress could influence the Commission's composition by requiring Senate consent and consultation with leaders. The Civilian Property Realignment Commission would analyze agency property inventories, hold public hearings, and develop recommendations. Congress could influence the Commission's composition by requiring Senate consent and consultation with leaders. The CPRA process could be slowed down by consultations with congressional leaders and Senate confirmation of the Commission chairperson. The President would review the Commission's recommendations and submit a report to Congress within 30 days. The President must approve or reject all of the Commission's recommendations. If he disapproves, he must submit a report to Congress and the Commission, who can revise the recommendations within 30 days. If no report is submitted within 30 days, the CPRA process ends for the year. Congress would have 45 days to review and vote on the President-approved recommendations from the Commission. They would need to approve the entire list of actions, not individual ones, to reduce conflicts among stakeholders. The United States Postal Service (USPS) identified redundant facilities to close in 2002 to reduce operating costs, but faced political pressure from stakeholders and ultimately abandoned many closure plans. The CPRA aims to reduce stakeholder pressure by shifting decision-making to an independent commission and imposing a 45-day timeframe for congressional action. The CPRA would limit Congress's time for considering recommendations on major real property actions, potentially reducing oversight. Projects like the Department of Homeland Security consolidation at St. Elizabeth's costing $3.26 billion have long-term consequences and require congressional hearings. The CPRA would impose time constraints on Congress for reviewing major real property actions, potentially limiting oversight. This includes projects like the relocation of DHS headquarters and FDA consolidation, which have significant financial implications. If approved, agencies must start implementing recommendations within two years and complete them within six years, unless extenuating circumstances cause delays. The GSA Administrator would have the authority to take necessary actions, such as selling or exchanging properties. The CPRA grants the GSA Administrator authority to take actions, including selling or exchanging properties, to implement Commission recommendations. Federal agencies must use existing authorities or work with GSA. The Administrator can convey property for less than fair market value, potentially bypassing certain disposal processes. The House-passed version includes an amendment requiring screening of properties for homeless use. The amendment to the McKinney-Vento Act would apply to properties identified for disposal that are under 25,000 square feet or valued at less than $5 million. Agencies argue that homeless screening requirements create delays and increase maintenance costs. VA officials say the Act can add up to two years to the disposal process, resulting in ongoing operating and maintenance expenses on unneeded properties. CPRA aims to save costs by limiting screening to properties recommended for conveyance, potentially bypassing the process for certain properties. It is unclear how many properties would meet homeless screening criteria, impacting potential savings. The bill establishes two accounts for administrative costs and implementing actions, with appropriations of $20 million for salaries and expenses and $62 million for the APSMF. The APSMF would receive $62 million from the sale of properties as per the Commission's recommendations. Agencies argue for using net proceeds for real property activities to dispose of unneeded buildings. However, it is uncertain if there will be enough funds for costly actions like consolidating offices or preparing properties for sale. Agencies often lack the necessary funding for repairs or maintenance. The government faces significant challenges with property deficiencies due to lack of funding. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimated a $3 billion repair cost for buildings in poor condition. Despite selling 2,200 buildings in FY2009, only $50 million was netted. The market values of surplus properties are undisclosed, limiting potential for significant profits. The CPRA would restrict executive agencies from acquiring leased space without GSA involvement. The CPRA would require executive agencies to acquire leased space only through GSA, except for properties of the Department of Veterans Affairs or those excluded for national security reasons by the President. This may centralize leasing decisions but could potentially hinder GSA's ability to delegate leasing authority. If agencies lose independent leasing authority, it could cause delays in acquiring necessary space for their operations."
