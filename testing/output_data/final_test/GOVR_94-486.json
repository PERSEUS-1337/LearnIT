Disability for adults is the inability to work due to a physical or mental impairment lasting at least 12 months. Children can qualify if they have severe limitations. SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, established in 1972, provides cash income to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited resources. SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and operates in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. To qualify for SSI, a person must be a citizen of the United States or a \"qualified alien\" and meet certain residency requirements. In December 2013, the SSI program had over 8.3 million recipients, including children, adults, and elderly individuals. The federal SSI program provides cash income to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited resources. In 2014, the maximum federal SSI payment was $721 per month for an individual and $1,082 for a couple living independently. Most states supplement the federal SSI benefit, with adjustments made annually based on the Consumer Price Index. Recipients with other income have their countable income subtracted from the federal benefit rate to determine their SSI eligibility and payment amount. In December 2013, the average monthly federally administered SSI payment was $630.98 for children under 18, $546.38 for adults aged 18-64, and $425.09 for adults aged 65 or older. SSA sends SSI payments directly to recipients, but assigns representative payees to minors or individuals unable to manage their benefits. SSI recipients living alone or with all household members receiving SSI are automatically eligible for SNAP. Most SSI recipients are eligible for Medicaid. The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program determines eligibility and payment amounts based on all types of income. \"Deeming\" is used when an eligible individual lives with an ineligible spouse or child, or when an eligible non-citizen has a sponsor. SSI recipients can have assets up to $2,000 (or $3,000 for couples), excluding a home, car, and household items. Federal SSI benefits are funded by federal general revenues, while state supplements are funded by state funds. In FY2013, the net cost of the SSI program was $53.2 billion. The SSI program's funding of $53.2 billion comes from Congress through the annual appropriations bill for Labor, Health, Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies."
