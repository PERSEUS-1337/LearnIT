    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Domestic Refugee Resettlement Reform and Modernization Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that the United States has increased efforts to resettle Iraqi refugees since 2007, with many refugees in Syria and Jordan lacking legal status and access to healthcare. These refugees, often victims of torture or persecution, may have supported American military operations and are in need of protection and support upon arrival in the US. In fiscal years 2008 and 2009, thousands of Iraqi refugees were resettled in the United States. In fiscal year 2009, refugees resettled in the United States receive 36 months of cash and medical assistance, but in reality, they only get 8 months of support. Despite facing challenges like the recession, refugees can become self-sufficient with proper resettlement support. However, many struggle to find employment within the 8-month benefit period. State refugee offices and voluntary agencies lack adequate resources to assist refugees effectively. State refugee offices and voluntary agencies lack resources and data to increase staffing levels for the large number of refugees needing services. ORR funding formulas are retroactive, not reflecting large increases in refugee admissions. US resettlement policy assumes quick self-sufficiency for refugees, despite specific vulnerabilities hindering integration. Some refugees may have mental health issues from trauma or torture. Refugee services are hindered by lack of resources and data, with mental health issues from trauma or torture being a significant barrier to self-sufficiency and integration. Secondary migration is not properly tracked, and support is needed for organizations providing refugee services. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"national resettlement agency\" as voluntary agencies providing services to refugees, \"community based organization\" as nonprofits offering various services to refugees, and \"Assistant Secretary\" as the official overseeing refugee resettlement. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment. SEC. 5. ASSESSMENT OF THE REFUGEE DOMESTIC RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.
