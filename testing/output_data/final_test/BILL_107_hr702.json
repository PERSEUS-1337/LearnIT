    "content": "The \"Personal Watercraft Responsible Use Act of 2001\" aims to address the safety risks and environmental damage caused by the growing popularity of personal watercraft. These thrill craft operate differently from other boats, posing risks to untrained operators and aquatic habitats in shallow waters. The purposes and policies of the Act include ensuring safe use of personal watercraft, protecting shallow water habitats, reducing conflicts among boaters, and providing federal assistance to improve enforcement of boating laws. In this Act, definitions for \"coastal state\", \"coastal waters\", \"Secretary\", and \"personal watercraft\" are provided. Personal watercraft is defined as a motor vessel designed for one or more persons, powered by an inboard motor, and operated in various positions. \"No-wake speed\" is defined as the speed at which a personal watercraft moves through the water. The \"no-wake speed\" is the speed at which a personal watercraft moves through the water while maintaining minimum headway and producing the smallest wake possible. SEC. 5. ENFORCEABLE POLICIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE. The Secretary can withhold up to 10% of a coastal state's assistance under the Coastal Zone Management Act unless enforceable policies on personal watercraft operation are implemented. These policies must prohibit operating at no-wake speed in sensitive areas. The Coastal Zone Management Act requires that personal watercraft operators must not operate within 200 feet from the shoreline, in designated sensitive areas, or in a manner that disturbs wildlife. Coastal states must designate sensitive areas and enforce policies to protect them. The Secretary will issue criteria for designating sensitive areas based on unique aquatic habitat, vegetation, nesting birds, shellfish beds, marine mammals, and importance for recreational and commercial users. Coastal states with approved programs can comply by amending them to include required policies. The Secretary will issue regulations for designating sensitive areas based on unique aquatic habitat, vegetation, nesting birds, shellfish beds, and marine mammals. States can use grants to develop and implement enforceable policies required under this section. Regulations must be issued within one year of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. PERSONAL WATERCRAFT SAFETY PROGRAM. The Secretary of Transportation must establish guidelines for personal watercraft operation, including mandatory state registration, a minimum operator age of 16, and completion of a training program for all operators. Operators of personal watercraft, including rented vessels, must complete a training program with safety and conservation components. States can use funds to develop regulations for improving personal watercraft user safety, reducing conflicts, and minimizing environmental damage. SEC. 7. LAW ENFORCEMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to States for enforcing recreational boating laws, including equipment purchase and hiring personnel. States must have a boating safety program following national guidelines and adopt enforceable policies to be eligible. Allocation of grants is based on the number of recreational vessels in each State. The Secretary of Transportation provides grants to States for enforcing recreational boating laws, based on the number of registered vessels. States must have a boating safety program and matching funds are required for the grants. State contributions can be in the form of goods or services. SEC. 8. TASK FORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Transportation may provide grants to States for collaborative task forces to reduce conflicts between personal watercraft and other users. Task forces must be geographically organized and include members representing various stakeholders. Grants will be awarded competitively, with a limit of 25 per State. The Secretary of Transportation may issue regulations for task force development grants, requiring a 1-to-1 match of Federal and State funds. Grants must be used within 2 years, with unobligated funds reverting back to the Secretary for future grants. Authorization of appropriations for law enforcement grants and task force development grants under sections 7 and 8 respectively, totaling $25,000,000 and $2,500,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004. States retain the authority to impose stricter regulations on personal watercraft operation than those outlined in the Act."
