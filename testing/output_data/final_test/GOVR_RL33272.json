    "content": "The President submits a federal budget proposal to Congress annually by the first Monday in February. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes the proposal, and the House and Senate Budget Committees develop a budget resolution. Differences between the houses are to be resolved by April 15. The resolution serves as a framework for legislative action on the budget. This report focuses on Medicaid and SCHIP budget issues for FY2007, to be updated until the release of the President's FY2008 budget. The President's FY2008 budget has been released, containing proposals impacting Medicaid and SCHIP. The report provides background information, descriptions of the proposals, and cost estimates. Some proposals require legislative action, while others can be implemented without it. The President's budget proposals for Medicaid and SCHIP include both legislative and administrative changes. CBO and executive branch agencies differ in their treatment of these proposals, with CBO adjusting baseline estimates only as administrative changes are implemented. The President's budget proposals for Medicaid and SCHIP include legislative and administrative changes. CBO adjusts baseline estimates only as administrative changes are implemented, leading to differences with executive branch estimates. Two key administrative proposals in the FY2007 budget are limiting states' ability to tax health care providers for additional federal Medicaid funds and capping Medicaid payments to government providers. Congress urged HHS Secretary Leavitt not to implement Medicaid changes via administrative action, emphasizing the importance of congressional review. The 109th Congress passed legislation (H.R. 6111) to prevent the President's provider tax proposal. Congress passed legislation (H.R. 6111) to prevent the President's provider tax proposal and address transitional medical assistance and FY2007 SCHIP shortfalls. Transitional medical assistance (TMA) ensures Medicaid benefits for low-income families facing changes in income. Federal law requires four months of TMA for families losing eligibility due to various reasons, with work-related TMA benefits expanded in 1988. Congress expanded work-related TMA benefits in 1988, requiring states to provide up to 12 months of TMA coverage to families losing Medicaid eligibility due to increased hours of work or income. The President's budget seeks to extend these requirements through September 30, 2007, costing Medicaid $180 million in FY2007 and $360 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period. The proposal would cost Medicaid $129 million in FY2007 and $526 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period, while saving SCHIP $3 million in both FY2007 and over the FY2007-FY2011 period. Congressional Action extended TMA requirements through June 30, 2007. The Vaccines for Children program is funded by federal Medicaid appropriations. Children who are Medicaid recipients, uninsured, American Indians or Alaska Natives, or underinsured are entitled to receive VFC vaccines free of charge. In 2002, there were approximately 42,000 active VFC provider sites. Proposal seeks legislation to improve vaccine access. The President's budget proposes legislation to improve vaccine access by allowing underinsured children to receive VFC vaccines at state and local health clinics. The estimated cost of the proposal is $140 million in FY2007 and $700 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period. CBO estimates a cost of $115 million in FY2007 and $715 million over the same period. Third-party liability (TPL) refers to the legal obligation of third parties to pay for medical assistance under Medicaid. Medicaid is required to be the payer of last resort. For more information on FQHCs and rural health clinics, refer to CRS Report RL32046 by Barbara English. States must ensure that all other third parties meet their legal obligation to pay claims before Medicaid covers an individual's care. If probable liability exists, states must reject the claim for cost avoidance. If liability is uncertain or the third party cannot pay, states must pay the claim and try to recover the amount. Exceptions exist for using the pay-and-chase method. In certain cases, states are required to use pay-and-chase for prenatal and preventive pediatric care. Medicaid beneficiaries may need to reimburse the state for expenses, with the state able to place a lien on their property. Federal law prohibits Medicaid liens on living beneficiaries' property but allows them on deceased beneficiaries' estates. The President's budget proposes three legislative changes regarding Medicaid liens on deceased beneficiaries' estates. Providers would be required to bill third parties for certain services before billing Medicaid, with a 90-day waiting period. States would be explicitly permitted to use liens against liability settlements to recover Medicaid amounts. The proposal is estimated to save $90 million in FY2007 and $525 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period. The Medicaid state plan offers case management as an optional benefit to assist beneficiaries in accessing necessary services. Targeted case management is provided to specific classes of individuals or those in certain areas, with federal matching payments ranging from 50% to 83% depending on the state. The President's budget proposes changing the reimbursement level for targeted case management to a 50% matching rate for most Medicaid administrative costs. This change is estimated to save $208 million in FY2007 and $1.187 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period. CBO estimates savings of $250 million in FY2007 and $1.485 billion over the same period. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must enter rebate agreements with the Secretary of HHS for state Medicaid programs. Rebate calculations ensure Medicaid pays the lowest price offered by the manufacturers for drugs. Rebates are based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) compared to the \"best price.\" Additional rebates may be required based on weighted average prices. The President's budget proposes legislation to change the rebate formula for Medicaid drugs, eliminating the \"best price\" requirement and implementing a flat rebate for single source and innovator multiple source drugs. This change aims to simplify rebate calculations and allow for lower drug prices through private negotiations. HHS and CBO estimate no cost impact in the upcoming years. Under current law, state Medicaid programs set prices paid to pharmacies for outpatient drugs, with federal reimbursements limited to a federal upper limit (FUL). The FUL for generic drugs is 150% of the lowest published average wholesale price, while brand-name drugs are based on states' estimated acquisition costs. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 will change the FUL formula for multiple source drugs starting January 1, 2007. Beginning January 1, 2007, the FUL for multiple source drugs will change to 250% of the average manufacturer's price (AMP). The President's budget proposal aims to further reduce the FULs on these drugs to 150% of the AMP, with estimated savings of $130 million in FY2007 and $1.285 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period according to HHS. CBO estimates savings of $275 million in FY2007 and $2.325 billion over the same period. For more information on the Medicaid provisions of DRA 2005, refer to CRS Report RL33131 and CRS Report RL33251. The Federal statute allows state Medicaid programs to establish formularies for preferred pharmaceuticals. These formularies are less restrictive than closed formularies in the private market. Medicaid must provide non-formulary drugs, with exceptions for specific categories. States must cover all drugs from manufacturers with rebate agreements, but can exclude certain categories like drugs for weight loss, fertility, and cosmetic purposes. Formularies may also exclude drugs like barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The President's budget proposes legislation for states to use private sector management techniques to negotiate greater discounts with drug manufacturers, aiming to save $15 million in FY2007 and $177 million over FY2007-FY2011. Federal law prohibits Medicaid funds from being used for drugs treating sexual or erectile dysfunction. The proposal in the FY2007-FY2011 period aims to save $10 million in FY2007 and $200 million overall. States often undertake administrative activities that benefit multiple programs due to overlap in eligible populations. When AFDC was replaced by TANF in 1996, the federal match for cash welfare assistance ended, and the link between cash welfare and Medicaid eligibility was severed. States must now allocate common administrative costs for TANF, Medicaid, and food stamps based on each program's benefits. TANF block grants are calculated using pre-1996 federal welfare spending, including reimbursements for common administrative costs. The President's budget proposes legislation to recoup Medicaid administrative costs included in states' TANF block grants, aiming to save $280 million in FY2007 and $1.770 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period. Congress has reduced federal reimbursement for food stamp administrative costs by a flat dollar amount, totaling nearly $200 million annually, but has not done so for Medicaid administrative costs. The President's budget proposes legislation to extend the exemption for refugees and asylees from seven years to eight years, allowing more time for individuals to complete the citizenship process without losing SSI and SSI-related Medicaid eligibility. This is estimated to save $280 million in FY2007 and $1.770 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period. The proposal aims to extend the exemption for refugees and asylees to eight years, allowing more time for citizenship without losing SSI and SSI-related Medicaid eligibility. Estimated costs are $42 million in FY2007 and $134 million over FY2007-FY2011. CBO estimates lower costs at $5 million in FY2007 and $17 million over the same period. For more information, refer to CRS reports on refugee admissions, federal funding for unauthorized aliens' medical expenses, and noncitizen eligibility for federal assistance programs. The President's budget proposal would require states to use cost avoidance for pharmacy claims, eliminating the pay and chase waiver option. This change is estimated to save $105 million in FY2007 and $430 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period. CBO did not provide an estimate for this proposal. Under federal law, states can use provider-specific taxes to fund their Medicaid expenditures, but there are limitations. Taxes cannot exceed 25% of the state's share, and states cannot guarantee the return of tax funds to providers. However, if taxes returned to a provider are less than 6% of their revenues, the prohibition on guaranteeing the return of funds is not violated. States could impose a 6% provider tax, return the funds as Medicaid payments, and receive federal matching funds. The President's budget proposes to reduce the allowable provider tax rate from 6% to 3%, aiming to save $2.070 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period. The 109th Congress passed H.R. 6111, fixing the provider tax ceiling at 6% except for a period where it is set at 5.5%. This prevents the President's proposal from being implemented administratively. The President's budget proposes to clarify existing policies on provider taxes through regulation, with no cost impact estimated for FY2007-FY2011. Medicaid payments to certain institutional providers must not exceed Medicare payment principles. See CRS Report 97-483 for background on provider taxes. The Medicaid upper payment limit (UPL) rule allows states to draw down additional federal dollars by using Medicare payment rates for hospital and nursing home care. Some states require government providers to transfer extra payments back to the state through an intergovernmental transfer (IGT). These funds are sometimes used for non-health services or to cover part of the state's Medicaid costs to access more federal dollars. The UPL rules for Medicaid were revised during 2000-2002 to reduce excess federal dollars states received through IGTs. Despite reforms, some excess payments still exist due to unchanged UPL standards and regulations. CMS has taken steps to address improper state financing, requesting detailed information on Medicaid costs sources from states applying for waivers or plan amendments. The President's budget proposes to recover federal payments from improper IGTs and cap payments to government providers for Medicaid services. This could save $384 million in FY2007 and $3.812 billion over FY2007-FY2011. HHS estimates the savings, while CBO did not provide an estimate. (Source: CRS Report RL31021) Since the inception of Medicaid in 1965, states have been authorized to cover a broad range of services under the rehabilitation benefit, including diagnostic, screening, preventive, or rehabilitative services recommended by a physician. Congressional legislation clarified this benefit to encompass any medical or remedial service for the reduction of disability and restoration of individuals to their best functional level. The Medicaid rehabilitation benefit covers services for individuals with disabilities, including mental health, substance abuse, early intervention, physical disabilities, school-based rehabilitation, and services for children in foster care and juvenile justice programs. However, some states have misused this benefit by billing for non-rehabilitation services or using inefficient payment methods. The President's budget proposes changes to address these issues. The President's budget proposes clarifying Medicaid rehabilitation services to save money and prevent abuse in school settings. Medicaid covers services for individuals with disabilities, but misuse has led to overpayments. The proposal aims to address these issues and save $225 million in FY2007 and $2.286 billion over FY2007-FY2011. The President's budget aims to clarify Medicaid rehabilitation services to prevent abuse and save money in school settings. Inappropriate Medicaid billing for transportation and administrative activities has been highlighted in GAO and HHS OIG studies. Examples include lack of verification for provided transportation, billing for services not rendered, and inaccurate time studies for administrative activities. The President's budget aims to save money by prohibiting federal reimbursement for IDEA-related school-based administration and transportation costs, estimating savings of $615 million in FY2007 and $3.645 billion over FY2007-FY2011. This proposal would impact the allocation of costs for administrative activities across funding sources, including Medicaid, and other expenditures related to school employees and operating costs. States and the District of Columbia must consider hospitals serving a high number of Medicaid beneficiaries when setting payment rates. Each state determines which hospitals receive disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments under federal guidelines. The federal government shares the cost of DSH payments with states, capped at a statewide ceiling. Total federal reimbursement for DSH payments is limited, and payments to individual hospitals are also capped. The President's budget aims to clarify regulations on the use of DSH funds, with no cost impact estimated for FY2007-FY2011. Background information on Medicaid DSH payments can be found in CRS Report 97-483. SCHIP, established by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, allows states to cover low-income children above Medicaid eligibility levels. States have three benefit options for their SCHIP programs. States have flexibility in designing their SCHIP programs, enrolling low-income children in Medicaid or a separate state program. Nearly $40 billion has been allocated for SCHIP from FY1998-FY2007, with an authorized appropriation of $5.0 billion for FY2007. Annual allotments are based on the number of low-income children and uninsured children in the state, with funds needing to be spent within three years. Unused funds are reallocated among states. The President's budget proposes legislation to target SCHIP funds more effectively to address state shortfalls. The cost of the proposal is estimated at $635 million in FY2007, with a net cost of $110 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period according to HHS. CBO estimates the cost at $570 million in FY2007, with a net cost of $460 million over the same period. The proposal aims to redistribute unspent SCHIP funds to prevent state shortfalls, with estimated savings of $290 million in FY2007 and a net savings of $235 million over FY2007-FY2011. Congressional Action included passing H.R. 6164 to address the issue. Various reports provide additional information on SCHIP provisions and financing. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) established rules for employer-based health insurance plans to improve access and portability. One provision allows new enrollment outside of the annual open enrollment period for special reasons like exhausting COBRA coverage or gaining a new dependent. HIPAA also limits private health insurance plans from excluding coverage for pre-existing conditions. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to HIPAA, including defining Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility as a qualifying event for special enrollment into employer-based health insurance plans. This aims to enhance Medicaid and SCHIP programs' capabilities. The President's budget proposes legislative changes to HIPAA, including improving coordination between Medicaid, SCHIP, and private employer-offered coverage. It also suggests requiring SCHIP programs to issue certificates of creditable coverage to enhance HIPAA's portability provisions. HHS estimates no cost impact, and CBO did not provide an estimate. For more information on HIPAA, refer to CRS Report RL31634. In FY2004, nearly 6.2 million children were enrolled in SCHIP, while 27.4 million were enrolled in Medicaid in FY2003. Concerns persist about low take-up rates among eligible children. Estimates show 2.8 million uninsured children eligible for SCHIP and 3.4 million eligible for Medicaid in 2002. Medicaid and SCHIP can finance outreach activities, with a 50% federal matching rate for administrative expenses. The Cover the Kids outreach program proposes annual grants to states for enrolling eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP, costing $100 million in FY2007 and $500 million over FY2007-FY2011. The grant is not part of the Medicaid or SCHIP budget proposals but falls under the State Grants and Demonstrations budget proposals overseen by CMS. The proposal for the Cover the Kids outreach program includes annual grants to states for enrolling eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP. HHS estimates additional costs of $203 million in FY2007 and $1.978 billion over the FY2007-FY2011 period for Medicaid, and $69 million in FY2007 and $330 million over the same period for SCHIP. CBO estimates an increase in Medicaid spending by $13 million in FY2007 and $477 million over the FY2007-FY2011 period, and an increase in SCHIP spending by $3 million in FY2007 and $26 million over the same period. The HCFAC account funds the Medicare Integrity Program within CMS and certain health care fraud and abuse activities within the FBI. Additional funds are earmarked for Medicare and Medicaid activities of the HHS OIG, with remaining funds divided among other HHS agencies and the Department of Justice. The President's budget seeks legislation to increase HCFAC funding with a discretionary appropriation, costing $10 million in FY2007 for CMS. The HCFAC account funds the Medicare Integrity Program within CMS and certain health care fraud and abuse activities within the FBI. Additional funds are earmarked for Medicare and Medicaid activities of the HHS OIG, with remaining funds divided among other HHS agencies and the Department of Justice. The President's budget seeks legislation to increase HCFAC funding with a discretionary appropriation, costing $10 million in FY2007 for CMS. The proposal did not have an estimate from CBO in its preliminary analysis. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution, S.Con.Res. 83, which did not include reconciliation instructions for the Senate Finance Committee but included funding for four of the President's Medicaid and SCHIP proposals. The House Budget Committee reported a budget resolution including funding for various healthcare initiatives such as TMA extension, Vaccines for Children proposal, Cover the Kids initiative, and SCHIP funding boost. The resolution did not include reconciliation instructions for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Spending levels for Medicaid and SCHIP were based on CBO's baseline projections, with no reduction in Medicaid assumed. No agreement was reached on a FY2007 budget resolution, but current law spending for Medicaid and SCHIP remains unaffected. In FY2007 budget resolution, Medicaid and SCHIP spending levels are unaffected by current law. Legislation increasing spending may face procedural obstacles without budget assumptions. Congress can limit federal funds for specific Medicaid and SCHIP activities through annual appropriations. For example, the House proposed restrictions on HHS funds in its FY2007 budget. The FY2007 budget resolution included provisions to restrict HHS funds from implementing the President's proposal to reduce provider taxes. Two bills passed by the 109th Congress addressed various Medicaid and SCHIP issues, redistributing unspent funds and extending TMA requirements. H.R. 6111 addressed Medicaid issues not in the President's budget, including corrections to the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 and FY2007 DSH allotments for Hawaii and Tennessee."
