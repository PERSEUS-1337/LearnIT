The National Institutes of Health EPSCoR Program Act of 2001 establishes a program to enhance research competitiveness of eligible institutions in obtaining funds for biomedical and behavioral research. Eligible institutions are defined as research entities located in EPSCoR States. The EPSCoR Program aims to improve research competitiveness for institutions in EPSCoR States with historically low success rates in obtaining funds for biomedical and behavioral research from national research institutes. The NIH EPSCoR committee, established for EPSCoR States, ensures that funding received for biomedical and behavioral research does not exceed 1.08% of the total amount awarded by national research institutes. The NIH EPSCoR committee for EPSCoR States must meet specific conditions, including having members from key research entities in the State, to be considered for funding under Law 100-570. The NIH EPSCoR committee includes representatives from the State legislature and the Governor's office, with members serving staggered 4-year terms. The EPSCoR State fiscal agent acts on behalf of the committee by submitting applications for grants and disbursing funds. The Director of NIH can provide technical assistance to enhance competitiveness for eligible research plans. The NIH EPSCoR committee includes representatives from the State legislature and the Governor's office, with members serving staggered 4-year terms. The EPSCoR State fiscal agent can enhance competitiveness for eligible institutions by providing technical assistance, assisting in developing research proposals, and implementing research plans through formula grants. The cooperative agreement provides funding to eligible institutions in EPSCoR States for biomedical and behavioral research capacity enhancement programs, student programs, training, equipment, and facilities. The cooperative agreement provides funding to eligible institutions in EPSCoR States for capacity enhancement programs, student programs, training, equipment, and facilities, including instrumentation, construction or renovation of facilities, establishing collaborative relationships with research entities, and other programs determined by the Director of NIH. Projects should have a significant short-term impact on improving research capacity. Application requirements include identifying specific needs. The application for funding in EPSCoR States must identify specific needs, prioritize research categories, have a plan to secure funds, and submit a report on award usage within 60 days after the fiscal year. The application for funding in EPSCoR States must meet additional requirements set by the Director of NIH, with approval from the NIH EPSCoR committee, and the amount of award is determined based on the appropriated funds available. The Director of NIH awards grants to eligible institutions for research projects in priority categories identified under subsection (c)(3)(A). Funding from other programs is required for projects to receive awards. The Director of NIH awards grants to eligible institutions for research projects, with priority given to projects led by researchers who have not previously served as principal investigators for national research institutes. Funding from other programs, known as `Coprograms', can also be allocated but not exceeding 50 percent of the total award amount. Projects eligible for awards must meet specific requirements, including identifying activities related to the project's purpose and involving multiple research areas funded by the institution. The Director of NIH may establish additional requirements for applications. The NIH EPSCoR committee must approve applications meeting specified criteria and aligning with the State's strategy. $200,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for subsequent years. The Director of NIH will allocate funds for technical assistance and research plans. The Director of NIH reserves up to 10 percent of funds for subsection (b). For fiscal year 2002, 80 percent of funds are allocated for awards under subsection (c) and 20 percent for awards under subsection (d)(1). For fiscal year 2003, 70 percent is allocated for awards under subsection (c). In fiscal years 2002 and 2003, funds are allocated for awards under subsections (c) and (d)(1) with varying percentages. For fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006, the allocation shifts to 60/40, 50/50, and 50/50 respectively. Additional funding is reserved for a cofunding program. The Director of NIH shall reserve savings in indirect costs from research projects in EPSCoR States for making awards. The savings will be based on a 5-year average and allocated in line with existing guidelines. State EPSCoR committees must submit annual reports on activities, and states must forward copies to NIH. The State must send annual reports on activities to the Director of NIH."
