Section 7209(b)(1) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to include a pilot program for enhanced driver's licenses in at least one state to evaluate their effectiveness. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to include a pilot program for enhanced driver's licenses in at least one state to evaluate their effectiveness, which may permit individuals to use their driver's license for entry into the United States from Canada at land and sea ports of entry. The pilot program for enhanced driver's licenses is part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, allowing their use for entry into the US from Canada at land and sea ports. Adequate passport adjudication personnel must be hired to meet increased demand during peak travel times. The pilot program aims to ensure passport issuance within 8 weeks and requires a report on its impact on national security and recommendations for expansion to other states. The pilot program includes plans for expanding to other states, scanning participants against terrorist watch lists, evaluating machine-readable technology for enhanced driver's licenses, and considering privacy concerns and costs. The pilot program includes recommendations for improving driver's licenses and analyzing cost savings for participants. SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULE FOR MINORS. Section 7209(b) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to allow minors under certain conditions to enter the US from Canada or Mexico without proof of citizenship if accompanied by a legal guardian. Minors can enter the US from Canada or Mexico without proof of citizenship if traveling with a school group, religious organization, or youth athletics team, and providing a birth certificate. SEC. 4. TRAVEL FACILITATION INITIATIVES. Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 is amended to establish a State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program, allowing the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with participating states. The State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program allows citizens of the United States and Canada to enter the US from Canada by land or sea with only a qualifying driver's license or identity card issued by a participating state. The document must be tamper-proof and machine-readable. The State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program allows citizens of the United States and Canada to enter the US from Canada with a qualifying driver's license or identity card issued by a participating state. The state must have a mechanism to verify citizenship status without requiring it on the card, managing the information like a passport application, and prohibiting its use or distribution. The State Driver's License and Identification Card Enrollment Program allows citizens of Canada to enter the US with a qualifying document issued by the Canadian government without additional proof of citizenship. The Secretary of Homeland Security aims to ensure that Canadian identification documents for entry into the US use technology similar to US documents. The Program may be expanded to allow entry from countries other than Canada or using different evidence of citizenship. The subsection defines the term 'State' and clarifies that it does not create a national identity card. A birth certificate can be used as proof of citizenship for intrastate travel. During a 2-year period after a final rule is published, the Secretary of State will waive pass card and passport execution fees for designated facilities in cities or ports of entry for certain travelers within the United States. During a 2-year period, the Secretary of State will waive passport execution fees for designated facilities in cities or ports of entry, and develop mobile enrollment teams to issue passports without fees along the northern and southern borders for US citizens near international borders. The Secretary of State will designate cities and ports of entry near the US international borders with low population density. Prior to implementing the rule, the Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Homeland Security will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of implementing a State Driver's License and Identity Card Enrollment Program as an alternative to passports. A report on average border crossing delays will be submitted to congressional committees every 3 months for 2 years after implementation. The Secretary of State will report average processing times for NEXUS, FAST, and SENTRI cards, as well as passports or passport cards to congressional committees every 3 months. Appropriate congressional committees include the Senate's Committee on Appropriations, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and Judiciary, as well as the House of Representatives' Committee on Appropriations, Homeland Security, and Judiciary. The Congress intended to delay the implementation of a travel plan until a passport card is widely distributed. Additionally, there are new authorities granted to passport processing staff. SEC. 6 amends reemployment rules for civil service and foreign service annuitants, changing dates to 2010. SEC. 7 requires a report on border infrastructure. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, must submit a report to Congress within 180 days on the US infrastructure for managing cross-border travel related to NEXUS, FAST, and SENTRI programs. The report will assess access to dedicated lanes, total border crossing time, secondary inspection delays, and reader efficiency for identity documents. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
