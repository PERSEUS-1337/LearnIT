    "content": "The section discusses changes in individual income tax, treatment of unincorporated business, corporate tax, and repeal of estate and gift taxes. Key elements of individual income tax include rate structure, deductions, exemptions, and earned income tax credit. Lower- and moderate-income taxpayers may qualify for child credit and earned income tax credit. Higher-income taxpayers may face alternative minimum tax. The blueprint revises these elements except existing child credit and earned income credit. Values are based on 2016 law. The current law indexes most elements for inflation, except the child credit. Tax rates range from 10% to 39.6%, with wider brackets for joint returns. The blueprint proposes rates of 12%, 25%, and 33%, with unchanged bracket sizes. Less than 0.7% of taxpayers are subject to the 39.6% rate. The top marginal tax rates for different brackets range from 0% to 33%, with varying percentages of taxpayers and adjusted gross income (AGI) falling into each bracket. High-income taxpayers may also face a 3% increase in tax rates through a phase out of itemized deductions. In 2016, high-income taxpayers faced a phase out of itemized deductions starting at $259,000 for singles and $311,000 for joint returns. They were also subject to additional taxes on investment and wage income exceeding certain thresholds, as part of the Affordable Care Act. The Better Way proposal does not address these taxes but indicates a repeal of all ACA taxes in different task force proposals. Tax brackets are indexed for inflation, and taxpayers can choose between a standard deduction or itemizing deductions, with about 30% of taxpayers opting to itemize. The tax plan revision eliminates personal exemptions and most itemized deductions, replacing them with larger standard deductions. Taxpayers can now claim a standard deduction of $12,000 for singles, $18,000 for head of household returns, and $24,000 for joint returns. A nonrefundable credit of $500 for dependents is introduced to offset the elimination of personal exemptions for dependents. The tax plan eliminates most itemized deductions, including state and local taxes, and personal exemptions for dependents. The standard deduction is increased but the child and dependent credit may not be indexed for inflation. The alternative minimum tax applies to high-income individuals and includes personal exemptions, standard deduction, and state and local tax deductions. The tax plan eliminates most itemized deductions, including state and local taxes, and personal exemptions for dependents. It repeals the tax on high-income individuals but keeps the earned income tax credit and child credit provisions with adjustments. Interest income is taxed at ordinary rates, while dividends and capital gains have lower rates. The tax proposal includes lower rates for capital gains and dividends, with a zero rate for individuals in the 15% bracket or below and 15% for higher brackets. High-income returns are subject to a 20% rate. The proposal would tax 50% of capital gains, dividends, and interest at ordinary rates, resulting in rates of 6%, 12.5%, and 16.5% for different income brackets. Business income from pass-through businesses would be taxed under the individual income tax. The tax proposal includes lower rates for capital gains and dividends, with a zero rate for individuals in the 15% bracket or below and 15% for higher brackets. Pass-through businesses, including sole proprietorships and partnerships, will be subject to a maximum rate of 25% under the blueprint. Earnings will be allocated to reflect the owner-operator's labor services and taxed at regular rates. Additional provisions for retirement saving and higher education benefits will be retained, with potential revisions. Provisions for health insurance and tax deductions for corporations are being studied by the Health Care Task Force. Current law imposes a 35% tax on taxable income for corporations, with some industries eligible for a 9% deduction for domestic production. Various expenses like overhead, labor compensation, and capital investments can be deducted over time. Small businesses can fully expense equipment investments. The U.S. tax system applies worldwide, taxing income from foreign operations with a credit for foreign income taxes paid. Income from foreign subsidiaries is not taxed until repatriated. The blueprint proposes a 20% corporate income tax, expensing investments, disallowing interest deduction, and retaining the research credit. The blueprint proposes to eliminate the domestic production activities deduction but retain the research credit, converting the income tax to a cash-flow tax with a zero effective marginal tax rate on investment. This would result in a tax system known as an X-tax, which imposes a value-added tax. Land acquisitions would not be expensed, and it is unclear if inventories would be expensed. The blueprint does not clarify the treatment of inventories and transition rules for existing assets, interest income, and deductions. Net operating losses will be carried forward indefinitely with interest. Value-added taxes apply only to physical assets, not financial assets. The blueprint also mentions disallowing net interest deductions for financial transactions, posing challenges in treating financial firms like banks under a standard value-added tax. The blueprint for a new cash-flow tax would be imposed on a destination basis, taxing imports, allowing deductions for export income, and excluding foreign-source income from tax. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady suggested a possible five-year phase-in of the border adjustment and special considerations for industries like financial services, shipping, communication, digital services, and insurance. Interest deductions are also being considered. The House Ways and Means Committee is considering a new cash-flow tax system that would tax imports, allow deductions for export income, and exclude foreign-source income from tax. The proposal includes a five-year phase-in of the border adjustment and special considerations for industries like financial services, shipping, communication, digital services, and insurance. Additionally, interest deductions for small businesses are being discussed. The plan would tax accumulated foreign earnings over an eight-year period at varying rates. The blueprint for tax reform includes the repeal of the estate tax and generation-skipping tax. It may also repeal the gift tax to encourage inter vivos giving. Efficiency gains from tax reform aim to improve resource allocation, distinct from economic growth. Efficiency gains from tax reform aim to improve resource allocation, distinct from economic growth. Economic growth arises from increases in labor and capital, while efficiency is about maximizing well-being. Labor supply is influenced by income and substitution effects, where a cut in tax rates can impact work effort and consumption choices. The efficiency gain is the increased income minus the loss in the value of leisure or unpaid work. Labor supply affects economic growth but may not necessarily add to efficiency or well-being. The substitution effect and marginal rate impact efficiency gains by reducing distortion between consumption of goods and leisure. A higher rate of return can increase present and future consumption but may also lead to a reduction in savings. The timing of tax payments can affect savings, with consumption taxes shifting payments to the future prompting individuals to save more. The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated the effective marginal tax rates on wages, salaries, and self-employment income for current law and under the blueprint. The average marginal income tax rate fell from 24.7% to 22.9%, with a 1.9 percentage point decrease. The tax's structural elements driving these effects are roughly revenue neutral, suggesting no income effect. The net of tax wage increased by 2.4%. The Joint Committee on Taxation's labor substitution elasticity suggests an increase in labor input by 0.24% to 0.48%, affecting GDP by 0.16% to 0.32% in the short run and closer to 0.24% to 0.48% in the long run. The effects are overstated due to not considering the base broadening effect on marginal effective tax rates, impacting deductions like mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state/local taxes. The importance of deductions like mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state/local taxes is highlighted. Data shows that changes in deductions could lead to an increase in overall marginal tax rates for different income classes. The impact on labor income versus capital income benefits is still unclear. The mortgage interest deduction may not have an immediate impact due to existing mortgages but could affect long-term growth. Reducing marginal income tax rates is unlikely to significantly impact labor supply, growth, or efficiency. Base broadening and rate changes can influence consumption allocation. The reduction in itemizers and lower top tax rate would decrease the tax system's subsidies for deductions favoring certain types of consumption like state and local goods, owner-occupied housing, and charitable contributions. There is debate over the justification for subsidizing these items, with some economists criticizing deductions that encourage excessive investment in housing. Arguments in favor include promoting stable communities and providing a retirement asset for the middle class. Arguments in favor of state and local tax deductions and charitable contributions largely benefit moderate income taxpayers, not the wealthy. Some argue that tax subsidies for charities primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers, and direct government spending may be more effective in delivering funds to charity. The proposal aims to repeal certain itemized deductions like medical expenses, casualty losses, and employee expenses, as they are seen as reflecting an ability to pay rather than an incentive. Charitable contributions will also be affected by the repeal of the estate and gift tax. The proposal may lead to efficiency gains in capital allocation, but its impact on growth depends on offsetting forces like the rate of return and public borrowing. The current income tax system shows significant variations in effective tax rates due to cost recovery speed. The table shows estimates of effective tax rates on different types of equity investments under two sets of assumptions regarding shareholder taxability. The primary differences are the allocation of taxable shareholders and slightly higher tax rates in the CBO assumptions. The effective tax rates on different types of equity investments vary depending on the asset, with higher rates for equipment and structures. Shareholder level taxes on capital gains and dividends are added to corporate total rates, but the differences are small due to low rates and limited shares of assets held by taxable shareholders. The corporate sector has a larger share of tax-favored intangibles and equipment, resulting in smaller differences in aggregate tax rates between sectors. Effective tax rates for the blueprint are detailed in Table 2. The blueprint tax plan aims to reduce misallocation of capital by offering favorable treatment for research investments. It also addresses distortions in dividend policy and capital gains realizations. High-income taxpayers currently pay 23.8% in taxes, but lower capital gains and dividend tax rates could offset this effect. The tax plan aims to reduce misallocation of capital by offering favorable treatment for research investments. High-income taxpayers currently pay 23.8% in taxes, which would decrease to 16.5%. Some taxpayers subject to a 15% rate would now pay 12.5%. Debt finance is favored over equity due to lower taxes, narrowing the distortions between corporate and noncorporate sectors. The tax plan aims to reduce misallocation of capital by offering favorable treatment for research investments. Debt finance is favored over equity due to lower taxes, narrowing the distortions between corporate and noncorporate sectors. The CBO estimates show different tax rates on equity, debt, and combined debt and equity, with debt finance having negative tax rates in the corporate sector due to higher interest deduction tax rates. The difference between debt and equity is more pronounced in the corporate sector because of the higher corporate tax rate. Tax-favored debt-financed investment reduces overall effective tax rates and reverses the relative tax burdens across sectors. The tax plan aims to reduce misallocation of capital by offering favorable treatment for research investments. CBO assumes a lower leveraging ratio for the noncorporate sector, increasing the overall tax rate compared to the corporate tax rate. Effective tax rates for equity finance decrease while those for debt rise, resulting in small negative tax rates with CRS assumptions and small positive ones with CBO assumptions. CBO assumptions are better for measuring domestic savings effects, while CRS assumptions may be more suitable for U.S.-investment effects. Under the tax plan, the combined business tax rate would significantly decrease, leading to lower effective tax rates on business investment. The blueprint proposes a substantial reduction in tax rates for both corporate and noncorporate sectors. Additionally, owner-occupied housing should be considered in savings effects calculations. Based on CBO assumptions, owner-occupied housing comprises 41% of total investment with estimated tax rates of -9% for CRS and -1.1% for CBO. Under the blueprint, rates rise to -1.1% and 3%. Overall effective tax rates for business and housing investments are estimated at 4.8% under current law and -2.9% and 5.1% for the blueprint provisions. The Tax Policy Center estimates an overall business tax rate of 22% falling to 6.3%. Different growth effects estimates reflect different sources of growth. The Tax Policy Center's analysis used two models to estimate growth effects from different sources: short-run stimulative effects, supply side effects, and crowding out due to deficits. One model transitions from a demand-side to a neoclassical growth model, estimating a 1% increase in output in the first fiscal year. The tax plan has varying effects over time, with a 0.7% decline in the second year and a 0.2% decline in the third year. Negative effects start in FY2021, reducing output by 0.2%. Overall, the plan reduces output by 0.5% in the first 10 years and 1% in the second 10 years. This is due to crowding out reducing the capital stock more than induced saving increases it. The Tax Foundation's analysis focuses on supply-side effects and excludes short-run demand effects or crowding out. They project a long-term increase in output by 9.1%, mainly attributed to changes in capital income taxes. Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and Koehler estimate an 8% wage growth using the Global Gaidar Model, which they consider optimistic. The Tax Foundation's analysis focuses on supply-side effects, projecting a long-term increase in output by 9.1% due to changes in capital income taxes. The model used is a life-cycle model with multiple worldwide regions, showing positive growth effects in an optimistic scenario and negative effects in a pessimistic scenario. The results are largely influenced by an increase flow of capital from abroad, with deficits being financed through borrowing in the optimistic case and through crowding out of investment in the pessimistic case. The steady state effects of growth arising from supply side effects can vary widely based on elasticities such as savings, labor supply, and factor substitution. Elasticities represent percentage changes in quantity divided by percentage changes in price. For example, the savings response is the percentage change in the savings rate divided by the percentage change in after-tax rate of return. Labor substitution elasticity reflects the percentage change in labor supply divided by the percentage change in after-tax wage at the margin. The labor income elasticity, factor substitution elasticity, and closed model analysis of tax effects are discussed. Uncertainties in supply side effects are illustrated through estimated tax rate differentials in Table 5 and Table 6. The model used is similar to the one by the Tax Foundation, with open economy issues to be discussed later. The analysis discusses tax rate effects and the importance of measuring tax changes and elasticities. Including marginal tax rates on wages would increase output. The Tax Foundation estimates show a 0.7% increase in output with a labor supply elasticity of 0.3. The Tax Foundation model's large output effect is challenging to explain. The Tax Foundation's model shows a significant output effect that is hard to explain. The model predicts a 2.8% growth rate with certain elasticities, but a model without economic depreciation would have a larger effect of 4.4%. This could be due to a different mix of capital stock and focusing on assets with reduced tax rates. The AKK model predicts a significant output effect due to reduced tax rates on capital assets, estimating a fall from 34.6% to 16.1%. The tax rate changes have a 3.1 times greater effect on capital income compared to CRS assumptions and 2.4 times greater compared to CBO assumptions. The output effect is estimated to be around 6% with infinite savings elasticity and other generous assumptions, 36% higher than the rate reported by the TPC. The AKK model predicts a significant output effect due to reduced tax rates on capital assets, estimating a fall from 34.6% to 16.1%. The tax rate changes have a 3.1 times greater effect on capital income compared to CRS assumptions and 2.4 times greater compared to CBO assumptions. The output effect is estimated to be around 6% with infinite savings elasticity, 36% higher than the rate reported by the TPC. The discussion highlights the importance of assumptions in models, including behavioral responses estimates, crowding out treatment, and proper measurement of tax rate changes on output. Empirical evidence suggests labor substitution elasticity from close to zero to 0.3, income elasticity of 0 to -0.1, and a net savings and labor supply effects estimate. The JCT and CBO models differ in their elasticities assumptions, with JCT using a substitution elasticity of 0.2 and an income elasticity of -0.1, while CBO uses a substitution elasticity of 0.24 and an income elasticity of -0.05. Empirical evidence suggests savings elasticities around zero. JCT's modified model with a life cycle element produces effects similar to a 0.29 elasticity. Growth effects range from 0.7% to 1.0% under JCT assumptions and tax rates, and higher if CBO assumptions on elasticities are used. The tax change could lead to a 0.6% to 0.8% growth effect if CBO assumptions on elasticities were used. This may result in significant output decreases if crowding out is considered. The tax change also has important effects on international tax issues, with a true destination-based tax not discouraging imports or favoring exports as claimed. The import tax makes imports less attractive initially, while the export subsidy makes exports more appealing to foreigners. These shifts in demand lead to changes in the demand and supply of dollars, causing the dollar to appreciate by 25% with a 20% tax rate. The dollar appreciates by 25% with a 20% tax rate, offsetting the effects of the tax. U.S. consumers see no change in prices of imported goods, foreign exporters receive the same price, and foreigners buy and sell at the same prices in their own currency. Some objections have been raised, such as the non-refundable export subsidy for firms in loss positions. Adding border adjustments can increase a firm's share of assets from around 20% to typically 40%. Firms with losses may not benefit from export subsidies, leading the border tax adjustment to act partially as a tariff, discouraging imports. Ways to address this issue include merging with an importer or shifting supplies from domestic to foreign producers. These approaches may create market inefficiencies, and a more efficient solution could be allowing refundability or crediting the subsidy against other taxes. International considerations include attracting more capital from abroad. Increasing savings elasticity to attract more capital from abroad, evidence suggests portfolio substitution elasticity is around 3. US portfolio elasticity larger than supply elasticity, with estimates ranging from 0.8% to 2.5%. Inflow of foreign investment may be less due to debt mobility. The new tax system encourages more equity investment over debt-financed investment, potentially impacting the U.S. capital stock. The AKK study suggests that international capital flows play a significant role, with a focus on perfect substitution of equity capital. However, the model may not account for imperfect substitutability of equity and debt, leading to potentially exaggerated results. Additionally, the model overlooks the presence of non-corporate capital in the economy, such as pass-through businesses and owner-occupied housing. The destination basis of the tax will eliminate distortions in international relationships, discouraging repatriation of income earned abroad and reducing incentives for firms to invert. It would also reduce artificial profit shifting and eliminate the need for tax-induced mergers. The blueprint for the border tax adjustment introduces inefficiencies if the export subsidy is not refundable. Tax-motivated changes by firms in a loss position may distort trade. The territorial tax, lower rate, and disallowance of interest deductions will reduce incentives for inversions and profit shifting.

The territorial tax, lower rate, and disallowance of interest deductions will reduce incentives for inversions and profit shifting. Distributional consequences arise in considering the blueprint, including issues of vertical equity, horizontal equity, intergenerational distribution, and international distribution. The TPC provides distributional analysis for 2017, indicating a 2.5% overall increase in after-tax income. The overall increase in after-tax income is projected to be 2.5%. The effects vary across income classes depending on assumptions about border tax adjustment and exchange rates. Without exchange rate adjustment, income increases range from 0.4% to 4.6% for different income groups, with the top 1% and 0.1% seeing the highest increases. With exchange rate adjustment, income increases range from 1% to 10.8% for different groups. Without border tax adjustment, income increases range from 1.2% to 17.4% for different income groups. The Tax Foundation presents distributional analyses showing income increases for different income groups, with the top 1% and 0.1% seeing the highest increases. The overall increase in income is significantly larger in the TPC analysis compared to the Tax Foundation estimates. One key difference is that the TPC analysis includes the repeal of taxes in the Affordable Care Act, which accounts for a growing share of the total cost over time. Both analyses show a pattern of favoring higher-income individuals. The Tax Foundation's distributional analysis shows a pattern of favoring higher-income individuals due to reductions in business and corporate taxes. Growth effects are incorporated with larger benefits, but there are concerns about the projected increases. Increased savings and work effort come at a cost, with benefits capturing what is lost and gained. Capital deepening may benefit lower-income workers, while capital decline would have the opposite effect. The AKK study provides a distributional analysis focusing on lifetime spending and net wealth for the 40-49 age cohort under the plan. It shows that shares remain essentially the same even after growth effects are considered. Horizontal equity is discussed in terms of tax treatment for taxpayers with the same ability to pay but different family compositions. Taxpayers vary in the number of children and marital status, affecting tax rates. A recent report compares current law treatment with proposed changes in the tax system. Differences in ability to pay, such as medical expenses, are also considered. The comparison focuses on effective tax rates across family types, analyzing structural elements like exemptions, credits, deductions, and alternative minimum tax. Capital and labor income differentials are not included in the comparison, as most taxpayers have minimal capital income. The comparison of effective income tax rates for lower- and middle-income families under current law and proposed changes in the tax system is done by assigning an income required to match a reference income through an equivalency index. The blueprint does not impact the lowest income levels. The blueprint maintains favoritism for families with children at lower income levels, but this diminishes at higher income levels. Effective tax rates on higher incomes show more even taxation across family sizes under current law, with families with children taxed more heavily at higher income levels. The blueprint maintains favoritism for families with children at lower income levels, but this diminishes at higher income levels. The tax burden on families with children is higher due to allowances being phased out or not large enough relative to income. Couples living together face horizontal equity issues, with potential marriage penalties or bonuses based on income splits and family circumstances. The tax system can result in penalties or bonuses based on income levels, particularly in the earned income credit. Marriage penalties are avoided in middle incomes due to double rate brackets, deductions, and exemptions. Uneven income division can lead to marriage bonuses or penalties. Tax rates vary with children involved, and unmarried primary earners without custody may face higher taxes. These patterns are reflected in the blueprint, with similar structural elements to current law. The current tax law includes changes such as the loss of itemized deductions, the new child and dependent credit replacing the personal exemption, and limits on deductions offsetting rate changes. Certain deductions like medical expenses and casualty losses are more beneficial for lower and moderate income individuals. These deductions help measure ability to pay accurately. The current tax law includes changes like the loss of itemized deductions, new child and dependent credit, and limits on deductions offsetting rate changes. Some deductions, such as medical expenses and casualty losses, are more beneficial for lower and moderate income individuals. Economists recognize that different taxes fall on wages, asset values, and investment income. There is an inter-generational distributional aspect to the cash-flow tax. The cash-flow tax has an inter-generational distributional aspect as it falls on the generation alive at the time. Returns to investment are generally not taxed, except for economic rents. The burden for debt-financed investment depends on general price rise, which may require an expansion of the money supply. Retail sales tax or value-added tax may lead to a desirable price rise for consumption goods, reducing purchasing power equivalent to a fall in asset value. If a price increase is not accommodated, debt retains its value, leading to a larger fall in equity-owned assets. Stock market values would decrease more than their effective fall when prices change, with equity owners bearing the full burden of the asset tax. The expectation is that stock market prices would fall to match the higher return on new investments, making existing shares less attractive. This fall in asset prices affects individuals beyond the wealthy. A fall in asset prices affects individuals beyond the wealthy, with about half of U.S. stocks held by nontaxable shareholders. The value of assets would not be recouped as in normal market fluctuations, leading to a permanent decrease. Younger generations would increasingly own stock at a discount, lessening the tax burden over time. The new tax proposal applies cash-flow effects to all purchases, with the estimated fall in the stock market being relatively straightforward. The current income tax already incorporates aspects of a cash-flow tax through accelerated depreciation and expensing of intangibles, resulting in discounted prices. However, the new cash-flow tax system excludes land purchases from expensing, and it is unclear if inventories would be excluded. The estimated 12% discount in the current stock market is attributed to consumption tax elements of the current income tax, with half of the effect due to expensing of intangible investments. The estimated effects of the proposed cash-flow tax range from 5.9% to 17.3%, depending on various factors such as debt share and treatment of inventories. The tax is destination-based and may impact estimates differently. The proposed cash-flow tax could have uncertain effects on estimates, especially for intangible assets like human capital investment. Transition rules for existing assets are unclear, but increasing the tax rate above 20% could increase the discount. Excluding land and inventories reduces the discount, while debt increases it by 1.125% for each percentage point, potentially raising it to 25%. Increasing the tax rate above 20% could raise the discount, with debt increasing it by 1.125% for each percentage point. Border tax adjustments could lead to dollar appreciation, affecting holders of foreign assets and debt denominated in U.S. dollars. U.S. holders of foreign assets could lose up to $4.9 trillion, while foreign holders of U.S. assets could gain up to $8.1 trillion. Raising the tax rate above 20% could lead to significant dollar appreciation, impacting holders of foreign assets and debt denominated in U.S. dollars. Increasing the rate to 25% could result in a 33% dollar appreciation, while a 30% rate could lead to a 43% appreciation. Maintaining the current 35% rate would cause a 54% appreciation. The border adjustment could expand the tax base, projected to generate over a trillion dollars in revenue over the next decade, with no clear burden on any specific group due to offsetting effects on U.S. consumers and producers by exchange rates. The border adjustment could expand the tax base, projected to generate over a trillion dollars in revenue over the next decade. The additional tax revenues act as loans from the rest of the world, as trade deficits cannot be sustained indefinitely. Trade surpluses will occur in future years, leading to significant revenue losses due to the border adjustment. Studies by TPC, Tax Foundation, and AKK estimated the blueprint's revenue effects, with differences in inclusion of certain taxes and effects of the estate tax. The elimination of the border adjustment is estimated to add $1.2 trillion to the ten-year cost. The TPC estimates a revenue loss of $3,100.9 billion for the first 10 years and $2,225.6 billion for the second 10 years. Excluding Affordable Care Act taxes, the cost is $2,297.6 billion in the first 10 years and $795.6 billion in the second 10 years. Individual income tax costs are $1,219.0 billion in the first 10 years and $303.9 billion in the second 10 years. Structural elements are close to revenue neutral, losing $95.9 billion in the first 10 years but gaining $202.4 billion in the second 10 years. The changes from current law in the previous section on distribution and horizontal equity mainly involve losses on the individual side due to the treatment of business and investment income. The maximum tax rate on business income and expensing, along with the disallowance of net interest deductions, result in significant revenue losses initially and smaller amounts over time. Additionally, the more generous treatment of capital gains, dividends, and interest leads to substantial losses. Other tax expenditures assumed at a gain are also included. The Tax Foundation estimated a revenue loss of $2,418 billion in the first 10 years, with $981 billion from the individual income tax, $1,197 billion in corporate revenue losses, and $240 billion from the estate and gift tax repeal. The border adjustment provides a significant offset to losses, gaining $1,179.6 billion in the first 10 years and $1,689.3 billion in the second 10 years. The Tax Foundation estimated a revenue loss of $2,418 billion in the first 10 years, with $981 billion from individual income tax, $1,197 billion from corporate income taxes, and $240 billion from estate and gift taxes. AKK estimate a loss of $212 billion annually without specifying a time period, excluding the Affordable Care Act taxes, transition effects, and estate tax repeal. The model does not include other forms of capital like unincorporated businesses and owner-occupied housing. The Tax Foundation estimated a revenue loss of $2,418 billion in the first 10 years, with $981 billion from individual income tax, $1,197 billion from corporate income taxes, and $240 billion from estate and gift taxes. AKK find a revenue gain of $38 million annually and stress that these estimates represent an upper bound on wage growth. The TPC's estimate does not include the larger costs of interest payments on the debt. The Tax Foundation's estimate reflects significant supply side and tax rate effects, posing a challenge for tax reform proposals due to the unsustainable nature of the debt. Revenue losses would be more serious in the short run without the border tax adjustment. The blueprint could simplify tax administration and compliance, particularly by reducing the share of taxpayers who itemize. Repealing estate and gift taxes would eliminate tax planning surrounding those taxes. The cash-flow treatment simplifies business accounting by eliminating the need to depreciate assets and reduces the need for international tax planning to shift profits. U.S. firms would no longer move headquarters for tax reasons or engage in inefficient mergers. Profit shifting would be reduced by lower tax rates and disallowance of interest deductions, but increased through transfers of intangibles under a territorial tax system. The blueprint introduces simplification but also new administrative costs and complexities. Issues related to border adjustment would no longer be a concern without that adjustment. The incentive to characterize labor income as capital income will be increased due to the lower tax rate granted to business income in the new 33% bracket. The payroll tax applies to all labor income, including high-income individuals above the Social Security tax threshold. Sole proprietors and general partners must allocate income between capital and labor to apply lower capital income tax rates. Eliminating the 25% cap on tax rates could exacerbate entity choice distortion. Exporters facing deductions for export sales and costs leading to permanent loss positions may need to undertake costly mechanisms like merging with importing firms or shifting to imports. Refunding taxes or combining a standard value-added tax with income tax subsidies could help alleviate the burden. Import tax can be imposed by disallowing import cost deductions. Taxing direct business-to-customer sales is complex, especially in the digital economy. Two approaches exist: requiring customers to pay the tax or remote sellers to withhold it. The latter is recommended by the OECD but faces challenges in compelling sellers out of their jurisdiction to collect taxes. The OECD recommends taxing remote sellers to prevent tax avoidance by large-scale firms with reputational value in being tax compliant. U.S. producers may avoid taxes by selling to affiliates abroad who then resell back into the U.S., especially with intangible goods like software and e-books. Regulating interest rates for sales and substituting deductible costs are suggested to prevent abuse. The tax system may lead to tax planning issues, especially with intangible goods like technology. For example, a U.S. parent company could invest in research to develop technology, sell it to a low-tax country, and then distribute the rights back to avoid taxes. The tax system presents challenges with intangible goods like technology, where a U.S. parent company could avoid taxes by selling technology to a low-tax country and receiving royalties back. This raises concerns about the lack of clear principles for treating intangibles under destination principle tax, potentially excluding income from intellectual property. The blueprint's border adjustments may face legal challenges as illegal tariffs and export subsidies by the WTO. The border adjustments in the tax system may face legal challenges regarding the taxation of imports and exclusion of exports. There are concerns about the lack of refundability of export subsidies and potential violations of income tax treaties by imposing import taxes on sellers without a permanent establishment in the United States. These issues raise questions about compliance with WTO regulations and tax treaties. If the tax violates WTO rules, significant changes to tax law may be necessary, including switching to a different basis of taxation or facing penalties like countervailing duties. This change would impact state and local income tax systems, especially for businesses transitioning to expensing. Enforcement would become more challenging, particularly for individual income taxes. The reduction in itemizers could impact state revenues as non-itemizers may now opt for the state standard deduction. States would need to adjust their conformity with federal itemized deductions, affecting businesses' simplification from cash-flow taxes for state income tax purposes. Concerns arise for large publicly traded firms regarding the effects on profits from the destination-based cash-flow tax. The destination-based cash-flow tax raises questions about whether it will be treated as an income tax or a consumption tax. Arguments have been made that expensing may not incentivize investment and growth if treated as an income tax. Most economists disagree, as it implies firms are not maximizing profits. The blueprint includes financial income, like net interest income, in the tax base. The tax base for deductions includes financial transactions like interest, capital gains, and royalties. Questions remain about whether border adjustments should apply in this case. Estimating long-run growth effects involves a production function and maximizing profits subject to payments for capital and labor. Labor supply is influenced by after-tax wages and tax rates on wage income. The equation for R is based on the steady state equilibrium where savings equals investment, with the savings rate being a constant elastic function of the rate of return. To solve the model, substitute values from equations to derive the relationship between R and W, and express the capital-labor ratio as a function of relative prices. The analysis involves equations with five unknowns to determine the percentage change in output based on tax rate changes. The model considers the tax rates on capital and labor income to calculate the percentage change in output. The formula used for stock market effects does not include debt and interest payments. The calculations determine the real after-tax return using a weighted average of debt and equity costs.

Calculations determine the real after-tax return using a weighted average of debt and equity costs. The value of stock per dollar of existing capital stock is calculated based on annual profits net of reinvestment, statutory tax rate, depreciation rate, growth rate, and value of depreciation discounted at the nominal growth rate. Profit growth, inflation rate, and real growth rate are considered in determining the value of an indefinite stream of profits net of investment. The standard user cost of capital is used to relate gross profit to the after-tax discount rate. The standard user cost of capital is calculated for different types of assets using equations with five unknowns. The value of V is determined based on economic depreciation and tax rates, with calculations done for each asset type. The values of p, g, and u are set at specific levels for the analysis. The user cost of capital is calculated for different assets with specific values assigned to p, g, u, and R."
