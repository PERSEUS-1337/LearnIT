The Congress finds that in 2005, crude oil, gas, and natural gas prices reached record highs, leading to significant profits for oil and gas companies. Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, Conoco Phillips, and BP reported substantial profit increases in the third quarter of 2005. In 2005, top oil companies like Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, Conoco Phillips, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell saw significant profit increases. The top five oil companies collectively earned $81 billion in profits over the first three quarters. Senior executives at these companies also saw a substantial increase in compensation, with an average of $16.5 million in direct compensation in 2004, double the previous year. CEO's of these companies denied any wrongdoing in a joint Senate hearing in November 2005. The top five oil companies reported lower effective tax rates compared to other industries, with projections of high oil prices leading to continued profits. The Federal budget deficit for the year was $319 billion. The Federal budget deficit for the year was $319 billion, the third largest in history, with the national debt exceeding $8 trillion. Despite record oil and gas prices and profits, there is no justification for special tax breaks for energy companies. Home heating costs are expected to rise significantly, putting financial strain on many families. Households heating with natural gas could see fuel costs increase by up to 50 percent this winter. Those using heating oil can expect a 21 percent increase. Families using heating oil will pay nearly three times the amount compared to 2001-2002.

REQUIREMENT TO SUSPEND ROYALTY RELIEF. The President must suspend relief from royalty payments for oil and gas production on Federal lands when the average prices exceed certain thresholds. The President determines average prices for royalty relief based on recent data from the Energy Information Administration. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can use increased revenues from the enactment of the Act, up to $2 billion each for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, for low-income home energy assistance based on Department of Energy estimates on energy prices. SEC. 7. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR ENERGY COST ASSISTANCE OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a new section for a credit to assist farmers and ranchers with energy costs. A new section of the Internal Revenue Code allows eligible taxpayers engaged in farming businesses to claim a credit for qualified energy costs incurred during the taxable year. The credit is equal to the lesser of 20% of the costs or $1,500. Qualified energy costs include fuel, energy utilities, natural gas, propane gas, LP gas, fertilizer, and heating oil. The provision does not apply to costs incurred after December 31, 2005. The Internal Revenue Code has been amended to disallow double benefits for energy assistance for farmers and ranchers. Refundability provisions have also been updated, and clerical amendments have been made to the code. The Small Business Act has been amended to include a new Energy Emergency Grant Program under section 37. The amendments made by this section will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2004. The Administrator will establish an Energy Emergency Grant Program to assist small businesses affected by price increases in heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, or kerosene. Grants cannot exceed $1,500, but exceptions may be made for businesses that are major employers in their area. The Energy Emergency Grant Program will provide assistance to small businesses impacted by price increases in heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, propane, or kerosene. The price index must increase by at least 30 percent for heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, or propane, and any significant increase for kerosene will be determined by the Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy. The current price index is based on the moving average of the closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for the 10 most recent trading days for contracts to purchase these fuels during the subsequent calendar month. The term 'base price index' is defined as the moving average of the closing unit price on the New York Mercantile Exchange for heating oil, natural gas, gasoline, transportation fuel, or propane for the 10 days in the most recent 2 preceding years. Section 36 of the Small Business Act, added by this Act, will apply to economic injury suffered on or after the enactment date."
