    "content": "Iran, with nearly 80 million people, was ruled by the late Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, until his ouster in February 1979. The Shah's father, Reza Shah Pahlavi, took power in 1921 after a coup against the Qajar Dynasty. The Qajar dynasty had been in decline due to perceived manipulation by Britain and Russia, leading to the constitutionalist movement in 1906. Iran's history includes various Persian empires and dynasties, with the Qajar dynasty leading to the formation of Iran's first parliament and constitution in 1906. The country lost territories over time, adopted Shiite Islam under the Safavid Dynasty, and the Shah's anti-Communist stance made the US see Iran as a bulwark against Soviet influence. Israel had a representative office in Iran during the Shah's rule. During the Shah's rule in Iran, nationalist Prime Minister Mossadeq was overthrown in a CIA-backed coup in 1953. The Shah's attempts to modernize Iran and align with the West led to opposition from Shiite clergy and repression of dissent through the SAVAK intelligence service. The Shah of Iran exiled Ayatollah Khomeini in 1964 due to his opposition to the Shah's policies and alleged surrender of Iran's sovereignty to the US. Khomeini fled to Iraq and later to France, where he continued to advocate for an Islamic revolution in Iran. His return in 1979 led to the collapse of the Shah's government and the establishment of an Islamic Republic with Khomeini as the Supreme Leader. The constitution of Iran adopted in 1979 enshrined velayat-e-faqih, establishing the Supreme Leader position. The regime opposed Western influence and relations with the US turned hostile after the 1979 embassy seizure. Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989 and was succeeded by Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i. The regime faced unrest, including a bombing in 1981 that killed senior leaders. The Iranian regime faced unrest in 1981 when a bombing killed several senior leaders, leading to the purging of secular, liberal, and left-wing personalities. This period also saw the regime under economic and military threat during the Iran-Iraq War. The acrimony in U.S.-Iran relations since the Islamic revolution is attributed to the structure of Iran's regime. Iran's constitution reserves decision-making authority for the Supreme Leader, with directly elected President and Majles. Factional disputes exist within unelected institutions, leading to periodic unrest from various groups. U.S. officials have accused Iran's regime of widespread issues. U.S. officials have accused Iran's regime of widespread corruption, likening it to a mafia organization. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo highlighted allegations of leaders enriching themselves at the expense of the public good. The State Department's report noted that corruption and mismanagement at the highest levels have led to environmental degradation in Iran. The power structure in Iran is dominated by unelected or indirectly elected individuals, with the Supreme Leader at the top. The Supreme Leader of Iran, chosen by the Assembly of Experts, holds significant power including being commander-in-chief of the armed forces and appointing key officials. Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i succeeded Ayatollah Khomeini in this role. The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, holds significant power and can remove an elected president. He appoints key officials and there is no announced successor to him. He reportedly favors Hojjat ol-Eslam Ibrahim Raisi as his successor. Raisi, a hardliner involved in repression, is a potential successor to the Supreme Leader of Iran. Other contenders include Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani and Ayatollah Ahmad Khatemi. Two councils, the Council of Guardians and another, play a significant role in legislation and policy. The Council of Guardians, headed by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, reviews legislation to ensure it complies with Islamic law and vets election candidates based on subjective criteria. The Expediency Council, established in 1988, resolves legislative disagreements and serves as a policy advisory body for the Supreme Leader. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was reappointed as its chairman. Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was reappointed as chairman of the Council in February 2007 until his death in January 2017. The Supreme Leader appointed Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi as chairman of an expanded Council in August 2017. Sadeq Larijani replaced Shahroudi in December 2018. President Hassan Rouhani and Majles Speaker Ali Larijani do not serve as Council members but attend sessions. The Council includes former president Ahmadinejad and operates alongside domestic security organizations under the Supreme Leader's control. The domestic security organs in Iran include the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Law Enforcement Forces, which are responsible for suppressing antigovernment demonstrations and maintaining internal security. The IRGC's role is carried out through the Basij militia, known for enforcing public dress codes and raiding Western-style parties. The Law Enforcement Forces serve as the regime's first line of defense against unrest. The Ministry of Interior in Iran exercises civilian supervision over the police and domestic security forces, while the Ministry of Intelligence and Security conducts surveillance to identify regime opponents. These organizations work closely with the IRGC and Basij, which are generally outside ministry control. Several of these organizations and their leaders are sanctioned by the United States for human rights abuses. International observers question the credibility of Iran's elections due to the role of the COG in vetting candidates. Women can vote and run for most offices in Iran. The Iranian political process faces criticism for the absence of political parties, with strict approval standards set by the Interior Ministry. Only parties loyal to the regime are granted permission to operate, leading to the banning of dissenting parties. Women can vote and run for most offices in Iran, but are prohibited from running for the office of president according to the interpretation of the constitution by the COG. Candidates must receive over 50% of the vote, or a runoff is held. The presidency in Iran is the main directly elected institution, subordinate to the Supreme Leader. Presidential authority, especially in national security, is limited by clerics and the IRGC. However, the president holds significant economic policymaking power, appoints the cabinet, develops budgets, and oversees oversight bodies like the Anticorruption Headquarters. Iran's Majles is a 290-seat unicameral parliament with reserved seats for minority communities. The president and Supreme Leader have had conflicts over power, leading to discussions about eliminating the presidency and restoring the prime ministership. The Majles is Iran's 290-seat unicameral parliament responsible for voting on cabinet nominees, enacting legislation, and approving the national budget. It focuses on domestic issues, defers on defense and foreign policy matters, and ratifies major international agreements. Women participate in elections without a quota system. The Assembly of Experts, an 88-seat institution, selects a new Supreme Leader and oversees governmental work. The Assembly of Experts in Iran selects a new Supreme Leader and can amend the constitution. It meets twice a year and holds elections every 8-10 years. The current chairman is Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati. In Iran, after the presidency of Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, reformist Mohammad Khatemi won elections in 1997 and 2001 but was marginalized by hardliners by 2005. Conservative candidates won in the 2004 Majles elections, leading to Ahmadinejad's victory in 2005 with support from Khamene'i. Disputes among hardliners continued in the 2008 elections. In the 2009 presidential election, reformists aimed to unseat Ahmadinejad. In the June 12, 2009, presidential election in Iran, Mir Hossein Musavi's supporters used social media to organize rallies in Tehran. Ahmadinejad was declared the winner with 63% of the vote, leading to protests by Musavi's supporters who claimed fraud. Large antigovernment demonstrations followed, resulting in over 100 protester deaths. The Green Movement of Hope and Change emerged in Iran after the 2009 presidential election, with protests led by opposition figures like Neda Soltani. Despite initial success, the movement declined after regime suppression in 2010. Ahmadinejad's nationalist policies led to conflict with Supreme Leader Khamene'i, weakening his position after the 2012 elections. Ahmadinejad has since become a regime critic, facing corruption allegations. In the June 14, 2013, presidential elections in Iran, major candidates included hardliners like Qalibaf, Velayati, and Jalilli, as well as moderate Rouhani. Despite the shock of Rafsanjani's denial as a candidate, Rouhani won with 50.7% of the vote, supported by Green Movement followers. In the 2013 presidential elections in Iran, Rouhani won with about 50.7% of the votes. Hardliners gained control of municipal councils in major cities. Rouhani's cabinet included Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, and Defense Minister Hosein Dehgan. Ali Shamkhani, a senior IRGC leader, was appointed to head the Supreme National Security Council. In the 2013 presidential elections in Iran, Rouhani won with about 50.7% of the votes. Hardliners gained control of municipal councils in major cities. Rouhani's cabinet included Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, and Defense Minister Hosein Dehgan, an IRGC stalwart. Justice Minister Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi was reportedly involved in the 1988 mass executions of Iranian prisoners. Iran held concurrent elections for the Majles and the Assembly of Experts in February 2016, with pro-Rouhani candidates winning a significant number of seats. In the latest elections in Iran, a majority of seats were won by reformists and pro-Rouhani candidates, reducing the number of hardliners significantly. Independents hold about 50 seats, and 17 women were elected\u2014the largest number since the revolution. Ali Larijani was reelected as Speaker. In the presidential election, Rouhani won with about 57% of the vote, defeating Hojjat ol-Eslam Ibrahim Raisi, a close ally of Khamene'i. In the municipal elections in Iran, reformists and moderate-conservatives won control of the councils in major cities. The Tehran municipal council saw all 21 seats taken by the alliance. Mohammad Ali Najafi replaced Qalibaf as Tehran mayor but resigned in 2018. Pirouz Hanachi is the current mayor. Rouhani began his second term in August 2017. In August 2017, Rouhani began his second term as President of Iran. His second-term cabinet retained key officials, including Foreign Minister Zarif. Zarif faced threats of impeachment from hardliners after the US withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018. In February 2019, Zarif announced his resignation on Instagram but was not accepted by Rouhani. Key changes in the cabinet included Minister of Justice Seyed Alireza Avayee replacing Pour-Mohammadi and Defense Minister Amir Hatami becoming the first non-IRGC Defense Minister in over 20 years. In December 2017, significant unrest erupted in over 80 cities in Iran, mainly due to economic conditions. Protests evolved to opposition against Iran's leadership and spending on interventions in the Middle East. Some protesters were against Rouhani's budget proposals favoring cleric-run businesses and the IRGC, while cutting subsidies. Rouhani acknowledged the right to protest and some grievances of the demonstrators. Khamene'i initially blamed the unrest on covert actions. Since February 2018, ongoing protests in Iran have included women demonstrating against the strict dress code and facing detainment. Small protests and acts of defiance have continued, with significant unrest in the Tehran bazaar in July 2018 due to shortages and shop closures. Security forces used force against protester violence, while the government temporarily shut down access to social media platforms. Iranian media reported 25 deaths and nearly 4,000 arrests during the period of unrest. Since September 2018, workers in various industries have conducted strikes demanding higher wages to cope with rising prices. Iran established \"anticorruption courts\" to divert blame for economic issues, imposing the death penalty on businessmen. Protests in southwestern Iran in early 2019 were in response to the government's mishandling of flooding effects. Military action has been taken against armed factions outside Iran. The US Administration supported protests in Iran, warned against using force, and imposed sanctions on regime officials responsible for abuses against protestors. Congressional resolutions also backed the protestors, and the State Department reported on Iran's actions. The U.S. Administration supported protests in Iran, imposed sanctions on regime officials, and condemned human rights abuses. Reports from the State Department and U.N. Special Rapporteur highlighted Iran's violations, including capital punishment, harsh prison conditions, and unlawful detention. Secretary of State Pompeo denounced Iranian human rights abuses and expressed support for those silenced. Reforms to Iran's Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes have been noted, but concerns remain about human rights violations. The \"Citizen's Rights Charter\" in Iran aims to protect free expression and raise public awareness of citizen rights, with a focus on eliminating death sentences for children convicted of drug-related offenses. Despite commitments to implement the Charter's 120 articles, key protections for individual rights have not been fully implemented. A U.N. Special Rapporteur on Iran human rights, appointed in 2016, has issued reports highlighting ongoing human rights violations in the country. Asma Jahangir, appointed in 2016, issued two Iran reports before passing away in February 2018. The special rapporteur mandate was extended in March 2018, and Javaid Rehman was appointed in July 2018. The U.N. General Assembly has urged Iran to allow the Special Rapporteur to visit, but Iran has only responded through \"special procedures.\" Despite criticism of its human rights record, Iran acceded to the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in 2010 and sits on the boards of UNDP and UNICEF. Iran's U.N. dues are about $9 million per year, and it has the High Council for Human Rights defending the government's actions. The United States has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials for human rights abuses and internet censorship. U.S.-Iran relations deteriorated after the fall of the Shah in 1979 and the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran has been urged to improve its human rights practices by the U.N., but has only responded through \"special procedures.\" The U.S. Embassy in Tehran was taken over by radical pro-Khomeini students on November 4, 1979, leading to 66 U.S. diplomats being held hostage for 444 days. They were released on January 20, 1981, following the Algiers Accords. The U.S. broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, after a failed rescue attempt. Iran's authoritarian regime and human rights abuses have strained U.S.-Iran relations. Iran maintains an interest section in Washington, DC through the Embassy of Pakistan. The former Iranian Embassy in DC closed in April 1980 when diplomatic relations broke. Iran's Mission to the UN in New York handles most of Iran's diplomacy in the US. The US interests section in Tehran, under the Embassy of Switzerland, has no American personnel. The Reagan Administration labeled Iran a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" in 1984 due to backing for the Beirut bombing. US naval forces clashed with Iranian naval elements during the Iran-Iraq War. U.S. naval forces clashed with Iranian naval elements in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran lost ships in engagements with the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. mistakenly shot down Iran Air Flight 655, leading to a cease-fire in the war. President George H.W. Bush hinted at improved U.S.-Iran relations if Iran helped release U.S. hostages. The release of U.S. hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1991 led to no thaw in U.S.-Iran relations, as Iran continued to support violent groups opposed to Arab-Israeli peace efforts. The Clinton Administration implemented a strategy of \"dual containment\" of Iran and Iraq, imposing trade bans and penalties on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector due to its support for terrorist groups. Mohammad Khatemi's election as president in 1997 prompted a U.S. offer of direct engagement. The election of Mohammad Khatemi as president in 1997 led to a U.S. offer of direct dialogue, but no agreement was reached. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for confidence-building measures in 1998. President Bush included Iran in the \"axis of evil\" in 2002 but sought Iran's help in stabilizing Afghanistan and Iraq. A reported Iranian proposal for a \"grand bargain\" in 2003 was rejected by the U.S. Administration. The Administration worked with European countries to persuade Iran to limit its nuclear program. President Bush and President Obama both expressed support for a \"free and democratic\" Iran. President Obama aimed to rebuild a U.S.-Iran relationship through diplomacy, starting with a message to the Iranian people on Nowruz in 2009. In 2009, President Obama expressed commitment to diplomacy with Iran, rejecting regime change and acknowledging Iran's right to peaceful nuclear power. He loosened restrictions on U.S. diplomats meeting with Iranian counterparts and exchanged letters with Supreme Leader Khamene'i in support of engagement. Iran's crackdown on the Green Movement and refusal to compromise on its nuclear program posed challenges for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration shifted to a \"two track\" strategy towards Iran, combining stronger economic pressure with offers of negotiations for sanctions relief. Direct talks with Iranian officials in Oman were initiated in early 2013 to explore a comprehensive nuclear accord. President Obama emphasized diplomacy after the election of Rouhani in June 2013. In September 2013, Obama and Rouhani exchanged letters and had the first direct U.S.-Iran presidential contact since Iran's revolution. After the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, bilateral meetings were held covering regional and bilateral issues. Obama hoped the JCPOA would improve U.S.-Iranian relations and benefit U.S. national security. Meetings continued at the margins of nuclear talks. In January 2016, as a result of the JCPOA, $1.7 billion in cash payments were made to Iran, including $400 million for original DOD monies and $1.3 billion for interest. Some criticized the financial settlement as paying \"ransom\" to Iran, while Obama Administration officials saw it as an opportunity to resolve outstanding issues. Iran jailed several dual nationals, continued support to allies, conducted ballistic missile tests, prompting U.S. sanctions. Iranian officials criticized new U.S. visa requirements for European businessmen traveling to Iran. In December 2015, Secretary of State Kerry assured Iran that the U.S. would not interfere with their legitimate business interests. In January 2016, Kerry helped secure the release of 10 U.S. Navy personnel detained by Iran. There was no increase in diplomatic representation or visits by Kerry to Iran. In 2014, Iran appointed Hamid Aboutalebi, linked to the 1979 U.S. embassy seizure, as ambassador to the UN. The United States denied a visa to Iran's ambassador, leading to the appointment of Gholam Ali Khoshroo. In 2015, both countries allowed their interests sections to move to new locations. Khoshroo was later replaced by Majid Takht Ravanchi in 2019. The Trump Administration shifted policy to pressure Iran's economy and renegotiate the JCPOA. The Trump Administration's policy towards Iran aims to address a broad range of concerns, including denying Iran revenue to develop strategic capabilities and intervening in the region. The policy includes creating economic difficulties to potentially spark unrest in Iran and lead to regime collapse. Key elements of the policy involve citing Iran's support for the Houthis in Yemen, issuing warnings to Iran, and conducting a six-month Iran policy review based on the belief that the JCPOA has not effectively curbed Iran's objectionable behavior. President Trump also emphasized the need for change in the Iranian regime during his visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. President Trump emphasized the need to isolate Iran and support a peaceful transition of its government. He stated that the US would only stay in the JCPOA if Congress and allies address nuclear restrictions, curb Iran's ballistic missile program, and counter its regional activities. This decision triggered a 60-day review period. President Trump announced the withdrawal from the JCPOA and reimposition of all U.S. secondary sanctions on May 8, 2018, with full effect as of November 5, 2018. This decision came after Congress did not take legislative action to address the JCPOA's weaknesses, despite a 60-day review period triggered by the denial of certification under INARA. Statements by President Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo have since outlined U.S. policy to counter Iran's regional activities. In his first speech as Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo announced a return to pressuring Iran through sanctions and working with allies against its regional activities, proxies, ballistic missile program, cyberattacks, and human rights abuses. He expressed U.S. solidarity with the Iranian people. Pompeo later addressed Iranian Americans, highlighting human rights abuses, corruption, and efforts to destabilize the region. President Trump responded to threats from Iranian leaders regarding oil exports through the Persian Gulf on Twitter. President Trump's tweet warned Iranian President Rouhani against threatening the United States, hinting at possible military action. Secretary Pompeo established an \"Iran Action Group\" to coordinate Iran-related activities, led by Brian Hook. The group's \"Outlaw Regime\" report highlighted Iran's abnormal state, aligning with President Trump's policy. The Trump administration abrogated the 1955 U.S.-Iran Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular Rights on October 3, 2018. This move did not impact the interests sections in each other's countries. A ministerial meeting in Warsaw, Poland in February 2019 focused on Middle East issues, particularly countering Iran. On April 8, 2019, the US designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, citing past acts of Iran-backed terrorism. On April 22, 2019, the US announced the end of exceptions for countries reducing purchases of Iranian oil. U.S.-Iran tensions escalated in May 2019 following intelligence reports. U.S.-Iran tensions escalated in May 2019 following intelligence reports of potential attacks on U.S. forces. President Trump warned Iran on Twitter but also expressed a desire for talks to ease tensions. The Trump Administration has not ruled out any policy options, including sanctions. The Trump Administration has debated engagement with Iran, setting strict conditions for improved relations. President Trump expressed willingness to meet with Iran's President Rouhani, but Secretary of State Pompeo outlined 12 behavior changes required for normalization. Some demands, such as ending support for Hezbollah, may not be met by Iran. At a July 30, 2018 press conference, President Trump expressed willingness to meet with President Rouhani without conditions, but later decided not to meet during the General Assembly meetings. President Rouhani mentioned previous U.S. requests for negotiations, which Iran rejected. Foreign Minister Zarif hinted at the possibility of U.S.-Iran talks on specific issues in April 2019. In April 2019, Zarif proposed U.S.-Iran talks on exchanging prisoners. In May 2019, Trump expressed interest in direct talks with Iran. Trump supported Japan's mediation efforts, while Pompeo contacted Oman, Qatar, and Switzerland for potential negotiations. The U.S. has engaged in talks with Oman, Qatar, and Switzerland to explore potential negotiations with Iran. Previous administrations have considered military force as an option against Iran's nuclear program, but a ground invasion has not been on the table. The Obama Administration emphasized that all options, including military action, were available to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but a nuclear agreement was seen as a more effective way to set back Iran's nuclear advancements. The Trump Administration, like the Obama Administration before it, has not ruled out military action against Iran. This includes the possibility of using military force if Iran attacks U.S. allies or disrupts oil shipping in the Gulf. The U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA was accompanied by threats of unspecified action if Iran restarts its banned nuclear program. tensions between the two countries have led to increased U.S. military deployments in the Gulf region. Since May 2019, tensions have escalated between the U.S. and Iran, leading to increased military deployments in the Gulf region. While the Administration has threatened to use force against Iran's nuclear program or in response to attacks on U.S. forces, President Trump has expressed a desire to de-escalate tensions. The U.S. has supported Israel's strikes on Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria and conducted operations to intercept Iranian weapons shipments to Yemen. The U.S. has not enacted legislation limiting the President's authority to use military force against Iran, nor has there been authorization for such force. Secretary of State Pompeo deferred to legal experts on the matter during a Senate hearing in April 2019. The U.S. has not authorized military force against Iran. Secretary of State Pompeo mentioned Iran harboring Al Qaeda members. The U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA and reimposition of sanctions have significant implications. The U.S. has debated supporting efforts to overthrow Iran's leadership. President Obama showed some support for Iranian demonstrators in 2009 and 2011. President Obama stated in a 2013 speech that the U.S. does not seek to change Iran's regime. The Trump Administration's policy is to change Iran's behavior, not its regime, but statements by officials suggest support for regime change. President Trump expressed hope for a more just government in Iran, while Secretary of State Tillerson testified in support of a philosophy of regime change for Iran. President Trump and his administration have expressed support for regime change in Iran, stating that they stand in solidarity with the Iranian people who are longing for a peaceful transition of government. Trump has also shown support for protests in Iran and announced the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, delivering a message to the long-suffering people of Iran. President Trump and his administration have expressed solidarity with the Iranian people, supporting their desire for regime change. Secretary of State Pompeo also expressed total support for the Iranian people and highlighted the regime's human rights abuses and corruption. Pompeo's speeches indicated a hope for the Iranian people to overthrow the current regime. The Broadcasting Board of Governors is launching a new full-time Persian-language service for television, radio, digital, and social media to support ordinary Iranians. President Trump ruled out a policy of regime change during escalating U.S.-Iran tensions in May 2019. Some in Congress have advocated for a formal policy of overthrowing the regime. In the 111th Congress, a bill aimed to promote regime change in Iran. Iranian leaders believe the US has never accepted the 1979 Islamic revolution. Various US administrations and Congresses have supported democracy promotion and sanctions on Iran. Legislation like the Iran Freedom Support Act authorized funds for democracy promotion in Iran. Several laws and Executive Orders since 2010 aim to promote change in Iran. The Obama Administration has amended U.S.-Iran trade regulations to allow for the sale of consumer electronics and software to Iranians for communication purposes. Some democracy promotion funding for Iran was used to train Iranians in circumventing internet censorship. However, U.S. funding for such programs has been criticized as counterproductive, leading to accusations of disloyalty against civil society activists. The Obama Administration shifted towards working with Iranians on apolitical issues like health and education. The State Department provides funding for democracy promotion programs in Iran, focusing on apolitical issues like health, education, science, and the environment. The funds are allocated through DRL and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs in partnership with USAID, with some used for cultural exchanges and broadcasting to Iran. Iran views this funding as a violation of the 1981 \"Algiers Accords\" and a form of interference in its internal affairs. The George W. Bush Administration funded Iranian prodemocracy activists to change regime behavior, not overthrow the regime. Radio Farda, established in 2002, broadcasts to Iran with a budget over $11 million. Radio Farda, based in Prague, broadcasts 24 hours a day with a budget of over $11 million per year. Secretary Pompeo announced a new Persian-language channel for Iranians, but it is unclear if it will enhance existing programs. The VOA Persian Service, established in 2003, includes radio, television, and internet broadcasting, costing about $20 million annually. Critics note a decline in audience among young, educated, anti-regime Iranians seeking U.S. support. The State Department aims for outreach to the Iranian population. The State Department has increased outreach efforts to the Iranian population by adding a Persian-language website and Twitter feeds. They have also expanded the presence of Persian-speaking U.S. diplomats in diplomatic missions around Iran to facilitate Iranian participation in U.S. democracy-promotion programs. Additionally, the Iran unit at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai has been enlarged, and \"Iran-watcher\" positions have been added to U.S. diplomatic facilities in various locations. \"Iran-watcher positions have been added to U.S. diplomatic facilities in Baku, Azerbaijan; Istanbul, Turkey; Frankfurt, Germany; London; and Ashkabad, Turkmenistan.\""
