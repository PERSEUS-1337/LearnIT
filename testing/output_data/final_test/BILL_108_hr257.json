Additionally, assistance for livestock producers is also available. The Secretary of Agriculture will use funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide assistance to livestock producers in counties designated as primary disaster areas in 2001 or 2002. Producers can apply for assistance within 30 days of the enactment of the Act, following criteria from the 2002 Livestock Compensation Program.

They cannot receive payments from both this section and the 2002 Livestock Compensation Program.
