    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Board of State and Community Corrections in California is required to collect and maintain information on correctional policies, practices, and needs, including prevention, intervention, and supervision for adult corrections, juvenile justice, and gang issues. They must also make recommendations for improving criminal justice and gang prevention activities statewide. The Board of State and Community Corrections in California is tasked with identifying, promoting, and providing technical assistance for evidence-based programs and practices. They are also responsible for developing definitions of key terms to ensure consistency in data collection and implementation of evidence-based practices, consulting with various stakeholders and experts in the process. The Board of State and Community Corrections in California includes members such as a district attorney, public defender, Secretary of the Department of Corrections, a representative from the Administrative Office of the Courts, a nonpartisan policy institute representative, and a nonprofit agency representative. They receive and disburse federal funds, develop procedures for grant applications, and perform necessary services as required by federal acts. The Board of State and Community Corrections in California works on identifying delinquency and gang intervention grants for consolidation and providing technical assistance in criminal justice and delinquency prevention matters. Develop incentives for local governments to form regional partnerships to pool grant funds for services like job training, target at-risk youth, and maximize state funds impact. Conduct evaluation studies on programs assisted by federal acts. The board evaluates gang and youth violence programs at state, local, and federal levels, making recommendations for better coordination and funding allocation. They aim to ensure that 70% of funding is used for evidence-based programs by 2014 and promote best practices for addressing gang and youth violence. The board collects and analyzes data on local plans for addressing gang and youth violence, providing annual reports to the Governor and Legislature. The board supports the development of data collection instruments to reflect the local impact of Chapter 15 of the Statutes of 2011 for felony offenders and postrelease community supervision. Data collected will be made available on the board's website to promote collaboration and reduce duplication of efforts. The California District Attorneys Association, California State Association of Counties, California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, and Chief Probation Officers of California will collect and analyze data on recidivism rates for individuals sentenced under specific sections of the law or placed on postrelease community supervision since July 1, 2016. The data will include recidivism rates at one, two, and three years post-release, to be published quarterly on the board's website starting September 1, 2017. The term \"recidivism\" will have the same meaning as defined in the legislation. The board may collect, evaluate, publish, and disseminate statistics on criminal justice in the state, as well as perform other functions required by federal acts. Nothing in this chapter includes funds already designated to the Local Revenue Fund 2011."
