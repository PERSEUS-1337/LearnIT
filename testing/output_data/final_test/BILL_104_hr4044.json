The \"Safe and Responsible Handgun Act of 1996\" aims to address the disproportionate use of poor-quality handguns in violent crimes across state lines. It encourages states to restrict the sale of unsafe handguns not suitable for legitimate purposes like sport or self-defense, emphasizing the need for accurate data to formulate effective policies to reduce gun-related violence. SEC. 3. REDUCTION OF BYRNE GRANTS FOR STATES NOT ESTABLISHING HANDGUN ROSTER BOARDS. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish guidelines for each State to create a Handgun Roster Board consisting of 9 members with specific qualifications, including representatives from the police, State prosecutor's office, and firearms owners' rights organizations. The Handgun Roster Board, established by the Secretary of the Treasury, consists of 9 members with specific qualifications, including representatives from police, State prosecutor's office, firearms owners' rights organizations, handgun dealers or manufacturers, organizations advocating for greater handgun control, and members who do not meet the specified requirements. The Board designates a chairman and publishes a roster annually specifying lawful handguns and terms. The Handgun Roster Board, established by the Secretary of the Treasury, annually publishes a roster of lawful handguns and terms for manufacturing, selling, owning, possessing, or using in the State. Factors considered for inclusion on the roster include concealability, ballistic accuracy, portability, quality of materials and manufacture, safety features, caliber, and detectability by standard security equipment. The Handgun Roster Board, established by the Secretary of the Treasury, annually publishes a roster of lawful handguns for use at airports in the United States. The Board may add a handgun type to the roster upon its own initiative or upon petition. States must have laws in place to make the manufacture, sale, ownership, possession, and use of certain handguns illegal if not specified on the roster. The Handgun Roster Board publishes a list of approved handguns for airport use. States must have laws prohibiting the manufacture and sale of handguns not on the roster, with penalties of up to $10,000 for violations. Laws prohibit unlawful sale of handguns, with fines up to $2,500 and additional penalties as per State law. Violations involving multiple handguns are treated separately. Certain lawfully possessed handguns are exempt. Definitions are provided for clarity. The law prohibits unlawful sale of handguns with fines and penalties. States have 3 years to comply with the law, with a possible 2-year extension for good faith efforts. Non-compliant states may be ineligible for funds. Definitions for \"handgun\" and \"licensed dealer\" are provided. States failing to comply with subsection (a) of the law may lose 10 percent of allocated funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Funds not received by non-compliant states will be reallocated to states that do comply. SEC. 4. INDEPENDENT STUDY GROUP. The Secretary of the Treasury, in cooperation with the Attorney General, establishes the Independent Study Group (ISG) to create a national firearms injury reporting system. The ISG includes representatives from various agencies and is tasked with studying the feasibility of collecting data on intentional and unintentional firearms injuries, fatal and nonfatal injuries, and details surrounding the incidents. The Secretary of the Treasury, with the Attorney General, forms the Independent Study Group (ISG) to develop a national firearms injury reporting system. The ISG will study collecting data on intentional and unintentional firearms injuries, including details like firearm types, demographics of those involved, firearm ownership, storage, theft, and involvement of drugs or alcohol. Within a year, a report recommending the establishment of an effective national firearms injury reporting system will be submitted to Congress."
