    "content": "The \"Retirement Security Education Act of 2005\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Improving financial literacy is crucial for Americans of all ages. Low savings and high debt levels are serious issues, especially for those nearing retirement. Only half of working Americans have pension coverage, with a small percentage enrolled in defined benefit plans or 401(k)s. Women, due to longer life expectancies, are more likely to face poverty in old age compared to men, with a significant gender gap in retirement income sources. Research indicates that there are 4 basic sources of retirement income security: social security benefits, pensions and savings, healthcare insurance coverage, and necessary earnings from working during retirement years. About a quarter of baby-boomer households have not adequately prepared for retirement. Over the next 30 years, the number of older individuals in the United States is expected to double to nearly 75,000,000, leading to a rise in long-term care costs. Additionally, the number of individuals over 65 years of age requiring long term care services is projected to double to approximately 12 million in the next 25 years. Fraud against older individuals, such as telemarketing schemes and identity theft, has also increased significantly. SEC. 3. Grant program to enhance financial and retirement literacy, reduce financial abuse and fraud among mid-life and older Americans. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible entities to provide financial education programs for mid-life and older individuals in local communities. The programs aim to enhance knowledge of financial, long-term care, and retirement issues, as well as reduce financial abuse and fraud, including telemarketing, mortgage, and pension fraud. Eligible entities include State agencies, area agencies on aging, and non-profit organizations with a proven record of serving mid-life and older individuals and conducting consumer awareness programs. An eligible entity seeking a grant under this section must submit an application to the Secretary, including a plan for continuing the programs after the grant expires. The recipient of the grant is limited to using 4 percent of the total amount for administrative costs. The Secretary will establish performance measures to evaluate the programs funded by the grant. The Secretary evaluates programs funded by grants under this section based on performance measures to judge effectiveness, identify best practices, and potential replication. Annual reports are submitted to Congress detailing the status of the grant program. The grant program under this section includes descriptions of programs funded with grant funds and the evaluation results of such programs. The National Training and Technical Assistance Program is established under Section 4. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to eligible nonprofit organizations for creating financial education materials and providing training. Entities must have experience in financial education and submit an application to receive a grant. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis. Congress emphasizes the importance of prioritizing financial education assistance for organizations with experience in educating older women. In this Act, key terms defined include \"area agency on aging,\" \"financial education,\" \"mid-life individual,\" \"older individual,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State agency.\" These definitions clarify the scope and applicability of the Act. The term \"State agency\" is defined in section 102 of the Older Americans Act of 1965. Authorization of Appropriations: $100,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Limitations on fund usage: $200,000 for evaluation and report, and 5-10% for training and technical assistance."
