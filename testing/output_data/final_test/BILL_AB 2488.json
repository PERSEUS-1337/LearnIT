    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Foothill Feeder below Castaic Dam in Los Angeles County is crucial for providing water from the State Water Project to the southern California region served by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which supplies water to approximately 19 million people in six counties. Water supplies from the State Water Project are crucial for southern California's water supply, ensuring clean and reliable water for municipal and industrial uses, health and safety, and water agencies relying on deliveries from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. To protect southern California water supplies, periodic dewatering, inspection, maintenance, modification, or repair of the Foothill Feeder may require the incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback into the Santa Clara River and its tributaries. During the permit application process, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must consult with wildlife agencies for mitigation measures for the unarmored threespine stickleback in the Santa Clara River watershed. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California may be authorized to incidentally take unarmored threespine stickleback during maintenance of the Foothill Feeder water supply facility, subject to fulfilling specific conditions set by the department. The take authorization includes developing an adaptive management plan to monitor and minimize impacts on unarmored threespine stickleback. A biologist with experience in evaluating inland fisheries must be present during activities that may affect the species. The Metropolitan Water District consults with the department to avoid incidental take of the stickleback. The take authorization covers incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback during maintenance of the Foothill Feeder in specific locations along the Santa Clara River and its tributaries. The take authorization includes incidental take of unarmored threespine stickleback in Bouquet Creek to the Newhall Ranch Road Bridge, as well as during mitigation or conservation actions required in the permit. The permit issued for the Foothill Feeder Repair project includes conditions related to biological and scientific considerations, such as handling stranded fish, dewatering the feeder, and mimicking streamflows. These conditions must comply with the project description, mitigation measures, and release plan outlined in the environmental impact report. Amendments may be made as needed by the adaptive management plan or subsequent environmental documents under the California Environmental Quality Act. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California must report to the department within six months after dewatering the Foothill Feeder to address compliance with permit conditions and the effectiveness of the adaptive management plan for conservation. \"Modification\" in this context excludes expanding the feeder's water delivery capacity. The department may authorize the taking of fully protected fish for scientific research purposes, including efforts to recover threatened or endangered species, after notifying all affected parties and soliciting comments. No permit or license shall be issued for the take of fully protected fish, except for scientific research purposes. Interested parties must notify the department in writing of their interest in fully protected species and provide relevant information and comments within 30 days of notification being published. Fully protected fish, including Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens River pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin, may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. The Department may authorize the taking of fully protected fish for scientific research purposes after notifying all affected parties and soliciting comments. No permit or license shall be issued for the take of fully protected fish except for necessary scientific research efforts. Affected and interested parties with an interest in fully protected species can provide relevant information and comments on proposed authorization within 30 days of notification being published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Fully protected fish, including Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens River pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin, may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to include these species. (a) Fully protected fish cannot be taken or possessed, except for authorized scientific research purposes. The department must notify affected parties before authorizing the take of a fully protected fish. Affected and interested parties with an interest in fully protected species can provide relevant information and comments on proposed authorizations within 30 days of notification being published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Fully protected fish, including Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin, may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code is amended. Fully protected fish cannot be taken or possessed, except for scientific research purposes authorized by the department after notifying all affected parties. No permits or licenses are issued for taking fully protected fish, except for research on recovering threatened or endangered species. Affected and interested parties have 30 days to provide information and comments on the proposed authorization after notification is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register. Fully protected fish, including Colorado River squawfish, Thicktail chub, Mohave chub, Lost River sucker, Modoc sucker, Shortnose sucker, Humpback sucker, Owens pupfish, Unarmored threespine stickleback, and Rough sculpin, may be possessed under a permit issued by the department. Scientific research excludes actions for project mitigation. The bill incorporates amendments to the Fish and Game Code related to the Rough sculpin. It will only take effect under specific conditions involving the enactment of other bills and the timing of this bill's enactment. Section 3.2 of the bill includes amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, contingent on specific conditions and the enactment of other bills. Section 3.3 of the bill incorporates amendments to Section 5515 of the Fish and Game Code, contingent on the enactment of multiple bills and specific conditions."
