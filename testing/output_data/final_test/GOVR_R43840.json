    "content": "Noncitizens in or outside the United States may be liable for U.S. income taxes based on their residency status as either a resident or nonresident alien under the Internal Revenue Code. The two residency tests include the Green card test for lawful permanent residents and the Substantial presence test for individuals present in the U.S. for a certain period. Exceptions apply, such as closer connections to a foreign country exempting individuals from being categorized as resident aliens. Nonresident aliens are subject to special tax rules, only taxed on U.S. income, and have restrictions on tax benefits. Resident aliens follow U.S. tax laws, including taxation on worldwide income. Immigration status as immigrant or nonimmigrant does not affect tax classification. Noncitizens are classified as resident or nonresident aliens for federal tax purposes, regardless of their immigration status. Immigration status generally does not affect tax liability, but special rules may apply to individuals with green cards or certain visas. Unlawfully present aliens may have different tax considerations. Unlawfully present aliens in the United States are classified as resident or nonresident aliens for federal tax purposes. This classification does not impact their immigration status but determines their tax liability. The preference between resident and nonresident alien status depends on the individual's specific circumstances. Nonresident aliens are not taxed on foreign income but face restrictions on claiming tax benefits. It is a misconception that being a nonresident alien is better due to income exemption from U.S. taxation. However, all aliens are subject to federal income taxes on U.S.-source income. Noncitizens must have a taxpayer identification number to comply with federal tax law. Individuals must have a taxpayer identification number to comply with federal tax law. Taxpayer identification numbers can be Social Security numbers (SSNs) for certain groups of noncitizens or individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) for those not eligible for an SSN. ITINs are issued by the IRS for federal tax purposes only and do not affect immigration status. The IRS issues ITINs for federal tax purposes to individuals who are not eligible for Social Security numbers. ITINs do not have any immigration consequences and do not affect the right to be legally employed in the United States. The IRS began issuing ITINs in 1996, replacing temporary identification numbers assigned to tax returns. The IRS introduced ITINs in 1996 to improve tax compliance for individuals without SSNs, replacing temporary identification numbers. SSA stopped issuing nonwork SSNs for tax filing purposes, leading to the use of ITINs for tax compliance by aliens. The IRS issues ITINs to individuals without SSNs for tax compliance, authorized by IRC Sections 6109 and 7805. Section 6109 mandates the use of an identifying number for tax filings, with the SSN as the default option. Section 7805 grants the Treasury Secretary the authority to enforce IRC regulations. The IRS issues ITINs to individuals without SSNs for tax compliance, authorized by IRC Sections 6109 and 7805. Taxpayer identification numbers allow noncitizens to fulfill federal tax obligations. In 2011, 4,135,379 individual income tax returns were filed using an ITIN. The IRS does not provide detailed breakdowns of this number. A married couple filing jointly with one taxpayer using an ITIN would be counted as an ITIN return. Having an ITIN does not necessarily mean being unlawfully present in the US. ITINs are for those who need a taxpayer ID but are not eligible for an SSN, including noncitizens lawfully present on a temporary basis, individuals with US tax obligations, and unlawfully present aliens. The IRS believes many ITIN filers are unlawfully present aliens working in the US. Some taxpayers using ITINs may be living and working in the country unlawfully, but not all do. They may file taxes using an SSN, a made-up number, or another person's SSN. Some may work for cash and not file taxes at all. Taxpayers using ITINs are generally eligible for tax benefits, but may be ineligible for certain benefits requiring an SSN. Currently, only the earned income tax credit (EITC) requires taxpayers to provide their SSNs, along with their spouses' and qualifying children's. Other tax provisions indirectly limit benefits for individuals using ITINs, such as the child tax credit's requirement for the child to be a U.S. citizen, national, or resident. Nonresident aliens face restrictions on claiming certain tax benefits, affecting ITIN filers who are nonresident aliens. Unlawfully present aliens are subject to the same tax rules as everyone else. Unlawfully present aliens are subject to the same tax rules as everyone else, with limitations on claiming tax benefits based on specific statutes. Examples include ineligibility for health insurance premium assistance credit and the EITC requiring SSNs for eligibility. Certain benefits are also disallowed for nonresident aliens. Unlawfully present aliens are ineligible for certain tax benefits like the EITC and ACTC if they are nonresident aliens. The EITC requires SSNs for eligibility, limiting the ability of individuals with earnings from unauthorized work to claim the credit. Unlawfully present aliens may claim the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) under the IRC, despite not being authorized to work in the United States. In 2011, TIGTA reported that unauthorized individuals claimed $4.2 billion in ACTC, increasing from $924 million in 2005 and $2.1 billion in 2008. The IRS lacks estimates on federal income taxes paid by unlawfully present aliens or the tax benefits they receive. President Obama announced an immigration initiative in 2014 to expand relief for certain aliens, including DACA recipients and parents of US citizens. This initiative may affect the eligibility of unlawfully present aliens for tax benefits such as the EITC and ACA premium. Aliens covered by the President's 2014 immigration initiative may be eligible for the EITC and ACA premium assistance credit based on their work authorization and lawful presence. There is uncertainty regarding the eligibility of certain DACA beneficiaries for the ACA credit. The Obama Administration may take action to exclude some 2014 deferred action beneficiaries from the credit. Noncitizens who own businesses may also be affected by these changes. Noncitizens who own businesses in the United States are not exempt from federal income taxes, despite rumors suggesting otherwise. Resident aliens are taxed similarly to U.S. citizens, while nonresident aliens have different tax rules but are still subject to taxation on income earned in the U.S. Noncitizens, including aliens, are subject to U.S. taxation on income earned while working or doing business in the country. There are limited exceptions, but none would allow someone to avoid paying taxes as suggested in the rumor. Setting up a foreign corporation in a noncitizen's home country to operate tax-free in the U.S. is not possible, as foreign corporations are taxed on income from U.S. business activities."
