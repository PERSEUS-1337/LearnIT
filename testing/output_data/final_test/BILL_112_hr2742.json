    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hire, Train, Retain Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to the act. The Congress finds that 9.2 percent of Americans were unemployed in June 2011, with 14.1 million people out of work. Many workers displaced during the recession need re-training to re-enter the workforce. Additionally, there are 982,000 discouraged workers who feel unqualified for available jobs, despite there being 3.0 million job openings in May 2011. The job market is facing a disconnect as many job seekers lack the necessary skills for available vacancies, especially in technology-related fields. The distinction between white collar and blue collar jobs is becoming blurred due to the increasing specialization in traditionally blue collar roles. SEC. 3. Payroll tax forgiveness for hiring and training workers. Section 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to provide a special exemption for certain individuals hired between 2011 and 2015.

The effective dates for these amendments vary, with wages paid after the enactment of the Act affected generally, and railroad retirement taxes applying to compensation paid after the same date. SEC. 4. Business credit for retention of certain newly hired individuals in 2011. The Business Credit for retention of certain newly hired individuals in 2011 increases the current year business credit for each retained worker by $1,000 or 6.2% of wages paid during a 52-week period.
