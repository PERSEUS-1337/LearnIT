    "content": "The Act titled \"Alternative Certification and Licensure of Teachers Act of 1998\" is cited as the short title. The purpose of the Act is to provide findings and establish a framework for alternative teacher certification and licensure. Congress finds that the main teacher quality problem in 1998 is the lack of subject matter knowledge, and states should have flexibility to create alternative teacher certification programs to recruit well-educated individuals into classrooms. The purpose of this Act is to improve the supply of well-qualified teachers by encouraging states to develop alternative routes to teacher certification. SEC. 3. ALLOTMENTS. From the amount appropriated for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State the lesser of the amount applied for or a proportion based on the total population of children ages 5 through 17. Excess funds from States not applying may be reallocated to other States. The Secretary may allocate funds to States demonstrating a current need, with funds remaining available for 2 years from the grant date. SEC. 4. STATE APPLICATIONS. State applications for receiving an allotment under this Act must be submitted through the State educational agency, containing program descriptions and assurances to supplement, not supplant, funds for teacher certification programs. State educational agencies must consult with various stakeholders, including local educational agencies, teachers, schools of education, parents, and other interested parties when developing certification or licensure requirements. The State educational agency must submit a final report to the Secretary detailing activities and results achieved with assistance under this Act. GEPA provisions do not apply, except for fiscal control and fund accounting procedures. SEC. 5. USE OF FUNDS. A State educational agency must use funds provided under this Act to support programs that help individuals transition to a teaching career through alternative routes to certification. The agency can implement these programs directly or through contracts or grants to various educational entities. Funds can be used for designing, developing, implementing, and evaluating these programs. The curr_chunk focuses on the design, development, and implementation of programs for professionals entering the education profession through alternative routes to certification. It includes establishing administrative structures, training staff, developing recruitment strategies, and providing support programs like mentorship. The curr_chunk outlines the development of recruitment strategies, reciprocity agreements for teacher certification, and other programs designed to meet the purpose of the Act as determined by the Secretary. The Act defines key terms such as elementary school, local educational agency, secondary school, Secretary, State educational agency, institution of higher education, and State. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 and each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years."
