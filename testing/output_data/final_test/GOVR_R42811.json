    "content": "Congress has a long history of overseeing the executive branch to ensure compliance with legislative intent, improve governmental operations, evaluate program performance, and prevent encroachment on legislative powers. Various oversight techniques have been used, and contemporary developments have enhanced Congress's capacity to check the executive. Legislative oversight involves preventing executive encroachment on legislative powers, investigating poor administration, abuse, and fraud, assessing program objectives, reviewing federal financial priorities, protecting individual rights, and informing the public. This oversight is mainly conducted through congressional processes like budget, authorization, appropriations, confirmation, and investigations, and occasionally through impeachment. The adversarial nature of congressional investigations sets it apart from routine oversight processes. The inquisitorial process of congressional investigations sustains and vindicates Congress's role in the constitutional scheme of separated powers and checks and balances. The history of congressional investigations has established the nature and contours of congressional prerogatives necessary to maintain the integrity of the legislative role. Congress's power of inquiry extends to all aspects of legislative oversight. Congress's power of inquiry extends to all executive departments, agencies, and establishments equally, with congressional probes of the Department of Justice being particularly contentious due to its law enforcement mission. These inquiries often face claims of political interference and refusals to provide internal documents or testimony, citing privileges, exemptions, and the need to protect deliberative processes. An examination of past investigative confrontations with the DOJ can inform future committees on the scope of their investigative prerogatives. Requests for DOJ materials are typically resolved through negotiation, without the need for judicial intervention. There is no court precedent imposing a threshold burden on committees to demonstrate a \"substantial reason to believe wrongdoing occurred\" to obtain information. Committees only need to show that the information is within their authorized jurisdiction, aids a legitimate legislative function, and is pertinent to the area of concern. Congress has historically obtained information on prosecutorial misconduct, but access to material on open criminal investigations is rarely granted. Disputes with the Department of Justice are usually resolved through negotiation without the need for judicial intervention. Typically, disputes over executive privilege in relation to congressional oversight are resolved through negotiations, with compromises such as narrowing requests or delaying information release. Courts have been hesitant to intervene in these disputes, with only four cases addressing executive privilege between Congress and the executive, and two resulting in decisions. The Supreme Court has not ruled on executive privilege in response to congressional information demands. Committees are often restrained by prudential considerations when demanding disclosure of information, weighing legislative needs and statutory duties against potential harms to an agency. Historical records show congressional adherence to these considerations. This report will review the legal basis for investigative oversight. This report briefly reviews the legal basis for investigative oversight and examples of congressional oversight. It assesses the Department's attempts to limit congressional access to information and provides summaries of successful inquiries. Congress has broad authority to obtain information, including classified or confidential material, despite no specific constitutional provision or statute authorizing oversight. The Supreme Court has established that congressional oversight power is essential to the legislative function and is implied from the general vesting of legislative powers in Congress. The power of inquiry is broad and encompasses investigations into existing laws, proposed statutes, and alleged waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's power to investigate waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments. This investigative power is essential for the legislative function but has limitations, as it cannot be used solely for exposure without justification. The Congress has the authority to investigate waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within government departments, but it must be related to a legitimate task of Congress. The investigation must have a legislative purpose or be conducted pursuant to some other constitutional power of Congress. The courts generally presume there is a legislative purpose for an investigation, and a House or Senate rule authorizing the investigation is necessary. The Court upheld the validity of a resolution authorizing an inquiry into corruption charges against Senators, even though it did not specify the outcome of the investigation. The questions were relevant to the inquiry, focusing on whether Senators were speculating in sugar stocks during the consideration of a tariff bill. The Court did not need to determine the Senate's actions based on the findings, but it was clear that negative answers would have cleared the Senate of any wrongdoing. The Senate had the jurisdiction to pursue an inquiry into corruption charges against Senators, even without specifying the outcome. The resolutions indicated that the Senate found the transactions reprehensible and deserving of condemnation. The right to expel extends to cases where the offense is inconsistent with the trust and duty of a Member. The Senate's actions were within its constitutional powers. The Senate had the jurisdiction to investigate corruption charges against Senators without specifying the outcome. The resolutions indicated the Senate's condemnation of the transactions. The Court found the Senate was acting within its right in ordering the investigation for a legitimate object. The Senate had the jurisdiction to investigate corruption charges against Senators without specifying the outcome. The resolutions indicated the Senate's condemnation of the transactions. The Court found the Senate was acting within its right in ordering the investigation for a legitimate object, aiding in legislating. The avowal of contemplated legislation was in accord with the right interpretation of the resolution directing the investigation. The Senate has the jurisdiction to investigate corruption charges without specifying the outcome, as it aids in legislating. The DOJ, like other executive departments, is subject to Congress's oversight authority. The court emphasized that seeking information related to specific legislative problems is within Congress's power. The Supreme Court has upheld Congress's power to investigate various matters, including foreign and domestic subversive activities, labor union corruption, and civil rights violations. However, Congress's authority is not unlimited, as courts have ruled that investigations must have a legislative purpose and not be conducted as a trial. The executive branch has argued against providing information to Congress for various reasons, including avoiding prejudicial pre-trial publicity, protecting innocent third parties, and maintaining the confidentiality of informants. These arguments were famously articulated by Attorney General Robert Jackson in 1941. The DOJ attorneys use prosecutorial discretion to prevent interference with the President's duty to execute laws. Attorney General Jackson and Attorney General Smith argued that withholding internal DOJ documents is necessary to protect law enforcement strategies and pending enforcement actions. This policy aims to safeguard enforcement policy and individual rights. The Attorney General maintains that withholding law enforcement files from congressional investigation is crucial to protect the integrity of law enforcement and prevent congressional interference in investigations. This policy is based on the belief that the President and his subordinates have the responsibility to ensure the faithful execution of laws. The Department of Justice initially withheld internal prosecutorial documents from a committee investigation into FBI informant misuse but eventually disclosed them under congressional pressure. The DOJ expressed concerns about protecting sensitive advice memoranda and deliberative documents related to criminal charges to maintain the integrity of prosecutorial decision-making. This stance was seen as a principled interest in avoiding polarization in the criminal justice process. During the House Oversight investigation of Operation Fast and Furious, the DOJ resisted committee requests for access to internal deliberative communications, citing concerns about inhibiting candor in Executive Branch deliberations and impairing its ability to respond to congressional oversight. This raised separation of powers concerns and potential imbalance in the government branches' relationship. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress' right to investigate government conduct, and agencies cannot deny access to documents. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress' right to investigate government conduct, stating that agencies cannot deny access to documents even if it may expose criminal corruption or maladministration. Congressional committees engaged in legitimate legislative investigations do not need to halt their inquiries, even if the responses may be harmful to a witness in a separate proceeding. The Court rejected the argument that certain questions were outside the committee's power to ask due to pending judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress' right to investigate government conduct, stating that agencies cannot deny access to documents even if it may expose criminal corruption or maladministration. Congressional committees engaged in legitimate legislative investigations do not need to halt their inquiries, even if the responses may be harmful to a witness in a separate proceeding. The Court rejected the argument that certain questions were outside the committee's power to ask due to pending judicial proceedings. The reach of 'due process' could potentially turn a witness' privilege against self-incrimination into a restraint on congressional inquiry, but the pendency of litigation does not prohibit Congress from investigating facts relevant to that litigation. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress' right to investigate government conduct, allowing access to documents even if it may expose corruption. Congressional committees can continue inquiries even if it may harm a witness in a separate proceeding. While there are suggestions to handle prejudicial pre-trial publicity, there are no legal limitations on Congress's investigative rights during pending judicial proceedings. Delaney v. United States highlighted the consequences of concurrent executive and congressional investigations. The United States must accept consequences if damaging publicity affects a person awaiting trial, potentially leading to trial postponement. Congressional hearings generating publicity for individuals not under indictment serve a different purpose, informing Congress, the Executive, and the public for legislative and enforcement actions. The absence of an indictment and the time between a congressional hearing and criminal trial can impact court decisions on claims of prejudiced defendants. Congressional hearings can generate publicity that informs Congress, the Executive, and the public for legislative and enforcement actions. Congress questioning agency decision makers may potentially undermine the impartiality of proceedings, but courts have clarified that mere inquiry and oversight by Congress may not constitute political pressure. Congressional hearings can have a prejudicial effect on pending cases, prompting a choice for Congress to weigh the harm caused by publicity against the need for information access for oversight and investigation. The executive branch has historically claimed that prosecution is solely an executive function, limiting congressional access to information related to it. This is seen as interference with prosecutorial discretion, which is crucial for pursuing criminal cases. The Iran-Contra Independent Counsel emphasized that the decision to withhold testimony for political reasons is a significant one for the legislative branch. The executive branch has historically claimed prosecutorial discretion as solely an executive function, limiting congressional access to information. In rare instances, the President may assert executive privilege in response to a congressional demand for information. Federal courts have been reluctant to rule on such controversies, as seen in United States v. AT&T. Federal courts have been highly reluctant to rule on disputes between the executive and Congress, as seen in cases like United States v. AT&T and United States v. House of Representatives. The courts have dismissed cases without resolving the issues, citing the need for the branches to attempt to accommodate each other's needs first. The D.C. Circuit Court emphasized the importance of compromise and cooperation between the Legislative and Executive Branches in resolving disputes over powers. In Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers, the court rejected the executive's claim of absolute immunity for senior advisers, allowing for the assertion of executive privilege in response to specific questions during congressional testimony. The D.C. Circuit Court emphasized compromise and cooperation between the Legislative and Executive Branches in resolving disputes over powers. In cases like In re Sealed Case (Espy) and Judicial Watch v. Department of Justice, the court distinguished between the \"presidential communications privilege\" and the \"deliberative process privilege\" as executive privileges to protect decision-making confidentiality. The deliberative process privilege has a lower threshold to overcome and disappears in cases of government misconduct, while the presidential communications privilege is rooted in the constitutional separation of powers. The presidential communications privilege is based on constitutional separation of powers principles and applies to direct decision-making by the President. It can only be overcome with a substantial showing that the materials likely contain important evidence not available elsewhere. The privilege covers communications from close presidential advisers preparing advice for the President, limited to staff with operational proximity to the President. The D.C. Circuit affirmed these limits in the Judicial Watch case. The presidential communications privilege in the Judicial Watch case involved requests for documents about pardon applications reviewed by the Justice Department. The district court applied the privilege, but the appeals court reversed, stating it only applies to documents authored or solicited by the President or close advisers with significant responsibility for advising on presidential decisions. The presidential communications privilege in the Judicial Watch case involved requests for documents about pardon applications reviewed by the Justice Department. The privilege was not applied as the officials involved were deemed too removed from the President and his senior White House advisers to be protected by it. Key considerations for asserting the privilege include the communication being authored or solicited by the President or a close advisor with operational proximity to the President, and relating to decision making in the context of a quintessential and non-delegable presidential power. The Presidential communications privilege is limited to exclude materials concerning presidential decision making pursuant to statutory delegations of authority. The DOJ may argue that withheld materials are covered under the privilege, based on the \"operational proximity\" test. In cases involving prosecutorial discretion, the Supreme Court's ruling in Morrison v. Olson is relevant. The Supreme Court's ruling in Morrison v. Olson casts doubt on the non-delegable nature of prosecutorial discretion as a presidential power, challenging the validity of independent counsels under the Ethics in Government Act. This may impact the DOJ's ability to shield materials related to prosecutorial discretion from Congress using the presidential communications privilege. The presidential communications privilege is not absolute and can be compelled by Congress if the evidence is critical to their functions. If the material does not qualify under this privilege, the executive can claim the deliberative process privilege as a fallback option. The deliberative process privilege is a common law privilege for executive agencies that can be overcome by a showing of need by an investigatory body. The weight of common law privileges in a congressional investigation is not clearly defined, and the committee decides whether to accept such assertions based on legislative need for disclosure. Congress has the constitutional prerogative to investigate, especially in cases of waste, fraud, and abuse. The common law privileges, such as attorney-client privilege, can be overcome by a showing of need by a jurisdictional committee in a congressional investigation. The Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar acknowledges Congress's discretion in accepting common law privileges and advises attorneys to exhaust all avenues of appeal before disclosing privileged information. The attorney-client privilege can be overcome in congressional investigations by showing a need. The Department of Justice has been involved in significant congressional investigations, providing documents and making officials available for interviews and testimony. These investigations show consistent congressional oversight of DOJ misconduct. Several congressional investigations into the Department of Justice have led to important remedial legislation, resignations, and convictions of Attorneys General. The Palmer raids in 1920 and 1921 were scrutinized by Senate and House committees. During the \"Palmer raids,\" led by Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and his Special Assistant J. Edgar Hoover, thousands of suspected Communists were arrested and deported. Palmer testified at Senate hearings, providing the Subcommittee with Department memoranda and Bureau of Investigation reports on deportation cases. The materials included confidential instructions for surveillance and arrest procedures, as well as a detailed analysis prepared by one of Palmer's special assistants in response to a district court opinion on pending appeals. The Senate conducted an investigation of the Teapot Dome scandal, focusing on the Department of the Interior's actions in leasing naval oil reserves. A Senate Select Committee was formed to investigate the Department of Justice's failure to prosecute wrongdoers in various cases, including the Department of the Interior. Testimony from attorneys and agents highlighted specific instances of the Department's failure to prosecute alleged cases. The Senate committee investigated cases where prosecution was still possible due to the statute of limitations not expiring. Despite promises of cooperation from Attorney General Daugherty, access to DOJ documentation was limited. Some documents may have been volunteered by witnesses rather than officially provided. After Daugherty's resignation, the Committee was denied access to confidential Bureau of Investigation files. After Daugherty's resignation, the Committee was initially denied access to confidential Bureau of Investigation reports. However, with the appointment of the new Attorney General, Harlan F. Stone, broad access to Department files was granted. Witnesses were allowed to testify about the investigations and even read from the reports at the hearings. Stone provided the Committee with all the files they requested, unlike his predecessor Daugherty who had refused most of their requests. For example, an accountant from the Department who had conducted an investigation into fraudulent property sales by the Alien Property Custodian's office was able to present his confidential reports to the Committee. The Property Custodian's office provided confidential reports to the Bureau of Investigation detailing findings and recommendations for further action on cases involving false claims. The Select Committee issued a subpoena for Mally S. Daugherty's testimony, leading to his detention by the Deputy Sergeant at Arms. Following his detention by the Deputy Sergeant at Arms, Daugherty petitioned in federal court for a writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court upheld the Senate's authority to investigate charges concerning the Department of Justice's administration and the performance of the Attorney General and his assistants in prosecuting crimes. The Supreme Court upheld the witness' conviction for contempt of Congress in the Teapot Dome case, despite the witness refusing to answer questions citing a pending lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company as a reason for withholding information. The Court rejected the argument that lawsuits provided an excuse for not cooperating with congressional inquiries. The Supreme Court upheld the witness' conviction for contempt of Congress in the Teapot Dome case, ruling that pending lawsuits do not excuse non-cooperation with congressional inquiries. In the 1950s, the House Committee on the Judiciary conducted investigations into the Department of Justice, uncovering allegations of abuses and inefficiencies. The House Committee on the Judiciary conducted investigations into the Department of Justice, focusing on the attempt to curb a St. Louis grand jury inquiry into federal tax fraud laws. Testimony was heard from various officials and members of the grand jury. Transcripts of telephone conversations were also reviewed and included in the public record. The House Committee on the Judiciary investigated the Department of Justice's attempt to influence a St. Louis grand jury inquiry into tax fraud laws. Transcripts of telephone conversations between DOJ attorneys were included in the public record. The subcommittee focused on whether there was an attempt to influence the grand jury and questioned the grand jurors about efforts to prevent a thorough investigation and pressure to issue a report absolving the government of impropriety. The House Committee on the Judiciary investigated the Department of Justice's attempt to influence a St. Louis grand jury inquiry into tax fraud laws. The subcommittee questioned attorneys and witnesses about potential interference with the grand jury's investigation, including efforts to delay or influence their deliberations. Testimony was given regarding similar charges of DOJ interference with another grand jury investigating Communist infiltration of the United Nations. The subcommittee emphasized the importance of protecting the sanctity of the grand jury process. The House Committee on the Judiciary investigated the Department of Justice's attempt to influence a St. Louis grand jury inquiry into tax fraud laws, focusing on efforts to delay or influence the grand jurors' deliberations. Attorney General McGrath resigned in response to corruption evidence, leading to a new cooperative attitude in the Department. The subcommittee commended the Department's cooperation in providing requested materials for the investigation. The subcommittee staff analyzed cases to investigate delays in the Department's handling of routine cases, including a procurement fraud case reviewed publicly at a hearing. Access was granted to all documentation except confidential FBI reports. During the 83rd Congress, the subcommittee investigated allegations of an agreement between the DOJ and the NYPD not to prosecute cases of police brutality by New York officers that may violate federal civil rights laws. Witnesses, including former and current DOJ officials, were restricted from discussing specific cases. The Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee investigated the negotiation and enforcement of consent decrees by the DOJ Antitrust Division, focusing on cases involving the oil-pipeline industry and AT&T. The subcommittee obtained a chronology of the Department's actions and reviewed DOJ memoranda and correspondence, as well as telephone transcripts of intradepartmental conversations. The Antitrust Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee conducted hearings on the AT&T and oil pipeline consent decrees. The subcommittee faced challenges in obtaining information from the Department of Justice, with the Chairman requesting disclosure of all related files, which the DOJ refused to provide. Deputy Attorney General William P. Rogers cited reasons for the refusal, including the voluntary nature of information submitted by AT&T during negotiations. AT&T argued that disclosing files during consent decree negotiations would discourage future negotiations. The head of the Antitrust Division also stated that the confidentiality of communications with defendants should be maintained. Additionally, Rogers expressed concerns that staff members would be hindered in exchanging ideas if they had to explain intermediate positions to Congress. The DOJ's refusal to comply was in line with a directive from the President. The Department of Justice refused to disclose files during consent decree negotiations, citing the need to maintain confidentiality in communications with defendants. This decision was in accordance with a directive from the President to ensure that employees can freely exchange ideas without fear of disclosure. The Department of Justice withheld information during consent decree negotiations to prevent embarrassing disclosures, hampering the committee's investigation. Despite this, the subcommittee was able to obtain some material from AT&T directly. The Department allowed attorneys to testify about the decree, indicating a willingness to share relevant information. During the Cointelpro and Related Investigations of FBI-DOJ Misconduct between 1974 and 1978, Senate and House committees examined intelligence operations of federal agencies, including the FBI and Justice Department. The Senate Select Committee heard from 800 witnesses, including present and former FBI and DOJ officials, and obtained approximately 110,000 pages of documents. The Senate Select Committee reviewed documents from intelligence agencies and other sources, including FBI documents with redacted materials. The committee emphasized the importance of regular access to working documents for effective oversight of the intelligence community. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights held hearings on FBI domestic intelligence operations in 1975, with testimony from DOJ and FBI officials. The General Accounting Office (GAO) also reviewed FBI operations by analyzing 899 cases from ten FBI offices involved in domestic intelligence activities. The FBI agreed to have agents prepare summaries of each case file, detailing the investigation's information, methods, and sources. The General Accounting Office (GAO) conducted a review of FBI domestic intelligence operations in 1975, analyzing 899 cases from ten FBI offices. The review included details on the investigation methods, sources, and instructions from FBI Headquarters. GAO also interviewed FBI agents involved in the cases and prepared summaries of each document in the file. In a follow-up investigation in 1977, GAO reviewed 319 additional cases and obtained access to selected documents for verification. In 1979, joint hearings were held to investigate fraudulent pricing of fuel in the oil industry and the failure of the Department of Energy and DOJ to prosecute alleged criminality. Testimony and evidence were received in closed session regarding pending indictments and criminal proceedings. The Subcommittee on Energy and Power avoided actions that might affect the indictment of any party. The joint hearings in 1979 investigated fraudulent pricing of fuel in the oil industry and the failure of the Department of Energy and DOJ to prosecute alleged criminality. Testimony and evidence were received in closed session regarding pending indictments and criminal proceedings. The committees praised for their discreet conduct during the hearings to avoid interference with ongoing investigations and criminal trials. The DOJ allowed access to declination memoranda, with the condition that the information not be made public unless approved by the committees. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary investigated Billy Carter's activities on behalf of the Libyan government in 1980. The Department of Justice provided documents related to the decision not to prosecute Billy Carter. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Billy Carter's ties to Libya in 1980. The Department of Justice was questioned about Attorney General Civiletti's handling of the investigation, specifically regarding the withholding of intelligence information. Witnesses from the Department testified about decision-making processes and the Billy Carter case. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Billy Carter's ties to Libya in 1980. The Department of Justice was questioned about Attorney General Civiletti's handling of the investigation, specifically regarding the withholding of intelligence information. Witnesses from the Department testified about decision-making processes and the Billy Carter case. The subcommittee staff took 35 depositions totaling 2,646 pages and accessed documents from the Department's files on the case, including prosecutorial memoranda, correspondence with Billy Carter, and FBI investigative reports. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Billy Carter's ties to Libya in 1980, questioning the Department of Justice about Attorney General Civiletti's handling of the investigation. Classified documents related to the case were kept by the Senate Intelligence Committee for examination by designated staff members. In 1982, a select committee studied undercover law enforcement activities, with FBI Director William Webster testifying about the history and policies governing such operations. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Billy Carter's ties to Libya in 1980, questioning the Department of Justice about Attorney General Civiletti's handling of the investigation. Classified documents related to the case were examined by designated staff members. In 1982, a select committee studied undercover law enforcement activities, with FBI Director William Webster testifying about the history and policies governing such operations. Witnesses testified about Abscam and other undercover operations conducted by the FBI and other units of the Department. Committee staff interviewed present and former Department attorneys and FBI agents, including members of the Department's Brooklyn Organized Crime Strike Force. The Department stated that Strike Force attorneys do not normally testify before congressional committees to avoid inhibiting prosecutors from their tasks. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated Billy Carter's ties to Libya in 1980, questioning the Department of Justice about Attorney General Civiletti's handling of the investigation. The committee focused on the FBI's Abscam operation, resulting in the criminal conviction of several officials. They reviewed over 20,000 pages of Abscam documents during the covert stage of the operation. The Senate Judiciary Committee reviewed over 20,000 pages of Abscam documents, along with video and audio tapes, as part of their investigation into the FBI's Abscam operation. The Department of Justice provided the committee with access to confidential Abscam materials, with certain limitations to protect ongoing investigations and sensitive information. The committee agreed to a \"pledge of confidentiality\" allowing them to use and disclose information from confidential documents without identifying specific documents. Access to confidential documents was limited to committee members, counsel, and document custodians. DOJ later permitted access to other committee attorneys. In addition to direct access to documents, the committee received oral briefings on factual material from withheld prosecutorial memoranda and documents related to an internal investigation of possible misconduct in the Abscam operations. The committee had limited access to confidential documents for their investigation into possible misconduct in Abscam operations. They were allowed to examine a report at the Department but could not copy or remove it. The committee found this limited access impractical and requested further access from the Attorney General. The committee requested further access to confidential documents for their investigation into possible misconduct in Abscam operations. The Department agreed to provide a copy of the report with restrictions on dissemination and copying. The committee also retained the right to seek unrestricted access if needed. The FBI's Operation Corkscrew undercover investigation of corruption in the Cleveland Municipal Court involved access to confidential documents similar to the Abscam investigation. In 1982, House committees investigated the EPA's enforcement of the \"Superfund\" law, requesting documents from EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford. After initial refusal, subpoenas were issued for EPA and DOJ attorneys' memoranda containing litigation and negotiation strategy. Compliance was resisted due to documents being \"enforcement sensitive.\" President Reagan directed executive privilege to prevent disclosure. House Transportation Subcommittee cited Ms. Burford for contempt of Congress, affirmed by the full Committee and House of Representatives. DOJ's attempt to enjoin forwarding the contempt citation to U.S. Attorney failed. Following negotiations with the Public Works and Transportation Committee, the DOJ agreed to release documents in stages to the subcommittee. However, Chairman John Dingell objected to the limited access and delays. After threats of new subpoenas and contempt citations, an agreement was reached to deliver all requested documents without redactions or briefings. The subcommittee agreed to handle all \"enforcement sensitive\" documents in executive session, with the right to release them in public session after providing notice to the EPA. Staff access would be decided by the chairman and ranking minority Member. The agreement was signed by Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Broyhill, and White House Counsel Fielding on March 9, 1983. The Department of Justice filed a legal action against the House to defend Burford's refusal to comply with a subpoena. The lawsuit was dismissed, documents were provided to Congress, and the contempt citation was dropped. Questions remained about the Department's role in the controversy, including decisions on executive privilege, prosecution, and conflicts of interest. The House Judiciary Committee investigated the Department of Justice's actions regarding advising the President, representing Burford, and enforcing the congressional criminal contempt statute. The committee faced challenges in obtaining information but ultimately concluded that the Department consciously prevented them from accessing key information. The House Judiciary Committee faced challenges in obtaining information from the Department of Justice during the EPA controversy. The Department deliberately withheld vital handwritten notes and chronologies for over a year, which contained crucial information for the Committee's inquiry. Other abuses included withholding relevant documents and providing false testimony before the committee. The House Judiciary Committee requested documentation from the Department of Justice regarding the withholding of EPA materials. The committee's chairman, Representative Peter Rodino, asked for all relevant documents and information on the Department's actions, including potential conflicts of interest and instructions given to the U.S. Attorney. The House Judiciary Committee requested documents from the Department of Justice regarding the withholding of EPA materials. After meetings between committee staff and Department officials, an agreement was reached for staff to review thousands of documents from various divisions. In July 1983, the committee chairman requested copies of 105 important documents identified during the review. The House Judiciary Committee requested 105 important documents from the Department of Justice related to the withholding of EPA materials. Despite initial delays, the committee finally received the documents in July 1984, a year after the initial request. There were also disagreements regarding access for committee staff to interview Department employees. The House Judiciary Committee interviewed 26 current and former Department of Justice employees, including four Assistant Attorneys General, without Department attorneys present. If requested, employees could have private counsel present during interviews. The House Judiciary Committee interviewed Department of Justice employees, including Assistant Attorneys General, to access Criminal Division documents related to the investigation of Rita Lavelle. Initially, the Department refused to provide these documents, citing longstanding practice. The House Judiciary Committee requested access to Department of Justice documents related to an investigation, but the Department refused, citing a longstanding practice of not providing access to active criminal files. The committee chairman objected to the denial of access, stating that no claim of executive privilege had been asserted and demanding a detailed index of the withheld documents. The House Judiciary Committee demanded a detailed index of withheld documents from the Department of Justice, including title, date, length, author, summary, reason for withholding, and certifications. The chairman narrowed the request to \"predicate\" documents related to the investigation of Lavelle. The Department eventually produced the requested materials after more than three months. In 1985 and 1986, the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee investigated why no individuals were charged in connection with E.F. Hutton's case. The subcommittee requested documents related to the case, including letters promising not to prosecute, draft indictments, and internal DOJ communications. Assistant Attorney General Trott agreed to provide a document with redactions following the request. The Justice Department recommended that the subcommittee go to court to obtain access to all information related to the grand jury investigation, including redacted details such as witness identities and testimony. The court expressed doubt about the applicability of Rule 6(e) to the documents sought by the subcommittee. The Subcommittee report includes exhibits of deliberative prosecutorial documents related to Hutton's money management practices, recommending prosecution. The Subcommittee also received memoranda analyzing defenses by Hutton officers during the Iran-Contra scandal investigation in the late 1980s. During the Iran-Contra scandal, the House and Senate committees demanded Justice Department files, which Attorney General Meese's team tried to withhold. The committees questioned Justice Department officers, including Meese, and criticized the inadequacies of the \"Meese Inquiry\" into the NSC staff. The Iran-Contra Committees found that the NSC staff were forewarned to shred records and create a false story during the investigation. The congressional report revealed incompetence in the Attorney General's team during the Meese Inquiry, including lack of note-taking and allowing documents to be shredded. The inquiry excluded key departments like the Criminal Division and FBI until it was too late. In June 1992, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology reviewed a plea bargain settlement involving Rockwell International Corporation for environmental crimes at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility. The settlement followed a five-year investigation by a joint government task force. Concerns were raised about the size of the fine relative to profits and lack of personal indictments. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology reviewed a plea bargain settlement involving Rockwell International Corporation for environmental crimes at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility. Concerns were raised about the lack of personal indictments despite DOJ findings of \"institutional crimes\" encouraged by DOE. The subcommittee held hearings and received testimony from various officials. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology reviewed a plea bargain settlement involving Rockwell International Corporation for environmental crimes at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility. Concerns were raised about the lack of personal indictments despite DOJ findings of \"institutional crimes\" encouraged by DOE. The subcommittee held hearings and received testimony from various officials. The subcommittee members unanimously authorized the chairman to send a letter to President George H. W. Bush requesting that he either personally assert executive privilege as the basis for directing the witnesses to withhold the information or direct DOJ to retract its instructions to the witnesses. The subcommittee moved to hold the U.S. Attorney in contempt of Congress for not retracting DOJ's instructions to witnesses. A last-minute agreement required DOJ to issue new instructions for all personnel under subpoena to answer all questions, including internal deliberations related to the plea bargain. Transcripts of interviews were to be provided to witnesses but not made public, except for refreshing recollection or impeaching testimony of other witnesses. The House Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations conducted an extensive investigation into the impact of the DOJ on the effectiveness of the EPA's criminal enforcement program from 1992 to 1994. This involved two public hearings, three years of staff work, document reviews, and overcoming DOJ resistance. Witnesses were interviewed under oath, and the subcommittee reserved the right to hold further hearings in the future. The Subcommittee's investigation into DOJ's impact on the EPA's criminal enforcement program faced persistent resistance. It focused on mismanagement allegations within the Environmental Crimes Section and the decision to centralize control in Washington. DOJ's lack of cooperation led to delays in obtaining crucial documents related to closed criminal environmental cases. The Subcommittee's investigation into DOJ's impact on the EPA's criminal enforcement program faced resistance in obtaining staff interviews with line attorneys. Despite DOJ's initial refusal, subpoenas were issued to present and former DOJ attorneys in May 1993. In June 1993, DOJ agreed to staff interviews of the subpoenaed attorneys. The Subcommittee's investigation faced resistance in obtaining staff interviews with line attorneys, but subpoenas were issued in May 1993. In March 1994, document subpoenas were issued to the Attorney General and Acting Assistant Attorney General due to continued refusal to produce documents voluntarily. DOJ claimed some documents were \"deliberative\" and limited access could be allowed. The Acting Assistant Attorney General's nomination was put on hold until DOJ agreed to comply with the subpoena in late March. The DOJ complied with a subpoena after a hold was placed on a nomination. The investigation led to changes in the centralization of environmental prosecutions and management at ECS. The next case study involved revelations of internal investigations despite agency resistance. The subcommittee found serious misconduct by DOJ and Treasury branches in the investigation and prosecution of Randall Weaver and Kevin Harris at Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Hearings revealed multiple internal investigations that were not publicly released, with DOJ initially reluctant to share documents but eventually providing some under agreed conditions. The most crucial document obtained was the Report of the Ruby Ridge incident. The Report of the Ruby Ridge Task Force, established by the DOJ after the acquittals of Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris, found misconduct by federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors. The 542-page report highlighted problems with the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, and U.S. Attorneys Office in Idaho, recommending institutional changes. The Ruby Ridge Task Force report found misconduct by federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors, recommending institutional changes. It concluded that FBI rules of engagement were unconstitutional, and the fatal shot fired by an FBI HRT member at Vicki Weaver was deemed unreasonable. OPR disagreed with the recommendation for a criminal investigation into the shooting. The Deputy Attorney General referred the Task Force recommendation for prosecutorial review to the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, which concluded that there was no basis for criminal prosecution. Campaign Finance Investigations Allegations of violations of campaign finance laws and regulations surfaced during the latter stages of the 1996 presidential election campaign and became the subjects of investigations by committees in both Houses between 1996 and 2000. Several committee inquiries focused on the nature and propriety of DOJ actions and non-actions during investigations. In 1997, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee investigated allegations of improprieties in campaign funding, focusing on money flow into the Republican and Democratic National Committees from foreign sources. Concerns arose about the quality of DOJ's prosecution efforts and lack of cooperation between Main Justice and the FBI. In 1999, hearings were held on DOJ's handling of the investigation of Yah Lin \"Charlie\" Trie, who allegedly funneled money from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee and provided funds to the President's Legal Expense Trust. In 1997, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee investigated campaign funding improprieties involving foreign sources. The committee subpoenaed documents related to the President's Legal Expense Trust (PLET) and the DOJ's Campaign Finance Task Force conducted a parallel investigation. FBI agents suspected Trie's agent of destroying subpoenaed documents from April to October 1997, but DOJ Task Force attorneys refused to grant a search warrant due to insufficient probable cause. In December 1997, FBI Director Freeh suggested appointing an independent counsel for the campaign finance investigation to avoid political conflict. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight requested Freeh to produce the memo, but Attorney General Reno intervened, citing DOJ policy. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight issued subpoenas to Attorney General Reno and FBI Director Freeh in December 1997 for memos related to the campaign finance investigation. Reno refused to comply, citing DOJ policy, and Freeh suggested appointing an independent counsel to avoid political conflict. The Committee later learned that a memo by Charles La Bella recommended appointing an independent counsel, but Reno still refused to comply with the subpoena. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight issued subpoenas to the Attorney General in 1998 for memos related to the campaign finance investigation. Despite being held in contempt of Congress, the Attorney General refused to release the memos. After negotiations, an agreement was reached to produce the subpoenaed memoranda to the committee under certain conditions. The House Committee on Government Reform issued a subpoena for DOJ documents related to FBI corruption in its Boston Regional office. Despite DOJ's refusal to comply, the committee released the memos to the public on June 6. The House Committee on Government Reform issued a subpoena for DOJ documents related to FBI corruption in its Boston Regional office. The subpoena was postponed due to the September 11 terrorist attacks. It sought Justice Department documents regarding alleged law enforcement corruption in the FBI's Boston office over nearly 30 years, including allowing innocent individuals to be wrongly convicted of murder, permitting informants to commit additional murders, and warning informants of impending indictments. The President directed the Attorney General not to release the documents to protect the effectiveness of deliberative processes. The Justice Department argued that disclosing documents would hinder the necessary candor in prosecutorial decisions and politicize the criminal justice process. They claimed historical policy of withholding such documents from Congress. Congressional hearings showed the Department's firm stance on the issue. The Justice Department initially refused to disclose documents, citing concerns about hindering prosecutorial decisions and politicizing the criminal justice process. However, they later acknowledged the possibility of compromise, stating that there was no strict policy against congressional access to deliberative documents. White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales conceded that the Executive Branch traditionally protected sensitive deliberative documents but could make exceptions based on a committee's specific need. The documents were eventually released after expert testimony at a February 6, 2002 hearing. The committee heard expert testimony on DOJ disclosing deliberative documents to Congress since 1920, including prosecutorial memoranda, testimony of Department employees, FBI reports, and documents from open and closed cases. They were given access to disputed documents after a hearing. The Massachusetts federal district court judge awarded $101.7 million to convicted persons and their families under the Federal Tort Claims Act for government liability in malicious prosecution, civil conspiracy, emotional distress, and negligence. The FBI Office of Professional Responsibility found in 1997 that prosecutorial discretion was not exercised for informants Bulger and Flemmi, which was contradicted in a committee hearing with former U.S. Attorney Jeremiah O'Sullivan. In 2002, a committee hearing confirmed that prosecutorial discretion had been used for Bulger and Flemmi. The Justice Department's documents also support this. The Justice Department's conclusion that prosecutorial discretion did not benefit Bulger or Flemmi, while fighting to withhold information from Congress, is concerning. In 2007, investigations began into the removal and replacement of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006 by the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. In 2006, the House and Senate Judiciary Committees investigated the removal and replacement of nine U.S. Attorneys. The committees questioned the reasons for the terminations, individuals involved in the decisions, and factors influencing them. DOJ officials, including the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, were interviewed during hearings. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees investigated the removal and replacement of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006. They focused on the role of the White House in the removals, seeking witnesses and documents. The White House offered limited access to documents and witnesses, with restrictions on questioning and no transcripts provided. The committees had to agree not to pursue further White House-related information through other means. The House and Senate committees issued subpoenas to White House officials for documents and testimony related to the removal of U.S. Attorneys in 2006. The White House Chief of Staff and former White House Counsel were subpoenaed, but the White House refused to produce documents citing executive privilege. Former White House officials were directed not to appear for testimony. The House committees issued subpoenas to White House officials for documents and testimony related to the removal of U.S. Attorneys in 2006. White House officials, including Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten, were directed not to appear for testimony, leading to contempt of Congress votes against them. The full House of Representatives voted to hold them in contempt on February 14, 2008. H.Res. 979 and H.Res. 980 authorized actions to enforce subpoenas against White House officials, but the Attorney General determined their refusal to comply was not a crime. The House Judiciary Committee then filed a civil action seeking enforcement of the subpoenas on March 10, 2008. The District Court granted the Committee's motion for partial summary judgment, declaring that \"Ms. Miers is not absolutely immune from congressional process\" and must appear before the Committee to provide testimony when faced with a congressional subpoena. It ordered Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten to produce non-privileged documents and provide a specific description of documents withheld on the basis of executive privilege. In July 2003, CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson's identity was leaked by Robert D. Novak, following criticism of the Bush Administration by her husband, Joseph Wilson. Joseph Wilson criticized the Bush Administration for claiming Saddam Hussein bought uranium from Niger, sparking an FBI investigation into the disclosure of Valerie Plame's identity. Scooter Libby, Vice President Cheney's Chief of Staff, was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. The House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the leak to uncover the national security violation and the involvement of White House officials. On July 16, 2007, Chairman Henry Waxman requested information from an investigation regarding a serious national security breach. The Department of Justice allowed access to redacted interviews with White House staff, but reports on interviews with the President and Vice President were restricted. The Committee's analysis raised questions about Vice President Cheney's involvement. Chairman Waxman later requested access to more information from Attorney General Michael Mukasey. Chairman Waxman requested access to reports of interviews with the President and Vice President, but the Justice Department refused to release them. The Committee issued a subpoena for unredacted transcripts and documents, but the Justice Department maintained that the confidentiality interests of the President and Vice President outweighed the need for disclosure. Discussions were held regarding the possibility of reviewing redacted portions of interviews with White House staff, but access to reports on internal White House deliberations remained restricted. The Justice Department refused to release reports of interviews with the President and Vice President, citing executive privilege and separation of powers concerns. Chairman Waxman agreed not to pursue an interview with President Bush but demanded access to Vice President Cheney's interview and unredacted versions of staff interviews. Chairman Waxman demanded access to Vice President Cheney's unredacted interview reports to investigate concerns raised by Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald about the Vice President's involvement in the leak. Waxman rejected the Justice Department's arguments for withholding the reports, stating that confidentiality interests did not apply and that the reports did not involve vital national security issues. Chairman Waxman demanded access to Vice President Cheney's unredacted interview reports to investigate concerns raised by Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald about the leak. President Bush and Vice President Cheney agreed to be interviewed despite potential disclosure risks. The Department of Justice notified the Committee of the President's formal assertion of executive privilege over relevant documents. On July 16, 2008, the Committee considered a resolution to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress for non-compliance with the subpoena. The Attorney General argued that executive privilege was invoked to protect the confidentiality of White House deliberations, including internal staff discussions on advising the President. He also claimed that the subpoenaed documents fell under the presidential communications and deliberative process aspects of executive privilege, as well as the law enforcement component, which would be compromised if disclosed to Congress. The Attorney General argued that executive privilege was invoked to protect White House confidentiality, including internal staff discussions. The Committee's interest in the affair did not meet the standard to overcome executive privilege. The contempt hearing was postponed to consider the President's claim. The Committee requested a description of the documents subject to executive privilege, but no response was received before the end of the Congress term. In August 2008, CREW filed a FOIA action seeking records release. In October 2009, court allowed some records withholding for privilege and security reasons. In early 2011, investigations into ATF's Operation Fast and Furious began due to whistleblower allegations. Investigations into ATF's Operation Fast and Furious were triggered by whistleblowers alleging straw purchasers were allowed to amass firearms for trafficking. Some of these firearms were trafficked to criminals in Mexico, including two found at the scene where a Border Patrol Agent was killed. Senator Grassley requested information on the sale of assault weapons to straw purchasers, and the ATF denied knowingly allowing this. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee requested documents regarding Operation Fast and Furious after learning about a \"gunwalking\" operation. The Department of Justice refused to provide the materials, leading to a subpoena for the documents. Despite producing redacted files, the Department withheld information on investigative activities to protect sensitive details. The Justice Department concluded its efforts to respond to the subpoena for materials related to Operation Fast and Furious. Most withheld material was prohibited by statute, while some were withheld to protect pending criminal investigations. Internal communications were also withheld to protect Executive Branch confidentiality interests and separation of powers principles. The Committee then subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for a list of materials and communications related to the operation. The Department of Justice produced documents related to Operation Fast and Furious, including a letter with inaccuracies that was later withdrawn. Despite confidentiality concerns, the Department agreed to provide information on how the inaccurate details were included in the letter. Subpoenaed materials were still not released. The Department of Justice refused to release subpoenaed information in two categories, leading to threats of contempt from the Committee. The Committee criticized heavy redactions in documents and outlined non-compliance with three categories in the subpoena. The Department of Justice refused to release subpoenaed information in three categories: (1) details on who at the Justice Department knew about program tactics, (2) information on how officials handled whistleblowers, and (3) documents related to the lack of information-sharing among law enforcement agencies. The Department defended its redactions as necessary to protect its interests. The Department of Justice refused to release federal wiretap applications and core investigative materials to protect ongoing criminal investigations and maintain separation of powers principles dating back to the 19th century. Disclosure was deemed to potentially influence investigations or prejudice law enforcement. Additionally, internal communications in response to investigations were considered inappropriate for disclosure to congressional oversight committees due to confidentiality and constitutional concerns. The Committee narrowed its subpoena to information on senior officials during Operation Fast and Furious and post-February 4 documents related to the Department's response to Congress. Chairman Issa announced a vote on holding Attorney General Holder accountable. On June 20, 2012, Deputy Attorney General James Cole informed the Committee that President Obama had claimed executive privilege over the materials, leading to the collapse of negotiations for document disclosure. Attorney General Holder argued that the requested materials fell under executive privilege based on past claims. Attorney General Holder argued that disclosing the requested materials would hinder Executive Branch deliberations, raise separation of powers concerns, and create an unfair imbalance in the oversight process. He also cited executive privilege to protect ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions from congressional scrutiny. Attorney General Holder argued that for a congressional committee subpoena to overcome an executive privilege claim, it must demonstrate that the documents are \"demonstrably critical\" to a \"legitimate legislative responsibility.\" He stated that there was no need for further access to the Department's deliberations, as the connection between the congressional interest and the documents was weak. The Department also argued that Congress's role is to inform itself, not the public. The House Committee approved a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Holder for failing to comply with a subpoena. The resolution was passed with a 255-67 vote, finding Holder in contempt and directing the Speaker to certify the contempt. The House Committee approved a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Holder for failing to comply with a subpoena. The resolution was passed with a 255-67 vote, finding Holder in contempt and directing the Speaker to certify the contempt. A second resolution, H.Res. 706, authorized Chairman Issa to initiate a judicial proceeding to affirm Holder's duty to comply with subpoenas. Deputy Attorney General James Cole stated that Holder's response did not constitute a crime, and the DOJ would not bring the contempt citation before prosecution. The House Committee approved a contempt of Congress resolution against Attorney General Holder for failing to comply with a subpoena. The DOJ will not prosecute the Attorney General for contempt of Congress. The Committee filed a civil enforcement action instead. The case will focus on the validity of the Committee subpoenas, not on the contempt power or its application. The court will consider if the subpoena falls within the Committee's jurisdiction and serves a valid legislative purpose. It will also assess if executive privilege protects the documents and if the Committee's need for them outweighs that privilege. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia."
