    "content": "The \"Space Exploration Act of 2002\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Congress finds it is in the national interest to have a robust space exploration program, including robotic missions and human space flight. The US has achieved significant milestones in human space flight, but there is no commitment to future goals after the International Space Station. Scientific research can be done robotically, but a comprehensive plan for solar system exploration is needed. The Nation's plan for scientific exploration of the solar system and search for life beyond Earth involves both robotic spacecraft missions and human space flight. Human space flight complements robotic exploration and enhances scientific research capabilities. The successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope highlights the potential of human space flight in advancing scientific exploration goals. Numerous commissions and study panels have outlined future goals for human space flight over the last 30 years, indicating that additional studies are not currently necessary. The main hurdle in carrying out human space flight activities beyond low Earth orbit is the lack of a national commitment to specific and challenging goals. Without such goals, programs for developing technological capabilities are likely to be unfocused, inefficient, and short-lived. It is in the national interest of the United States to commit to a set of incremental goals for the human space flight program to facilitate scientific exploration of the solar system and aid in the search for life beyond Earth. The human space flight initiative aims to explore the inner solar system, with Mars as the ultimate goal. Other important objectives include missions to Earth-Sun libration points, asteroids, the Moon, Mars' satellites, and eventually Mars itself. The initiative should have incremental goals to advance scientific understanding and develop necessary capabilities. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration should develop a roadmap and implementation plan for a progressive program of human space flight beyond low Earth orbit in support of the scientific exploration of the solar system and the search for life beyond Earth. Existing and planned investments in the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and the Space Launch Initiative will contribute to this initiative. The President should ensure sufficient resources for NASA to advance human space flight goals without duplication of effort. Successful Moon landings in 1969-1972 inspired a generation in science and engineering. A sustained human space exploration initiative can inspire a new generation. A bold and sustained human space exploration initiative, like the Apollo program, has the potential to engage the international community in peaceful cooperation in space. Completing the International Space Station with a full crew complement and robust research capabilities is essential for a successful comprehensive initiative of scientific exploration of the solar system involving human space flight. The term \"Administrator\" in this Act refers to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Act also includes a Human Space Flight Initiative. The Administrator of NASA has set goals for the human space flight program, including developing reusable space vehicles capable of carrying humans to various destinations within specific timeframes. Within specific timeframes, the development and flight demonstration of reusable space vehicles capable of carrying humans to various destinations such as Earth-orbit crossing asteroids, the Moon, and Mars are outlined in the Act. This includes the deployment of human-tended habitation and research facilities on the lunar surface and one of the moons of Mars. The Act outlines the development and flight demonstration of a reusable space vehicle for carrying humans to Mars. The Administrator will establish an Office of Exploration to plan and manage NASA activities in coordination with other relevant offices. Competitions will be held for innovative mission concepts to achieve the goals. Competitions will be open to various entities to propose efficient mission concepts to achieve the outlined goals, including international participation and cost-sharing. The Administrator will solicit proposals within 180 days for the first goal and determine timing for competitions for the other goals. The Administrator will establish an independent panel to review proposals for competitions under subsection (a), evaluating mission concepts, cost estimates, funding profiles, schedules, and technological risk reduction roadmaps. The Administrator will conduct an independent external review of cost estimates and funding profiles for competitively selected proposals within 60 days of the selection process. A report on the implementation plan and review results will be provided to Congress within 90 days of the completion of each competition. The implementation plans of competitively selected proposals will be updated annually by the project manager. An independent external review panel will assess these updated plans, with results shared with relevant congressional committees within 30 days of each review. The implementation plan for competitively selected proposals will be assessed annually by an external review panel. Key aspects to address include the reasonableness of the schedule, consistency with the mission concept, addressing technical and programmatic risks, utilizing commercially available goods and services, and leveraging existing capabilities from previous phases of the human space flight initiative. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 are authorized for the Administrator to carry out the human space flight initiative and other NASA programs."
