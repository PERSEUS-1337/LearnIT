The English Language Unity Act of 2005 establishes English as the official language of the United States by amending Title 4, United States Code to include a new chapter on the official language. The English Language Unity Act of 2005 designates English as the official language of the United States. Representatives of the Federal Government are obligated to preserve and promote English, including encouraging language learning. Official government functions must be conducted in English. The English Language Unity Act of 2005 designates English as the official language of the United States for all laws, public proceedings, regulations, publications, orders, actions, programs, and policies, with exceptions for specific circumstances such as teaching languages, national security, public health, and protecting victims' rights. The Uniform English language rule for naturalization requires citizens to understand English for naturalization ceremonies and official functions, while allowing communication in other languages in unofficial capacities. Sec. 166 of the Uniform English Language Act states that individuals injured by a violation of the act may seek relief through civil action. Chapter 6 discusses the official language of the United States, specifically outlining general rules for English language texts of the laws. Chapter 1 of title 1, United States Code, is amended to include a new section regarding English language requirements and workplace policies being consistent with US laws. Any ambiguity in the English text of US laws should be resolved in favor of preserving rights retained by the people and reserving powers to the States or the people. Additionally, implementing regulations are to be put in place. The Secretary of Homeland Security must issue a proposed rule for testing English language ability for naturalization within 180 days. Citizens should be able to understand key US documents in English, with limited exceptions for extraordinary circumstances like asylum. The effective date for the amendments is 180 days after the enactment of the Act."
