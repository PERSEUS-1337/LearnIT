    "content": "The study introduces decision gates (d-gate) to optimize deep neural networks for industrial applications by dynamically determining the depth of embeddings needed for sample discrimination. Integrating d-gate modules reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy, leading to significant speed-up and FLOPS reduction in experiments with ResNet-101. The proposed d-gate modules resulted in a significant speed-up and FLOPS reduction on ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201 trained on CIFAR10, with minimal drop in accuracy. Deeper architectures offer better modeling performance but also pose challenges such as overfitting and high computational costs. Previous studies addressed these issues by introducing residual learning and leveraging the inception idea within a residual block. The ResNext architecture utilized the inception idea within a residual block structure to improve subspace modeling and address the degradation problem, resulting in enhanced modeling accuracy. Various methods have been proposed to reduce computational costs, including precision reduction, model compression, teacher-student strategies, and evolutionary algorithms. Conditional computation and early prediction methods have also been introduced to dynamically execute different modules within a network based on skip connections. In this study, decision gates (d-gate) are introduced as modules trained to determine if a sample needs to be projected into a deeper embedding or if an early prediction can be made, enabling conditional computation of dynamic representations at different depths in deep neural networks. This approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining modeling accuracy compared to training networks from scratch. Deeper subspace embeddings are crucial for discriminating samples near decision boundaries, but may be unnecessary for samples far from boundaries. Decision gates are introduced to determine if samples need deeper embedding or can be predicted early, reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. The early prediction problem is addressed by introducing decision gates in a deep neural network to determine if samples require projection into a deep embedding space. These decision gates aim to minimize the risk of early misclassifications while deciding if a sample is near a boundary. The d-gate module, with weights w and biases b, provides distances of samples to decision boundaries in the embedding space for classification. It acts as a linear classifier, efficiently trained to minimize classification error on training data. The d-gate module, with weights w and biases b, computes distances of samples to decision boundaries in the embedding space for classification. It is a linear classifier trained to minimize classification error on training data using gradient descent optimization. The d-gate can be trained within a mini-batch framework, making it convenient for deep neural networks with large datasets. The d-gate module computes distances to decision boundaries in the embedding space for classification. It determines early prediction or moves samples to a deeper stage for improved projection. Decision gates trained with hinge loss show higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to cross-entropy. The proposed d-gate modules in ResNet101 BID6 and DenseNet201 BID8 on CIFAR10 dataset allow fine control over trade-off between accuracy and computational cost by adjusting decision thresholds. Integrating d-gate modules in network architectures reduces computational cost significantly. The integration of d-gate modules in ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201 networks reduces computational cost significantly while maintaining accuracy levels. For ResNet-101, a 39% reduction in computational cost with a 1.7% drop in accuracy results in a 38% speed-up. Similarly, DenseNet-201 sees a 36% reduction in FLOPs with only a 2% accuracy drop, leading to a 46% speed-up. Overall, d-gate modules provide a significant increase in prediction speed. The proposed d-gate modules significantly increase prediction speed, suitable for industrial applications. A hinge loss is introduced for training the d-gate modules, showing effectiveness compared to cross-entropy loss through a comparative experiment on ResNet101. The proposed hinge loss is compared to cross-entropy loss for training decision gates in a network. Results show that hinge loss leads to higher modeling accuracy, especially when using fewer FLOPs. This highlights the limitations of cross-entropy loss in optimizing decision boundaries."
