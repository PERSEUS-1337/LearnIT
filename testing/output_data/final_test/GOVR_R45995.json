    "content": "The House passed the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 (H.R. 6) on June 4, 2019, providing a pathway to lawful permanent immigration status for unauthorized childhood arrivals. This vote was the only successful one among several House and Senate floor votes since 2018 on similar legislation. The term \"unauthorized childhood arrivals\" includes individuals who entered the US unlawfully or lost legal status. Each bill has its own criteria for eligibility. Legislation on unauthorized childhood arrivals, including the DREAM Act, has been introduced since 2001. The report focuses on House and Senate measures from the 115th and 116th Congresses, as well as the DACA initiative. LPRs can live and work in the United States permanently, becoming U.S. citizens through naturalization after residing in the country for five years. S. 1291 aimed to provide immigration relief to unauthorized childhood arrivals, seen more sympathetically due to arriving in the U.S. as children. Subsequent bills granting LPR status to unauthorized childhood arrivals were not all named the \"DREAM Act\" and did not have the same provisions as S. 1291. The \"Dream Act\" aimed to help unauthorized childhood arrivals become LPRs, but subsequent bills did not have the same provisions. To adjust status to LPR, individuals must have been inspected and admitted into the U.S. unlawfully entered individuals are not eligible. Unauthorized individuals who entered the United States are not eligible for adjustment of status unless they fall into a disqualified category. Bills like S. 1291 and S. 1545 aimed to provide LPR status to unauthorized childhood arrivals but did not progress further. S. 1545 targeted foreign nationals who were inadmissible or deportable from the United States. S. 1545 proposed a two-stage process for eligible individuals to become LPRs, with criteria including continuous presence in the US for five years, initial entry before age 16, and educational requirements. Disqualification could occur if the individual was inadmissible or deportable under specified grounds in the INA. S. 1545 proposed granting conditional LPR status to qualifying childhood arrivals, allowing them to apply for naturalization once the conditional basis was removed. The bill also addressed eligibility for higher education benefits. The bill proposed granting conditional LPR status to qualifying childhood arrivals, allowing them to apply for naturalization. It also addressed eligibility for federal student aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, excluding grant aid like federal Pell Grants. Additionally, the bill aimed to eliminate a provision from the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act that restricts states from providing higher education benefits to certain unauthorized immigrants. In the 109th Congress, proposals for unauthorized childhood arrivals were included in larger immigration reform bills. The Senate passed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 with a DREAM Act subtitle, but the House did not consider the bill. The DREAM Act provisions were similar to those in a previous bill and aimed to grant LPR status to unauthorized childhood arrivals. The 108th Congress proposed S. 2611, which included provisions for unauthorized childhood arrivals to become conditional LPRs and eventually full-fledged LPRs. These DREAM Act provisions were more lenient compared to general legalization provisions, reflecting a belief that these individuals were less responsible for their unlawful status. Differences existed between the DREAM Act provisions in S. 2611 and S. 1545. In the 110th Congress, there was an unsuccessful vote in the Senate on a bill for comprehensive immigration reform (S. 1639) that included a DREAM Act subtitle among other legalization provisions. The vote was 46 to 53, with differences from earlier bills on unauthorized childhood arrivals. For example, S. 1639 tied DREAM Act provisions to other legalization measures in the bill. Under S. 1639, unauthorized childhood arrivals had to obtain temporary legal status under a new \"Z\" nonimmigrant category. Eligibility requirements included continuous presence in the U.S. since a specified date, clearance of strict inadmissibility criteria, submission of biometric data for security checks, and satisfaction of federal tax liabilities. Z nonimmigrant status was granted for four years and could be extended. Extension criteria included English language and U.S. civics knowledge requirements. S. 1639 proposed different pathways to LPR status for Z nonimmigrants, including a DREAM Act pathway with specific requirements such as being under age 30, under age 16 at initial entry, and completing two years of education or military service. Individuals under this pathway would meet the LPR residence requirement for naturalization after eight years. S. 1639 proposed pathways to LPR status for Z nonimmigrants, including a DREAM Act pathway with specific requirements. It addressed eligibility for higher education benefits, allowing access to federal student loans and Work-Study programs. The bill did not fully repeal the IIRIRA Section 505 restriction on state provision of post-secondary educational benefits but made it ineffective for Z nonimmigrants. Other legislation on unauthorized childhood arrivals in the 110th Congress included S. 1348, which was not successful. After an unsuccessful cloture vote on S. 1639, the Senate considered a stand-alone DREAM Act bill, S. 2205. In the Senate, a cloture vote on S. 1639 was unsuccessful, leading to consideration of a stand-alone DREAM Act bill, S. 2205. Supporters debated whether to pass the stand-alone bill for unauthorized childhood arrivals or pursue broader immigration reform. The House approved a DREAM Act amendment in the 111th Congress, while the Senate rejected a similar motion. The House passed the DREAM Act amendment to H.R. 5281, establishing a three-stage process for individuals to obtain LPR status. It included conditional nonimmigrant status, extension of status, and eventual LPR status with naturalization eligibility after three years. The DREAM Act amendment to H.R. 5281 established a three-stage process for individuals to obtain LPR status, including eligibility requirements and surcharges on applications for conditional status. Unlike earlier bills, it included specific criteria such as age, biometric data submission, tax liability satisfaction, and English proficiency. The House-passed DREAM Act amendment allowed individuals meeting its criteria to be eligible for federal student aid, including loans and Work-Study programs. DHS later announced the DACA initiative, offering deferred action for certain individuals brought to the US as children. President Obama called on Congress to pass DREAM Act legislation and announced the DACA initiative, offering temporary relief from deportation for young individuals. The eligibility criteria for an initial DACA grant included being under age 31 on June 15, 2012, under age 16 at the time of entry into the United States, continuously residing in the US since June 15, 2007, physically present in the US on June 15, 2012, not in lawful status on that date, meeting education or military service requirements, and not having certain criminal convictions. To request DACA, individuals had to be at least age 15 and submit specific forms and fees to USCIS. Employment authorization could be granted to those with deferred action if they could show an economic need. Initial requests for DACA are no longer accepted, but previous recipients can still apply for renewals every two years. To renew DACA, recipients must meet specific criteria, including continuous residence in the US, no felony convictions, and submission of forms and fees. The Senate passed an immigration reform bill with DREAM Act provisions in the 113th Congress, but the House did not consider it. The Senate passed the immigration reform bill (S. 744) on a 68-32 vote, proposing a general legalization program and a special DREAM Act pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals. Applicants would have applied for registered provisional immigrant (RPI) status, meeting specific requirements for a six-year initial period. The Senate passed immigration reform bill S. 744, proposing a general legalization program and a special DREAM Act pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals. RPI status could have been granted to DACA recipients with streamlined procedures, leading to a special pathway to LPR status for those meeting specific criteria after being in RPI status for at least five years. The Senate passed immigration reform bill S. 744, proposing a general legalization program and a special DREAM Act pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals. S. 744 would have authorized DHS to adopt streamlined procedures for DACA recipients to obtain LPR status. Restrictions on federal student aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act for RPIs who entered the US before age 16 would have been placed. The bill aimed to repeal Section 505 of IIRIRA, which limits educational benefits for undocumented aliens. DACA was terminated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on September 5, 2017, but legal challenges allowed previous DACA recipients to continue submitting requests. New DACA requests were initially halted but later allowed due to court rulings. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the DACA rescission on November 12, 2019. Past DACA recipients with expired or terminated grants can still apply for renewal. USCIS reinstated the late renewal policy for expired grants. There were approximately 669,080 active DACA recipients as of April 30, 2019, with 80% born in Mexico and a median age of 25. As of July 31, 2019, USCIS reported that out of the 822,063 individuals granted DACA, 73,043 became LPRs and 4,448 became citizens. This data can be compared with estimates of the DACA-eligible population, which is around 1,307,000 unauthorized individuals. According to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), around 1,307,000 unauthorized individuals were immediately eligible for DACA in 2016. In 2018, MPI estimated that 1,302,000 individuals met the DACA eligibility requirements. Discussions on unauthorized childhood arrivals took place following the DACA rescission announcement in 2017. In 2018, discussions on unauthorized childhood arrivals included proposals for legal status for DACA-eligible individuals, enhancements to border security, and changes to the permanent immigration system. Both the Senate and the House considered legislation containing provisions for DACA recipients and unauthorized childhood arrivals. In the 115th Congress, multiple proposals for immigration relief for unauthorized childhood arrivals were considered but not passed. The Senate rejected motions to invoke cloture on three immigration proposals in February 2018. Subtitle A of S.Amdt. 1955, the USA Act of 2018, aimed to establish a mechanism for certain childhood arrivals who were inadmissible or deportable from the United States. Arrivals in temporary protected status (TPS) or inadmissible to the United States could potentially become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) through a two-stage process. Conditional LPR status would be granted in stage 1, with requirements such as continuous presence in the U.S. since December 31, 2013, initial entry before age 18, no inadmissibility issues, and meeting educational criteria. S.Amdt. 1955 aimed to grant conditional LPR status to DACA recipients, with biometric and biographic data submission for security purposes. In stage 2, a conditional LPR would need to meet additional requirements to have the conditional status removed and become a full-fledged LPR. These requirements include achieving a college degree, serving in the uniformed services, or having valid employment for at least three years. Other requirements include submitting biometric and biographic data for security checks. The bill outlines requirements for conditional LPR status, including security checks, English language proficiency, and civics knowledge. Conditional LPRs could apply to have the condition removed after meeting stage 2 requirements, which include education, military service, or employment. Applicants meeting all requirements upfront could skip conditional status and be granted full LPR status directly. The Senate considered two amendments, S.Amdt. 1955 and S.Amdt. 1958, related to immigration reform. S.Amdt. 1955 did not include provisions for federal student aid and was not passed. S.Amdt. 1958, the Immigration Security and Opportunity Act, proposed a two-stage pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals, with additional eligibility requirements compared to S.Amdt. 1955. The Immigration Security and Opportunity Act proposed a two-stage pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals, with additional eligibility requirements. Non-DACA recipients needed continuous presence in the US since June 15, 2012, initial entry before age 18, no inadmissibility under specified grounds, educational requirements, enlistment in the Armed Forces, maximum age requirement, and federal tax liability satisfaction. All stage 1 applicants had to submit biometric and biographic data for background checks. Conditional LPR status would be valid for seven years. The Immigration Security and Opportunity Act proposed a two-stage pathway to LPR status for certain childhood arrivals, with additional eligibility requirements. Conditional LPR status required meeting stage 2 requirements such as obtaining a college degree, serving in the uniformed services, or meeting employment criteria. Other requirements included background checks, English language proficiency, civics knowledge, and federal tax liability satisfaction. S.Amdt. 1958 proposed changes to the Immigration Security and Opportunity Act, including counting time in conditional status towards LPR status for naturalization purposes. It also imposed restrictions on parents of beneficiaries obtaining LPR status and did not address federal student aid or Section 505 of IIRIRA. The Senate voted against invoking cloture on the amendment on February 15, 2018. The Senate voted against invoking cloture on S.Amdt. 1958 on February 15, 2018. S.Amdt. 1959, the SECURE and SUCCEED Act, included provisions for unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain LPR status through a three-stage process. Requirements for conditional temporary resident status included continuous presence in the US since June 15, 2012, initial entry before age 16, birthdate after June 15, 1981, and no lawful status on June 15, 2012. The SECURE and SUCCEED Act proposed a three-stage process for unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain LPR status. Requirements for conditional temporary resident status included continuous presence in the US since June 15, 2012, initial entry before age 16, birthdate after June 15, 1981, and meeting educational or military requirements based on age. Applicants needed to submit biometric and biographic data for background checks and satisfy federal tax liability. Additional requirements for conditional status included acknowledging terms of violation. Conditional temporary resident status under the SECURE and SUCCEED Act required acknowledgment of potential ineligibility for immigration benefits if terms were violated. The status was valid for seven years or until age 18, with the possibility of a five-year extension by meeting educational or military criteria. After seven years, applicants could apply for LPR status with additional requirements. The S.Amdt. 1959 imposed stricter requirements for individuals applying for LPR status, including compliance with conditional temporary resident status, background checks, English language and civics requirements, and tax payment. Beneficiaries would have to wait at least seven years after obtaining LPR status to apply for naturalization. In 1959, a parent or family member of an alien granted conditional temporary resident status or LPR status could not gain status based on a family relationship. The Senate did not pass S.Amdt. 1959 in February 2018. In June 2018, the House considered immigration reform bills for unauthorized childhood arrivals, but they did not establish new mechanisms for LPR status. One bill would have provided DACA recipients with temporary status, while another bill would have enabled eligible individuals. The Securing America's Future Act of 2018 (H.R. 4760) proposed a new temporary immigration status called contingent nonimmigrant (CNI) status for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals. To be eligible for CNI status, individuals would have needed valid work authorization from the DACA initiative, be enrolled in an educational institution full-time, or have earned a high school diploma. H.R. 4760 proposed a new temporary immigration status called contingent nonimmigrant (CNI) status for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals. Applicants would need to submit biometric and biographic data, pass security and law enforcement checks, and pay a border security fee. CNI status would be granted for three years, with the possibility of extension, allowing for employment authorization and travel outside the U.S. without a pathway to LPR status. The House voted not to pass H.R. 4760 on June 21, 2018. The related Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018 (H.R. 6136) would have established a less restrictive process for certain unauthorized childhood arrivals to obtain CNI status compared to H.R. 4760. It would not have required applicants to be under age 31 at the time of filing the CNI application and would have granted CNI status for six years, extendable in six-year increments. H.R. 6136 would have allowed contingent nonimmigrants to obtain employment authorization and travel outside the U.S. CNIs meeting certain criteria could become LPRs through adjustment of status provisions. To adjust to LPR status, individuals must have been inspected and admitted or paroled into the U.S. and be admissible for permanent residence. H.R. 6136 would have allowed contingent nonimmigrants to obtain employment authorization and travel outside the U.S. CNIs meeting certain criteria could become LPRs through adjustment of status provisions. The bill aimed to consider CNIs who have been in that status for five years as inspected and admitted into the United States, exempting them from certain grounds of inadmissibility related to unlawful presence and lack of proper documentation. The bill H.R. 6136 did not address all disqualifications for adjustment of status, like unauthorized employment. It offered limited permanent immigration relief and was not passed by the House. Legislative activity on unauthorized childhood arrivals is now focused on the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 (H.R. 6), which includes provisions for Dream Act and American Promise Act. H.R. 6, passed by the House on June 4, 2019, establishes a pathway for certain childhood arrivals to become LPRs through a two-stage process. Requirements include continuous presence in the U.S. for at least four years, initial entry before age 18, meeting educational criteria, and no inadmissibility issues. The bill H.R. 6 provides a pathway for childhood arrivals to become LPRs through a two-stage process. Requirements include continuous presence in the U.S. for at least four years, meeting educational criteria, and no inadmissibility issues. DACA recipients who meet renewal requirements would undergo streamlined application procedures. Conditional LPR status would be valid for 10 years, with a second set of requirements to remove the conditional basis and become a full-fledged LPR. The bill H.R. 6 outlines a two-stage process for childhood arrivals to become LPRs. Stage 2 requirements include biometric data submission, background checks, English language proficiency, and civics knowledge. Conditional LPRs can apply to have their status removed after meeting these requirements. H.R. 6 outlines a two-stage process for childhood arrivals to become LPRs. Conditional status can be removed after meeting stage 2 requirements, counting towards LPR status for naturalization. The bill also grants full LPR status directly to applicants meeting all requirements initially. It does not restrict beneficiaries' eligibility for federal student aid and does not repeal Section 505 of IIRIRA. The Trump Administration's efforts to end the DACA program have influenced the passage of H.R. 6 in the House in the 116th Congress. The passage of H.R. 6 in the House in the 116th Congress is a significant development, as it is the latest bill to grant LPR status to unauthorized childhood arrivals. The question remains whether this bill or another measure will be enacted into law to provide legal status to DACA recipients or unauthorized childhood arrivals."
