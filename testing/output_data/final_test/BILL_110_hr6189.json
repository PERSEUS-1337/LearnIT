    "content": "The \"Colorado Charter Forest Act of 2008\" includes provisions for a charter forest demonstration project in Colorado, independent scientific review, community management council, stewardship contracting authority, and authorization of appropriations. The Act defines key terms such as Charter Forest demonstration project, community management council, covered National Forest System lands, independent scientific panel, and Secretary. It establishes a Charter Forest demonstration project for National Forest System lands in Colorado. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a Charter Forest demonstration project in Colorado to increase community involvement in managing National Forest System lands. The project will evaluate methods to improve the management and health of these lands and will last for 10 years. During the 10-year Charter Forest demonstration project in Colorado, the Secretary of Agriculture will manage National Forest System lands under existing laws and regulations. SEC. 4. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND MONITORING. The Secretary will assemble a scientific panel to assess the sustainability of National Forest System lands, considering factors like forest health, fire risk, insect infestation, biodiversity, and economic productivity. The panel must submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within one year. The panel will prepare a monitoring plan to track the charter forest demonstration project's implementation. After five years and completion of the project, the panel will revise the assessment and evaluate the project's impacts on sustainability, insect infestation, and wildfire susceptibility. The panel will monitor the charter forest demonstration project's impact on sustainability, insect infestation, and wildfire susceptibility on National Forest System lands. SEC. 5. COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. The Secretary will establish a community management council for the charter forest demonstration project to advise on environmental, economic, and social issues related to National Forest System lands. The council will assist in setting management priorities and project development, consisting of 13 appointed members. The Secretary will establish a community management council for the charter forest demonstration project with 13 appointed members. Members should represent various interests and have the ability to work on complex land management issues. The Forest Service Regional Forester for Colorado serves as an ex officio member of the council, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, non-Federal employee members serve without compensation. The council may request staff assistance from the Secretary, meetings must be announced in advance and open to the public, and the council must maintain records. The council maintains meeting records and makes them available for public inspection. The council is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. RELATION TO NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969. The Secretary will develop a \"Charter\" for the covered National Forest System lands with the advice and cooperation of the council. The Charter will address land and resource management goals and objectives, including desired landscape conditions and management outcomes. The Secretary will establish a Charter for National Forest System lands with input from the council, outlining management goals, guidelines, and monitoring plans. Legal requirements dictate that projects must align with the Charter, which becomes operational upon approval by the Secretary and council majority. If a project aligns with the Charter, it can proceed under the demonstration project. The Secretary will not need to conduct additional analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for projects consistent with the Act and Charter. Inconsistent projects must be revised to align with the Charter or have the Charter amended by the Secretary and council majority for approval. If an individual or entity disagrees with the Secretary's determination on project compatibility with the Charter, they can file a predecisional objection. The Secretary cannot proceed with the project unless it is revised or approved by the council majority. The Charter can be amended as provided in subsection (e)(2)(B). SEC. 7. PREDECISIONAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary will establish a predecisional review process for site-specific projects on National Forest System lands during the Charter forest demonstration project. The process includes providing notice of proposed decisions, allowing requests for review within 30 days by residents of Colorado, and completing the review within the specified timeframe. The predecisional review process for site-specific projects on National Forest System lands in Colorado must be completed within 30 days of the request being submitted. The Secretary has the authority to exempt decisions responding to unexpected or serious events from the review rules. Individuals or entities must exhaust the review process before challenging a project in court under the demonstration project. In predecisional review of management activities on National Forest System lands in Colorado, deference must be given to the Secretary's expert judgment on scientific data. The demonstration project is exempt from Forest Service decision-making and appeals reform. SEC. 8. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTING AUTHORITY. The Secretary may enter into stewardship contracts for National Forest System lands to achieve land management goals. These contracts are in addition to existing authorized contracts. SEC. 9. RETENTION AND USE OF RECEIPTS. During the Charter forest demonstration project, the Secretary retains proceeds from timber sales and permits for National Forest System lands. The funds are used for projects prioritizing forest health, insect eradication, and environmental restoration. The Secretary consults with the council in selecting projects. Authorization of appropriations is provided. Authorization of $5,000,000 annually from 2009 to 2019 for the Secretary to implement the Act. Congress suggests reducing the Forest Service land acquisition budget by an equal amount to offset the funds appropriated for the Act."
