    "content": "The 2000 presidential election deadlock led to legislative action in Congress to address voting system issues. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) was enacted to provide federal funding for election reform. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), also known as P.L. 107-252, provided federal funding to states for modern voting equipment and election administration improvements following the 2000 Presidential election controversy. HAVA established payment and grant programs, created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and promoted accessibility, student participation, and research in the electoral process. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established to oversee payment and grant programs, testing and certification of voting systems, and provide guidance to state and local election officials. It set requirements for states to offer provisional ballots, post sample ballots at polling places, enforce voter identification standards, and ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities in federal elections. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) set requirements for accessibility in federal elections, including providing properly equipped voting machines, manual auditing, alternative-language accessibility, and maintaining a statewide voter registration list. It also mandated the EAC to develop voting system guidelines for states to use voluntarily, prohibited rulemaking by the EAC, and amended the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) to improve voting procedures for military and overseas citizens. Many bills have been introduced to amend HAVA since its enactment, with only minor changes being made. The MOVE Act in 2009 established new military and overseas voting requirements under UOCAVA and authorized appropriations to achieve compliance. Local election officials generally support HAVA, although some provisions, like provisional ballots, were initially controversial. Issues discussed include the role of the EAC, HAVA funding and requirements, voter registration, voter identification, UOCAVA, the Voting Rights Act, and election technology, including cybersecurity. The report also covers legislative activity in the 114th Congress. Before HAVA, federal election administration was handled by the Office of Election Administration (OEA) of the Federal Election Commission (FEC). HAVA replaced OEA with the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), an independent federal agency with two boards representing state and local officials. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee federal election administration. The EAC works with various organizations and experts to develop voting system standards, provide technical support, and issue guidelines for voting systems. The EAC does not have rule-making authority but carries out grant programs, testing, certification, and studies election issues. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to oversee federal election administration. EAC does not have rule-making authority but enforces HAVA requirements through civil actions by the U.S. Attorney General and state-established grievance procedures. There was debate over whether EAC should be a permanent agency, with concerns about federal involvement in state responsibilities. HAVA authorized EAC appropriations for FY2003-FY2005 without a sunset provision. Bills have been introduced to address EAC's permanency. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) was established by the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) without a sunset provision. Bills have been introduced to reauthorize or eliminate the EAC, but none have been enacted. The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS) has been a prominent critic, calling for the EAC's elimination due to concerns about it evolving into a regulatory body. Local election officials, however, appear to be more supportive. Several bills affecting the EAC's authorization have been introduced in recent Congresses, with some calling for the termination of the agency. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 195 would eliminate the EAC and transfer its functions to the FEC. The EAC was established by HAVA as a bipartisan agency with four commissioners nominated by the President. Commissioners must have expertise in election administration and serve a four-year term. Commission actions require approval from at least three members. Vacancies occurred from 2011 to 2015, with new commissioners sworn in. A consensus emerged after the 2000 election to address election problems. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was enacted after the 2000 election to address various election issues. It facilitated the replacement of outdated voting technology and established technical requirements for voting systems. The act also sparked controversy surrounding election technology and administration. These issues continue to be debated, with cybersecurity concerns adding new urgency. States have different voting practices and requirements. HAVA sets requirements for voting systems used in federal elections, including error correction, accessibility for disabilities, manual auditing, alternative languages, and voter privacy. It led to the elimination of outdated voting systems like lever machines and punch cards in the US. Most jurisdictions in the United States use optical scan systems for voting, where voters mark choices on paper ballots read by electronic counting devices. There are also direct recording electronic (DRE) systems where voters mark choices via a computer interface. Electronic memory systems are used in about 60% of states to meet accessibility requirements, with almost half of all states using them as the primary voting system. Hand-counted paper ballots are used in some polling places in about 20% of states. DREs constituted about 70% of all voting equipment used in the 2014 election due to the need for multiple units in jurisdictions using them as the primary voting system. The development of voluntary technical standards for computer-based voting systems began in the 1980s with the FEC's participation. HAVA mandated the creation and regular updates of these standards by the EAC, with assistance from NIST. These standards, now known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG), address HAVA voting-system requirements and other technology aspects. The process involves drafting by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee with NIST support, public comment, review by EAC boards, revision by the EAC, and adoption by vote of the commissioners. The Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG) were first approved by the EAC in December 2005, with an update in March 2015. Most states require systems to be tested for conformance with EAC guidelines. HAVA does not mandate federal testing but gives EAC responsibility for voluntary testing and certification. Some voting systems have been certified by the EAC and are used in about half the states, but concerns remain about the expense and complexity of the certification process. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 addressed voter registration problems by requiring computerization, integration, maintenance, security, and accuracy of voter registration lists at the state level. Unlike voting systems, HAVA does not mandate EAC to develop technical guidelines for registration systems. The EAC provided general guidance to states in 2005, without specific technical standards. A study by the National Research Council in 2010 offered detailed recommendations for improving state voter registration databases. HAVA established payment and grant programs for election administration improvements, including expedited formula payments for states to replace punchcard and lever machine systems. Administered by the General Services Administration, these payments help states meet the act's requirements and improve general election administration. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established payment and grant programs for election administration improvements, including formula payments to states to meet requirements and improve election administration. It also provides payments for accessibility, protection and advocacy systems, research on voting technology, pilot programs, and student programs. Administered by various agencies such as the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established payment and grant programs for election administration improvements, including formula payments to states to meet requirements and improve election administration. Administered by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), it includes programs to recruit college and high school students as poll workers, provide grants for the National Student and Parent Mock Election, and fund EAC operations with appropriations from Congress. States and territories were eligible to receive payments once they published a state plan in the Federal Register, followed by a public comment period and certification with the EAC. The initial $2.3 billion appropriations were distributed to states by December 2005. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) established payment and grant programs for election administration improvements, including formula payments to states. Funding was distributed to states by December 2005, with additional appropriations in FY2008 and FY2009. For FY2016, $9.6 million was provided for the EAC, with $1.5 million transferred to NIST for testing guidelines. The President's budget request for FY2017 includes $9.8 million for the EAC. In recent elections, issues with voter registration systems have gained prominence, including concerns about integrity, accuracy, fraud, and abuse. Developments impacting these issues include the use of electronic pollbooks, online voter registration, and initiatives for automatic voter registration. The use of information technology in elections has expanded beyond traditional uses, with the development of electronic pollbooks (EPBs) improving voter registration processes. EPBs can reduce waiting times, check-in problems, and errors, while also facilitating alternative voting procedures and identity verification. The use of electronic pollbooks (EPBs) in elections can improve voter registration processes and identity verification. However, unresolved issues include performance data, technical standards, security concerns, and fraud prevention. The Presidential Commission on Election Administration recommended transitioning to EPBs and utilizing other IT solutions like online voter registration. As of June 2016, 31 states plus the District of Columbia offer online voter registration. As of June 14, 2016, 31 states and the District of Columbia offer online voter registration, with seven more states planning to implement such systems. The widespread acceptance of online voter registration is due to cost reduction and increased accuracy compared to traditional paper-based methods. In the United States, voter registration is primarily the responsibility of individual citizens, but there is a movement in some states to shift this responsibility to state governments. Automatic voter registration is a method used by some states to register citizens to vote if they have interacted with government agencies. Several states have adopted laws for automatic voter registration, and bills have been introduced in many others. This process aims to increase voter registration by using existing demographic and geographic information. States are implementing automatic voter registration using computers, which are vulnerable to unauthorized access. Cybersecurity measures are necessary to prevent attacks on election administration systems. The security of electronic voting systems has been a concern since the 1960s, especially with the adoption of DRE systems after HAVA requirements. DRE systems offer usability and efficiency but raise security controversies. Electronic voting systems, particularly DRE machines, have raised security concerns due to the inability to verify voter choices stored in electronic memory. Unlike paper ballots, DRE machines do not allow for independent verification of voter selections, posing a greater security risk overall. Many states have enacted requirements for paper ballot records that can be verified by voters and used in recounts to address concerns about electronic voting security. Some states use BMDs or configure DREs to produce verifiable paper records (VVPAT) for voters to check before casting their ballot. DREs are the standard equipment for polling-place voting in some jurisdictions in 24 states, with varying use of VVPATs. Some jurisdictions use DRE devices without VVPAT as their primary voting systems. About 20% of jurisdictions with DREs use VVPAT. VVPAT can counter vote-changing malware but relies on voters checking before casting ballots. Optical scan systems are preferred for cybersecurity as paper ballots can be verified and recounted by machine or hand. Remote voting, including absentee or mail-in balloting, allows for various Internet-based methods such as electronic provision of blank ballots or end-to-end Internet voting. While the latter is not commonly used in public elections in the United States due to security concerns, it is utilized in private and some other countries. The use of Internet voting in federal elections has been studied and tested, but security concerns have led to its termination in 2015. While all states offer UOCAVA voters the option to receive blank ballots electronically, only a few states allow for the electronic return of ballots. However, no states have implemented end-to-end Internet voting for federal elections due to cybersecurity risks. The potential vulnerability of voting to cyberattacks includes risks such as disruption of access, compromise of ballot secrecy, and authentication challenges for online voters. The acquisition of election technologies from private-sector companies by election administrators is fragmented, uncertain, and resistant to innovation due to variations in state and local requirements, episodic elections, fixed customer base, and uncertain funding. The fragmented and uncertain market for election technologies led to the use of obsolete voting technology, causing issues in the 2000 presidential election. The Help America Vote Act (HAVA) provided almost $3.3 billion to states, resulting in most states updating their voting systems. By the end of FY2015, 89% of funds had been spent, with concerns raised about aging technology. The 2014 Presidential Commission report highlighted concerns about aging voting systems purchased with HAVA funds, which are approaching or exceeding their projected lifespans. These outdated systems are at risk of technical issues and cyberattacks, with estimated costs for replacement systems potentially surpassing unspent HAVA payments. Between the enactment of HAVA and the 2016 presidential election, concerns were raised about foreign influence in federal elections, particularly regarding foreign ownership of election technology companies. The consolidation of the voting-system market in 2010 led to the dissolution of Premier Election Systems, with ES&S acquiring some of its assets. Dominion Voting, a Canadian firm, acquired resources divested by ES&S and later acquired Sequoia Voting Systems. The entrance of Dominion into the U.S. market was not highly debated, but other attempted acquisitions and mergers involving foreign-owned companies have been more controversial. Foreign-owned companies have been controversial in the context of foreign influence in US elections. Intrusions into election systems in 2016 raised concerns, with the Director of National Intelligence stating that Russian government directed compromises of emails from US political organizations to interfere with the election process. Most intrusions originated from servers operated by a Russian company. The Director stated that most cases of intrusions into election systems originated from servers operated by a Russian company, but it is not possible to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. Cybercriminals and adversaries may target election infrastructure to obtain personal information on voters. The U.S. election administration practices, with decentralized and diverse infrastructure and layered defenses, create substantial barriers to intrusions with widespread impact. Many observers believe the risk of cyber intrusions impacting election results is minimal due to the layered defenses in place. However, there is concern that a persistent adversary like a nation-state could potentially conduct undetectable cyberattacks that compromise election information or processes, such as altering voter registration lists. Cyberattacks could impact elections by deleting voter registration lists, spreading disinformation, disrupting information systems, and modifying electronic vote counts. These attacks could erode public confidence and potentially influence election outcomes, especially in close contests. Both DRE and optical scan voting systems are vulnerable to such attacks. Defensive measures against cyberattacks on voting systems include prevention, detection, response, and recovery. While prevention measures like meeting technical standards and tampering prevention procedures are important, experts now recognize that they are not sufficient. Adversaries with enough motivation and resources can overcome these measures, potentially manipulating vote counts to change election outcomes. Successful attacks may go undetected for months, posing a serious threat to election integrity. Some experts propose that election systems should have ways of auditing results independently of voting software to detect and respond to intrusions. This can be achieved by requiring all voting systems to produce paper ballots for verification by voters, serving as the official record for recounts. Manual audits can ensure the election outcome is accurate despite cyberattacks or equipment malfunctions. Various criteria have been suggested for triggering audits in election systems, with some advocating for routine manual audits of a subset of cast ballots. However, opinions on this matter remain controversial among election professionals, with some arguing that layered security measures can sufficiently protect DRE and optical scan systems from tampering. The Department of Homeland Security has offered assistance to states in enhancing the security of their election systems in response to documented breaches and security concerns. The Department of Homeland Security has formed a working group with state election officials to address election system security. Federal intelligence agencies are also involved in countering foreign threats to U.S. elections. Some suggest designating state election systems as critical infrastructure, while others are concerned about state control implications. States vary in voter identification requirements, with some enacting laws for photo ID, leading to court challenges and rulings. In the 109th Congress, legislation was passed to require photo identification and proof of citizenship for voting in federal elections, but no further action followed. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Indiana statute requiring photo ID for voting, sparking debate on voter fraud, ID restrictiveness, and disenfranchisement risks. Members of the uniformed services and U.S. citizens living abroad can register and vote absentee in federal elections under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). The law is administered by the Secretary of Defense, with amendments made following the 2000 presidential election controversy in Florida. Additional provisions were included in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2002 and the Help America Vote Act. Minor revisions were made in 2005 and 2007, with further updates in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2010. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was challenged in a 2013 case by the U.S. Supreme Court in Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, specifically targeting Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA. These sections required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get approval from the Justice Department or the U.S. District Court for any changes to the election process. In Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, deeming it outdated. This rendered Section 5 inoperable until Congress establishes a new coverage formula. Legislation has been introduced in Congress to amend the VRA and add a new formula for coverage. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to amend voting laws such as NVRA, HAVA, UOCAVA, and others. These bills propose changes to voter registration, voting systems, absentee voting, and election auditing. They also include provisions to reauthorize the EAC, provide voter registration information to 12th graders, transfer election administration functions to the FEC, require early voting and measures to reduce waiting times at polling places, provide voting information to federal prisoners upon release, and amend the Voting Rights Act to establish a new coverage formula. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to amend voting laws, including changes to voter registration, absentee voting, and election auditing. Proposed amendments include requiring evidence of citizenship for federal mail voter registration, securing voting rights for individuals released from incarceration, prohibiting state election officials from participating in campaigns, allowing all eligible voters to vote by mail in federal elections, and establishing open primaries for U.S. House and Senate candidates. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to amend voting laws, including changes to voter registration, absentee voting, and election auditing. Proposed amendments include establishing election day as a federal holiday, requiring automatic voter registration through motor vehicle authorities, providing paid leave for voting in federal elections, allowing same-day voter registration, prohibiting photo identification requirements for voting, and permitting sworn written statements for voter identification. Additionally, states would be required to allow 16-year-olds to pre-register to vote.

Other proposed amendments include changing Election Day to the first weekend in November, prohibiting straight-party voting, providing payments to states to replace voting systems, and restoring voting rights of unincarcerated individuals convicted of most crimes. The bills also aim to amend HAVA and NVRA to prohibit voter identification that has associated costs for the voter, require states to institute automatic registration of voters, correction of registration information at the polling place, and online registration, provide EAC grants to assist states in implementation, require states to provide voter registration forms at naturalization proceedings, permit postage-free voting by mail for all voters, require voting systems to use voter-verifiable paper ballots, and establish other election administration requirements. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to amend voting laws, including changes to voter registration, absentee voting, and election auditing. Proposed amendments include establishing election day as a federal holiday, requiring automatic voter registration through motor vehicle authorities, providing paid leave for voting in federal elections, allowing same-day voter registration, and protecting the rights of Indian and Native Alaskan voters. Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress aim to amend voting laws, including changes to voter registration, absentee voting, and election auditing. Proposed amendments include same-day voter registration, protecting the rights of Indian and Native Alaskan voters, online voter registration, early voting or no-excuse absentee voting, modifying change of address procedures, designating federal election day as a holiday, establishing procedures for automatic voter registration, and expanding voting residency guarantee for military family members. Several committees in the 114th Congress held hearings on election administration issues, including cybersecurity and funding for election programs. No funds have been allocated for state election administration programs since FY2010, which could be used for updating voting equipment and enhancing election integrity. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) oversees the use of funds for election programs, including upgrading voting equipment and enhancing security. After a period without commissioners, new appointments were made in 2014 and 2015. The integration of information technology in elections has improved processes but also poses cybersecurity challenges, especially leading up to the 2016 election. The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) faces challenges related to cybersecurity and aging technology. Legislation to eliminate or reauthorize the EAC has been introduced in Congress. The agency has been criticized for various reasons, but some believe it is necessary for improving election administration. Voter identification and registration management are contentious issues, with some state laws facing legal challenges. The FY2003 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.5 billion for election reform programs authorized by HAVA, including funds for election administration improvement and voting system replacement. GSA disbursed the funds to states in June 2003 based on voting-age population, with payments made to replace punchcard and lever voting systems. In FY2003, $1.5 billion was allocated for election reform programs under HAVA, including funds for election administration improvement and voting system replacement. The FY2004 budget request included $500 million for EAC requirements payments and administration, with no specific funds requested for other programs. The final omnibus appropriations bill, P.L. 108-199, signed into law on January 23, 2004, contained over $1.5 billion for election reform, including $1.0 billion for requirements. The FY2005 budget request included $65 million for election reform, with $40 million for requirements payments, $10 million for EAC administrative expenses, $5 million for protection and advocacy programs, and $10 million for accessibility payments. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY2005 included $14 million for the EAC, $15 million for disability voting access, $200,000 for the student parent mock election program, and $200,000 for protection and advocacy systems. The FY2006 budget request included $17.6 million for the EAC, $5 million for protection and advocacy programs, and $9.9 million for accessibility payments. The final appropriation (P.L. 109-115) contained $14.2 million for the EAC, with $13.5 million and $8.6 million for the HHS programs. The FY2007 request included $16.9 million for the EAC, $4.83 million for protection and advocacy programs, and $10.89 million for accessibility payments. The 109th Congress adjourned without enacting an appropriations measure, providing temporary funding until February 15, 2007. The FY2007 budget for the EAC was provided via a continuing resolution until February 15, 2007. Funding for FY2008 was ultimately provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2008, with $16.53 million allocated for the EAC. The FY2008 budget for the EAC, enacted on December 16, 2007 (P.L. 110-161), provided $16.53 million, including funds for NIST and a student and parent mock election program. FY2009 appropriations included $16.68 million for the EAC, with $4 million for NIST, and additional funding for protection and advocacy programs and disability access. The omnibus bill (P.L. 111-8) passed on March 11, 2009, provided $18 million for the EAC, with allocations for NIST and the College Program. The omnibus bill allocated $4 million to NIST, $750,000 for the College Program, and $300,000 for the high school mock election program. It also provided $100 million for requirements payments to states, $5 million for voting technology research grants, and $1 million for a pilot program testing voting systems. Additionally, $12.2 million was allocated for disability access and $5.3 million for protection and advocacy programs. In FY2010, the President's budget requested $16.5 million for the EAC and $106 million for election reform payments to states. The House and Senate bills would have provided similar funding for the EAC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 allocated $18.0 million for the EAC, with funds also designated for NIST, the Help America Vote College Program, and mock elections. Additionally, $75 million was provided for election reform programs, including payments to states, research grants for voting technology, and grants for voting system testing. The omnibus bill also included funding for disability access and protection and advocacy programs. The omnibus bill allocated $12.15 million for disability access and $5.26 million for protection and advocacy programs in FY2011. The President's budget request included $16.8 million for the EAC, with $3.25 million to be transferred to NIST. It also included funding for accessibility payments administered by HHS. The bill terminated EAC \"election reform grants\" and provided no funding for certain programs, citing unspent EAC payments to states and accrued interest discrepancies. Funding for federal agencies, including the EAC, was provided at FY2010 levels. In FY2011, funding for federal agencies, including the EAC, was provided at FY2010 levels through continuing resolutions. H.R. 1473 allocated $16.3 million for the EAC, with $3.25 million to be transferred to NIST, but no new funding for election reform programs. For FY2012, the President's budget requested $13.7 million for the EAC, resulting in a 23% reduction in operating funds from FY2011. No funding was included for HAVA-authorized programs and accessibility payments. In FY2013, the EAC received $11.5 million in funding, with $2.75 million allocated to NIST and $1.3 million for the Office of the Inspector General. The funding was initially provided under a continuing resolution until March 2013 when it was replaced by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013. The appropriations were reduced for all federal agencies due to the President's sequester order. The FY2014 appropriations for the EAC noted the $11.5 million funding before the sequester reduction. In FY2013, the EAC received $11.5 million in funding, with $2.75 million allocated to NIST. For FY2014, the President's budget requested $11.0 million for the EAC, with $2.75 million to be transferred to NIST. The House Committee recommended eliminating the EAC, while the Senate Committee proposed $11.0 million for the EAC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014 provided $10.0 million for the EAC, including $1.9 million for NIST. For FY2015, the President's budget requested $10.0 million for the EAC, with $1.9 million to be transferred to NIST. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended eliminating the EAC and provided no funding in H.R. 5016. Funding for the EAC was included in H.R. 83 with $10.0 million, $1.9 million for NIST. For FY2016, the President's budget requested $9.6 million for the EAC, with $1.5 million to be transferred to NIST. The House Committee included $4.8 million in H.R. 2995, while the Senate Committee included $9.6 million in S. 1910. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided $9.6 million for the EAC. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (H.R. 2029) allocated $9.6 million for the EAC, with $1.5 million designated for NIST."
