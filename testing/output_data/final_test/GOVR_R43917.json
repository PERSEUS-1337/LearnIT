    "content": "The TVPA defines \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" as sex trafficking induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or labor trafficking through force, fraud, or coercion for involuntary servitude. Experts agree that the prostitution of minors falls under this definition. This report analyzes trafficking-related provisions in legislation from the 114th Congress. The legislation discussed includes the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act, Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, Response to Victims of Child Sex Trafficking Act, SAVE Act, Human Trafficking Prevention Act, Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act, and other related bills passed by the House in 2015. The House passed multiple bills in 2015 related to human trafficking, including the Human Trafficking Detection Act, Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims Act, Strengthening Child Welfare Response Act, Human Trafficking Prioritization Act, International Megan's Law, and Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act. The House passed multiple bills in 2015 related to human trafficking. The Judiciary discussed issues raised in the bills, grouped under themes like victim restoration, criminal justice, domestic sex trafficking of children, and other issues. Human trafficking thrives on demand and vulnerability, with victims facing mental and physical abuse. U.S. anti-trafficking efforts focus on victim assistance. The U.S. anti-trafficking efforts focus on victim assistance, providing immediate services to help victims recover and reclaim their lives. Pending legislation aims to improve services for all victims, including foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, as well as victims of labor and sex trafficking. There is confusion over the eligibility of U.S. citizens for anti-trafficking grant programs and funding for programs targeting U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. Congress has allocated funding for programs targeting U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident victims of trafficking. The DOJ and HHS receive specified funding for trafficking victim services, with funding increasing from $20 million in FY2002 to $58 million in FY2015. HHS used all its money on services for noncitizen victims between FY2009 and FY2013. The Department of State's Trafficking in Persons Report recommended increased funding for agencies to provide services to noncitizen victims. NGOs emphasize the need for more funding for comprehensive services. The 113th Congress amended grant programs to include sex trafficking victims in victims services programs, such as the Violence Against Women Act. Additionally, grants to tribal governments were expanded to combat violence against women, including sex trafficking. The 113th Congress amended grant programs to include sex trafficking victims in victims services programs, such as the Violence Against Women Act. It also created a new tribal coalition grant program to enhance access to essential services for Indian women victimized by domestic and sexual violence, including sex trafficking. Additionally, pending legislation in the 114th Congress aims to enhance services to trafficking victims. The 114th Congress aims to enhance services for trafficking victims through various bills, including the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act of 2015 and the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2015. These bills focus on providing housing, establishing a national communications system for victims, and adding additional rights for victims of federal crime. Noncitizen victims of trafficking are certified by HHS to receive services. H.R. 181 and S. 178 clarify that U.S. citizen and LPR victims of trafficking are eligible for HHS-provided services without certification. Job Corps is a job training program for 16-to-24 year olds administered by DOL. H.R. 159 and S. 166 would amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which supersedes the Workforce Investment Act, now allows victims of severe trafficking to be eligible for the Job Corps program without meeting income requirements. Victims of trafficking may require medical care, psychological treatment, and job training for recovery. H.R. 159 and S. 166 aim to collect data on mandatory restitution orders, while S. 178 proposes forfeiture for perpetrators. H.R. 285 aims to permit the prosecution of entities, including websites, that advertise a person \"knowing\" in the context of combating human trafficking offenses. The United States has various statutes to combat human trafficking, but there is interest in enhancing investigations and prosecutions of offenders. Law enforcement targets criminal networks involved in trafficking, and S. 178 proposes forfeiture of property involved in trafficking offenses for victim restitution. H.R. 181 and S. 178 aim to expand prosecution abilities for entities advertising or benefiting from human trafficking, allowing wiretap orders for investigations and requiring clear evidence for prosecuting individuals transporting minors for illegal sexual activity. H.R. 159 and S. 166 clarify the U.S. Marshals Service's authority to assist in locating missing children. S. 178 imposes a $5,000 penalty on offenders of various crimes, with the funds going into a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund for victim support and grants. The bill aims to enhance victims' programming under the Victims of Child Abuse Act, prohibit fund money for abortions except in specific cases, transfer unobligated funds to the Crime Victims Fund annually, and address the demand for sex trafficking by focusing on penalizing buyers. H.R. 181 and S. 178 aim to prohibit patronizing or soliciting commercial sex, especially involving minors, without the need to prove knowledge or disregard of the victim's age. These bills also require the Attorney General to enhance law enforcement capabilities to prosecute individuals involved in child sex trafficking. The Innocence Lost National Initiative, a partnership between the FBI, DOJ, and NCMEC, focuses on recovering children from exploitation. S. 178 aims to combat child sex trafficking by establishing task forces, requiring annual reporting on arrest statistics, and creating a Cyber Crimes Center within ICE. This Center would have specialized units for child exploitation investigations, computer forensics, and cyber crimes. The CEIU within the Center would coordinate initiatives and investigations related to child exploitation, child pornography, child sex tourism, and forced child labor. The Cyber Crimes Center within ICE, as established by S. 178, would provide training, technical expertise, and support to law enforcement agencies for child exploitation prevention. It would also offer counseling services to ICE personnel, collect data on law enforcement activities, and oversee cyber security strategy to combat criminal enterprises on the Internet. The CCU would collaborate with the Department of Defense and National Association to Protect Children to recruit, train, and hire wounded veterans and transitioning service members to combat domestic sex trafficking of children in the United States. Child victims of sex trafficking are considered regardless of consent or age, with the exact number unknown due to challenges in defining the population. Most victims are U.S. citizens and LPRs, with factors like homelessness and child abuse fueling commercial sexual exploitation. The National Academy of Sciences identified various factors contributing to the risk of child sex trafficking, recommending collaboration among multiple stakeholders to address the issue. The 113th Congress passed legislation such as the E. Clay Shaw, Jr. Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act and the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act to combat sex trafficking of children. The 113th Congress passed legislation to combat child sex trafficking, including providing assistance to responders and identifying services for victims. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization act created a grant program for child sex trafficking victims. The 114th Congress is considering additional legislation on sex trafficking, touching on various policy areas. The House has passed bills to strengthen responses to trafficking, including prioritizing staff training on sexual exploitation and sex trafficking for the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. H.R. 469 reinforces requirements for state child welfare agencies to respond to child sex trafficking and labor trafficking victims. The Missing and Exploited Children's program provides support for missing and sexually exploited children. The Missing Children's Assistance Act mandates DOJ to grant funds to NCMEC for assisting in cases of missing and exploited children, including child sex trafficking. The E. Clay Shaw, Jr. Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act expanded NCMEC's role to provide technical assistance to law enforcement in identifying and recovering victims of child sex trafficking. This responsibility was added through amendments in P.L. 113-38. The Missing Children's Assistance Act, under P.L. 113-38, tasks NCMEC with operating a tipline for reporting Internet-related child sexual exploitation. H.R. 246 and S. 178 in the 114th Congress aim to amend the act by replacing \"child prostitution\" with \"child sex trafficking, including child prostitution.\" Additionally, H.R. 181 and S. 178 would amend the Crime Control Act of 1990 regarding reporting missing children to the NCIC Missing Person File. Under current federal law, law enforcement agencies cannot require a waiting period for missing child reports or remove entries based solely on age. Reports must include specific details and be entered into the NCIC within two hours. Within 60 days of a missing child report, law enforcement must update records with medical and dental information, collaborate with NCMEC, and follow appropriate search procedures. H.R. 181 and S. 178 propose including a recent photo in NCIC entries for missing children and notifying NCMEC of reports involving foster care children. S. 178 proposes changes to the verification and updating of records for missing children, including a shorter timeframe of 30 days and the requirement for a recent photograph. It also mandates state law enforcement agencies to notify NCMEC of reports involving missing children from foster care and allows for updating missing person records with new information during investigations. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act funds organizations to provide services for youth who have experienced homelessness. The Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims for Youth Trafficking Act of 2015 would amend provisions in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to prioritize research and projects addressing trafficking victimization effects on youth. The bills aim to amend the Street Outreach Program to include victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking, as defined by the TVPA. This expansion would encompass child and adult victims of sex and labor trafficking. Additionally, the Victims of Child Abuse Act supports improving investigation and prosecution of child abuse. The Victims of Child Abuse Act aims to enhance the investigation and prosecution of child abuse by expanding and improving Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs). These centers coordinate a multi-disciplinary response to child abuse to ensure victims and their families receive necessary support services without additional trauma. CACs are established in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with regional centers also being supported to enhance practices and expand their reach. H.R. 181 and S. 178 aim to expand the definition of \"child abuse\" for Children's Advocacy Centers (CACs) to include child pornography and human trafficking. The bills also require grantees to meet oversight and accountability requirements and disclose federal funding sources. Additionally, the bills enable grants for specialized programs to assist victims of child pornography and establish a Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund for grants and services. The HHS Secretary can use funds from the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund to award grants for CACs and victims programming under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety and well-being of children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention through CPS hotlines. Foster care children, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are vulnerable to trafficking, especially those who run away. Youth who run away from foster care are vulnerable to sex trafficking, but state and local child welfare agencies may struggle to respond due to various challenges. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 mandated a new role for state child welfare agencies in addressing child sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 requires state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. Agencies must collaborate with various entities and report information on missing children to NCMEC and law enforcement. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act of 2014 mandates state child welfare agencies to establish procedures for identifying and assisting victims of sex trafficking, including children and individuals up to age 26. HHS is required to form a national advisory committee on child sex trafficking to enhance the nation's response to domestic sex trafficking. The Strengthening the Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act of 2015 aims to reinforce these efforts through the state grants program under CAPTA. The bill H.R. 469 aims to enhance the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) by ensuring initial investigation and assessment of child trafficking, supporting states in developing procedures for child victims of labor trafficking, and adding provisions related to sex trafficking of children in state plans. Funding for CAPTA state grants is provided to improve child welfare systems and address child abuse and neglect. The bill H.R. 469 aims to enhance the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act by addressing the identification and assessment of child sex trafficking victims, training state child protective services representatives, and providing services for child victims. States would be required to report the number of identified sex and labor trafficking victims to HHS. Additionally, HHS would report to Congress on child sex and labor trafficking prevalence. The bill H.R. 469 aims to enhance the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act by addressing the identification and assessment of child sex trafficking victims, training state child protective services representatives, and providing services for child victims. HHS would report to Congress on the specific type and prevalence of severe forms of trafficking against children under the care of child welfare agencies, the practices used by states to identify and serve trafficked children, and any barriers in federal laws preventing the identification of such victims. The 2013 TVPA reauthorization law created a grant program for child sex trafficking victims, allocating funds for NGOs to provide services like counseling and shelter. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 would authorize grants for domestic child human trafficking programs. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 aims to provide grants to state or local governments to develop child human trafficking deterrence programs. These grants can be used for specialized training programs, law enforcement units dedicated to fighting child trafficking, and court programs for victims. The Department of Justice would oversee the grants and audit grantees annually to prevent misuse of funds. The bills aim to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of grant monies by directing the DOJ to audit grantees annually. The TVPA treats individuals under 18 involved in commercial sexual activity as victims eligible for specialized services. State laws may not always follow this approach, sometimes labeling minors as criminals instead of victims. Safe harbor provisions under the 2013 TVPA reauthorization protect individuals under 18 arrested for prostitution, treating them as victims of trafficking and referring them to service providers. H.R. 159 and S. 166 incentivize states to enact safe harbor laws treating minors involved in commercial sexual activity as trafficking victims, discouraging prosecution for prostitution, and diverting them to child protection services. Concerns exist about coordination among anti-trafficking agencies and efficient fund usage. The TVPA established protections for individuals under 18 involved in commercial sexual activity. The TVPA established the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking to coordinate anti-trafficking efforts across U.S. government agencies. H.R. 350 and S. 178 aim to direct the Task Force to develop a national strategy to combat human trafficking. The President's Interagency Task Force would review human trafficking in the U.S., focusing on prevention efforts and best practices for child trafficking. H.R. 350 and S. 178 also require a GAO report on law enforcement efforts and federal grant programs related to combating human trafficking. S. 178 proposes the creation of the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, composed of survivors to advise on federal anti-trafficking policies and programs. The Council would provide input to federal agencies, formulate recommendations, and produce an annual report on anti-trafficking efforts. Members would receive travel expenses and a per diem but would not be federal employees. The Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 166) would establish a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking, integrating federal, state, local, and tribal efforts. The Human Trafficking Prioritization Act (H.R. 514) aims to enhance cooperation between the private sector and federal agencies in combating human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Prioritization Act (H.R. 514) aims to change the status of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking within the Department of State to the Bureau to Combat Trafficking in Persons. It also requires DOS to report to congressional committees on designating an Assistant Secretary of State to Combat Trafficking in Persons. This change is believed to be more effective in carrying out duties mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460) directs the Secretary of DHS to implement a training program on deterring, detecting, and disrupting human trafficking for personnel from TSA, CBP, and other relevant agencies. This includes ensuring that personnel regularly receive current information related to the detection of human trafficking. The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 requires the Secretary of DHS to certify completion of training on human trafficking detection to congressional committees. The bill also mandates an annual report on the training program's effectiveness, including the number of suspected and confirmed human trafficking cases. Additionally, the Secretary can share training materials with other entities to help them establish their own human trafficking identification programs. The Attorney General must ensure that DOJ anti-trafficking programs include technical training for law enforcement on effective measures. The Human Trafficking Prevention Act mandates training for law enforcement on investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases, facilitating health services for victims, seeking restitution, and providing training for judges on ordering restitution. Additionally, the bill includes members of the Foreign Service in required training to identify and protect trafficking victims. The bill mandates training for ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission on trafficking issues before departing for their posts. The Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act requires a grant for developing best practices for health care professionals to recognize and respond to trafficking victims. A pilot program will be established in each of the 10 HHS regions near anti-trafficking task forces. H.R. 469 mandates training for child protective services workers to identify and address at-risk children, in alignment with federal child welfare law amendments. The bill also requires the establishment of pilot programs in each of the 10 HHS regions to implement best practices and analyze outcomes. AHRQ will disseminate identified best practices from medical or nursing schools. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) sets minimum standards for sex offender registration in the US, classifying offenders into three tiers based on the severity of their crimes. Tier III includes the most serious offenders, subject to strict registration and notification requirements. Tier I and Tier II offenders are classified based on the severity of their offenses. H.R. 515 proposes the establishment of the \"Angel Watch Center\" within ICE to track travel by child-sex offenders and notify destination countries. It also calls for bilateral agreements with foreign governments to share information on offenders. The bill suggests creating bilateral agreements with foreign governments to exchange information on international travel by child-sex offenders, including U.S. citizens arrested or convicted for such offenses abroad."
