    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act, known as Article 11, aims to protect legislative employees who report ethical violations without fear of retribution. It defines a legislative employee as someone currently employed by either house of the Legislature, excluding members. A protected disclosure involves filing a complaint with the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee regarding a violation by a legislator. The Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act, Article 11, protects legislative employees reporting ethical violations. It includes committees in the Senate and Assembly, an ethics ombudsperson, and defines \"use of official authority or influence.\" The Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act prohibits legislators from using their authority to intimidate or interfere with a legislative employee's right to make a protected disclosure. Violators may face fines up to $10,000 and imprisonment. Additionally, they can be held liable in a civil action for damages. The Legislative Employee Whistleblower Protection Act prohibits legislators from interfering with employees making protected disclosures. Supervisors can still take personnel actions if based on separate evidence. A legislative employee can file a complaint alleging reprisal or retaliation for making a protected disclosure. The complaint must be filed within one year of the improper act. A person who intentionally engages in acts of reprisal against a legislative employee for making a protected disclosure may face a fine up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. The definition of \"legislative employee\" includes former employees if the complaint is filed within one year of the improper act. In addition to other penalties, a person who retaliates against a legislative employee for a protected disclosure is liable for damages. The burden of proof is on the offending party to show the retaliation would have occurred for legitimate reasons even without the disclosure. Punitive damages may be awarded if malicious acts are proven. The injured party is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. A legislative employee can bring an action for civil damages without filing a complaint. Supervisors can take personnel actions if justified by separate evidence. \"Legislative employee\" includes former employees. The article states that if a complaint is filed within one year of the most recent improper act, it does not diminish the rights of legislative employees under any other law. No reimbursement is required for local agencies or school districts due to the creation of a new crime or infraction."
