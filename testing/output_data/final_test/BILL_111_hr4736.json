    "content": "The Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010, also known as the Energy Education Loan Forgiveness, amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 by adding a new section for loan forgiveness related to energy education. The Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 aims to encourage individuals to pursue advanced energy professions and reduce student loan debt by forgiving loans for skilled energy workers in the advanced energy industry. The Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 focuses on advanced energy and authorizes the Secretary to provide loan forgiveness through a program to repay qualified loan amounts for certain loans made under specific parts of the title. The Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 authorizes the Secretary to forgive a borrower's loan obligation in increments based on years of employment, up to $4,500 after the fourth year. The Energy Education Loan Forgiveness Act of 2010 allows the Secretary to forgive a borrower's loan obligation up to $5,000 after the fifth year of employment. Loan forgiveness is granted on a first-come, first-served basis, and borrowers cannot receive reductions under multiple sections for the same service. Definitions for \"advanced energy\" and \"industry that focuses on advanced energy\" are provided in the Act. The term 'industry that focuses on advanced energy' refers to industries primarily involved in developing, producing, and distributing advanced energy, including alternative energy like wind and solar, nuclear energy, energy-efficient construction, sustainable energy technologies, water and energy conservation, recycling, waste reduction, and advanced agriculture. The Secretary is authorized to issue regulations necessary for advanced energy industries, skilled energy workers, and loan forgiveness criteria. Coordination with the Secretary of Energy is required for defining terms and categories. Authorization of appropriations is granted for advanced energy industries under subsection (f)(2) for fiscal year 2011 and the following 5 years."
