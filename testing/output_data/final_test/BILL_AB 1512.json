    "title": "AB 1512",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 396 of the Insurance Code is amended to require insurers to take specific actions. Insurers must allow policyholders to designate an additional person to receive notice of policy changes, with instructions on how to do so and update the designee. This notification must be provided at the time of application or within 30 days after policy inception, and every two years thereafter. If the policyholder contacts the insurer to establish or change the designated person, the insurer must comply with the request. Insurers are not required to maintain additional verification if a designated person receives notice of policy changes. An insurer can comply with policy change notification requirements by following a specific procedure outlined in subdivision (b). The insurer must notify the policyholder within 30 days of an individual policy's inception about the right to designate a person to receive notice of policy changes. The notice should explain how to designate someone to receive notifications of policy lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal, or cancellation for nonpayment of premium. If the applicant or policyholder does not designate an individual to receive notice of policy changes within 30 days of being notified by the insurer, they will be presumed to have declined the opportunity. The insurer must retain and use the contact information provided for the lifetime of the policy and allow updates upon request. The policyholder can designate one additional person to receive notice of policy changes, and can change this designation every two years. The policyholder can designate a person to receive notice of policy changes. This notice can be combined into a single notice and does not require two separate notices. If the policyholder pays the premium through a payroll or pension deduction plan, the notice requirements can be delayed until 60 days after they are no longer on the deduction payment plan. An insurance policy cannot lapse without prior notice to the designated individual at least 10 days before the effective date. The notice must be sent by first-class mail within 10 days of the unpaid premium. This does not change the requirements for notifying the policyholder of lapse, termination, or cancellation as stated in other sections of the code. This section applies to certain types of insurance policies issued or renewed after January 1, 2016. A designated individual receiving notice of policy lapse has no rights to benefits under the policy, except for receiving the notice itself. This section will be effective starting January 1, 2016."
