    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pakistan Proliferation Accountability Act of 2005\". Congress finds that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan operated an illegal international network selling nuclear weapons and technologies to various countries, including providing North Korea with uranium enrichment centrifuges and designs. Documents from Libya confirm the proliferation activities of this network. The illegal international nuclear proliferation network led by Dr. Khan provided Libya with nuclear weapon designs and uranium enrichment centrifuges. Pakistan admitted in 2005 that the network also supplied centrifuges to Iran. The full extent of the network's activities remains unknown, and the US has not been able to directly interview Dr. Khan. The sense of Congress is that the US government has an interest in uncovering the illegal nuclear proliferation network run by Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan. They believe Dr. Khan should provide a full account of the network's activities. Additionally, there is a prohibition on US military assistance to Pakistan. The US government prohibits military assistance to Pakistan unless the President certifies that Pakistan has cooperated in investigating Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's nuclear proliferation network. The US government prohibits military assistance to Pakistan unless it cooperates in investigating an illegal international nuclear proliferation network connected to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, which has been confirmed dismantled. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the House of Representatives and Senate."
