Harriet Tubman, born into slavery in Maryland around 1822, emancipated herself in 1849. She returned repeatedly to Dorchester and Caroline Counties to lead family members to freedom in the northern US and Canada. Harriet Tubman, known as \"Moses\" by African-Americans and abolitionists, was a prominent conductor of the Underground Railroad. Frederick Douglass praised her for her bravery in serving enslaved people. During the Civil War, Tubman worked as a nurse, scout, and spy for Union troops, helping rescue hundreds of enslaved individuals in Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina. Harriet Tubman established a home for aged African-Americans in Auburn, New York, which she later bequeathed to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.
