    "content": "Depthwise separable convolutions are efficient in reducing parameters and computation in convolutional operations, leading to better image classification models. They have been successful in models like Xception and MobileNets. A new architecture called SliceNet, inspired by Xception and ByteNet, shows significant parameter reduction and improved results in neural machine translation tasks. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of depthwise separable convolutions in machine translation, architectural changes enabled by depthwise separability include increased convolution window length without the need for filter dilation. A new super-separable convolution operation further reduces parameters and computational cost. LSTM-based recurrent neural networks have been successful in natural language processing tasks, narrowing the gap between human and machine translations. Auto-regressive convolutional models have also shown promise recently. The text discusses the success of auto-regressive convolutional models in various data domains and their computational complexity. Inspired by vision architectures like Xception and MobileNets, a new convolutional sequence-to-sequence model called SliceNet is introduced for machine translation. SliceNet, a sequence-to-sequence architecture for machine translation, surpasses previous experiments except for the Transformer model. It features depthwise separable convolution layers with residual connections and super-separable convolutions, eliminating filter dilation for better performance. The depthwise separable convolution operation, used in models like ByteNet and WaveNet, improves results without dilation by combining depthwise and pointwise convolutions. It is different from spatially separable convolutions and is related to Inception modules. The fundamental idea behind depthwise separable convolutions is to simplify feature learning by breaking it into spatial and channel steps within a deep neural network. This approach leverages the assumption of independent channels and correlated spatial locations in 2D or 3D inputs, gradually learning higher levels of feature abstraction with increasing depth. Dedicated feature pathways are available for merging later in the network, enabling more efficient learning. Depthwise separable convolutions simplify feature learning by breaking it into spatial and channel steps within a deep neural network. This approach enables independent feature pathways that are later merged, making learning more efficient compared to regular convolutions. Grouped convolutions are an intermediary step between regular and depthwise separable convolutions, splitting input channels into segments for independent spatial convolutions before concatenating the results. Depthwise separable convolutions simplify feature learning by breaking it into spatial and channel steps within a deep neural network. The key gains from separability can be seen when comparing the number of parameters of separable convolutions, group convolutions, and regular convolutions. The size and cost of a separable convolution with c channels and a receptive field of size k is k \u00b7 c + c^2. The text discusses the concept of super-separable convolutions as a way to reduce the size of convolutions in deep neural networks. This technique involves splitting the tensor into groups, applying separable convolutions to each group, and then concatenating the results. By using stack super-separable convolutions with co-prime groups, the exchange of information between channels is maintained. Filter dilation is a technique for aggregating multiscale information in convolution operations, avoiding parameter count explosion. Checkerboard artifacts can occur when dilation values have common divisors. Choosing co-prime dilation factors can help alleviate these artifacts. The purpose of filter dilation is to increase the receptive field of the convolution operation. The use of filter dilation in convolution operations increases the receptive field for gathering feature information. Depthwise separable convolutions make the operation cheaper by reducing model parameters. Experimentation explores the trade-off between dilation rates and convolution window sizes. In contrast to previous models like WaveNet and ByteNet, the use of depthwise separable convolutions in SliceNet eliminates the need for dilation. The model operates on channel-wise slices of inputs and follows a convolutional autoregressive structure. Inputs and outputs are embedded into the same feature depth, concatenated, and fed into a decoder for generating output elements. The autoregressive decoder in SliceNet generates output predictions based on encoded inputs and previous outputs. It uses convolutional modules and attention mechanisms for information exchange between encoder and decoder. Local computation is performed using convolution modules with ReLU activation and layer normalization. Each module step includes ReLU activation, depthwise separable convolution, and layer normalization. The autoregressive decoder in SliceNet uses convolutional modules and attention mechanisms for information exchange between encoder and decoder. BID1 acts over hidden units, computing layer-wise statistics and normalizing them. The normalized units are scaled and shifted by learned parameters G and B, producing final units activated by a non-linearity. Convolution steps with kernel size K and dilation D are defined as ConvStep. Modules are composed by stacking convolutional steps with residual connections. Four convolutional steps are used with skip-connections between the stack input and outputs of the second and fourth steps. The ConvModule architecture in SliceNet uses convolution sizes and dilations for information exchange. Inner-product attention is employed with a timing signal to access positional information. The full attention mechanism includes adding timing signals to targets, two convolutional steps, and attending to the source. Outputs are generated in an autoregressive manner, establishing long term dependencies with attention. Convolutional autoregressive generation offers large receptive fields for long term dependencies. The structure of InputEncoder, IOMixer, and Decoder is detailed. Machine translation using deep neural networks achieved great success with sequence-to-sequence models that used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells. The basic architecture consists of an RNN encoder and decoder, with the encoder reading the source sentence token by token and transforming it into a fixed-sized state vector. The decoder then generates the target sentence token by token from this state vector. While this architecture can achieve good translation results, it has limitations due to long term dependencies. SliceNet uses a simplified version of neural attention mechanism to improve translation quality on longer sentences. Previous models like BID10 and BID13 used convolutional architectures with a standard RNN, leading to fixed-size vectors that hinder performance on longer sentences. This bottleneck is similar to the limitations of RNN sequence-to-sequence models without attention. Fully convolutional neural machine translation models like Extended Neural GPU and ByteNet have improved efficiency by using left-padded convolutions in the decoder. This technique, introduced in WaveNet, has been adopted in SliceNet and other recent neural translation models. Depthwise separable convolutions, first studied by Sifre during an internship at Google Brain, have shown strong results since their introduction in 2014. In an ICLR 2014 presentation, depthwise separable convolutions were introduced and later demonstrated to yield strong results in large-scale image classification in Xception and parameter-efficient models in MobileNets. The experiments aim to evaluate the impact of replacing convolutions in a ByteNet-like model with depthwise separable convolutions and the trade-off of reducing dilation while increasing convolution window size. Additionally, auxiliary experiments include testing intermediate separability points and the performance impact of super-separable convolutions. The experiments evaluate the performance impact of super-separable convolutions compared to depthwise separable convolutions in a ByteNet-like model for English to German translation. Results show depthwise separable convolutions are superior, with details on parameter count and accuracy provided in tables. Depthwise separable convolutions outperform regular convolutions in a ByteNet-like architecture, offering higher accuracy with fewer parameters and lower computational costs. The use of small groups and larger convolution windows eliminates the need for dilation, while the super-separable convolution operation shows incremental performance gains. In this work, a new convolutional architecture called SliceNet is introduced for sequence-to-sequence tasks, utilizing depthwise separable convolutions. Results show that SliceNet models with significantly higher feature depth outperform all previously reported models except for the recent Transformer. The BLEU score was obtained using a beam-search decoder with a beam size of 4 and a length penalty tuned on the evaluation set. SliceNet introduces a new convolutional architecture utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, outperforming previous models except for the Transformer. Filter dilation is not necessary, as larger convolution window sizes yield better results. Super-separable convolutions show incremental performance improvements. This work aligns with the trend of using depthwise separable convolutions in convolutional models. Depthwise separable convolutions can replace regular convolutions for 1D or 2D data, resulting in a cheaper, smaller model with improved performance. This trend is supported by solid theoretical foundations and experimental results. The current work aims to affirm and accelerate this trend, with potential applications beyond translation tasks."
