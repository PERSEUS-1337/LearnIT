    "content": "The extended appropriations process for FY2011 began with the Obama Administration's budget request in February 2010 and ended with the enactment of P.L. 112-10 on April 15, 2011. Congressional debate revolved around two proposals, H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, which eventually led to the compromise embodied by P.L. 112-10. The federal government was funded through a series of resolutions continuing funding at FY2010 levels between October 1, 2010, and April 15, 2011. This report aims to facilitate comparative analysis of key proposals in FY2011. The report aims to compare key proposals in the FY2011 appropriations process, focusing on their impact on the federal budget deficit. It includes a table showing discretionary funding levels in each proposal and compares FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations. The debate centered on the impact of discretionary federal spending on the budget deficit, with appropriations acts providing budget authority. This will be the final update of the report. The report compares key proposals in the FY2011 appropriations process, focusing on their impact on the federal budget deficit. It includes discretionary funding levels in each proposal and compares FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations. The budget deficit for FY2011 was estimated at $1,399 billion under the CBO March 2011 baseline. The proposals analyzed provide annualized discretionary outlay levels for various acts. The proposal in H.R. 1 aimed to reduce budget authority by $1,372 billion, resulting in a discretionary outlay level $5 billion below the CBO baseline. However, the enacted P.L. 112-10 increased discretionary outlays by $4 billion compared to the baseline. Reductions in discretionary spending could impact mandatory spending, net interest, and revenue collection, affecting the FY2011 deficit. The table below shows the impact of different proposals on funding for federal departments and agencies in FY2011, without including scorekeeping adjustments or rescissions of prior year funding. It compares discretionary appropriations in the proposals to the FY2010 and FY2011 enacted funding levels."
