    "content": "During the past 10 years, states have implemented policies to divert cash welfare assistance applicants who may need less help in becoming self-sufficient. State diversion programs include formal assistance, job search requirements, and resource referrals. This report focuses on formal state diversion programs. State diversion programs are discussed, with information sourced from state annual reports on the TANF block grant program for FY2005. The report includes data from state plans, data reports, and state websites on families being diverted from TANF assistance. The terms used by states may vary, and job search and resource referral are considered diversion strategies but not assistance in the data provided. Policymakers have grappled with providing financial aid to needy families while promoting self-sufficiency. Since the late 1960s, federal welfare policymakers have aimed to provide financial assistance to needy families while promoting self-sufficiency to prevent dependency. States have utilized Section 1115 waivers to offer one-time financial payments to divert job-ready individuals from welfare enrollment. Some states historically discouraged people from applying for welfare by withholding information, using condescending language, asking unnecessary questions, and offering relocation assistance to eligible families to leave the state for better benefits. The 1996 welfare reform law ended cash welfare benefits for low-income families with children, replacing it with a block grant called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). States gained control over program eligibility and benefits, aiming to move parents from welfare to work and improve children's lives. States have control over program eligibility and benefits under the 1996 welfare reform law. Diversion programs can be included in TANF programs, helping families maintain independence from welfare by focusing on their specific circumstances and needs. Some states offer relocation assistance to TANF-eligible families as part of their diversion activities. States have control over program eligibility and benefits under the 1996 welfare reform law. Some states offer relocation assistance to TANF-eligible families as part of their diversion activities, focusing on encouraging families to move where they may find jobs. The number of families on AFDC/TANF dropped significantly from 1994 to 2005, with states testing innovative approaches to reduce welfare rolls and promote self-sufficiency. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) began monitoring diversion policies and practices in 1999. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) invited applications for FY1999 funding for studies on the TANF program. Six out of seven Welfare Outcomes Grants were awarded to states studying welfare reform impact on TANF applicants. Ten ASPE grantees included states like Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, Milwaukee County, and Wisconsin. The reports of completed studies discuss information about individuals and families diverted from TANF, including their well-being and program participation. Texas and North Carolina studied formal diversion programs. A significant proportion of diverted families were still receiving TANF benefits after 12 months. The final rule on TANF was published in April 1999, stating that short-term crisis benefits do not count as TANF assistance. The TANF program does not consider crisis assistance, child care, transportation, and work supports as TANF assistance. Families receiving diversion aid are exempt from TANF work requirements, time limits, and other obligations. The TANF block grant program was reauthorized in 2006 with a funding level of $16.5 billion annually. Regulations for the TANF program were required to be issued by June 30, 2006. In FY2004, $271 million was spent on cash payments for diversion assistance and short-term benefits. One strategy states are using to reduce ongoing welfare is diversion assistance, which diverts families from receiving monthly cash TANF payments by referring them to alternative resources. Cash assistance is now seen as a last resort in many states, with the emphasis on eligibility for other forms of aid. In many states, cash assistance is now considered a last resort, with diversion assistance being seen as a positive alternative to welfare. Diversion programs focus on providing families with the support they need to maintain self-sufficiency, such as one-time cash payments for emergencies, support services like child care and transportation, or help finding employment. These services aim to prevent families from relying on ongoing TANF benefits by offering short-term assistance or services to meet immediate needs. Welfare diversion programs offer temporary emergency assistance to families as a one-time payment instead of ongoing cash benefits. Accepting a diversion payment can make a family ineligible for TANF assistance for a period of time. Diversion can take various forms such as lump sum payments, vendor payments, supportive services, and job search activities. It aims to prevent families from relying on ongoing assistance by providing short-term support to meet immediate needs. The lump sum payment approach in welfare diversion programs aims to provide short-term financial assistance to families with immediate needs, helping them avoid ongoing welfare assistance. Eligible applicants may receive one-time cash, voucher, or vendor payments to address work-related needs or emergency expenses like rent, utilities, or child care. This assistance can help families support themselves by addressing immediate financial challenges. The lump sum payment approach in welfare diversion programs provides short-term financial assistance to families facing immediate needs, such as car repairs, rent payments, or medical emergencies. This aid aims to help families avoid ongoing welfare assistance by giving them a modest boost in income to stay off the welfare rolls. In welfare diversion programs, lump sum payment programs are not widely used compared to job search assistance programs. Job search activities are required before qualifying for monthly cash assistance, encouraging individuals to find employment quickly and reduce their need for welfare. This approach aims to divert TANF applicants from cash welfare by helping them find jobs. According to a 1999 GWU study, \"Work First\" programs focus on rapid entry into the labor market, encouraging recipients to take the first job available with the expectation of moving into a better job later. Applicant job search programs take this concept further by requiring immediate employment search to reduce the need for welfare assistance. The resource referral approach in welfare programs aims to help families find employment quickly to avoid needing assistance. Support services like child care, transportation, and health care, along with food stamps, can help families stay self-sufficient. TANF intake workers explore other forms of aid like drug treatment programs and family support. Welfare is viewed as a temporary option, and the referral approach does not guarantee services. According to a 1999 GWU study, only seven states are actively exploring alternative resources with applicants before proceeding with an application for TANF. As TANF caseloads decrease and time limits increase, more localities may start linking families with alternative resources before providing cash assistance. This approach is the least utilized and understood strategy for diverting applicants from welfare rolls. In the late 1990s, many states began implementing diversion programs for welfare applicants. Initially, families mistakenly believed that being diverted from TANF meant they were ineligible for food stamps and Medicaid as well. However, this perception has been corrected, leading to an increase in food stamp participation and Medicaid enrollment numbers since FY2000-FY2005. The number of Medicaid recipients has been fluctuating over the years, reaching 37.8 million in 2002. Informal diversion in TANF programs discourages eligible families from applying for benefits. Some families are deterred by work and child support requirements, leading to decreased application rates. Informal diversion in TANF programs discourages eligible families from applying for benefits due to stricter requirements. Some families choose not to apply because they anticipate not meeting the new program's expectations or assume they are no longer eligible. The new program rules for TANF programs have increased the burden on applicants by requiring multiple office visits, screening interviews, and program orientations, which may deter eligible families from applying for benefits. The stringent job search requirements in Cook County have deterred many applicants from applying for TANF benefits. Informal diversion can be difficult to detect and families may be discouraged or confused about their options. Final regulations for the TANF program were published in April 1999 and took effect in October 1999. The final TANF regulations, effective from October 1, 1999, exclude non-recurrent crisis benefits, child care, transportation, and work supports from being considered TANF assistance. Families receiving diversion aid are exempt from TANF work requirements, time limits, child support assignment, and data reporting. HHS acknowledges the importance of diversion activities in reducing dependency and the need to avoid stifling state responses to family problems with restrictive federal rules. The final TANF regulations exclude diversion aid from being considered TANF assistance, allowing states to provide short-term non-recurrent benefits without triggering work requirements or time limits. HHS only collects aggregate spending information on diversion programs, recognizing their role in reducing dependency. The final TANF regulations exclude diversion aid from being considered TANF assistance, allowing states to provide short-term non-recurrent benefits without triggering work requirements or time limits. HHS is not collecting detailed data on diversion caseloads, but new reporting requirements include descriptions of non-recurrent benefits and eligibility criteria. States must also report any policies limiting payments to eligible families or delaying assistance eligibility. The TANF program allows states to provide short-term non-recurrent benefits through diversion aid, which is not considered TANF assistance. States must report on diversion activities and ensure individuals receive information about other benefit programs. Diversion programs help families facing temporary financial problems access immediate assistance for employment. Research shows that women who received cash welfare assistance as children are more likely to face challenges such as not completing high school, having a child outside of marriage, and relying on welfare. Only 20% of diversion program participants enroll in TANF within 12-18 months, indicating that these programs attract those who are less likely to need long-term assistance. Policymakers are concerned that diverting families from TANF may leave crucial needs unmet. A 2002 Urban Institute study found that a significant share of eligible persons diverted from the TANF program could benefit from enrolling in TANF for substantial income and services. Research suggests that diverting from TANF may lead to lower employment rates and higher reliance on the Food Stamp program, indicating unmet long-term needs for diverted families. Based on state reports, in FY2005, some states provided lump sum diversion payments to TANF applicants, required job searches, and used resource referrals.
