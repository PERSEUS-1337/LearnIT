    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to collect accurate demographic data to improve public services, but currently lacks consistent data on sexual orientation and gender identity. Limited data shows higher poverty rates among children raised by same-sex couples compared to different-sex couples. Data from a 2013 Williams Institute report reveals high poverty rates among LGBT communities, with one-third of lesbian couples and 20.1% of gay male couples without a high school diploma living in poverty. African American same-sex couples have poverty rates over twice that of different-sex married African American couples. Additionally, hate crimes with a sexual orientation bias were the second most common type of hate crime in California in 2013, comprising 25% of all hate crimes. Various studies by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Institute of Medicine found health disparities for LGBTQ individuals, including higher risks for cancer, mental illness, smoking, and substance abuse. Research from the LGBTQ Reducing Disparities Project highlighted difficulties LGBTQ individuals face with service providers regarding acceptance of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Due to historical exclusion of data collection, LGBT communities face disparities in health and welfare, including high rates of poverty, suicide, homelessness, substance abuse, and violence. It is crucial for the state to embrace diversity and collect accurate data to effectively deliver services. The Legislature intends for state departments to utilize existing research and practices when collecting voluntary self-identified information on sexual orientation and gender identity. They should also consider urging the collection of this information in circumstances where it is not already being collected. Section 8310.8 of the Government Code, known as the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Disparities Reduction Act, applies to specific state departments for collecting voluntary self-identification information on sexual orientation and gender identity. The departments listed in Section 8310.8 of the Government Code may collect demographic data voluntarily under certain circumstances, such as federal programs or surveys with defined categories, or when collected by other entities not included in the section. State departments must report demographic data collected under specific circumstances to the Legislature, ensuring confidentiality of personal identifying information. Reports may aggregate data at various levels to prevent individual identification and ensure statistical reliability. State departments may use voluntarily provided information on sexual orientation and gender identity for specific purposes such as demographic analysis, care coordination, and research. Compliance with these requirements must be achieved by July 1, 2018. The Legislature imposes limitations on public access to meetings and writings of public officials, citing the California Constitution. To protect the privacy of individuals who provide voluntary self-identification information regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, it is necessary to prohibit the public disclosure of personal identifying information that could lead to their identification."
