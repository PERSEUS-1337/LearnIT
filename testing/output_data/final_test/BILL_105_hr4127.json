    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that gifted and talented students, regardless of background, require specialized services to fully develop their high capabilities. These students are often underrepresented in gifted education programs due to their advanced academic abilities, quick learning, and need for more complex educational opportunities. Gifted and talented students need specialized education to reach their full potential. Currently, there is no federal requirement to support the approximately 3,000,000 gifted students in the US. States and school districts vary in resources and services for these students, leading to disparities. To compete globally, more students need to achieve at higher levels, including highly capable students. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the United States on international assessments was among the lowest in the world in physics and advanced mathematics. Elementary school students with academic gifts often master a significant portion of the school year's content before it begins. Only a small fraction of education spending in the US goes towards elementary and secondary education. The purpose of this Act is to provide grants to States to support programs, classes, and other services designed to meet the needs of the Nation's gifted and talented students in elementary and secondary schools. The Act aims to provide grants to States for programs supporting gifted students in schools. The Secretary can provide grants to States for gifted education programs in public schools, including professional development, technical assistance, and support for innovative programs and services. States may allocate funds for innovative approaches and curricula in schools, including emerging technologies like distance learning. A maximum of 10 percent of the total amount received can be used for state administrative costs related to gifted education programs. The curr_chunk discusses the implementation of gifted and talented education programs, dissemination of information to teachers and parents, establishment of State gifted education advisory boards, and management of funds received under this Act. The curr_chunk focuses on the application of the discussed provisions related to gifted and talented education programs, dissemination of information, establishment of State advisory boards, and fund management under this Act. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary, ensuring funds support gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds, with at least 90% of funds going to public schools. Funds must supplement, not replace, State and local education funds. States must develop and implement program assessment models to evaluate the effectiveness of specialized education for gifted and talented students. The Secretary will approve a State educational agency's application if it meets the requirements of this section. SEC. 5. ALLOTMENT TO STATES. The Secretary will allocate funds to each State based on the number of children aged 5 through 18. Each State will receive a minimum of $1,000,000 per fiscal year if funds allow, with reductions if necessary. SEC. 6. REPORTING. States must report on the effectiveness of specialized education for gifted and talented students. The State educational agency must submit an annual report to the Secretary detailing the students served and activities supported with funds from the Act. The report should also outline measures taken to meet accountability requirements. SEC. 7.
