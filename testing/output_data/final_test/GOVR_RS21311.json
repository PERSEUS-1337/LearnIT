The Bush Administration published The National Security Strategy of the United States, stating readiness to use preemptive military force to prevent enemies from using weapons of mass destruction. The analysis reviews historical uses of preemptive military force by the United States. The preemptive use of military force by the United States is aimed at preventing or mitigating a presumed military attack. It involves deploying military forces to address a specific and imminent threat, requiring timely action. This is different from a \"preventive war,\" which involves significant use of force to forestall a presumed threat in the future. Such a preventive war would be an expansion of the traditional concept of preemptive force. The Bush Administration's view on military preemption is outlined in the September 2002 U.S. National Strategy document. The historical record shows that the United States has never engaged in a preemptive military attack, except for one instance. The United States has only engaged in one preemptive military attack in its history, during the Spanish-American War of 1898. The goal was to compel Spain to grant Cuba its independence, and U.S. military actions were based on special foreign policy considerations. During the Cuban Missile crisis of 1962, the United States considered using military force to destroy Soviet missiles in Cuba but ultimately resolved the crisis diplomatically. The United States deployed military forces as part of its diplomacy, while also reserving the right to take further military actions if necessary. The origins of the Mexican War are controversial, but it was not a preemptive attack by the United States. In the aftermath of the First World War, the US sent military forces to Russia to protect its interests and aid anti-Bolshevik forces during the civil war. The President has historically obtained congressional authorization for military actions or directed them in support of multinational operations. Examples include participation in the Korean War, Persian Gulf War, and Bosnian and Kosovo operations. The use of military force against Iraq in 2003 was controversial but justified by the U.S. and allies to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions. The United States has historically used military force in Central America and the Caribbean to support the Monroe Doctrine, not as preemptive action but in response to threats to stability in the region. The United States established protectorates in the Caribbean through treaties with the Dominican Republic and Haiti in the early 20th century, allowing for the collection of customs income and military intervention to maintain stability. These arrangements were terminated during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. The United States utilized military forces to restore order in Haiti and the Dominican Republic from 1915-1934 and 1916-1924, respectively, to maintain political stability and prevent foreign intervention. In 1912, the US intervened in Nicaragua to restore political order, leading to the Bryan-Chamorro treaty in 1914 granting rights to protect the Panama Canal and future canal through Nicaragua. The Bryan-Chamorro treaty of 1914 granted the United States the right to intervene in Nicaragua to protect the Panama Canal and U.S. interests. This led to Nicaragua becoming a quasi-protectorate of the United States. U.S. military forces were permanently withdrawn in 1933. Subsequent interventions in the Dominican Republic in 1965, Grenada in 1983, and Panama in 1989 were justified by concerns for U.S. citizens and interests during political instability in those countries. The United States has used covert action to influence political and military outcomes in other nations, such as Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. This form of intervention aims to prevent certain groups or figures from gaining political power that goes against U.S. interests. However, covert action failed in Cuba in 1961. The United States has used covert action to influence political and military outcomes in other nations, such as Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954. The general approach is to support local forces in gaining or maintaining political control to protect U.S. interests. These operations are conducted without significant U.S. military involvement to avoid direct attention. Previous covert actions could be seen as preemptive measures to prevent unwanted developments in other countries, but they were on a smaller scale compared to conventional military operations and not used to preempt an imminent attack on the United States. The Cuban missile crisis of 1962 was a significant example of preemptive military action considered by the United States to destroy nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba. This action was not used, but it stands out as a case where preemptive military force was seriously contemplated. During the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, President Kennedy opted for a naval \"quarantine\" of Cuba to prevent missile shipments from the Soviet Union. This measured approach successfully resolved the crisis. In contrast, the Iraq War of 2003 saw the United States using significant military force. The United States used significant military force in the Iraq War of 2003, based on the Bush Administration's preemptive military action strategy to prevent potential threats from unfriendly nations with weapons of mass destruction. The Bush Administration's preemptive military action in the Iraq War of 2003 was based on concerns about Iraq's WMD program and violations of UN Security Council Resolutions. President Bush launched military action with coalition forces to enforce these resolutions. The Bush Administration's preemptive military action in the Iraq War of 2003 was based on concerns about Iraq's WMD program and violations of UN Security Council Resolutions. President Bush concluded that further diplomatic efforts would not succeed, leading to the use of military force to achieve Iraqi disarmament. The military action was justified to protect the security of the United States from a prospective threat by Iraq. The United States' military action in the Iraq War of 2003 could be seen as a preventive war rather than preemptive, based on concerns about Iraq's WMD program and violations of UN resolutions."
