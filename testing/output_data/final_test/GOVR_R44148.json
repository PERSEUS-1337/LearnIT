    "content": "Since 1978, the federal government has settled water rights disputes with 40 Indian tribes to fulfill its tribal trust responsibilities. These settlements provide funding for tribes to access and develop their water resources. Congress is concerned about the effectiveness of the negotiation process and funding for these settlements. This report provides background on Indian water rights settlements, the settlement process, enacted and potential settlements, issues related to Indian water rights, challenges in negotiation and implementation, and settlements in a legislative context. Indian water rights are vested property rights with a federal trust responsibility. The federal trust responsibility is a legal obligation of the United States to protect Indian resources and assets in their best interest. This includes managing reserved lands, waters, resources, and assets for Indian tribes. The United States fulfills this responsibility by assisting tribes with their claims to reserved water rights through litigation, negotiations, and settlements. These water rights claims typically date back to the establishment of reservations. Indian reserved water rights were first recognized by the Supreme Court in Winters v. United States in 1908, where Congress implicitly reserves water for Indian reservations. Disputes have arisen between Indians and non-Indian water users, especially in the western United States, where Indian reservations predated settlement by non-Indians. Water allocation in western states follows a system of prior appropriation. The Winters doctrine recognizes the priority of Indian reserved water rights, dating back to the creation of reservations. Disputes often arise with non-Indian water users, leading to costly litigation or negotiated settlements. Indian water rights holders may only receive paper water rights without access to tangible water resources due to lack of financial capital. Negotiated settlements have become the preferred method for resolving Indian water rights disputes due to the inability of courts to authorize new water projects. These settlements allow tribes to discuss and agree on water allocations, resolving uncertainty and avoiding litigation. However, there is still debate on whether litigation or settlements are more suitable for resolving these disputes. The primary issue in Indian reserved water rights settlements is quantification, determining the amount of water users have rights to. Negotiation often includes building water infrastructure for access to resources and provisions for environmental protection. Federal government involvement follows a 1990 policy statement. The W. Bush Administration adopted criteria and procedures in 1990 for Indian water rights settlements, preferring negotiation over litigation. DOI, DOJ, and OMB are key federal entities involved in prenegotiation, negotiation, and implementation of settlements. DOI has the majority of responsibilities in approving Indian water rights settlements. The Department of the Interior (DOI) plays a key role in approving Indian water rights settlements. Two entities within DOI handle Indian water settlement policy: the Working Group on Indian Water Settlements, responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of the Interior's Indian Water Rights Office (SIWRO), which oversees and coordinates settlements. SIWRO interfaces with negotiation and implementation teams for individual settlements and tribes. DOI appoints teams to work on individual Indian water rights settlements during various stages. Teams are appointed by the Department of the Interior to work on Indian water rights settlements, with a chairman representing the Secretary. Federal teams consist of representatives from various agencies and guide the settlement process through prenegotiation, negotiation, settlement, and implementation stages, which can take several years. The prenegotiation stage of Indian water rights settlements involves steps before formal negotiations begin, including litigation and adjudications. The federal government also has its own prenegotiation framework with phases like fact-finding and briefings. During the prenegotiation stage of Indian water rights settlements, consultations occur between DOI and DOJ to establish a negotiation team. The team submits a fact-finding report within nine months, evaluating claims and potential settlement issues. In the second phase, the team works with DOJ to assess all parties' positions and develop a federal negotiating position, considering costs for litigation and settlement. During the negotiation phase of Indian water rights settlements, the Working Group presents a recommended negotiating position to the Secretary, recommends federal funding contributions, and outlines positions on major settlement issues. The negotiation process can be prolonged and may take years to resolve, with the federal negotiation team working closely with OMB and DOJ. The federal negotiation team works with parties to reach a settlement for Indian water rights claims. DOI offices, BIA's Branch of Water Resources, and Reclamation's Native American Affairs Program provide support. OMB issued guidance for more involvement in negotiations and requires regular updates. Settlements are presented for congressional authorization after negotiation phase completion. Once a settlement is agreed upon, it may require congressional approval to become law and be eligible for federal funding. If not, approval can be done administratively or judicially. The SIWRO oversees implementation through federal teams, assisting tribes and parties. Settlements from litigation must be reconciled with the original agreement and any changes. After a settlement is agreed upon, it may need congressional approval for federal funding. The SIWRO oversees implementation with federal teams. The adjudication court conducts an inter se process to hear objections before approving the settlement. Federal agencies like Reclamation or BIA typically manage the implementation. The \"Criteria and Procedures\" statement emphasizes cost control and tribal self-sufficiency. Funding comes from Reclamation, BIA, or other agencies as per settlement terms. The federal government has been involved in Indian water rights settlements since 1990, with 21 ongoing negotiation teams and 23 implementation teams as of 2018. A total of 36 settlements have been entered into since 1978, with 32 enacted by Congress and the rest approved administratively or by judicial decree. Challenges in negotiating and implementing Indian water rights settlements include funding sources, compliance with regulations, and water delivery conditions. Federal policymakers face the task of securing funding for settlements while also achieving cost-savings compared to litigation. Delivery of wet water to tribes often requires significant financial investments and new infrastructure projects. Some Indian water rights settlements have been renegotiated to reduce federal costs by millions of dollars. OMB issued a memo in 2016 for greater involvement in settlement negotiations, requiring a description of costs and benefits before formal approval. The costs and benefits of proposed settlements by DOI and DOJ are evaluated before a formal letter of Administration position. Challenges include identifying federal funding sources and structures for authorization, which have been funded through discretionary or mandatory funding, or a combination of both. Some settlements have tapped into the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund for mandatory spending. Recent Indian water rights settlements have been funded through discretionary or mandatory funding sources, including the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund. The timing of fund release varies and may depend on future actions. Congress has approved different funding approaches, with discretionary spending being the most common source. The DOJ Judgment Fund in the Department of the Treasury is also mentioned as a funding source. The most common source of funding for congressionally approved Indian water rights settlements is through discretionary appropriations authorized by Congress. Specific sums are allocated for individual settlements, such as the Pechanga Band of Luise\u00f1o Mission Indians Water Rights Settlement Act, which established the Pechanga Settlement Fund with four accounts. Congress may also authorize discretionary appropriations of \"such sums as may be necessary\" for settlements like the Colorado Ute Settlement Act. These funds must be spent by a specified deadline, such as April 30, 2030. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000 authorized the implementation and maintenance of the Animas-La Plata project using necessary funds. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 allocated mandatory and discretionary funding for Indian water rights settlements, creating the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund for scheduled deposits starting in 2020. The Reclamation Water Settlements Fund, established by the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, will receive $120 million annually from 2020 to 2029 for a total of $1.2 billion. The fund can be used for water rights settlement agreements approved by Congress, with priority given to projects like the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project and the Aamodt Settlement. The Reclamation Water Settlements Fund, established in 2009, will receive $120 million annually from 2020 to 2029 for a total of $1.2 billion. Congress must approve priority projects by December 31, 2019, or funds will revert to the fund for other Indian water rights settlements. Any unexpended balance will transfer to the Treasury by September 30, 2034. Additionally, $870 million in discretionary appropriations was authorized for the Navajo-Gallup project under P.L. 111-11. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-291) authorized and provided funding for water rights settlements, including $82 million for the Aamodt Settlement and $66 million for the Abeyta Settlement. Additional discretionary funding was also allocated for these settlements. The Claims Resolution Act of 2010 authorized and funded various water rights settlements, including the Crow Tribe, White Mountain Apache Tribe, and Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. Additional discretionary and mandatory funding was allocated for these agreements. The Arizona Water Settlements Act (P.L. 108-451) authorized water rights settlements for the Gila River Indian Community and the Tohono O'odham Nation, funded by redirection of funds from the Lower Colorado River Basin Development Fund. The Arizona Water Settlements Act authorized funding for the Gila River Indian Community and Tohono O'odham settlements, including $53 million for a trust fund to cover CAP water costs. Up to $250 million from LCRBDF receipts could be used for future Indian water rights settlements in Arizona, with funding priorities determined by availability of balances. The Judgment Fund could also be a potential source of payment for settlements. The Judgment Fund is a permanent appropriation available to pay all judgments against the United States that are not covered by other funding sources. Payments from the fund must meet certain criteria, including being monetary and final, certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, and authorized by specific statutes or rendered by certain courts. Alternatively, payments can result from compromise settlements negotiated by the Attorney General in defense of imminent litigation. The Judgment Fund is used to pay judgments against the United States that are not covered by other funding sources, including settlements negotiated in defense of imminent litigation. This fund has been utilized for various settlements with Indians and Indian tribes, such as the Cobell v. Salazar litigation settlement implemented under the Claims Resolution Act of 2010. The Judgment Fund is used to pay judgments against the United States, including settlements with Indian tribes. The Consolidated Appropriations Act authorized a transfer of $1.9 billion for final judgments and settlements. Additionally, separate funding mechanisms were set up for specific water rights settlements with Indian tribes, such as the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Agreement. The Consolidated Appropriations Act established funds for specific water rights settlements with Indian tribes, including the WMAT Settlement Fund and the WMAT Maintenance Fund. Congress authorized $78.5 million for the WMAT Settlement Fund and directed the transfer of $50 million from the U.S. Treasury General Fund to the WMAT Maintenance Fund without a separate appropriation. Payment from the Judgment Fund for Indian water settlement agreements may be precluded if there is another source of funding provided by appropriation or statute. Courts require programmatic specificity in appropriations, and agencies may need to seek additional funding from Congress if funds have been used elsewhere. The use of the Judgment Fund for settlements depends on the nature of the claim, substantive law, existing funding sources, and the forum of the award. The environmental impact of settlements on federal agencies, environmental groups, and tribes has raised concerns due to challenges under federal environmental laws like NEPA, CWA, ESA, and Safe Drinking Water Act. Some argue that settlement projects, including water projects, have negative consequences on water quality, endangered species, and habitats. For example, the Animas-La Plata project faced opposition. The Colorado Ute Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-585) faced opposition over alleged environmental law violations, including concerns raised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about water quality and wetlands in New Mexico. The project was stalled for a decade until the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000 (P.L. 106-554) addressed these issues by reducing the project size and ensuring compliance with NEPA, CWA, and ESA. Other settlements like the Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Settlement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-441) and the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-434) also faced opposition initially due to environmental concerns. During water rights negotiations, a key challenge is identifying a water source to fulfill reserved rights, often done through reallocating water or acquiring it from willing sellers. Settlements also address the type of water and its uses, as well as water quality issues. Another common issue is whether to allow for the marketing, leasing, or transfer of tribal water. The question of allowing marketing, leasing, or transfer of tribal water in settlements is a contentious issue. While some see benefits in better water reliability and economic incentives, others, including some tribes and state users, oppose it. Cultural and religious objections also exist, as some believe water is integral to tribal identity. Non-Indians may oppose water marketing if it raises prices for downstream users, potentially harming regional economies. Negotiating the right to market, lease, or transfer water can be contentious due to potential harm to regional economies. Indian water rights settlements provide certainty and benefits for stakeholders, but some tribal communities object, fearing limitations on future development. Some argue against water rights settlements, fearing limitations on future development and potential economic opportunities. They prefer water leasing and marketing for greater flexibility. Others oppose negotiated settlements, preferring litigation for potentially greater gains in the future. Some water users have concerns about water rights settlements, particularly in western Montana where the CSKT Water Compact is seen as potentially curtailing nontribal water rights. The federal government plays a role in the settlement process to fulfill its trust responsibility to tribes. The federal government fulfills its trust responsibility to tribes by securing, protecting, and managing their water rights. Settlements offer tribes a chance to waive breach-of-trust claims and resolve disputes, with over 50 negotiations resulting in 36 settlements as of 2019. These settlements aim to secure tribal water resources access, although the success of these projects is still ongoing. The federal government has appropriated over $2.9 billion in discretionary funding for Indian water rights settlements as of FY2019. The success of these projects is still ongoing, with varying outcomes among individual settlements. Some may disagree with specific settlement contents or outcomes, advocating for alternative solutions like litigation. Tracking the funding status of these settlements can be challenging due to the mix of discretionary and mandatory funds involved. The federal government has appropriated over $2.9 billion in discretionary funding for Indian water rights settlements. An additional $4.3 billion in mandatory funds is expected in the future. These funds have been allocated to various agencies, including Reclamation, BIA, Bureau of Land Management, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The total amount of authorized Indian water rights settlements is not formally tracked. DOI estimated a $1.3 billion backlog in \"authorized but unfunded\" settlements in early 2019. Settlements are negotiated case-by-case, ratifying agreements and compacts between tribes and water users. The federal government has allocated significant funds for Indian water rights settlements, with additional funding expected in the future. These settlements involve ratifying agreements between tribes and water users, authorizing water reallocation, and funding new water projects. Settlements also include provisions for tribal development funds, fish and wildlife protection programs, and ecosystem restoration. Since 2009, Congress has enacted nine Indian water rights settlements involving 13 tribes, at a cost of over $2 billion. Settlements focus on securing control of rights, alternative forms of gaining water rights, and authorizing conditions for water marketing and leasing for tribes. Settlement examples include the Seminole Tribe of Florida administering its water rights and the Zuni Indian Tribe waiving claims to gain federal funds for water rights. During recent years, Congress has passed several Indian water rights settlements without new federal funding. The process for considering this type of legislation has been a topic of discussion, with the House Natural Resources Committee outlining their expectations during the 115th Congress. The House Natural Resources Committee outlined expectations for Indian water rights settlement legislation, including affirmations by relevant departments, cost limitations, court conveyance, written agreements, approval of legislative text, and DOJ testimony availability. In the 116th Congress, H.R. 644 and S. 1207 would approve a settlement for water rights claims of the Navajo Nation on the San Juan River in Utah. It authorizes the establishment of a Navajo Water Development Trust Fund with two accounts for water supply projects and maintenance activities, totaling $209.4 million in appropriations. The Navajo Utah Settlement legislation authorizes $1 million in nontrust fund appropriations for water supply projects and maintenance. It reserves tribal access to 81,500 acre-feet per year from water sources in Utah, with the depletion subtracted from the State of Utah's Colorado River allocation. Parties involved would waive most claims, and the Navajo Nation would subordinate its water rights to existing non-Indian uses, potentially leading to water shortages for the tribe. The Navajo Utah Settlement legislation proposes a fund-based approach for water resource expenditures, departing from constructing new facilities. This approach aims to prevent cost overruns, accumulate interest, and supplement available funds. It is uncertain if other tribes with water-rights claims would support this template for future settlements. Congress is also considering extending mandatory funding for the Reclamation Water Settlement Fund. In the 116th Congress, H.R. 1904 and S. 886 propose extending $120 million per year in mandatory funds for the Reclamation Water Rights Settlement Fund indefinitely. This funding would support water supply infrastructure, water delivery system rehabilitation, and habitat restoration projects. Ongoing disputes over Indian water rights are being negotiated and settled by the executive branch, posing a continuous issue for Congress. By the end of the 115th Congress, 32 settlements had been enacted since 1978, with additional funding and new settlements likely to be requested in the future. Primary concerns for Congress include the cost and sufficiency of federally authorized efforts to settle tribal water rights claims. The settlements for Indian water rights are approved by authorizing committees and may involve federal involvement in project implementation. Congress may be interested in the extent of federal involvement and whether the federal government or tribes should lead in project development."
