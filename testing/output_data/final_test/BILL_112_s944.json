    "content": "The Act titled \"Detaining Terrorists to Secure America Act of 2011\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds that the United States and its allies are in an armed conflict with violent Islamist extremist groups like al Qaeda. Recent attacks and plots include Najibullah Zazi's 2009 subway bombing plot in New York and Nidal Malik Hasan's 2009 attack at Fort Hood. Several attempted terrorist attacks have been thwarted in recent years, including a Christmas Day 2009 bombing attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a May 2010 attempt in Times Square by Faisal Shahzad, an October 2010 plot to send explosives to Jewish centers in Chicago, and a February 2011 plot by Khaled Aldawsari to attack New York and the home of former President George W. Bush in Dallas. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US and allied forces have captured thousands of individuals associated with terrorist organizations, including detainees at Guantanamo Bay who were involved in planning, financing, and facilitating terrorism. Many of these detainees provided valuable intelligence on al Qaeda, preventing further attacks. Intelligence from detainees at Guantanamo Bay was crucial in locating Osama bin Laden. About 25% of released detainees have returned to hostilities. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula includes former Guantanamo detainees in its leadership. The Joint Task Force-Guantanamo, responsible for detainee care at Guantanamo Bay, emphasizes the importance of detaining enemy belligerents to prevent future attacks. The International Committee of the Red Cross also visits the facility. The International Committee of the Red Cross visits detainees at Guantanamo Bay quarterly, and the detention facility benefits from robust oversight by Congress. The text chunk reaffirms the authority to maintain the United States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the detention of enemy combatants by the Department of Defense. The United States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is designated for detaining individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US or its coalition partners on behalf of specified groups. The Secretary of Defense is required to keep the facility operational for current and future detainees. The amendment prohibits the transfer of detainees to foreign entities and the construction of detention facilities in the United States. It also supersedes an Executive Order. Supersedure of Executive Order No. 13492, dated January 22, 2009, nullifies specific sections of the order."
