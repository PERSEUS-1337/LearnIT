    "content": "The Fed directly changes two interest rates: the discount rate, set by the Fed, and the federal funds rate, a market rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. The discount rate is determined by the Board of Governors, while the federal funds rate is decided by the Federal Open Market Committee. The Federal Reserve announced a change in the discount rate on January 6, 2003, making it a penalty rate for banks borrowing from the Fed instead of the federal funds market. The primary rate was set at 2\u00bc% for financially sound banks, while riskier banks had to pay a higher secondary rate of 2\u00be%. Since the financial crisis in 2007, the Fed has not emphasized whether banks borrow at the discount window or in the federal funds market. The Federal Reserve announced a change in the discount rate on January 6, 2003, making it a penalty rate for banks borrowing from the Fed instead of the federal funds market. The discount rate remains slightly higher than the target rate for federal funds, which is market determined and may vary from day to day. The FOMC set a range for the federal funds target at its December 16, 2008 meeting due to difficulty in holding the actual federal funds rate at the 1% target rate set on October 29, 2008. The Federal Reserve aims to maintain the economy at a level of low inflation and unemployment by adjusting interest rates. Changes in the federal funds target rate signal shifts in monetary policy and impact financial institutions and markets globally. Unusual financial conditions, such as past crises, have also influenced Fed policy. The Russian debt crisis of 1998, the terrorist attacks of September 2001, and the financial crisis starting in 2007 influence Fed decisions on rate changes. The Fed reports to Congress twice yearly on its monetary policy, including rate changes, in oversight hearings in February and July as required by the Federal Reserve Reform Act. Monetary policy has varied since 2001, initially aimed at setting an expansion in motion by reducing the federal funds target rate from 5\u00bd% in March 2001 to 1% in June 2003. The target was gradually raised to 5\u00bc% over two years as the expansion gained momentum. Despite concerns about inflation and GDP growth, the FOMC believed inflation would moderate over time. In late summer 2007, concerns arose over falling housing prices and financial market conditions related to subprime mortgages. To address this, the Board of Governors reduced the discount rate and federal funds target rate multiple times. The economy softened in the third quarter of 2007 but rebounded in the first quarter of 2008. GDP fluctuated in 2008, with positive growth in the first two quarters but contraction in the last two quarters and the first quarter of 2009. Unemployment rate rose from 4.8% to 8.5% in 13 months, with 5.1 million job losses since December 2007. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target and discount rates multiple times in 2008, reaching a range of 0% to \u00bc%. The Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target and discount rates multiple times in 2008, reaching a range of 0% to \u00bc%. As energy prices rose, the Fed took new measures to stabilize the financial system and contain the economic contraction, with total reserves of depository institutions at $44.3 billion in March 2008. Total reserves of depository institutions were $44.3 billion in March 2008, with $41.3 billion required. One year later, reserves increased to $780 billion, with only $55.3 billion required. Initiatives announced in March 2009 could add nearly $2 trillion to reserves by the end of the year. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for June 23-24, 2009.
