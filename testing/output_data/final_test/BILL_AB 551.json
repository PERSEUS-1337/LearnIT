Chapter 2.8 (Section 1954.600) of the Civil Code addresses bed bug infestations, emphasizing the need for cooperation among landlords, tenants, and pest control operators for successful control. Early detection and reporting are crucial in preventing infestations, with tenants protected from retaliation for reporting issues. Effective control is more likely with informed landlords and tenants following best practices. The importance of cooperation between landlords, tenants, and pest control operators in identifying and controlling bed bug infestations is highlighted. Tenants need to cooperate by reducing clutter and washing clothes, while landlords should respond promptly to prevent infestations from worsening. Pest control operators with knowledge in best practices, such as those from the National Pest Management Association, are best equipped to help eradicate bed bugs. Training in bed bug management based on NPMA practices should be incorporated for licensing renewal. In this chapter, a \"pest control operator\" is defined as an individual with specific licenses from the Structural Pest Control Board. Landlords are prohibited from renting units with known bed bug infestations, and they are considered to have notice if infestation is visually evident. On and after July 1, 2017, landlords must provide written notice to prospective tenants before creating a new tenancy for a dwelling unit. The notice, in at least 10-point type, includes information on bed bug identification, prevention, and reporting suspected infestations to the landlord. All other tenants must receive this notice by January 1, 2018. Bed bugs have six legs and vary in color from red to brown. Adult bed bugs are about 1/4 inch in length, while young bed bugs are about 1/16 inch. They do not fly but can crawl or be carried from place to place. Female bed bugs lay one to five eggs per day, and they can survive for months without feeding. Bed bugs can survive for months without feeding and usually bite people at night. Symptoms of a bed bug infestation include red welts, fecal spots, molted skins, eggs, and a sweet odor in heavily infested areas. Bite marks are red and itchy, often found on exposed body parts while sleeping. Some people may not show visible signs of bed bug bites. To learn more, visit the websites of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the National Pest Management Association. The procedure to report suspected infestations to the landlord and cooperate with inspections for bed bugs elimination is necessary for tenant's cooperation. The landlord must inform tenants of pest control findings within two business days. All tenants will be notified of confirmed infestations in common areas. Section 1.5 of the bill includes amendments to the Civil Code, contingent on certain conditions."
