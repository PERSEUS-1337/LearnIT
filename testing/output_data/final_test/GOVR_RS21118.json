    "content": "The United States is the largest investor and recipient of foreign direct investment globally. Its historical approach aims to establish an open and rules-based system that benefits both the U.S. and foreign investors. The Trump Administration has not formally outlined its foreign investment policy, but has expressed openness to foreign investment. The global outward direct investment position in 2016 was around $26 trillion, with the U.S. direct investment position at $6.4 trillion. Other major overseas direct investors include Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. The Commerce Department uses three measures to publish data on U.S. direct investment position: historical cost, current cost, and market value. In 2016, U.S. direct investment abroad (USDIA) increased by $304 billion at historical cost, current cost, and market value, reaching cumulative amounts of $5.4 trillion, $5.9 trillion, and $7.4 trillion respectively. The rise in market value reflects price increases on equity assets offset by foreign exchange changes. Detailed data on foreign investment are presented on a historical cost basis, while new spending by U.S. firms abroad slightly increased in 2016. In 2016, U.S. direct investment abroad rose to $312 billion, while foreign direct investment in the United States fell by 5.0% to $479 billion. This marked a shift from previous years where U.S. investment abroad exceeded foreign investment in the U.S. economy. Foreign direct investment in the United States fell from $287 billion in 2013 to $207 billion in 2014, with a significant drop attributed to a $130 billion stock buyback between Verizon and France's Vodafone. The direction and magnitude of direct investment flows are largely determined by relative rates of growth between U.S. and foreign economies, as well as factors such as inflation, interest rates, tax rates, and economic performance expectations. In 2016, USDIA consisted mainly of reinvested earnings, equity capital, and intercompany debt, with a net flow of funds from foreign affiliates back to U.S. parent firms. Despite concerns, reinvested earnings play a significant role in financing USDIA, indicating reliance on foreign affiliates for funding. The reliance on reinvested earnings for U.S. direct investment abroad may be due to the prevalence of equity-financed investment in Europe. Market valuations of U.S. direct investment abroad increased by $2 trillion from 2012 to 2014 but declined in 2014 and 2015. Foreign firms operating in the U.S. saw a $1.6 trillion valuation increase from 2012 to 2014, with annual increases of $500 billion in 2014 and $200 billion in 2015. Foreign investment does not necessarily shift jobs overseas, as it stimulates intrafirm trade. Intrafirm trade between U.S. parent companies and foreign affiliates accounted for $315 billion in exports and imports, while foreign firms' affiliates in the U.S. accounted for $189 billion in exports and $521 billion in imports in 2014. In total, intrafirm trade made up 31% of exports and 35% of imports. The overseas direct investment position of U.S. firms reached $5.0 trillion in 2015, with 71% of it on a historical-cost basis. In 2015, U.S. firms had an overseas direct investment position of $5.0 trillion, with 71% concentrated in high-income developed countries, mainly in Europe. This trend of investing in developed countries with similar consumer tastes increased after the mid-1990s, shifting away from developing countries. In 2015, U.S. firms directed 71% of their $5.0 trillion overseas direct investment to developed economies, with 59% in Europe. The Netherlands is the largest recipient of U.S. direct investment abroad, followed by the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada, and Ireland. In 2015, U.S. firms directed a significant portion of their overseas direct investment to developed economies, with a focus on Europe. The top locations for U.S. overseas investors include the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Canada, and Ireland. Investments in these countries reflect long-standing economic relationships and shifts in the U.S. economy towards high technology services and financial industries. U.S. direct investment abroad has shifted towards high technology, finance, and services industries in developed countries with advanced infrastructure and communications systems. Investments in most sectors increased in 2015, except for banking, finance, and insurance. Holding companies mainly reflect foreign investment through existing subsidiaries. Service-oriented sectors like computer systems design continued to grow. Some Americans debate the impact of U.S. direct investment abroad, with concerns about job shifts to low-wage countries. In 2014, 10.0% of foreign affiliate sales were to U.S. parent companies, indicating that U.S. firms invest abroad primarily to serve foreign markets rather than exporting back to the United States. The intrafirm share of U.S. trade is higher than Mexico and Canada, partly due to trade agreements. US firms operating in China have 82% of their sales in China and 6% back to the United States. The USDIA is dominated by very large firms with over 10,000 employees, accounting for over three-fourths of employment. Investments by holding companies blur the data on investment flows and positions by industry and country. U.S. multinational corporations rank among the largest U.S. firms, with 40% of parent companies employing more than 2,499 persons. Large U.S. parent companies, accounting for 95% of total employment by U.S. MNCs, have a significant presence abroad. The largest 2% of foreign affiliates of U.S. parent firms employ 90% of affiliate workers. U.S. MNCs expanded globally in the 1980s-2000s but faced market challenges at home due to downsizing. The 2008-2009 global recession disproportionately impacted U.S. MNCs due to their geographic and industrial focus. In 2007, U.S. parent companies accounted for about 21% of total U.S. business activity, with their share of manufacturing activity declining from 46% in 2000 to 41%. Despite losing market positions at home, U.S. MNC parent companies doubled their direct investment abroad, leading to a shift in economic activity to foreign affiliates. By 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with more than 32,000 employees. By the end of 2014, there were over 3,790 U.S. parent companies with more than 32,000 foreign affiliates, employing over 26 million workers in the United States. Foreign firms had over 6,600 affiliates operating in the U.S., employing 13.8 million workers abroad and 6.6 million in the U.S. U.S. parent companies paid nearly 80% more in aggregate employee compensation in the U.S. than foreign affiliates. U.S. parent companies are more efficient with higher output per employee compared to U.S. affiliates of U.S. firms or foreign firms in the U.S. Foreign firms in the U.S. are more capital intensive. Foreign firms in the United States are more capital intensive compared to U.S. parent firms or affiliates, likely due to newer capital stock. U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have higher gross output than foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. However, foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have higher total sales and pay more taxes to foreign governments. U.S. parent companies with overseas affiliates also pay more taxes compared to U.S. parent companies and foreign-owned affiliates in the U.S. One concern about U.S. direct investment abroad is the perception of sending low-wage jobs overseas. Data collection on U.S. firms shifting plants or jobs abroad is limited, making it difficult to track. Anecdotal evidence suggests that while employment losses may occur at parent firms, gains in foreign subsidiaries offset this, giving the impression of job shifting. However, employment patterns are influenced by various factors, and plant location shifts by U.S. multinational firms likely play a small role. Employment among U.S. parent companies fluctuated over the years, with a decrease in the early 1980s, an increase from 1992-2000, a decline in 2000-2003 due to economic downturn, a rise post-2003, a fall in 2008, and an expansion in 2014 to reach 26.6 million. Foreign affiliates of U.S. firms also saw an increase in employment to 13.8 million in 2014, accounting for 34.4% of total U.S. multinational company employment. During economic downturns, U.S. parent firms and their foreign affiliates have experienced employment fluctuations in various industries, reflecting the interconnected nature of the global economy. Employment trends among multinational companies (MNCs) are more likely influenced by shifts within the U.S. economy rather than deliberate efforts to outsource. Foreign affiliates of U.S. parent firms have seen significant employment growth in Latin America between 2000 and 2014, indicating expanding trade links with regions like Asia. In 2014, employment among foreign affiliates of U.S. parent firms tripled in Latin America and nearly tripled in Asia, particularly in China. Affiliates in Europe fell to second place behind Asia, with Canada and Mexico experiencing modest increases. American direct investment abroad has raised questions about its impact on the U.S. economy, as multinational corporations lost shares of GDP and domestic employment declined until the mid-1990s. Overseas affiliate employment grew in some industries, including manufacturing. Some believe U.S. direct investment abroad harms American workers by shifting jobs overseas, but data shows no significant difference in job movement compared to previous periods. Most U.S. investment is in developed countries with similar markets and consumer tastes, aimed at serving local markets rather than moving jobs offshore. Foreign firms are investing record amounts in the United States to acquire existing firms, expand subsidiaries, or establish new investments. Concerns have been raised in Congress about U.S. firms shifting operations back to the U.S. and curbing tax practices that shift taxes to foreign locations."
