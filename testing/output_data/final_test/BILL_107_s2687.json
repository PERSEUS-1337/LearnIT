The National Defense Rail Connection Act of 2002 emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive rail transportation network for national defense and economic development. Government assistance in developing the transcontinental rail system has led to the growth of strong communities in the western United States. Joint use corridors for rail transportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are seen as efficient for national security and interconnectivity. Government assistance in developing the Alaska Railroad between Seward and Fairbanks led to the growth of economically strong communities in Alaska, now home to over 70% of the state's population. Despite Alaska's accessibility by land routes, there is no rail connection, which could provide controlled access and reduce environmental impacts. Originally authorized for 1,000 miles, the current rail system in Alaska falls short of this goal. The Alaska Railroad system needs to be expanded to cover the originally planned 1,000 miles to maximize its economic benefits for Alaska and the nation. This expansion would provide access to natural resources, increase Alaska's contribution to the national economy, and support national defense installations like the National Missile Defense system. The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits of this expansion. The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits of establishing a rail connection to Alaska by authorizing a U.S.-Canada commission to study the feasibility of linking the Alaska rail system to the North American rail network. In support of pending bilateral activities, the United States should undertake related activities within its borders. SEC. 3. IDENTIFICATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE RAILROAD-UTILITY CORRIDOR. Within one year of this Act's enactment, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with relevant parties, must identify a proposed national defense railroad-utility corridor in Alaska linking the Alaska Railroad to the National Missile Defense facilities at Fort Greely. The corridor must be at least 500 feet wide and include necessary facilities. Ownership and legal descriptions of the corridor must be provided. Factors to be considered include various aspects related to the corridor's development. The factors to be considered for the proposed national defense railroad-utility corridor in Alaska include proximity to defense installations, access to natural resources, alignment standards, safety, community impact, environmental concerns, use of public land, and construction costs estimation. The proposed national defense railroad-utility corridor in Alaska includes estimating construction costs, financing methods, utility elements like pipelines and power lines, and traditional land uses. The Secretary may also consider extending the corridor to connect with the North American rail network in Canada. SEC. 4. NEGOTIATION AND LAND TRANSFER. The Secretary of the Interior will negotiate the acquisition of non-federally owned lands in the corridor identified in section 3 through land exchanges. Once the lands are acquired, they will be conveyed to the Alaska Railroad Corporation for the construction of a railroad extension to the proposed national missile defense installation at Fort Greely, Alaska. The Federal interest in lands conveyed to the Alaska Railroad Corporation under this Act shall be the same as in lands conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act. Actions authorized in this Act shall proceed immediately and to conclusion despite the land-use planning provisions of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Such sums as necessary are authorized to be appropriated for carrying out the provisions of this Act."
