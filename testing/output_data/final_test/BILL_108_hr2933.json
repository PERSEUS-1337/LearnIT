The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is amended to designate critical habitat for endangered species or threatened species. The Secretary is required to issue a final regulation designating any habitat determined to be critical habitat to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for a species within one year of finalizing a recovery plan or within 3 years of determining the species as endangered or threatened. The designation can be revised periodically, and any area designated as critical habitat does not apply to authorized actions. The text chunk discusses the authorization of actions in designated critical habitat areas under specific permits, written statements, or conservation programs. It clarifies that the establishment of a recovery plan does not create regulatory requirements. Repeal of Section 4(b)(6)(C) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. SEC. 3. BASIS FOR DETERMINATION.
