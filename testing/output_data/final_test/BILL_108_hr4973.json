    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Graduation Really Achieves Dreams Act\" or the \"GRAD Act\". The Congress finds that the national high school graduation rate is low, especially in urban districts, with only 50% graduating. The graduation rates for African American and Latino students are also low. Approximately 3,000 secondary school students drop out daily, and those in the lowest 25% of achievement scores are more likely to drop out. 25% of secondary school students read at \"below basic\" levels. Low graduation rates are evident in urban districts, especially among African American and Latino students. Approximately 25% of secondary school students read at \"below basic\" levels, with poor students of color performing at a fifth or sixth-grade level in reading. Many college students struggle due to lacking basic skills, with a high percentage needing remedial courses. Completing a degree is challenging for low-income students who manage to enter college. Low-income students face challenges in completing college degrees, with only 27% from the bottom 20% income bracket graduating within eight years. High school dropouts and GED recipients have higher attrition rates in the military, leading to the Armed Services no longer accepting dropouts. Failing to graduate high school increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, with a one percent increase in graduation rates potentially saving $1.4 billion in incarceration costs. In today's workplace, nearly 8 in 10 adults with bachelor's degrees are employed, compared to about 6 in 10 high school graduates and 4 in 10 dropouts. Jobs requiring a high school degree will grow by 9%, while those needing a bachelor's degree will grow by 25% and an associate's degree by 31%. Personalization of the school environment boosts success rates for low-performing students. Research shows that 40% of high school students feel disengaged from school, with even higher rates among urban teens and minorities. This disengagement leads to a lack of effort, seeking help, and taking appropriate courses. Effective education programs that improve graduation rates start in kindergarten and continue through 12th grade. \"SEC. 3. PROJECT GRAD.\" The program authorized under this Act aims to support integrated education reform services to improve high school graduation and college enrollment rates for disadvantaged students. The Secretary is authorized to award a grant to Project GRAD USA to provide assistance to existing programs and promote the establishment of new programs implementing these services. The Secretary will enter into an agreement with the grantee to ensure that subgrantees establish and operate Project GRAD programs with the necessary technical assistance. Grant funds can be used for program costs and technical assistance. The grantee will select subgrantees serving low-income students for Project GRAD programs, establishing feeder patterns to channel students into identified high schools. Services include research-based reading programs. The grantee will provide research-based programs in reading, mathematics, and classroom management, campus-based social services programs to increase family and community involvement, a college access program with scholarships and college awareness assistance, and other necessary services to boost high school graduation and college enrollment rates. At least 75 percent of the funds received must be used for these purposes. The grantee must allocate at least 75 percent of the funds received to fund awards for subgrantees to carry out education reform services. The remaining funds are to be used for promoting public awareness of integrated education reform services to improve graduation and college enrollment rates for disadvantaged students. The Federal share for Project GRAD programs is determined based on subgrants averaging $200 per pupil, taking into account the resources available to the school and the need for assistance. The subgrantee will implement the program to improve student outcomes. Subgrants may exceed $200 per student if additional resources are unavailable. The grantee may award less than the Federal share of program costs if resources are available to the subgrantee. The Secretary will evaluate student performance every 3 years through an independent entity. The evaluation of programs funded under this section will compare reading and math achievement, high school graduation, college going, and completion rates of participating students with those of non-participating students. Grantees must require subgrantees to prepare detailed reports on program results and fund usage, including student achievement data. The report on Project GRAD programs will include data on student achievement in reading and math, high school graduation, college enrollment, and completion rates, as well as relevant financial reporting. Evaluations and reports will be available to the Secretary and relevant committees. Authorization of Appropriations: $27,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 and additional funds for the following 5 years are authorized for grants under this section. A \"low-income student\" is defined as a student from a low-income family as determined by a local educational agency."
