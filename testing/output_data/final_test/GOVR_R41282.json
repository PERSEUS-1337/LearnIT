    "content": "Increasing dependence on foreign crude oil, climate change concerns, and the desire to boost domestic rural economies have led to a growing interest in renewable biofuels as an alternative to petroleum in the U.S. transportation sector. To address the higher production costs of renewable energy, U.S. policymakers have implemented various policies since the late 1970s to support biofuels production and use, including tax credits, import tariffs, research grants, and loans for infrastructure development. The report discusses the development of biofuels production infrastructure and federal policies shaping the U.S. biofuels sector. Biofuels are fuels produced from biological materials, with ethanol and biodiesel being the principal types. Biomass, organic matter that can be converted into energy, is a key component in biofuel production. Biomass, including food crops, energy crops, crop residues, wood waste, and animal manure, is a key component in biofuel production. The definition of biomass has evolved to include diverse sources like algae, construction debris, and food waste, impacting federal biofuels programs such as the Renewable Fuels Standard. The Renewable Fuels Standard categorizes biofuels into total renewable fuels, advanced renewable fuels, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel based on feedstock, production process, and greenhouse gas emissions. Criticism arises from the formal definition of biomass, with concerns about excluding potential future feedstocks. Algae-based biofuels are currently not included in the RFS cellulosic biofuels category. Algae-based biofuels do not qualify for the RFS cellulosic biofuels mandate but are eligible for the \"advanced other\" biofuels mandate, along with the cellulosic biofuels tax credit and depreciation allowance for qualifying plants. This differentiation may hinder investments in algae-based biofuels. Ethanol, made from fermenting sugars, is the primary biofuel in the US and can be produced from various feedstocks like sugar beets, sugar cane, corn, trees, grasses, and agricultural wastes containing cellulose. Since the late 1970s, U.S. biofuels output has mainly relied on ethanol from corn starch, with small amounts from sorghum, wheat, barley, and brewery waste. Brazil, the second-largest ethanol producer, uses sugar cane as the main feedstock. In 2012, the U.S. and Brazil produced 88% of the world's ethanol, with over 95% in the U.S. coming from corn starch. Interest has grown in developing motor fuels from cellulosic biomass materials to reduce reliance on corn production for ethanol. The development of motor fuels from cellulosic biomass materials is being pursued to reduce reliance on corn production for ethanol. However, the technology for converting cellulose into sugars for biofuels is expensive and not yet scaled up commercially. Biodiesel, made from organic-based oils like vegetable oils and animal fats, is the next significant biofuel in the United States. Biodiesel is primarily made from vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste restaurant grease. In the United States, soybean oil is the main feedstock, while rapeseed oil is used in the European Union and canola oil in Canada. The use of cheaper animal fats and palm oil has increased due to high vegetable oil prices. Ethanol is mainly used as a gasoline substitute, while biodiesel's value lies in its end use as a diesel fuel substitute. Other potential biofuels in the U.S. market include alcohols like methanol and butanol produced from biomass. Biodiesel and ethanol are valuable as gasoline additives and substitutes for diesel and home heating oil. They can also be used in jet fuel and to meet federal mandates under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The RFS requires blending renewable fuels in U.S. transportation fuel, with specific quotas for different types of biofuels. Administered by the EPA, biofuels must meet criteria on greenhouse gas emissions and feedstock production. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels based on specific criteria for greenhouse gas emissions and feedstock production. Government policy creates demand for biofuels regardless of price, with ethanol being used as an additive in gasoline for cleaner combustion. Ethanol production processes vary but share the same value determinants. The demand for biofuels is driven by government policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates the use of biofuels based on specific criteria. Ethanol is used as an additive in gasoline to improve engine combustion and meet federally mandated minimum usage requirements. Biodiesel can be used as a substitute for petroleum-based diesel transportation fuel, home heating oil, blend in jet fuel, or as an additive to meet RFS categories for qualifying biofuels. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates the use of biofuels based on specific criteria, leading to different valuations for RFS biofuels categories based on scarcity. Each gallon of qualifying biofuel has a renewable identification number (RIN) detached at blending to prove RFS usage fulfillment. Surplus RINs can be sold or stored for future RFS mandates, creating secondary markets by biofuel type when supply tightens. The supply of a specific biofuel type tightens relative to its RFS mandate, affecting RIN values. Biofuels must compete in the marketplace with petroleum-based fuels once RFS blending mandates are met, leading fuel blenders to be sensitive to price relationships. Ethanol, with lower energy content than gasoline, is particularly impacted. Ethanol's value is impacted by its lower energy content compared to gasoline, leading consumers to pay only about 68% of the price of gasoline for ethanol. From 2006 to 2011, ethanol production and consumption exceeded federally mandated levels. However, economic conditions changed in 2012 due to a severe drought, increasing the role of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in driving ethanol use. Biodiesel's use is mainly driven by federal policies like the RFS biomass-based diesel and biodiesel production tax credit, as it is more expensive to produce than petroleum-based counterparts. In 2013, the \"blend wall\" emerged as a constraint on U.S. ethanol consumption due to automakers' reluctance to warranty vehicles for higher ethanol blend ratios. The 10% blend ratio represents the upper limit for ethanol in gasoline, given current vehicle and infrastructure compatibility. In 2013, ethanol accounted for nearly a 10% share of blended gasoline sold in the United States. The RFS mandates for non-advanced ethanol may exceed the blend wall in 2013, with carry-over RINs likely to help meet the requirements. However, surpassing the blend wall could be challenging in 2014 due to infrastructure constraints. Excess ethanol production beyond the blend wall may have limited value domestically unless used in flex-fuel vehicles or exported internationally. In the 1970s, federal policies were implemented to promote energy independence by exempting ethanol from motor fuels excise tax and providing a tax credit. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 favored ethanol blending due to its oxygenate characteristic. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) promoted ethanol blending with reformulated gasoline (RFG) by requiring a 2% oxygen content, leading to the use of oxygenates like MTBE and ethanol. A tax credit for small ethanol producers was also established in 1990 to support the industry's growth. The U.S. biofuels industry saw significant growth from 1980 to 2001, with ethanol production increasing from 175 million gallons to 1.8 billion gallons. Federal involvement also increased in the 2000s with the Bioenergy Program providing payments to biofuel producers to encourage the use of farm commodities in biofuel production. Legislation further supported the industry's growth. The U.S. biofuels industry experienced significant growth from 1980 to 2001, with ethanol production increasing from 175 million gallons to 1.8 billion gallons. Federal legislation in the 2000s, such as the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000 and the 2002 farm bill, supported research, production, and use of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 also played a role in amending legislation to further aid the biofuels industry. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-148) expanded grants, contracts, and assistance for biomass, increased funding availability for programs, and established a program to accelerate adoption of biomass-related technologies. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357) provided an excise tax credit for ethanol production. These legislative actions boosted the U.S. biofuels industry in the early 2000s. The U.S. biofuels industry received a boost in the early 2000s due to water contamination issues from MTBE storage tanks. California requested a waiver from the EPA in 1999, but it was denied in 2001. Legislation to phase out MTBE was passed in 16 states by 2003. Between October 1, 2003, and January 1, 2004, over 43% of MTBE consumption in the United States was banned, leading to an additional demand for ethanol of 2.73 billion gallons in 2004. Investments in the biofuels sector increased, with the number of ethanol plants growing from 50 in 1999 to 81 in 2005. U.S. ethanol production rose to 3.9 billion gallons by 2005, using over 14% of the nation's corn crop. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 further boosted the ethanol sector, creating favorable economic conditions that lasted through most of 2006. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT; P.L. 109-58) was signed into law on August 8, 2005, containing provisions for agriculture-based renewable energy production, biofuels research and funding, biofuels tax credits, and the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS1). Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 caused damage to petroleum infrastructure, driving up gasoline prices. Corn prices remained low, leading to high profitability for the ethanol sector. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 led to a period of extreme profitability for the U.S. ethanol industry due to high ethanol prices and low corn prices. This resulted in a surge in investment in new ethanol plants, doubling production capacity in just four years. The establishment of the Renewable Fuels Standard guaranteed a market for ethanol production, reducing investment risk for the sector. The ethanol industry in the United States experienced significant growth from 2005 to 2009, with ethanol production increasing from 4.4 bgals to 10.6 bgals in 170 plants. Corn remained the primary feedstock for ethanol production, surpassing U.S. corn exports in 2007. The Renewable Fuels Standard was outgrown in 2006, leading to the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140) expanded the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandate, requiring the use of 9 bgals of biofuels in 2008 and increasing to 36 bgals annually by 2022. The mandate specified that only 15 bgals of annual RFS-qualifying biofuels could be ethanol from corn starch, with the rest to be met by advanced biofuels. Additionally, at least 16 bgals must be derived from cellulosic feedstock by 2022, and specific volume requirements were established for biomass-based diesel fuels. Agricultural commodity prices started rising in late 2006, coinciding with the implementation of the new mandate. The rise in commodity prices, particularly for corn and crude oil, reached record levels in mid-2008, impacting the profits of the U.S. biofuels sector and sparking a debate on the use of corn for ethanol. Economists attribute the price surge to factors beyond biofuels policy. The strong growth in ethanol demand for corn led to price increases in various agricultural markets. However, by mid-2008, prices plummeted due to the global financial crisis. This volatility raised concerns about the impact of biofuels expansion on energy security. The 2008 farm bill extended and expanded biofuels programs. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) extended and expanded biofuels programs, including tax incentives and tariffs on ethanol imports. It emphasized research and development of advanced and cellulosic bioenergy to avoid unintended consequences of relying on major field crops. The bill also established a new tax credit for cellulosic biofuel and covered a wide range of energy and agricultural topics, providing grants and loans for biofuels. The 2008 farm bill expanded biofuels programs, emphasizing research on advanced bioenergy like cellulosic ethanol. Energy grants and loans support initiatives such as the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels and the Repowering Assistance Program. Programs like REAP assist rural communities in becoming more energy-efficient. Cellulosic feedstocks like switchgrass and woody biomass are prioritized in research and funding. BCAP, Biorefinery Assistance Program, and Forest Biomass for Energy Program provide support for alternative feedstock resources and infrastructure. Title VII of the 2008 farm bill promotes research, development, and demonstration of biomass-based renewable energy and biofuels. One major policy issue was the impact of ethanol-driven expansion of U.S. corn production, leading to high commodity prices. The bill requires reports on the economic impacts of ethanol production. Funding for bioenergy programs was limited, with only about $1 billion in mandatory funding and slightly over $100 million in discretionary funding available during the life of the bill. $100 million in discretionary funding was available during the 2008 farm bill (FY2008-FY2012). Major Title IX bioenergy programs expired in FY2012 with no baseline funding going forward. The bill was extended through FY2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, but most bioenergy provisions lacked new mandatory funding. U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2007 and has been declining due to a weak economy and improved vehicle fuel economy. In 2010, U.S. ethanol consumption reached 12.9 billion gallons. In 2010, U.S. ethanol consumption reached an estimated 12.9 billion gallons, representing about 9.3% of annual gasoline transportation demand. Strong global economic growth and events in international feed grain markets contributed to record U.S. agricultural export values in 2010 and 2011, with ethanol production consuming 40% of the U.S. corn crop. Combined strong demand from export markets and ethanol led to low ending stock projections for U.S. corn and soybeans in 2010 and 2011, causing a surge in agricultural commodity prices. This also impacted other sectors of the U.S. economy. Interest in importing sugar-based ethanol from Brazil to meet biofuel requirements increased, with U.S. sugar-ethanol imports peaking in 2006. Market factors in 2010-2012, such as ethanol production nearing capacity and high sugar prices, influenced the ethanol market. In early 2012, high market prices and ideal planting conditions in the US led to record corn plantings. USDA projected a 2012 corn harvest of 14.8 billion bushels, resulting in a build-up of corn stocks. However, extreme heat in mid-June affected crop yields in the Central and Southern Plains and the Corn Belt. In August 2012, USDA drastically lowered its forecast for U.S. corn production to 10.8 billion bushels due to a \"flash drought\" in the Central and Southern Plains and the Corn Belt. This led to a 27% drop from the initial forecast in May, with corn prices rising sharply to $8.20 per bushel. Stocks of feed grains and soybeans were expected to reach historic low levels by the end of the 2012/2013 crop year. Ethanol production also declined in 2012 due to high production costs, leading to the idling of several ethanol facilities. In 2012, U.S. ethanol production declined to 13.3 billion gallons due to low corn supplies. The outlook for 2013 is also dampened, with ethanol production possibly falling below 2012 levels. Despite this, RFS mandates for biofuel use continued to grow in 2013. National transportation consumption of gasoline-type fuels was projected to be slightly under 131 bgals in 2013, with an implied ethanol blend wall of about 13 bgals. The price for renewable identification numbers (RINs) for basic renewable ethanol soared from under $0.05 per gallon. The price of ethanol (D6) rose sharply from under $0.05 per gallon in 2012 to over $1.00 per gallon in early March 2013, leading to an increase in RIN values for fuel blenders. The rapid RIN price increase is attributed to the collision of RFS mandates and the ethanol blend wall, which may require the use of accumulated RIN stocks for mandate compliance in 2013 and 2014. The expanded RFS2 is expected to have a significant impact on the U.S. biofuels sector, with uncertainties regarding spillover effects in other markets and policy goals. The rapid expansion of U.S. corn ethanol production, using over 40% of the 2011 and 2012 corn crops, raises concerns about sustainability and unintended consequences in other markets. Questions also arise about meeting the RFS mandate for biofuels from non-corn sources due to slow development in production capacity and high feedstock prices. Success in the biofuels sector may hinge on shifting away from traditional row crops like corn or soybeans for processing feedstock. The shift away from traditional row crops like corn or soybeans for biofuels production is crucial for sustainability. Federal policies aim to develop a cellulosic biofuels industry using biomass like prairie grass or algae. However, the uncertainty of new technologies hinders private-sector investment in this sector. U.S. ethanol production is concentrated in the central and western Corn Belt, where corn supplies are abundant. U.S. ethanol production capacity is concentrated in the central and western Corn Belt, with Iowa leading as the top ethanol-producing state. The total annual U.S. ethanol production capacity, including existing and under-construction plants, exceeds the RFS2 corn-starch ethanol quota for 2013. The top six Corn Belt states account for nearly 75% of national production, with actual operating capacity representing about 89% of nameplate capacity. Biodiesel production in several states, including Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, and others, is below capacity due to high feedstock costs. U.S. biodiesel was traditionally made from soybean oil, but producers have shifted to cheaper vegetable oils and animal fats. The American Soybean Association advocates for government support, but producers have diversified their sources. Ethanol production facilities have also adopted new technologies in recent years. In recent years, ethanol production facilities have added technology to extract corn oil from distillers grains and solubles, creating an additional income stream. The corn oil is mainly used as an energy supplement in livestock feed and for biodiesel production. Biodiesel is a nontoxic, biodegradable fuel that offers similar performance to petroleum diesel, with superior lubricity and emission improvements. Biodiesel, a renewable fuel, is compatible with existing diesel vehicles and infrastructure. In 2012, U.S. biodiesel consumption accounted for 1.5% of national diesel transportation fuel use. Biodiesel can also be used for non-transportation activities like home heating and power generation. In 2012, 53.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel were used for heating, power generation, railroad, and vessel traffic in the U.S., totaling 106.7 billion gallons. Fuel blenders and consumers closely monitor biodiesel prices compared to petroleum-based diesel. The profitability of the biodiesel industry is determined by the price relationship between vegetable oils and petroleum diesel. Soybean oil prices have averaged over $0.50/lb since late 2010, making the vegetable oil feedstock component of biodiesel cost over $3.75/gal. Wholesale biodiesel prices range from $4.50/gal. to $5.00/gal., higher than petroleum diesel wholesale prices of $3.05/gallon. The biodiesel industry relies on federal support to survive, with prices ranging from $4.50/gal. to $5.00/gal. compared to petroleum diesel at $3.05/gallon. The U.S. biodiesel industry began in the late 1990s, with production initially less than 1 million gallons. Federal incentives, such as tax credits, have driven investments in biodiesel plants. The biodiesel industry in the U.S. received a boost from market and policy developments, leading to all biodiesel qualifying for a $1.00 per gallon credit. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the biodiesel tax credit and established a Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit. Soybean oil prices were relatively low during 2000-2006, compared to prices since 2007. Biomass-based diesel was not initially part of the biofuels mandate. Biomass-based diesel (BBD) was added as a distinct category in the RFS2 mandate created under EISA of 2007. The U.S. biodiesel industry faced challenges due to rising vegetable oil prices relative to diesel fuel, leading to decreased demand after the financial crisis of late 2008. The financial crisis of late 2008 and the economic recession led to a drop in petroleum prices, affecting demand for transportation fuel. U.S. biodiesel producers benefited from exporting to the EU until anti-dumping tariffs were imposed in 2009, causing a significant decline in exports and impacting the U.S. biodiesel industry. The U.S. biodiesel industry faced challenges in 2009 and 2010, with bankruptcies and reduced production due to economic conditions and the expiration of the biodiesel tax credit. Production fell to 516 million gallons in 2009 and 343 million gallons in 2010. However, the industry saw a revival in 2011 with record production of 967 million gallons, following the renewal of the tax credit and an expanded biodiesel usage mandate. In 2011, the biodiesel industry saw a revival with record production of 967 million gallons. The biodiesel tax credit and producer credit were extended through 2013, supporting production. In 2012, biodiesel production reached 969 million gallons, surpassing the previous year's record. The RFS2 biodiesel mandate grew to 1 billion gallons in 2012, with expectations for production to exceed 1.28 billion gallons in 2013 and beyond. The biodiesel industry experienced a revival in 2011, reaching record production levels. By 2022, advanced biofuels, including biodiesel, are projected to increase to 21 billion gallons. Slow progress in cellulosic biofuel production may lead to biodiesel fulfilling part of the advanced biofuel mandate, impacting vegetable oil markets. Biodiesel production utilizes vegetable oils and animal fats, leading to a wider geographic distribution of plants compared to ethanol. The biodiesel industry in the United States saw significant changes due to economic conditions, tax credit delays, and fluctuating soybean prices from 2009 to 2012. This led to the closure of some plants in traditional crop areas and the emergence of new plants near alternative oil sources, resulting in a more diversified industry with a total annual production capacity of 2.1 billion gallons per year. The U.S. biodiesel industry is more diversified and less centralized than the ethanol industry, with the top six producing states accounting for only 58% of national capacity. The demand for biofuels as a transportation fuel is influenced by the size and fuel economy of the U.S. vehicle fleet, as well as the infrastructure needed for delivery to consumers at the retail level. 73% of U.S. transportation fuel is consumed as gasoline or gasoline blends, while the remainder is consumed as diesel fuel, requiring different infrastructure for delivery. The U.S. biodiesel industry is less centralized than the ethanol industry. The U.S. vehicle fleet consumes 73% gasoline or gasoline blends, with the remainder as diesel fuel, requiring different infrastructure for delivery. There were 250.2 million registered passenger vehicles in the U.S. in 2011, including flex-fuel vehicles capable of using ethanol blends. Pure ethanol cannot be used in the same infrastructure as retail gasoline due to physical properties and engine compatibility issues. Prior to October 2010, the amount of ethanol that could be blended in gasoline for standard vehicle motors was limited to 10% (E10) by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. Most vehicle warranties did not cover motor damage from ethanol blends above 10%. Flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) were the only ones capable of using higher ethanol blends, creating a \"blend wall\" for ethanol introduction into the gasoline pool. The U.S. ethanol industry advocates for raising the blending ratio from 10% to 15% or 20% to surpass the \"blend wall\" and meet RFS mandates. EIA's projections show a need for increased consumption at higher blending ratios to reach 20-27 billion gallons. The U.S. ethanol industry aims to increase the blending ratio to meet RFS mandates. EIA projects a decrease in gasoline consumption by 2022, leading to biofuels representing nearly 20% of the market. Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase the ethanol concentration to 15% (E15). The EPA issued a partial waiver in October 2010 for gasoline with up to 15% ethanol blend (E15) for model year 2007 and newer passenger vehicles. In January 2011, the waiver was expanded to include model years 2001 through 2006, but not for older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines. This restriction aims to prevent mis-fueling with higher ethanol blends. The approval of E15 use in model year 2001 and newer passenger vehicles covered 62% of U.S. roads by the end of 2010. However, two factors prevent a blend wall expansion to 15%: U.S. automakers have not extended warranties for ethanol blends above 10%, and older vehicles are not eligible for E15, limiting ethanol retail opportunities. Increasing ethanol use in flex-fuel vehicles at higher blend ratios like E85 is a long-term alternative but requires substantial infrastructure development. Increased E85 use requires infrastructure development, including more storage tanks and retail pumps. Over 14 million FFVs were on the roads in 2012, but not all have access to E85 pumps. Only 2% of retail stations in the US offer E85. Ethanol must compete with gasoline at blend ratios above 10% to be a viable transportation fuel. Federal biofuels programs have been crucial for the success of the U.S. biofuels industry, particularly ethanol and biodiesel. These policies were initially aimed at jumpstarting the industry when production capacity and market demand were low. One alternative to expand biofuel use is to produce \"drop-in\" biofuels like butanol that can be used with existing petroleum infrastructure, although they are more expensive to produce. Competitive pricing with gasoline on an energy-content or miles-per-gallon basis is essential for biofuels to be viable as a transportation fuel. Federal policy played a crucial role in supporting biofuels production capacity and closing the price gap with petroleum fuels during the rapid growth period of 2006-2011. Federal support peaked in 2011 with $7.7 billion in direct support, but decreased to $1.3 billion in 2012 due to expired tax credits. The debate over government subsidies and mandates for biofuels production has led to both proponents and critics emerging. The oversight and implementation of federal biofuels policies involve multiple government agencies, primarily the EPA, USDA, and DOE. Proponents argue that government support for agriculture-based biofuels production is justified by national energy security, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased domestic demand for U.S.-produced farm products. They also highlight the environmental benefits of biofuels compared to petroleum products and the potential for rural income growth and employment opportunities. Critics question the economic competitiveness of current biofuels production without subsidies, suggesting that technological advancements are needed. They argue that subsidies distort energy market incentives and divert funds from other renewable energy sources. Additionally, critics doubt the feasibility of biofuels production to offset petroleum imports and question the rationale behind promoting biofuels for energy security. Critics from the petroleum industry argue against the economic costs of biofuels blending requirements. Environmental groups believe that focusing on alternative energy sources hinders conservation efforts. Geographic lines play a role in biofuels policy debates, with Midwest states supporting federal policy while East and West Coast states feel mandates are costly. Conflict arises among corn users, as livestock producers face higher feed costs due to increased biofuels corn demand. Livestock producers criticize federal biofuels support due to rising feed costs from increased corn demand. Federal programs have historically supported the biofuels industry through tax credits, import tariffs, and usage mandates. Additionally, the industry receives indirect support through research grants and financial assistance for feedstock development and infrastructure. Various tax credits and incentives have been available for biofuels production, blending, and sale. These credits are rarely extended for more than a year or two at a time and require congressional action for extension. The American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012 extended producer and small producer tax credits for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and cellulosic biofuels through 2013. The most-favored-nation duty on imported ethanol, set at $0.54 per gallon for fuel use, expired on December 31, 2011. The 2.5% ad valorem tariff on ethanol remains permanent unless the HTS code changes. Brazilian sugarcane ethanol faced barriers due to tariffs, but could enter duty-free if dehydrated in CBI countries, supplying up to 7% of the U.S. ethanol market. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires blending renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel in U.S. transportation fuel. Administered by the EPA, fuel blenders must increase the amount of renewable fuel blended annually from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. Only 15 billion gallons can be ethanol from corn starch, with the remaining 21 billion gallons from advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuels and biomass-based diesel. Qualifying biofuels must meet criteria on greenhouse gas emissions and feedstock production. Several biofuels programs have been created to support research and development of technology, infrastructure development, and cellulosic plant investment. Federal programs and state incentives promote the use of bio-based products and renewable fuel research and production. The U.S. biofuels industry benefits from federal and state incentives, regulations, and programs supporting renewable fuel research and production. Federal farm programs provide price and income support, encouraging greater production and lower prices for agricultural feedstocks. This helps lower production costs for the U.S. biofuels sector and makes U.S. biofuels more competitive globally. The federal biofuels tax credit provisions and import tariff on foreign-produced ethanol are key issues for the next farm bill. Concerns include the expiration of program authority, lack of mandatory funding for energy-related provisions, redundancy across renewable energy programs, slow development of U.S. cellulosic biofuels sector, and spillover effects of increasing corn use for ethanol production. Many provisions of the 2008 farm bill were extended through FY2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The Taxpayer Relief Act extended biofuels policy provisions from the 2008 farm bill through FY2013, but major bioenergy programs have no new mandatory funding. Policymakers will need to find offsets to continue these programs. The 2008 farm bill authorized $1.1 billion in mandatory funding for energy programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, and Rural Energy programs. The Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels received $255 million in funding, while the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) received $255 million. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) had open-ended funding initially, but Congress later set limits on mandatory funding. Major farm-bill energy programs did not have baseline funding after FY2012, requiring new revenues or cuts to extend them. Ethanol tax credits and import duties expired in 2011, but cellulosic biofuel and biodiesel tax credits are set to expire in 2013. The industries are expected to lobby for extensions. Investors are slow to invest in cellulosic biofuels due to the unproven technology. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) aims to kick-start the industry by supporting new feedstocks. The biodiesel tax credit is projected to cost $1.28 billion in tax expenditures in 2012, while the cellulosic biofuels tax credit is projected to cost about $14 million. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) aims to support the establishment and production of eligible crops for bioenergy conversion and assist landowners with collection, harvest, storage, and transportation of materials for biomass facilities. Concerns about eligibility, funding, and sustainability may impact future congressional decisions on the program's reauthorization in the next farm bill, as BCAP lacks baseline budget spending beyond FY2012, potentially requiring offset funding. The EPA administers the RFS program, determining renewable fuel production pathways and mandate levels based on production capacity. Congress debates bills to modify current biofuels programs due to cost constraints and differing opinions. EPA may issue waivers if production capacity is insufficient for certain biofuel categories. The EPA administers the RFS program, determining renewable fuel production pathways and mandate levels based on production capacity. Congress debates bills to modify biofuels programs due to cost constraints and differing opinions. EPA may issue waivers for biofuel categories if production capacity is insufficient. The RFS mandates the use of over 16.55 bgals of biofuels in 2013, growing to 20.5 bgals by 2015 and 36 bgals by 2022. EPA adjusts mandates annually based on biofuel production projections. EPA announces biofuels standards for upcoming years in the spring through a notice of proposed rulemaking, with final rules issued by November 30 of the preceding year. EPA has already waived the original RFS2 mandate. The EPA has waived the original RFS2 mandate for cellulosic biofuels for the first three years and is likely to waive it for a fourth year. Future EPA waivers could deter capital investments in the sector. Meeting RFS mandates for traditional biofuels depends on the \"blend wall\" and the slow emergence of a national infrastructure. The expansion of the blending ratio to 15% for newer passenger vehicles may not occur due to infrastructure limitations, creating a barrier to expanded biofuels use by 2015. EPA is responsible for evaluating renewable fuel production under EISA. The EPA is responsible for evaluating renewable fuel production under EISA, including assessing compliance with GHG reduction thresholds based on lifecycle emissions. Concerns have been raised about increased field crop production for ethanol leading to commodity price hikes and potential land use changes. Ethanol production has led to commodity price increases, inducing increased land cultivation in other countries and resulting in higher global GHG emissions. The measurement of indirect land use changes (ILUC) is challenging due to various factors involved. The EPA's lifecycle GHG reduction analysis, including ILUC, has been controversial. Initially, EPA models were sensitive to ILUC assumptions, potentially excluding some biofuels from the RFS. Updated models in 2009 showed corn-starch ethanol achieving a 21% GHG emissions reduction, meeting the 20% threshold. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that GHGs are air pollutants covered under the Clean Air Act, allowing the EPA to regulate them. This decision impacts the future changes to EPA models and their ability to include or exclude certain biofuels in meeting RFS mandates. The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA allows EPA to regulate GHGs without further congressional action, impacting biofuels inclusion in RFS mandates. A Senate resolution to block EPA regulation was defeated, and California established a Low Carbon Fuels Standard in 2007. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) collaborated with various agencies to develop protocols for measuring the \"life-cycle carbon intensity\" of transportation fuels. The Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lowering the carbon content of transportation fuels used in California. Unlike the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the LCFS evaluates each fuel individually based on its demonstrated level of lifecycle GHG emissions. Biofuels must demonstrate lower lifecycle GHG emissions than the fossil fuels they replace, achieved through various methods like using natural gas instead of coal for processing ethanol. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) collaborates with agencies to measure the carbon intensity of transportation fuels. The LCFS aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by lowering the carbon content of fuels. Using tallow or recycled cooking oils instead of soybean oil can lower carbon intensities. CARB includes ILUC impact in its modeling efforts, affecting ethanol production eligibility for California's LCFS. This has implications for meeting federal RFS mandates, as California is a major consumer of gasoline and ethanol. The ILUC inclusion sparked reactions from biofuel proponents due to ambiguous cross-country effects measurement. In late 2010, CARB integrated ILUC research into the LCFS regulation. On November 9, 2011, CARB updated the list of biofuel production facilities, adding 111 new pathways. On November 26, 2012, CARB published the \"Final Regulation Order\" detailing the compliance schedule and carbon intensity lookup table. Ethanol groups filed a lawsuit on December 24, 2009, claiming the LCFS violated the U.S. Constitution. On December 29, 2011, a U.S. district judge ruled on the legality of California's LCFS law. The U.S. district judge ruled that California's LCFS law violated the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause, halting enforcement. CARB's request for a stay of injunction was granted, allowing enforcement until the appeal ruling. U.S. ethanol exports reached a record high in 2011 due to blending wall limits and a decrease in Brazil's exports. In 2011, U.S. ethanol exports reached a record high, driven by blending wall limits and decreased exports from Brazil. The top destinations were Brazil, Canada, and the EU, all with biofuels mandates. However, large U.S. ethanol exports may conflict with national energy security goals and lead to trade disputes. EU policies have supported renewable energy and GHG reductions, leading to a strong domestic renewable energy industry. The EU implemented a 20-20-20 plan aiming for a 20% reduction in GHG emissions, a 20% increase in renewable energy use (with 10% in transport), and a 20% decrease in overall energy consumption. They also set a mandate for renewable content in transportation fuels, limiting food-based biofuels to 5% to meet the 10% target by 2020. EU ethanol producers raised concerns about subsidized U.S. ethanol imports, leading to requests for anti-dumping measures. The EU initiated an investigation into whether U.S. exporters sold ethanol at unfair prices and were backed by subsidies, hurting EU biofuel producers. ePURE requested an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation. The Renewable Fuels Association pointed out that ethanol tax credits were not available to U.S. ethanol producers. EU concluded after a 15-month investigation that U.S. domestic ethanol producers were not at fault. The EU imposed a 9.5% anti-dumping duty on U.S. bioethanol imports due to illegal subsidies. U.S. senators requested a WTO challenge to the decision. The EU imposed a 9.5% anti-dumping duty on U.S. bioethanol imports due to illegal subsidies, leading to potential implications for U.S. ethanol exports. The United States may seek international markets for surplus domestic supplies amidst constraints on ethanol consumption and tight global supplies."
