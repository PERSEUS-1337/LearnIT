    "content": "Major earthquakes worldwide, like those in Japan in 2011 and 2016, highlight the seismic risk to America's infrastructure, including highways. Concerns stem from protecting public safety, aiding response efforts, and minimizing economic loss. While seismic resilience has improved with investments in new infrastructure and retrofitting, some highways remain at risk. Limited national data exist on the seismic risk to U.S. highways. The federal government supports state and local entities in assessing and addressing seismic risks to U.S. highway infrastructure. They provide data on seismic hazards, assist in developing construction standards, and invest in improving the resiliency of specific highway structures. This report focuses on the earthquake risk to highway systems, particularly bridges, and discusses federal and nonfederal actions taken to mitigate these risks. Seismic risk to the U.S. highway system is determined by three factors: likelihood of seismic events, vulnerability of highway structures, and potential consequences. Seismic hazards are greatest in the western United States, particularly in California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Hawaii. Seismic hazards in the U.S. are most prevalent in the western states like California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Hawaii. The timing and characteristics of earthquakes cannot be accurately predicted, but efforts are made to update seismic hazard maps with better data. Highway vulnerability to earthquakes depends on design and condition, with potential consequences affecting public safety, recovery efforts, and national defense. Actions can be taken to manage seismic risk despite its uncontrollable nature. Human-induced earthquakes, or \"induced seismicity,\" are a growing concern in the United States due to wastewater injection in deep disposal wells. This short-term hazard is different from natural tectonic forces, as it depends on injection activity. Efforts are being made to address the increase in earthquake activity associated with deep-well injection. The USGS updated seismic hazard maps for the central and eastern United States to include a one-year forecast that considers natural and induced earthquakes. Human-induced earthquakes from deep-well injection pose a temporal hazard, potentially affecting U.S. highway infrastructure. There is a lack of national data on the seismic vulnerability of highways, but states with high seismic hazards have taken steps to address this issue. Many states with high seismic hazards have assessed the vulnerability of highway components and ranked infrastructure based on this. Industry standards now require increased seismic resiliency in highway construction and retrofitting. Guidelines developed by AASHTO and FHWA for seismic design of bridges have been adopted nationally. The AASHTO guidelines for seismic design of bridges became a national standard in 1992. FHWA has provided retrofitting guidelines for tunnels, culverts, and pavements since 2006. Efforts to reduce seismic vulnerability have shifted from structures to highway systems, with FHWA developing software to estimate capacity loss in localities due to earthquakes. The performance of highway bridges is crucial for the seismic performance of a highway system. Western states adopted seismic design practices after the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, while states in the New Madrid seismic zone did not adopt standards until the early 1990s. National seismic bridge design standards have been in place since 1992, regularly updated to incorporate lessons learned from earthquakes. Many older bridges remain vulnerable to seismic hazards. Many bridges in the New Madrid seismic zone were built before 1990 and may not withstand seismic hazards. The current industry standard for new bridges is to design for the most intense earthquake expected in a 1,000-year period. This standard determines the need and cost of seismic bridge design and retrofitting. The seismic design standard for bridges is roughly 7% and is adopted by AASHTO in consultation with DOT and other stakeholders. Some states like South Carolina and California have stricter standards. Vulnerable older bridges, especially in West Coast states, have been retrofitted for seismic resilience. Tunnels are generally less vulnerable to seismic hazards than bridges, unless they cross a geologic fault. Damage to tunnels can have significant consequences for highway systems. The seismic design standard for bridges is roughly 7% and is adopted by AASHTO in consultation with DOT and other stakeholders. Some states like South Carolina and California have stricter standards. Vulnerable older bridges, especially in West Coast states, have been retrofitted for seismic resilience. Tunnels are generally less vulnerable to seismic hazards than bridges, unless they cross a geologic fault. Damage to tunnels can have significant consequences for highway systems, with tunnels often linking highway systems with little redundancy. Other highway structures like pavements, retaining walls, and culverts can also pose risks during seismic events, leading to erosion, flooding, and the need for rapid repair. The FHWA published a manual in 2006 providing guidance on seismic evaluation and retrofit for these structures, recommending a two-tier design approach with a focus on achieving a fully operational performance level for most infrastructure components. The FHWA guidance recommends a performance level for infrastructure to ensure life safety and operation during rare earthquakes. AASHTO lacks formal seismic standards for highway structures other than bridges. State governments decide whether to retrofit or replace vulnerable highway structures using federal and state funds. The FHWA guidance recommends performance levels for infrastructure during rare earthquakes. State governments prioritize retrofitting highway structures based on vulnerability, site characteristics, and importance to the highway system. California's Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program is the largest in the country, costing about $11 billion for retrofitting 2,200 state-owned bridges after the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes. According to CalTrans, the seismic retrofit programs cost around $11 billion, with most funding going to retrofit large toll bridges. While most of this work is completed, efforts and funding are now focused on retrofitting hundreds of bridges owned by local governments. A study identified nearly 13,000 vulnerable bridges in seven states in the New Madrid seismic zone that may require retrofitting to meet current standards. Seismic retrofitting of highway infrastructure is eligible for federal highway funds distributed to states. Seismic retrofitting of highway infrastructure is eligible for federal highway funds distributed to states, with states generally required to provide a portion of the funding for specific projects. Federal funds may assist with retrofitting costs, but using federal money for this purpose means it cannot be used for other highway or bridge improvements. Additional federal funds have been allocated for infrastructure improvements, such as the seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge authorized under TEA-21 in 1998. The DOT and FHWA fund seismic hazard research and training, coordinate with other federal agencies, and provide funding for the Highway Research and Development Program to study vulnerabilities of the transportation system to seismic activities. The FAST Act authorized $125 million annually for FY2016 through FY2020 for this program. The FAST Act authorized funding for the Highway Research and Development Program and the Technology and Innovation Deployment Program for FY2016 through FY2020. States are required to set aside 2% of highway funds for the State Planning and Research Program. The National Highway Institute offers courses on bridge seismic design, and the federal government supports earthquake hazard assessment through the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. Coordination for earthquake risk reduction is done by four federal agencies under NEHRP: USGS, NSF, FEMA, and NIST. The USGS, NSF, FEMA, and NIST coordinate activities for earthquake risk reduction under NEHRP. Congress authorized the USGS to monitor seismic activity in the US, operating a network of seismographic stations and a notification system for earthquake information dissemination. This data is used to prioritize inspections and response efforts for bridges and highways, improving highway services for emergency responders. Federal agencies enhance seismic resiliency of highway systems by informing pre-disaster planning. One way agencies enhance seismic resiliency of highway systems is through using FEMA's HAZUS-MH software, which provides maps and estimates of economic losses from earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. This information helps decision makers with preparedness, mitigation, and recovery efforts."
