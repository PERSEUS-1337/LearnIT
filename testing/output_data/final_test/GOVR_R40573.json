    "content": "The federal government has a long history of involvement in water resources development, including navigation improvements, flood reduction, irrigation expansion, water quality regulation, and wildlife protection. While states have primary authority over intrastate water allocation, the federal government can assist with water supply projects in limited cases. The government has been authorized to assist communities with water supply development. Land use planning and zoning are typically managed by local governments, but federal and state actions may conflict with local interests. Over the years, a complex web of laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels has been developed to manage water resources for various purposes such as allocation, quality protection, energy development, and environmental restoration. The complex web of laws and regulations at federal, state, and local levels has led to diverse congressional committees and federal agencies managing water policy. This dispersed arrangement complicates the management of large river systems and estuaries, especially when dealing with anadromous fisheries or threatened species. Multiple state and federal agencies manage facilities affected by water and land management decisions. Laws and responsibilities can be confusing for entities seeking assistance with water projects and recreational opportunities. Tensions exist between federal and state governments over water allocation and management. Experts have called for a national approach to address these concerns. Many experts have called for a \"national\" commission involving states and localities to develop a national water policy vision. The dynamic nature of water, including the hydrologic cycle and climate variability, complicates matters. Criticism of the fractured federal water policy has been ongoing, with calls for better planning and coordination. Various options have been suggested in the past, such as coordination entities within the executive branch and non-governmental commissions for policy review. Congress has not enacted comprehensive changes in federal water resources management since the 1965 Water Resources Planning Act. The last systematic review of nationwide federal water policy was in the 1973 NWC report. Congress often reacts to proposals to change water organizations as attempts to exert federal control. Congress has not enacted comprehensive changes in federal water resources management since the 1965 Water Resources Planning Act. Attempts to reorganize water organizations are seen as federal control. Coordination of federal activity is driven by pending crises. Recent federal activity in water resources management has been driven by pending crises and local initiatives. Concern about water supply has led to interest in legislation to establish a national water commission. The National Water Commission, created in 1968 by Congress, is tasked with reviewing national water resource problems and developing recommendations for a comprehensive strategy. The National Water Commission was created in 1968 by Congress to review water resource problems and provide recommendations for a comprehensive strategy. It was established to address concerns about water supply and to study issues related to water resource development, economic and social consequences, and specific water resource matters referred by the President and the Water Resources Council. The National Water Commission was established in 1968 to address water resource problems and provide recommendations. The Commission, consisting of seven members appointed by the President, had expertise in various fields related to water resource management. Despite progress made through legislation, few actions can be directly linked to the Commission's 1973 recommendations. Despite the National Water Commission's 1973 recommendations, there was little direct follow-up action. The report remained in limbo, awaiting mandated action from the Water Resources Council and final transmission from the President to Congress. President Nixon's focus on the Watergate scandals, the Ford administration's Section 80 study of water policy, and the Carter administration's acceptance of past mistakes all contributed to the lack of action on the Commission's recommendations. Despite the National Water Commission's 1973 recommendations, little direct action was taken. Water policy has evolved with various drivers, including changes in federal grants to loans for water quality activities and shifts in Reclamation law and federal cost-share policies. These changes were not direct responses to the Commission's recommendations but reflect a culmination of forces driving policy evolution. Despite the National Water Commission's 1973 recommendations, little direct action was taken. The difficulty in reaching agreement among stakeholders on roles and responsibilities remains a challenge in water management. The influence of a new commission in promoting change in a complex system may lie in how its recommendations combine with other drivers to support policy evolution. The National Water Commission completed its final report in June 1973, highlighting outdated water policies and flawed assumptions about future water needs. The report called for a shift in water resources management away from large-scale development projects, emphasizing the need for new federal, state, and local policies in water resource and water quality management. The National Water Commission's final report in June 1973 emphasized the need for new policies in water resource management, shifting focus from large-scale development projects to preservation and enhancement of water quality. The report included 17 chapters, 232 recommendations, and highlighted the importance of tying water development planning to water quality planning. The National Water Commission's 1973 report emphasized the need for new water resource management policies, focusing on tying water development planning to water quality planning. Conservation, efficiency, and better use of water for various purposes are essential. Governmental attention to environmental protection and updated laws are necessary for future water policies. The level of government closest to the water resource problem should control water resource development, management, and protection. The 1973 National Water Commission report highlighted the need for reevaluation of federal project planning, water management relationships, environmental impacts, cost recovery, and water quality concerns. Key issue areas included governance, natural environment impacts, cost recovery approaches, water quality improvements, and water rights. The report emphasized governance and institutional mechanisms for water management and planning. The National Water Commission recommended changes to the institutional structure for water resources management, including project planning, environmental considerations, public participation, federal coordination, and budgeting. The disbandment of the Water Resources Council and federal river basin commissions has altered the landscape of water resources management. The disbandment of the Water Resources Council and federal river basin commissions led to increased state responsibility for water management. The National Water Commission predicted a shift towards joint management of multipurpose water facilities and identified challenges in managing rivers for multiple uses. This shift away from large-scale federal development has become a reality. The 1983 federal water resources planning guidance focused on national economic development, moving away from multi-objective planning. Despite this, environmental concerns have gained more attention in federal water resources project planning due to environmental laws like NEPA and the ESA. Budgeting procedures do not reflect these environmental considerations. The Commission found that federal water resources budgeting procedures do not promote comprehensive regional development plans. Since the 1980s, larger federal water planning efforts have been halted, leading to project-specific budgeting for agencies like the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation. Federal funding for water quality infrastructure is mainly done through formula-based funding to state programs, marking a shift from development to preservation in federal water programs. Federal water quality spending increased significantly in the 1970s and has remained high, while water resources development spending has slightly decreased. Development has slowed, and environmental considerations are now essential in water resource projects. The public's focus has shifted from development to environmental and water quality preservation. The National Water Commission recommended a shift from development towards preservation and improvement of water quality, covering areas such as reservoir development, flood policy, estuaries, channelization, and fish and wildlife protection. Many environmental concerns raised by the NWC have been addressed through implementation of environmental laws like NEPA, ESA, and the Clean Water Act. Current federal water actions focus on ecosystem restoration and stream rehabilitation in projects like Everglades restoration and Bay-Delta restoration. The National Water Commission recommended a shift towards preservation and improvement of water quality, focusing on ecosystem restoration and stream rehabilitation in projects like Everglades restoration and Bay-Delta restoration. The Commission supported greater application of \"users pay\" and \"beneficiary pays\" approaches to improve equity and efficiency in federal water resource projects. The National Water Commission recommended changes in federal water policies, including cost sharing for projects, establishing waterway user charges, reforming irrigation policy, and addressing pricing of water services. They emphasized the need for improving cost recovery and eliminating program duplication to reflect changing federal priorities. The ongoing tensions between administrations and congress over funding for water projects focus on the federal role in financing. Concerns arise from program duplication and the incentives created by federal assistance for flood damage reduction infrastructure. Studies question the impact of infrastructure on development in floodplains and suggest changing cost shares or establishing special fees for project beneficiaries. Some progress has been made in addressing the Commission's recommendations related to containing costs for water projects, including increased cost shares for certain developments and establishment of a barge fuel tax. However, economists argue that more needs to be done to address inefficient cost share and water pricing policies. The final report addressed water pollution control, rejecting key concepts from the Clean Water Act, which was enacted shortly before the report's release. The Commission's final report, issued eight months after the enactment of a major law, rejected the zero discharge goal and core regulatory approach of the Clean Water Act. Despite improvements in water quality, water pollution problems persist. Recommendations on planning, federal and state roles, enforcement, and funding for pollution control activities remain relevant challenges. The report also highlighted the scarcity of water as a resource. The Commission focused on water scarcity and efficient use, suggesting procedural mechanisms and legal regulations to ensure effective water allocation. It highlighted the limited water supply in the West and the conflict between Indian water rights and non-Indian water development. Indian water rights claims were largely unquantified, creating uncertainties that needed urgent resolution. The Commission emphasized the urgent need to resolve Indian water rights claims due to uncertainties. Their recommendations focused on assessing future water requirements, governance of water resources, and policy choices influencing water use. The National Water Commission emphasizes the importance of public policies in determining future water use, stating that water \"demands\" are influenced by various factors and policy decisions. The Commission made recommendations related to water project planning, environmental considerations, and public participation in water resources management. The National Water Commission predicts a reduced role for large-scale federal water projects and emphasizes joint management of water facilities, water quality, and nonfederal uses. It highlights the importance of comparing alternative water uses and efficient water allocation through pricing policies. The Commission also warns against inefficient federal investment in water projects for regional economic development. The National Water Commission criticized the inefficiency of federal water projects for regional economic development, emphasizing the need for careful project assessment and integration with land-use planning and environmental concerns. It highlighted the shortcomings of large river basin plans and the lack of prioritization, realism, and consideration for metropolitan areas. The Commission also noted the burying of important non-quantitative issues in some plans and the high costs of federal planning requirements with unclear state benefits. It supported broadening traditional water resource plan objectives but expressed uncertainty in evaluating multi-objective plans and their alternatives. The National Water Commission criticized federal water projects for inefficiency in regional economic development, emphasizing the need for careful project assessment and integration with land-use planning and environmental concerns. It highlighted shortcomings in large river basin plans, lack of prioritization, and high costs of federal planning requirements. The Commission also noted biases towards construction projects and narrow alternative formulation, with a lack of consideration for nonstructural measures and adverse effects in evaluation. The National Water Commission criticized federal water projects for inefficiency in regional economic development, emphasizing the need for careful project assessment and integration with land-use planning and environmental concerns. It highlighted shortcomings in large river basin plans, lack of prioritization, and high costs of federal planning requirements. The Commission also identified municipal water supply and wastewater treatment; recreation use; water quality and pollution control; and power plant siting and licensing as significant planning challenges. The Commission's planning recommendations focused on integrating land-use and water planning at various levels and increasing federal funds for state water planning. The National Water Commission criticized federal water projects for inefficiency in regional economic development, emphasizing the need for careful project assessment and integration with land-use planning and environmental concerns. It highlighted shortcomings in large river basin plans, lack of prioritization, and high costs of federal planning requirements. The Commission also identified municipal water supply and wastewater treatment; recreation use; water quality and pollution control; and power plant siting and licensing as significant planning challenges. The Commission's planning recommendations focused on integrating land-use and water planning at various levels and increasing federal funds for state water planning. Planning organizations should give more attention to water management needs of smaller basins and metropolitan areas, estimate values for alternative water uses, analyze water resources as hydrologic systems, and judge fish, wildlife, and aesthetic values indirectly. The Commission recommended approving the multi-objective planning approach, not relying solely on benefit-cost analysis, determining nonfederal sponsors' willingness to pay for a project, and basing decisions on the value of uses preserved exceeding the value of the uses foregone. Significant shifts have occurred in water resources planning since 1973, with changes in Principles and Standards under different administrations. The Carter Administration published new Principles and Standards in 1979, which were later replaced by the \"Principles and Guidelines\" under the Reagan Administration in 1983. The focus shifted towards economic criteria, moving away from the multi-objective planning approach of the 1970s. The 1983 Principles and Guidelines shifted federal water resources planning towards a focus on national economic development, with regional and resource development projects declining. President Reagan dissolved large-scale river basin commissions in the early 1980s, and new environmental laws have shaped federal water resources planning since 1973. The 1983 Principles and Guidelines shifted federal water resources planning towards national economic development. Guidelines criticized for focusing on NED, as interest in aquatic ecosystem restoration grows. Hurricane Katrina highlighted concerns about public safety in planning. Congress called for an update to the Principles and Guidelines in WRDA 2007, emphasizing national priorities, economic development, and environmental protection in water projects. The WRDA 2007 provision focuses on economic development, avoiding unwise use of floodplains, and protecting natural systems. Implementation and oversight details are still unclear, including how tradeoffs between national economic effects, environmental benefits, and public safety will be addressed. It is also uncertain if nonstructural measures will be given more consideration and if planning will be broadened to include alternatives outside of an agency's mission. The NWC discussed preservation but did not anticipate ecosystem restoration as a significant water resources planning challenge. The growth of ecosystem restoration has shifted focus from economic to environmental justifications. The Corps has developed guidance assuming environmental benefits outweigh economic considerations. The Corps has developed guidance assuming environmental benefits outweigh economic considerations, leading to a focus on cost-effectiveness in evaluating restoration alternatives. However, it remains unclear if WRDA 2007 provisions can aid in integrating water resources and water quality planning for restoration projects. The discount rate for federal water projects, set in the Water Resources Development Act of 1974, is a topic of debate among economists. Some argue it should reflect private investment displacement, which is typically higher. The benefits of using a different rate are still being discussed, as it could impact project evaluation and federal participation. Federal support for planning projects has evolved since the 1965 Water Resources Planning Act. In the late 1970s, federal watershed and river basin planning received mixed reviews for its costs and usefulness. Federal funding for state planning declined, leading to the abandonment of the WRC and river basin commissions in the early 1980s. Federal project planning shifted towards project-specific approaches, with exceptions like large-scale ecosystem restoration efforts and planning assistance programs. WRDA 1986 authorized the Corps to assess water resource needs of river basins and watersheds; this authority has largely gone unused and unfunded. In the late 1990s, the Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission recommended a pilot program for water resources governance based on watersheds and river basins, recognizing existing watershed initiatives and partnerships. The WWPRAC also recommended new coordination of basin-level federal activities. The WWPRAC recommended new coordination of basin-level federal activities, but these suggestions were not well received by committee leaders in Congress due to concerns about increased bureaucracy and less state and local control. Despite this, state and local actions in watershed activities and partnerships with the federal government continue. Congress has shown support for technical assistance in water supply and treatment using federal agencies' expertise since 1992. Since 1992, Congress has authorized and funded the Corps to provide technical assistance for municipal water and wastewater projects. A Reclamation program was also created in 1992 to investigate water reuse in the West. Questions have been raised about the use of federal staff and funds for projects supporting municipal and industrial water supply, typically seen as a local responsibility. Some states and basins have conflicts over water resources during droughts. States like California, Texas, and Florida have their own planning efforts focused on water supply, ecosystem restoration, and drought management. Federal agency participation in state planning is limited due to budget constraints, with occasional congressional support shown in legislation like WRDA 2007 and the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. Federal support for watershed and state planning is now largely ad hoc and congressionally directed, with occasional congressional support shown in legislation like WRDA 2007 and the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008. The federal government lacks planning and evaluation guidance for water quality projects funded by the EPA. The Commission's final report highlights the need to balance project development with environmental concerns, suggesting the integration of NEPA requirements in the decision-making process. The Commission's final report emphasized the importance of integrating NEPA requirements into the decision-making process to address challenges and delays in project development. The report reflected the difficulties agencies faced in complying with NEPA in the early 1970s. The NWC identified processes to clarify NEPA requirements and expedite environmental reviews for water projects in the early 1970s. Recommendations included integrating NEPA into the licensing process, enhancing public and congressional participation, and addressing challenges in determining reasonable projects. These recommendations were later addressed through NEPA-related case law and regulations, leading to a mature NEPA process for water resources projects. The development of a mature NEPA process for water resources projects addressed recommendations made by the NWC in the early 1970s. CEQ's regulations aimed to improve decision-making, reduce paperwork, and delays. Key elements included defining roles of lead and cooperating agencies, setting time and page limits, specifying environmental review procedures, and involving the public in the process. The CEQ regulations specified the required elements of an EIS for the NEPA process, including a brief statement of project purpose, discussion of alternatives, description of affected environment, and analysis of impacts. The CEQ regulations have expedited the NEPA process since 1973, but the overall process has become more complex due to factors unrelated to NEPA itself. Water resources projects, in particular, are large and involve compliance with various environmental requirements. NEPA regulations require agencies to prepare the EIS concurrently with any other environmental requirements to avoid duplication of effort. NEPA serves as an \"umbrella\" statute, ensuring that any necessary studies, reviews, or consultations under other environmental laws are conducted. NEPA serves as an umbrella statute, coordinating compliance with other environmental laws. It does not require compliance with them but identifies obligations. Compliance with each applicable law would remain if NEPA requirements were removed. Agencies may still face challenges in identifying all project-related environmental issues. Agencies may face challenges in identifying all \"reasonable\" project alternatives, leading to potential litigation if stakeholders feel their preferred alternative is not considered. The threat of litigation can result in overly inclusive NEPA documentation to avoid legal challenges. The Commission addressed concerns about public participation in water resources planning, highlighting deficiencies and the need to clarify requirements to prevent project delays. The NWC recommended that federal water resources agencies adopt procedures for broad public participation in water planning activities from the beginning. Congress should require agencies to report on public participation for project authorization, showing compliance with agency procedures and resolving issues promptly. The NWC recommended that federal water resources agencies should ensure broad public participation in water planning activities. Water resources planning agencies should provide timely information and scheduling public hearings for proposed projects. Federal and state governments should require advance public disclosure for major nonfederal projects impacting water resources. Licensing agencies should aim to develop the interests of all affected participants. NEPA process addresses many public participation concerns by allowing the public to comment on proposed federal actions before decisions are made. CEQ's regulations require agencies to encourage public involvement in decisions that significantly affect the environment, such as projects requiring an EIS. Public notice of NEPA-related hearings and meetings must be provided, with documentation of public participation included in the final EIS. NEPA expanded the public review process, with opportunities for participation during project scoping and after a draft EIS is produced. CEQ offers guidance on public participation rights. CEQ recommends maintaining continuous contact with non-agency stakeholders from the earliest planning stages up to the decision to select a particular alternative to avoid conflict. Public involvement requirements are specified only for federal actions requiring an EIS, but agencies can create their own policies for environmental assessments or categorical exclusion determinations. The Commission recommended federal organizational changes to improve efficiency in managing the nation's water resources. It suggested modifications to federal agency functions and supported independent reviews of water development proposals. The Commission recommended federal organizational changes to improve efficiency in managing the nation's water resources, including creating an independent, full-time chairman reporting directly to the President. It also suggested expanding statutory membership and granting authority to distribute planning funds for the Water Resources Council. The Commission recommended federal organizational changes to improve efficiency in managing the nation's water resources, including creating an independent, full-time chairman reporting directly to the President. It also suggested combining NOAA and USGS into a new DOI agency responsible for water resources data, shifting USDA water engineering functions to nonfederal entities, and reorganizing NOAA's fisheries and coastal zone management functions. The Commission recommended federal organizational changes to improve efficiency in managing the nation's water resources, including shifting USDA water engineering functions to nonfederal entities and creating an Office of Water Technology by combining existing water research offices. Since 1973, significant shifts have occurred in federal water resources institutional arrangements, with the federalist division of responsibilities remaining largely intact. The Water Resources Council (WRC) was expanded in 1975 to include additional members but has been inactive since 1983. The council was created in 1965 to improve federal coordination and planning for water resources. Despite no comprehensive legislation changes, there have been shifts in organizational structures through executive actions and incremental changes. This has led to a decrease in coordination among federal water agencies since the 1970s. President Reagan's Executive Order 12319 in 1981 terminated six river basin commissions created in 1965, shifting their activities to member states and eliminating federal planning efforts. Federal grants for state planning also decreased, leading to limited federal agency participation in watershed planning. Federal planning assistance now consists of scattered programs among various agencies, with no independent entity reviewing all water projects. The Corps has maintained its construction program since 1973, with significant responsibilities for aging infrastructure and flood/hurricane risk reduction projects. However, changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s reduced the level of review of Corps projects, including the elimination of the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. Review now occurs under E.O. 12322, requiring OMB review for consistency with policies and regulations. The WRDA 2007 established a process for external independent review of Corps planning studies and safety reviews during construction of flood and storm damage projects. Reclamation has shifted towards water resources management over construction, collaborating with other federal agencies and Tribes to resolve water issues. The NWC recommendations for NOAA's responsibilities were not implemented, and organizational changes faced challenges. USDA's channelization program disappeared, but watershed efforts continue through NRCS cooperation with states and local agencies. The USDA's NRCS works with states and local agencies on engineering projects for flood control and water use, including dam rehabilitation. Dam repair and safety are growing areas of engineering for NRCS, Reclamation, and the Corps. The recommendation to limit Corps activities to those not efficiently done by nonfederal entities has not been consistently followed. Congress has funded Corps participation in municipal water projects, typically handled by municipalities or private consultants with federal support. The G.W. Bush Administration defined the scope of the Corps' involvement in ecosystem restoration projects. The Corps has retained its Planning Assistance to States program and Flood Plain Management Service, but federal support has declined. In the mid-1970s, the Corps received more funding for regional planning and flood plain management services. The Office of Water Research and Technology was formed in DOI in 1974 but abolished in 1982, with the desalination research program transferred to Reclamation. Federal water research has shifted focus from social science and water supply to water quality since the 1960s and 1970s. The federal budget for water research has halved since the early 1970s. Water resources aspects have remained scattered across congressional committees since 1973. The Office of Management and Budget underwent reorganization in the 1990s, leading to less management oversight in water resources. Without the Water Resources Council, coordination among federal agencies on water issues lacks an institutionally recognized system. The landscape of water management has shifted with increased consideration of environmental issues, led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1970. EPA influences federal water projects and shapes state, local, and private project planning through water quality and wetlands permitting. The Commission emphasizes the need for coordinated efforts in water resources projects to efficiently use resources, noting budgeting procedures do not promote long-term development. The Commission found that water projects were often considered individually, leading to uncertainty and schedule delays. They recommended using comprehensive river basin plans for project authorization and appropriations, incorporating 20 major regions for planning, and moving away from annual construction appropriations. The Water Resources Commission recommended using comprehensive river basin plans for project authorization and appropriations, incorporating 20 major regions for planning, moving away from annual construction appropriations, giving federal program administrators authority to contract in advance of appropriations, requiring five-year agency programs for construction projects, and deauthorizing construction not begun within 10 years. Despite some attempts at implementation, the authorization, budgeting, and appropriations processes for water resources have not significantly changed since 1973. Since the early 1980s, federal water resources planning efforts have been halted, and project authorizations and appropriations are considered on a project-specific basis. Congressional consideration of omnibus WRDA mostly authorizes individual Corps study and construction projects, without a comprehensive plan or review of activities. Budgeting for water resource projects remains project-specific, with exceptions for large-scale restoration efforts like Everglades restoration funding. In recent years, budgeting for water resource projects has not been based on regional resource plans, despite proposals to do so. Full-cost budgets and appropriations are not commonly used, except for the full funding of repair and strengthening of coastal storm protection facilities in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Congress has used general contract authority for various water programs since 1973. Congress has tightened controls on contract authority for water programs since 1973 to preserve its role in guiding appropriations. Recent legislation has imposed stricter rules for Corps multi-year contracts. Water resource agencies have developed five-year strategic plans in response to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1994, focusing on agency mission, goals, and performance. There have been limited efforts at capital budgeting by water resource agencies, with no sustained effort for coordinated budgeting for the federal water program. Legislation requires deauthorization of Corps construction projects without appropriations for six years. The deauthorization process for construction projects has not resolved the backlog or ensured compliance with planning requirements. Reclamation lacks a general deauthorization process for unfunded projects, but some authorizations include a \"sunset\" provision. Most new construction projects are initiated through congressional appropriations due to a \"no new start\" policy in recent Corps budgets. The backlog of construction authorizations has caused tension between the G. W. Bush Administration and Congress over funding priorities. The Corps' construction appropriations process involves a debate between concentrated and distributed approaches. Concentrated funding may lead to delays and increased costs, while distributed funding maintains project relevance. Tradeoffs in economic efficiency and political feasibility are considered, with limited data available for analysis. Annual federal appropriations for water resources projects have declined since the mid-1960s as a percentage of GDP and discretionary spending. Nonfederal spending increased in the 1970s and 1980s due to new federal standards for water quality. Efforts now focus on resolving resource conflicts and addressing new demands, including safety and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure. The Commission's report highlighted the environmental impacts of water projects and agency activities, emphasizing the need for better consideration of ecological processes and values in decision-making. It also recognized the importance of economic values and public safety in water resource alternatives. The Commission's report emphasized the need for better consideration of environmental impacts in water projects and agency activities. It identified areas for improvement in understanding and predicting primary and secondary environmental effects, as well as incorporating environmental values into decision-making. The report discussed the effects of reservoir development, flood policy, water development in estuarine and coastal ecosystems, and water project effects on fish and wildlife. It also addressed the Commission's recommendations for addressing fish and wildlife values in project planning. Since 1973, water resources development has slowed, and federal appropriations have decreased. Since 1973, federal water resources development has shifted towards environmental preservation and infrastructure maintenance. Concerns raised by the NWC have been addressed through environmental laws, with many federal actions focusing on ecosystem restoration. Disagreements persist on whether these efforts adequately address the Commission's concerns, particularly regarding the evaluation of development and environmental protection tradeoffs. Reservoir development alters aquatic and riparian ecosystems, impacting species and habitats. Reservoir development alters ecosystems, impacting biodiversity and species composition. Changes in flow regimes, water temperature, and quality harm some species while benefiting others. Dams can hinder fish migration and alter native fisheries downstream. The social effects of reservoir development include changes in recreation opportunities and landscape aesthetics. The Commission recommends developing a comprehensive database for water resource decisions. The Commission recommends further research on environmental impacts of water resource development, adoption of planning techniques accounting for ecological processes, analysis of environmental impacts of projects, promotion of decision-making under uncertainty, and monitoring of post-construction environmental consequences. Despite the lack of a national database, there is improved understanding of how reservoirs affect fisheries and habitat, with more information available on the state of the nation's waters compared to 1973. The Commission's recommendations for accounting for ecological values and analyzing environmental impacts today are largely implemented through NEPA and ESA during project planning. While there is no requirement to protect the overall function of ecosystems in project planning, some argue that ecosystem effects could still be better accounted for. Few new large-scale U.S. reservoirs are currently under construction, with recent focus on balancing objectives in managing existing reservoirs. Actions to protect threatened species listed under the ESA drive changes in operating plans for existing reservoirs. Conflicting objectives, such as maintaining navigation flows while also protecting bird species, have led to controversial updates in reservoir control manuals. Similar operational changes are seen in salmon runs and fish populations, sometimes creating conflicts between species. The Commission recommends collecting a broad range of data on the nation's water condition. The Commission report recommends collecting a broad range of data on the nation's water condition, including factors like water quantity, quality, geological attributes, soil properties, vegetation, fisheries, climate, aesthetics, land uses, and recreation. While a national database was never developed, some regions have developed broad data sets to address resource conflicts. Federal restoration initiatives in areas like the Florida Everglades and the Bay-Delta in California have led to documentation and monitoring of ecosystem conditions. However, experts highlight the need for better understanding and prediction of the interaction between water project operations and ecosystem health. Basic water flow data is being collected nationally, with ongoing efforts to improve measurement and modeling. The National Streamflow Information Program, managed by the USGS, monitors water flows in streams and rivers through a network of 7,500 stream gages. These gages now provide real-time stream flow data, aiding in forecasting river conditions and flood warnings. However, the program relies on partnerships with local sponsors and faces budget cuts, leading to a decline in federal funding and gage numbers. The USGS also collaborates with states to estimate water withdrawals and assess water quality in water bodies. Data on trends in freshwater fisheries are reported on a species-specific basis. Wetland losses due to human activities are monitored, and efforts are being made to improve data collection coordination. The Advisory Committee on Water Information was established to enhance data collection quality. The NWC report in 1973 recommended analyzing environmental impacts of water resource proposals, which was in line with NEPA requirements. Implementation of NEPA and ESA has led to more comprehensive environmental analysis of project plans. Non-federal interests now have a larger role in decision-making, but water resource planning still faces criticism. The 110th Congress called for updating water resources planning principles to better consider environmental and public benefits. This would apply to new Corps projects only, with no review process for previously authorized projects or those by other federal agencies. The planning of ecosystem restoration projects aims to restore habitat and environmental conditions degraded by past water resource development. Evaluating the costs and benefits of these projects, including valuing losses and gains in ecosystem services, remains a challenge. Research may not always provide a definitive understanding of the environmental impacts of water projects, according to the Commission. The Commission recommended using the best available science for decision-making on water projects, even with uncertainties. Adaptive management is used to address environmental uncertainty by incorporating new information into project implementation. Concerns with adaptive management include cost growth and delegation of decisions to agencies. The use of adaptive management in water resources is limited to select restoration efforts and has not been implemented across all projects. Federal agencies typically do not analyze the cumulative effects of project impacts on river systems unless directed to do so. Monitoring post-construction environmental effects is recommended, along with actions to address ecosystem and species health before mitigation is required. Monitoring river systems and tracking effects on species in rivers with pre-existing development pose challenges for environmental laws. Adaptive management techniques are used in cases requiring operational changes, with monitoring and ongoing assessment informing decision makers. However, the use of adaptive management is difficult for legislative decision makers due to cost and unpredictability. A national program for monitoring water project impacts does not exist, but WRDA 2007 includes provisions for environmental monitoring. WRDA 2007 includes provisions for monitoring environmental impacts of Corps projects, requiring plans for implementation and ecological success monitoring. It also mandates monitoring of restoration efforts for 10 years post-completion, with costs shared by federal and nonfederal sponsors. Monitoring is authorized for specific projects like dredged material disposal and coastal sediment management. Impact of these provisions is unknown due to early implementation stages. In the United States, flood-related roles and responsibilities are shared among federal, state, and local governments. Federal agencies like FEMA, NRCS, Reclamation, and TVA are involved in flood damage reduction projects. The federal government constructs flood control infrastructure, supports hazard mitigation, offers flood insurance, and provides disaster aid for significant floods. State and local governments are responsible for land use decisions shaping floodplain development. The Commission found that despite significant investments in flood damage reduction, annual flood losses grew and people continued living in harm's way. They called for a reorientation in national flood policy towards maximizing national economic, social, and environmental welfare through floodplain management. Federal efforts should encourage this approach and reform federal programs to prevent unfettered flood-prone development. The Commission recommended reforming federal programs for flood damage reduction, improving state floodplain management, encouraging public acquisition of floodplain lands for recreation, restricting federal construction assistance in floodplains, requiring compliance with floodplain plans, enhancing flood forecasting and emergency response plans, developing a national program for flood data, and independently appraising the National Flood Insurance Program. Federal efforts since 1973 have lacked a clearly defined flood policy or vision as suggested by the Commission. The Commission recommended various reforms to improve flood policy, but incremental changes have not effectively reduced the nation's flood vulnerability. Federal actions have provided some indirect flood risk reduction benefits, but the impact of changes in flood-prone land use remains largely unknown. The Commission recommended reforms to improve flood policy, but changes in flood-prone land use remain largely unknown. Institutional arrangements for floodplain management have diminished since 1973, with federal support decreasing. WRDA 2007 may signal a reorientation of flood policy if implemented, calling for a report on flood risk assessment and regional comparisons. The report aims to assess flood risk, evaluate flood efforts, and provide recommendations. Previous reports have suggested reducing flood vulnerability, but only narrow recommendations have been implemented. Legislative provisions and actions since 1973 have addressed flood risk through various measures. The federal actions in floodplains have seen only marginal implementation, enforcement, and funding, overwhelmed by the growth of lives, property, and infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Congressional oversight and federal appropriations have reflected a reactive approach to flooding dominated by structural flood damage reduction investments, the NFIP, and federal disaster aid. Flood policy lacks a comprehensive flood risk and floodplain management approach. The current flood risk and floodplain management approach includes restrictions on unnecessary development in floodplains. Criticisms are directed towards aid, insurance, and water resources projects for disincentivizing wise use of flood-prone areas. The Commission supports a focused effort to reduce flooding costs, improve public safety, and enhance state and local capacity for flood management. Congress increased nonfederal cost-share requirements for local Corps flood control projects in WRDA 1986. Debate continues on fairly addressing private gains from federal projects, particularly in flood- and erosion-prone coastal areas. The 110th Congress debated private benefits and development incentives in flood- and erosion-prone coastal areas created by Corps beach replenishment. WRDA 2007 called for updating water resources planning guidance to focus on public benefits. Implementation of this provision and other WRDA 2007 provisions related to flood-prone areas remains unknown. Significant changes in flood-related policy include improvements to the NFIP and reorganization of federal emergency response and recovery post-9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. The NFIP has faced concerns about subsidization and its financial foundation, with various studies and recommendations being reviewed. Reorganization of emergency response, including FEMA's placement within the Department of Homeland Security, remains a debated topic. Recent disasters like Hurricane Katrina and levee breaks have sparked discussions on managing flood and infrastructure risks. The policy issue revolves around determining an acceptable level of risk for infrastructure and who should bear the costs to reduce these risks, particularly in the case of levees and coastal development. Limited fiscal resources must be used to protect urban populations, economic infrastructure, invest in natural buffers, and ensure equity in protection for low-income and minority populations. Significant adjustments are needed in flood insurance, disaster aid policies, and programs to incentivize limiting flood-prone lands without infringing on property rights or local decision-making. Hurricane Katrina raised questions about federal agencies' ability to raise concerns regarding public safety without infringing on private property rights or local decision-making. Congress overrode the Corps' analysis in the 1990s for a locally preferred floodwall option in New Orleans, leading to significant failures during the hurricane. Damage from Katrina and other coastal storms highlights the increasing flood and erosion risks of coastal developments, with hurricane-prone states dominating NFIP outlays. The federal role in hurricane storm protection has grown since the mid-1960s, with the Corps building structures and conducting beach renourishment to reduce flooding. The federal government places sand periodically for beach renourishment to reduce flooding. Levee overtopping and failure contribute to approximately one-third of all flood disasters, with many locally built levees poorly designed and maintained. WRDA 2007 requires the Corps to establish a database with an inventory of the nation's levees and inspect federally constructed and other levees. A National Committee on Levee Safety was also created. The WRDA 2007 created a National Committee on Levee Safety to make recommendations for a national levee safety program. It requires Corps planning to consider risk behind levees, upstream and downstream impacts, and equitable analysis of alternatives. Implementation of these provisions and recommendations may impact federal and local investment in flood and storm damage infrastructure. Urban stormwater is being considered as a potential water supply resource, and estuaries are formed at the confluence of freshwater flows. Estuaries are biologically rich areas where many animal species rely on for habitat and human communities benefit from for food, recreation, and protection from floods and storms. The nation's estuaries and shorelands have been heavily modified, threatening ecological balance and productivity. The Commission found that modifications to estuaries and shorelands, primarily through water resource projects, have led to reduced sediment load in the Mississippi River affecting coastal wetlands in Louisiana, and agricultural pollution has impacted water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf Coast. Decisions on dredging, development, preservation, and waste disposal significantly impact the health and uses of coastal waters and shorelands, including wetlands. Coastal zone planning should be integrated with land use and water resources planning at all levels. The Commission recommended that water resources and development plans should protect estuaries and coastal zones, with costs borne by project beneficiaries. Legislation and programs have been enacted since 1973 to protect coasts and estuaries, but integration with general land use and water resource plans has been limited. The Commission recommended that water resources and development plans should protect estuaries and coastal zones, with costs shared by project beneficiaries. Legislation and programs enacted since 1973 aim to protect coasts and estuaries, but integration with general land use and water resource plans has been limited. Large-scale water resource planning efforts in the 1980s were constrained, leading to federal water projects being evaluated individually without fully examining cumulative impacts on coastal and estuarine resources. The Coastal Zone Management Program and National Estuary Program have made significant progress towards addressing these issues. The Coastal Zone Management Program and National Estuary Program have made significant progress towards protecting coasts and estuaries through state plans and federal-state partnerships. NEP focuses on conservation, management, and restoration efforts in 28 estuaries, including Puget Sound and Chesapeake Bay. Projects funded by NEP aim to protect and restore habitat, improve water quality, and conduct outreach. Several programs and laws related to coastal zone management include the Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program and the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. These programs aim to strengthen links between state coastal zone management and water quality programs, restore and protect coastal waters, and provide grants for acquiring coastal property to protect habitats and reduce water pollution. The Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982 prohibits federal financing for development in designated coastal barrier system areas, encompassing 585 units and 1.3 million acres of land. Despite expanded coastal zone planning since 1973, stress on coastal ecosystems persists due to intense development, population growth, and increased water use. Environmental consequences include the expansion of dead zones in coastal waters, notably in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2004 highlighted the loss of millions of wetland acres as more people settle in coastal areas. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2004 focused on protecting estuaries and coasts, emphasizing the restoration of aquatic ecosystems like Chesapeake Bay and coastal Louisiana wetlands. The Corps now prioritizes aquatic ecosystem restoration, with cost-share arrangements decided case-by-case. Coastal wetlands are crucial for ecosystem health, but while inland wetland loss has slowed nationally, coastal areas continue to lose wetlands due to development. The negative effects of channelization on streams were highlighted by the Commission. The Commission highlighted the negative effects of channelization on streams, recommending improvements to evaluation procedures, a user pay approach for costs, and a review of already authorized channelization plans. Federal channelization efforts have mostly been abolished or unfunded since the Commission's report. Some channelization plans have been discontinued or lacked funding. Despite this, some projects still incorporate channelization for flood damage reduction and navigation. The negative impacts of channelization are now evaluated and mitigated under federal and state environmental laws. Dredged material is now used for beneficial environmental purposes like island building and wetland restoration. Water projects have historically disregarded fish and wildlife impacts, resulting in harm to these resources. Thousands of miles of natural stream channels have been relocated or altered, leading to the drying up of some streams and damage to estuaries and marshes. The negative impacts of channelization on water resources include relocation or alteration of channels, drying up of streams, and damage to estuaries and marshes. Water quality deterioration and temperature alteration have also affected fish and wildlife. Federal protections under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and NEPA are seen as adequate to prevent damage to resources. The Commission recommends joint participation of fish and wildlife agencies in water projects to address impacts. The Commission recommended that fish and wildlife agencies collaborate in water project planning to prevent negative impacts. It called for state legislation to protect resources from nonfederal projects and for the WRC to resolve stakeholder disputes. Concerns about NEPA implementation in 1973 were raised, along with the need for more research on water project effects. Reducing uncertainty and producing scientifically defensible results were also highlighted. Improvements in water resources planning and project development practices have led to more attention to fish and wildlife since 1973. Achievements in fish and wildlife conservation have been made through wetlands conservation, ESA consultation, NEPA assessment requirements, and site-specific legislation. Federal agencies still operate reactively, responding to already formulated plans and declining species. While improvements have been made, their sufficiency is debated. Today, there are more threats to fish and wildlife resources, including habitat destruction, invasive species, climate change, and pollution. The Fish and Wildlife Service notes that aquatic resources in the United States are declining due to habitat destruction and modification. Attempts to implement regulations under the FWCA in the late 1970s and early 1980s were abandoned during the Reagan Administration. Currently, FWCA is applied to water activities through agency planning processes, but it is overshadowed by NEPA and has been undercut by judicial interpretations. The Water Resources Council (WRC) has been overshadowed by NEPA and disabled by judicial interpretations, leading to unfulfilled promises. The role of WRC as an arbitrator became irrelevant after its disbandment in 1983. Despite NWC recommendations for increased fish and wildlife research at a national level, implementation has been lacking. Research in the Columbia River Basin and California has shown the impact of water projects on fisheries and habitat. Insufficient scientific understanding of water quality and quantity needed for sustainability remains a central issue in current conflicts. The Commission recommended that states protect fish and wildlife resources on non-federally managed waters, similar to the FWCA on federal projects. State efforts are aided by federal programs, such as the Wallop-Breaux Act of 1984, which increased funding for conservation through the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act. The Commission recommended expanding the tax on sporting equipment to increase funding for state projects related to sport fishery management, conservation, and restoration. Identified deficiencies in federal cost-share policies led to inefficiencies in water resources management, including inconsistencies among policies within agencies and across federal agencies for similar projects. The Commission identified issues with federal cost-share policies for water supply projects, leading to inefficiencies and lack of taxpayer equity. Inconsistent flood control policies favored certain projects financially, causing confusion and distortion of problem-solving approaches. The Commission found that non-uniform repayment terms and differences in discount rates led to misallocation of taxpayer resources. Overly favorable cost-share policies resulted in unwise development in flood-prone areas and unnecessary federal project construction. The Commission recommended changes in federal cost-share policies to prevent unnecessary expansion of the federal role in water resource management and to ensure project beneficiaries pay proportional development and operating costs. Specific recommendations include recovering federal costs and establishing uniform cost-share policies for all water purposes. The Commission recommended establishing uniform cost-share policies for all water purposes, including different approaches like levees, floodwalls, and nonstructural measures. It also suggested interagency coordination mechanisms to streamline project applications and require consistency in cost-share policies across federal agencies. The Commission recommended cost-sharing policies for water projects, including interest charges during construction and beneficiary pays systems. The overarching theme was users pay, with changes adopted in the late 1970s and 1980s. The Commission recommended cost-sharing policies for water projects in the late 1970s and 1980s, but disagreements over local cost shares and repayment policies delayed authorizations until 1986. Consistency in federal financing across agencies and water resource purposes remains a concern today, with differences in cost-share policies for Corps and Reclamation flood projects and irrigation water supply. Standardization of cost shares within agencies has not been achieved. The 1986 WRDA made incremental changes to Corps cost-share policies and established limited local sponsor requirements for various projects, but lacked incentives for lower-cost flood control alternatives. Previous efforts to address cost-share issues, such as the 1977 Carter water plan and Principles and Standards for project evaluation, were ultimately abandoned or superseded by other events. The determination of appropriate cost shares for federal water resource projects and water quality infrastructure remains a challenge in federal water policy. Instituting \"beneficiary pays\" or \"users pay\" fee policies is politically difficult, despite the importance of the inland waterway system in supporting barge traffic for various products. The Commission recommended that users of the inland waterway system, including freight and pleasure craft, should bear its costs through a user fee to cover all operation and maintenance expenses. This proposal aligns with past legislation dating back to the 1930s and various administrations' advocacy for waterway user charges. The Commission recommended a uniform fuel tax and lockage fee for inland waterways, to be phased in over ten years. Efforts for full cost-recovery user fees have failed, with current user charges only recovering 10% of federal costs. Congress partially implemented the Commission's recommendations, with the current scheme only including a fuel tax and not covering all users or costs. In 1978, Congress enacted the Inland Waterways Revenue Act imposing a fuel tax on freight barges to fund construction and rehabilitation projects. The tax increased gradually from 4 cents to 20 cents per gallon. Operation and maintenance costs are funded with General Funds. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 imposed a fuel tax on freight barges, gradually increasing from 4 to 20 cents per gallon. Congress considered a full-cost recovery proposal but settled on the current tax rate. Various proposals were suggested, including a 42 cent tax by the Carter Administration, a 64 cent tax by railroads, and a one cent charge by the barge industry. The industry supported the fuel tax bill, which also authorized the replacement of Lock and Dam 26 on the Mississippi River. The 1986 act debated user fees for the barge industry, arguing for full cost-recovery fees to avoid inequities among freight modes. Rail and pipeline industries finance their infrastructure without public funds, while the trucking industry pays user fees covering 50%-80% of their costs. Subsidized barge rates lead to higher overall freight costs and inequities for shippers. The Commission recommended increasing user charges for barge transport to avoid inequities among freight modes and ensure that contributions are spent on investments with the greatest economic returns. This includes implementing a lockage fee and a uniform fuel tax to account for varying infrastructure costs on different waterways. Cross-subsidization between heavily used and lightly used waterways is currently taking place, which may be appropriate within a waterway network like the Mississippi system. The barge industry, owned by large corporations like Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill, receives public assistance for heavily subsidized waterways. Taxpayer groups question the need for continued support, as the industry argues they are the only ones paying fees. Economic studies have explored alternative user charge schemes, such as system-wide versus segment-specific fees. The Reclamation Act of 1902 authorized the construction of water projects in western states managed by the Department of the Interior. These facilities deliver water for irrigation to a population of approximately 31 million annually. The Reclamation Act of 1902 authorized federal funding for water projects in western states for agricultural and industrial use. Repayment requirements vary for different users, with interest for industrial users and no interest for agricultural users. The original act also limited land ownership to 160 acres to receive reclamation water. The Commission identified inefficiencies in the Bureau of Reclamation's irrigation program, citing subsidies and ownership requirements as problematic. Recommendations were made to reduce subsidies and eliminate the acreage limit to improve economic and water allocation efficiencies. The Commission recommended changes to future irrigation projects, including no subsidies, full cost payment by beneficiaries, and abolishing the 160-acre land ownership limit. For existing projects, they suggested exempting districts and landowners from the limit, offering lump-sum payments on repayment obligations, and allowing retention of excess acreage with certain conditions. The Commission recommended changes to future irrigation projects, including no subsidies, full cost payment by beneficiaries, and abolishing the 160-acre land ownership limit. They also suggested selling excess acreage with lump-sum payments or interest on costs, and allowing project water use on new acquisitions with similar payment terms. The recommendations, known as \"Reclamation reform,\" faced opposition from Congress members who feared negative impacts on irrigators and the nation's food supply. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 addressed challenges to the reclamation program, including acreage limitations and irrigation subsidies. Congress enacted the legislation after facing lawsuits and made further reform attempts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 increased acreage limits for water districts and users complying with the new law. It raised the limit to 960 acres for individuals and groups of 25 or less, and 640 acres for legal entities with more than 25 persons. The Act also addressed interest rate subsidies and imposed penalties for those remaining under prior law. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, also known as the \"hammer clause,\" increased acreage limits for water users and charged full cost for water delivered to landholdings above the new limit. Section 213 of the Act exempts project lands from ownership and pricing limitations after irrigation repayment obligations are met. Congress aimed to address Commission recommendations on linking acreage increases to higher water fees. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 increased acreage limits and charged full cost for water above the limit. Attempts to address acreage limitation and irrigation subsidy issues in the 1990s became more complex under the Reclamation Reform Act. Legislation was introduced to address the use of interest-free Reclamation water on surplus crops, but provisions were eventually dropped from omnibus reclamation legislation in the 102nd Congress. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) included new pricing provisions and fees for fish and wildlife restoration, specifically for the CVP. Tiered water pricing provisions aimed at promoting water conservation are contentious. Despite some efforts in 1982, issues like acreage limitation and interest subsidy remain sensitive topics in Reclamation oversight. Recommendations for full cost pricing have faced opposition from key Members of Congress. The NWC report highlighted concerns about biased pricing against irrigated agriculture and commodity production, which Congress has not addressed since the early 1990s. The debate over appropriate pricing of municipal and industrial water services continues, with research showing that rate structure and level can impact water efficiency. The CWA requires federal assistance recipients to charge user fees covering operation costs, but does not regulate local utility rates. The Commission emphasized the importance of full cost pricing and user charges in water and sewer services, aiming to conserve water supplies, promote efficient resource use, and base charges on costs imposed by users and society. Utility regulation may have multiple objectives, but pricing should reflect the true costs to the system and society. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved legislation calling for a study by the National Academy of Sciences on water utilities' rate structures and conservation practices. The study aims to determine if rates are based on full-cost pricing, identify best industry practices for rate structures, and assess how affordability impacts rate decisions. The Commission also made recommendations related to water pollution. The Commission identified various sources contributing to U.S. water quality impairments and noted inadequate monitoring programs. Water quality trends showed mixed results, with improvements in some areas but deterioration in others. Progress has been made in controlling pollutants from industries and sewage treatment. The Commission's recommendations addressed controlling discharges of toxic pollutants from industries and sewage treatment plants, which can harm human health and the environment. Nonpoint sources of pollution are believed to be the main cause of water quality impairments nationwide, with 45% of river and stream miles and 47% of lake acres not meeting standards. The recommendations covered Clean Water Act goals, water quality standards, economic inducements, planning, and federal and state roles. Many recommendations have been implemented through the Clean Water Act. The Commission's recommendations on controlling toxic pollutants from industries and sewage treatment plants have been addressed through the Clean Water Act (CWA). Despite improvements in water quality, concerns raised by the Commission about water pollution problems remain valid today. The CWA, with its zero discharge goal and regulatory approach, is considered successful in achieving its statutory goals. The Commission's focus on planning, federal and state roles, and enforcement still hold relevance. The Commission's recommendations on water quality programs, funding challenges, and the need for decisive action to shift towards water quality management were highlighted. The Commission rejected the goal of zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 as unrealistic and recommended cleanup requirements based on local water use designations and standards. They emphasized that absolutely pure water is not necessary for all uses. The Commission rejected the 1972 act's premise of minimum technology-based pollution control standards for all dischargers, favoring tailored requirements based on cost-benefit analysis. The National Commission on Water Quality endorsed the law's approach but recommended redefining the goal of zero discharge by 1985 to focus on conservation and resource reuse. The National Commission on Water Quality recommended redefining the goal of zero discharge by 1985 to focus on conservation and resource reuse, rather than relying on nationally uniform performance standards. The Commission urged reliance on water quality standards as the basis for pollution control requirements. The National Commission on Water Quality recommended a shift from zero discharge by 1985 to focus on conservation and resource reuse, advocating for water quality standards as the basis for pollution control requirements. This recommendation would have reversed the policy approach enacted in the 1972 FWPCA amendments, which required the development of water quality standards for interstate waters. Congress intended water quality standards to be the backbone of pollution control decisions, with minimum performance standards as a baseline. Economic inducements were suggested to encourage pollution control activities. The Commission focused on subsidies for municipal wastewater treatment, specifically the CWA's construction grants program. It believed that grants to communities for sewage treatment plants were appropriate to achieve clean water on a national scale within a short time. P.L. 92-500 expanded the grant program significantly, but federal assistance should end after 10 years. The Commission recommended federal assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plants to end after 10 years, with Congress providing $13 billion per year for that period. However, federal subsidies have continued beyond the recommended termination date, with funding falling short of the Commission's recommendations. The estimated funding needs for water quality projects nationally exceed $200 billion, making an end to federal financial assistance unlikely in the near future. The Commission recommended shifting from grant programs to loans for states to provide seed money to communities for projects, with communities repaying the loans. The debate continues on the federal assistance role duration. Planning for regional water quality management is emphasized, incorporating various aspects like water supply and land use planning. Coordination with other planning bodies is recommended. The Water Resources Planning Act emphasizes the need for major investment in water quality planning. The Clean Water Act includes the 208 program for waste management planning on a larger scale. States are now responsible for long-term water management plans, coordinating with river basin commissions. The Clean Water Act advocates for shared federal and state responsibility in water pollution control policy, with the federal government setting national policy and states implementing it. The Act emphasizes the importance of monitoring and data collection for understanding water quality trends and making informed decisions. The Commission recommended a major role for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in water quality monitoring through a national surveillance network. Monitoring activities are carried out by various entities, with data used to inform policymakers and the public. However, environmental monitoring, including water quality monitoring, receives less priority and funding compared to regulatory or capital improvement programs. Research needs were also identified in areas such as technology development and alternative waste. The Commission identified research needs in technology development, waste treatment, and pollution control. Adequate funding for research and development is crucial for successful implementation of public policies. Congress, the President, states, and localities should fully fund activities to address resource shortages. The 1972 FWPCA addressed key issues integral to CWA programs, such as federal grants contingent on local user charges and enforceable discharge permits. Water rights are traditionally regulated by states, using doctrines like riparian or prior appropriation. Under the prior appropriation doctrine, water users acquire rights based on reasonable and beneficial use, with permits issued by state agencies. The system operates on a \"first in time, first in right\" basis, with some states using both riparian and prior appropriation doctrines for water rights. The riparian doctrine of water rights is followed in eastern states, while western states adhere to the appropriation doctrine due to historical water availability differences. Eastern states share water resources without strict limits, while western states with regular shortages use the prior appropriation system to acquire defined water rights. These systems have been debated for effective water resource management. The Commission's recommendations focused on managing water resources efficiently to minimize shortages in both eastern and western states. They suggested implementing procedural mechanisms and legal regulations to ensure effective water usage, including transferring water rights, recognizing social values in water, and implementing permit systems for riparian states. The Commission recommended improving water laws to efficiently reallocate water rights, including enhancing states' water rights records, simplifying transfer procedures, modifying legal constraints on transfers, and evaluating federal water supply projects. Federal action would not be taken on improving records and transfer procedures, as these fall under state authority. The Commission recommended legal reforms for water transfers and supply projects, including repealing laws that hinder transfers and clarifying water rights holders' power to make transfers. The Commission also suggested Congress remove uncertainties in federal law regarding title to water rights and declare a national policy to facilitate water rights transfers without federal agency consent. The Commission recommended legal reforms for water transfers and supply projects, including repealing laws that hinder transfers and clarifying water rights holders' power to make transfers. They suggested federal action to allow transfers without consent if financial obligations are met. Additionally, they recommended that every report for proposed water projects include a study detailing water supplies, current water usage, estimated value of new projects, and feasibility of transferring rights to meet demand. The Commission recommended legal reforms for water transfers and supply projects to meet demand by transferring rights from old uses to new uses. They believed this would postpone the need for new water supply projects, provide economic incentives for water conservation, maximize economic yield, and make resource allocation more efficient. The recommendations criticized water rights systems for favoring economic development over social values like esthetics, recreation, and wildlife protection. The Commission recommended legal reforms for water transfers and supply projects to meet demand by transferring rights from old uses to new uses, providing economic incentives for water conservation, maximizing economic yield, and making resource allocation more efficient. They criticized water rights systems for favoring economic development over social values like esthetics, recreation, and wildlife protection. The Commission recognized the importance of riparian systems in protecting values and recommended improvements in protecting instream values and acquiring rights for noneconomic purposes. It suggested authorizing water rights for all social uses, expanding public water rights to protect streamflows, improve navigability, and prevent abuse, especially in areas facing new climate conditions like drought and flooding. The Commission recommended legal reforms for water transfers and supply projects to meet demand by transferring rights from old uses to new uses, providing economic incentives for water conservation, maximizing economic yield, and making resource allocation more efficient. They criticized water rights systems for favoring economic development over social values like esthetics, recreation, and wildlife protection. The Commission recognized the importance of riparian systems in protecting values and recommended improvements in protecting instream values and acquiring rights for noneconomic purposes. It suggested authorizing water rights for all social uses, expanding public water rights to protect streamflows, improve navigability, and prevent abuse, especially in areas facing new climate conditions like drought and flooding. Critics argue that the riparian system does not plan for water shortages and does not provide an efficient system of water resources management as a permit system does. The federal government has taken steps in recognizing social values in water, but water supply and water rights issues are generally addressed and resolved at the state level. The federal government has enacted legislation recognizing social values in decisions regarding waters regulated by federal water projects. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 allows protection of certain waters from development, with Congress designating rivers for protection over the past four decades. This designation allows recognition of aesthetic and recreational values by the federal government. The federal government recognizes aesthetic and recreational values of rivers under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. In 1992, the CVPIA amended the Central Valley Project to include fish and wildlife preservation. Many states have legal systems recognizing social values in water resources. The Commission's recommendations on federal water rights transfers are also important. The Commission's recommendations on federal water rights transfers have not been fully implemented, with limited action taken to encourage water transfers. Traditionally riparian states have modified their systems to include regulated riparianism, which generally involves an administrative permitting requirement. The federal government has not implemented a uniform requirement for water use and supply reports on federal projects, although this information may be gathered for other purposes under federal law. The Commission's recommendations on federal water rights transfers have not been fully implemented, with limited action taken to encourage water transfers. The federal government's ability to modify the riparian system is limited by principles of federalism, with no relevant federal action taken. The Commission highlighted the conflict between Indian water rights and non-Indian water development in the West, emphasizing the urgent need for resolution due to limited water supply and uncertainties. The Commission recommended solutions for resolving Indian water rights claims in the West, including defining and quantifying Indian water rights, providing substitute water supply or compensation to affected off-reservation owners, and placing jurisdiction over Indian water rights actions in federal hands. The Commission recommended federal jurisdiction over Indian water rights actions in the West, along with quantifying existing water uses on reservations and offering fair market rates for tribes to lease their water. While some recommendations have been partially implemented, most Indian water rights claims are settled on a case-by-case basis rather than through broad solutions. The Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs began inventorying and quantifying Indian water rights in 1971, despite opposition from some tribes and national Indian organizations. BIA continues to assist tribes with technical studies on water rights. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has been assisting tribes with technical studies on water rights since 1971. The Commission recommended that the United States provide a substitute water supply or compensation to off-reservation water users affected by Indian water resource development. The Commission recommended that the United States provide a substitute water supply or compensation to off-reservation water users affected by Indian water resource development, but this recommendation was opposed by tribes, the BIA, and non-Indian water users. Congress did not take the recommendation seriously, and it was never implemented. The Commission recommended that federal district courts have sole jurisdiction over actions affecting Indian water rights, but this has not been implemented due to a Supreme Court ruling. The ruling in Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States determined that state courts should be the primary adjudicatory forums for Indian water rights claims to maintain finality. The Supreme Court ruled that federal courts should defer to state courts in water rights claims to avoid contradicting each other. Commission recommendations for federal initiation and funding of tribal water rights litigation, BIA quantification of Indian water uses, and federal funding for tribal water development are being implemented. However, the recommendation to halt federally assisted water projects until Indian water rights are adjudicated has not been enacted, potentially affecting numerous projects. The Commission's recommendation for federal legislation on Indian water rights leasing has not been implemented, and the costs of such a policy are difficult to calculate. Progress has been made on some water policy issues identified in 1973, but few actions can be directly linked to the Commission's recommendations. The evolution of water policy since 1973 has not directly followed the Commission's recommendations. Project planning has shifted away from the multi-objective approach suggested, leading to piecemeal authorization of water resource projects. Coordination among federal water agencies has decreased, with funding and political influence playing a significant role in project pursuit. State-federal tensions persist over roles and responsibilities in water management. State-federal tensions over roles and responsibilities in water resource development continue to hinder resolution of difficult issues. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law in 1970 to protect the environment by requiring federal agencies to assess environmental impacts for major actions. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) but did not give it the authority to enforce the law or implement regulations for the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requirement. NEPA established the framework for integrating environmental considerations into federal decision making, but agencies initially struggled to comply with its requirements in the 1970s. CEQ issued non-binding guidelines to help determine NEPA implementation without enforcement authority. During the 1970s, CEQ issued non-binding guidelines for EIS preparation, leading to complaints about delays in the NEPA process due to lack of uniformity and uncertainty. President Carter directed CEQ to issue legally binding regulations for federal agencies, effective July 30, 1979, to standardize the NEPA process. Each agency was required to develop its own procedures. Federal agencies were mandated to create specific NEPA procedures for typical actions they undertake, while CEQ regulations required agencies to ensure their existing policies were in line with NEPA's intent."
