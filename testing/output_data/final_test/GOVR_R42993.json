    "content": "The return of security cooperation between the United States and New Zealand has forged a new security partnership between the two countries. Despite past differences over New Zealand's nuclear policies, recent developments have greatly bolstered bilateral defense and security cooperation, reaffirming a close relationship between the two nations. The United States and New Zealand have strengthened their bilateral relationship, with New Zealand being the only non-nuclear state invited to a Nuclear Summit in 2010. Various organizations and groups, including the U.S.-N.Z. Council and Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus, promote cooperation between the two countries. The bipartisan Friends of New Zealand Congressional Caucus, launched in 2005, includes over 60 Members of Congress. Representative Kevin Brady replaced Jim Kolbe as the Republican co-chair, and Representative Rick Larsen replaced Ellen Tauscher as the Democrat co-chair. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 marked a significant turning point in US-New Zealand relations, focusing on present and future cooperation. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 strengthened US-New Zealand relations, leading to the 2012 Washington Declaration on Defense Cooperation. This positive momentum was furthered by US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta's visit to New Zealand, lifting a ban on naval ship visits. New Zealand's military commitment in Afghanistan improved US perceptions of the country. Bilateral security ties will require continued attention within the context of China's rise and geopolitical uncertainty. New Zealand's commitment to Afghanistan, including regular troops and Special Forces, improved US perceptions of the country. President Obama praised New Zealand as an \"outstanding partner\" during Prime Minister Key's visit to Washington in 2011, leading to a new strategic partnership between the two nations. This strengthened relationship laid the groundwork for enhanced cooperation in the Pacific and beyond. In November 2010, a new strategic partnership was established between the United States and New Zealand, emphasizing shared democratic values and interests. The agreement aimed to put past differences aside and focus on future cooperation, reaffirming their close ties and commitment to peace, prosperity, and stability in the region. The strategic partnership between the United States and New Zealand focuses on shared values and interests, emphasizing cooperation in addressing regional security challenges in the Pacific. New Zealand supports Pacific island countries by providing aerial surveillance and enforcement capabilities through upgraded aircraft and patrol vessels. Collaboration efforts include supporting the Forum Fisheries Agency and the Niue Treaty to strengthen regional fisheries protection. The Niue Treaty aims to enhance regional fisheries protection. New Zealand collaborates with the United States, Australia, and France in maritime surveillance through the Quadrilateral Defense Coordination Group (Quad). Strengthening fisheries management could increase Pacific Island Countries' revenue by $60 million annually. The U.S. Coast Guard Ship Rider Program helps enforce fisheries control in the region by placing law enforcement officers from Pacific Island nations on U.S. Coast Guard ships for patrols. In Operation Kurukuru, vessels were found in Pacific Island nations' exclusive economic zones, with the United States and New Zealand participating in the largest monitoring operation in the region. Bilateral relations were strengthened through joint exercises and events, including the annual Pacific Partnership exercise aimed at increasing interoperability among U.S., Australian, New Zealand, and French forces. Exercises Alam Halfa and Bold Alligator further demonstrated the removal of barriers to bilateral defense exercises between the United States and New Zealand. In June 2012, a significant development in bilateral defense cooperation between the United States and New Zealand was consolidated and extended by the Washington Declaration. This declaration, signed by Secretary of Defense Panetta and New Zealand's Minister of Defence Coleman, reaffirmed the close relationship and provided a framework for a new strategic partnership as called for in the Wellington Declaration of 2010. Minister of Defence Coleman reaffirmed the close bilateral relationship and discussed expanded defense and security cooperation, focusing on maritime security, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. The agreement aims to build upon existing security cooperation between New Zealand and the United States, codifying ongoing arrangements and providing a framework for future defense cooperation. New Zealand's return to close defense cooperation with the United States includes participation in the biennial Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) military exercise, involving 42 ships, 6 submarines, over 200 aircraft, and 25,000 defense personnel. New Zealand sent HMNZS Te Kaha, HMNZS Endeavour, a rifle platoon, an Orion P-3K aircraft, and headquarters staff to participate in RIMPAC. Commander Joint Forces New Zealand Major General Dave Gawn highlighted the importance of such exercises in preparing for various contingencies and working with other nations to reduce conflict. During his September 2012 visit to New Zealand, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Panetta lifted a ban on New Zealand naval ship visits to U.S. ports, signaling a new era in bilateral ties and potential U.S. Marine Corps involvement in assisting New Zealand develop its amphibious capabilities. This policy shift aims to enhance cooperation in joint military exercises and high-level exchanges, particularly in humanitarian efforts. New Zealand's foreign policy orientation has evolved over time, shifting away from its loyalty to the British Empire. The country's national identity has been influenced by its changing demographics, including a growing M\u0101ori, Pacific Islander, and Asian population. This shift has impacted New Zealand's military commitments and external orientation, leading to potential joint military exercises and high-level exchanges in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts in the Pacific region. The changing demographics in New Zealand, including a growing M\u0101ori, Pacific Islander, and Asian population, have influenced the country's national identity and foreign policy towards the Asia Pacific region. Recent policy documents have examined New Zealand's relationships with the South Pacific, Asia, and China, emphasizing national security interests in a rules-based international order and strong international linkages. The 2010 Defence White Paper highlights the importance of a safe and secure New Zealand, a rules-based international order, and a sound global economy. New Zealand's national security interests are driven by its evolving national identity and shifting demographic composition. The government has identified seven key objectives for national security, including preserving sovereignty, protecting lines of communication, and sustaining economic prosperity. Concerns about global economic power shifts are also highlighted in New Zealand's National Security System document of May 2011. The document of May 2011 discusses concerns about structural shifts in global economic power and their implications for military power distribution. New Zealand aims to strengthen its leadership role in the South Pacific, identified as a top security priority, to support regional peace and security. New Zealand aims to play a leadership role in the South Pacific to address demographic, economic, and security risks. The Ministry of Defence plans for a new Joint Amphibious Task Force to enhance combat capabilities in the region. New Zealand's strategic focus on the South Pacific, influenced by its increasing Pacifika population and national interests, has led to a partnership with Australia in promoting shared security interests in the region. The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) spirit remains a core identity for many New Zealanders, strengthening the bond between the two countries. The bond between New Zealand and Australia is strengthened through joint security operations and formal agreements, such as the Canberra Pact of 1944 and the ANZUS Treaty of 1951. The defense relationship was further defined in the Closer Defense Relations agreement in 1991. The 2011 review emphasized mutual commitment to security and shared interests in the Asia Pacific region. New Zealand's evolving identity as a Pacific nation, influenced by its historical ties to Pacific territories like the Cook Islands and Samoa, has shaped its role in regional affairs. The country's shift towards embracing its Pacific identity occurred after Britain's entry into the European Common Market in the 1970s and the ANZUS split in 1984. This transformation has led to a more active engagement in the Pacific region, impacting future decisions on New Zealand's involvement in Pacific affairs. New Zealand's historical desire for a sphere of influence in the South Pacific, including advocating for annexations in Polynesia and the Pacific islands, was influenced by its role as a colonizing power and its view of itself as a natural leader of island peoples. This ambition was fueled by concerns over French, American, German, and French influence in the region, as Britain did not establish a Monroe Doctrine for the South Pacific. New Zealand's desire for a South Pacific sphere of influence is evident in its constitutional relationships with Tokelau, Niue, and the Cook Islands, as well as its Treaty of Friendship with Samoa. R.J. Seddon opposed British withdrawal from Samoa in 1899. The Cook Islands and Niue became part of New Zealand in 1901, and Samoa was seized from Germany in 1914. New Zealand's mishandling of the influenza epidemic in Samoa in 1918 led to resentment and the Samoan Mau uprising. Tokelau was included in New Zealand's administration in 1948. Samoa became independent in 1962. Samoa became the first independent state in Polynesia in 1962 and signed a Treaty of Friendship with New Zealand. By 1989, 15 Pacific Island states received 70% of New Zealand's overseas aid. The 2010 \"Inquiry into New Zealand's Relationships with South Pacific Countries\" acknowledged New Zealand's increasing Pacific composition and emphasized the importance of supporting peace and stability in the region. Recent New Zealand governments have recognized the need to strengthen ties with Asia and increase trade in the Asia Pacific region. New Zealand's focus on Asia has increased in recent years as trade patterns have shifted towards the Asia Pacific region. This shift is driven by the need to diversify export markets and promote economic security. New Zealand has strengthened its linkages with Asia through organizations like the East Asia Summit and the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership agreement. The importance of Asia is widely appreciated by New Zealanders. New Zealanders recognize the significance of Asia, with 77% viewing the region as important to the country's future. Australia is considered more important at 86%. Concerns about conflict in Asia impacting New Zealand are shared by eight out of ten citizens. The integration of Asian identities into the national identity is driven by demographics rather than government policy. Immigration trends show a significant increase in Asian ancestry in New Zealand, projected to reach 16% by 2026. The government's China strategy aims to boost exports and trade relations with China, which is crucial for economic growth. A Free Trade Agreement was established in 2008, leading to a surge in exports to China. In 2010, China sent 150,000 tourists and 21,000 students to New Zealand. Prime Minister Key expressed interest in closer dialogue with China on development cooperation in the Pacific. Foreign Minister McCully emphasized the importance of working closely with China in the Pacific, noting China's significant diplomatic presence in the region. McCully attributed China's engagement in the Pacific to securing future resources and establishing a presence. New Zealand's economy is increasingly linked to China, with the government promoting trade and being sensitive to anything that might disrupt the trade relationship. The Free Trade Agreement with China has facilitated trade, and there are varying views on how New Zealand should position itself in the region considering China's growing role in buying New Zealand exports. Geopolitical considerations and values also play a role in shaping these views. Foreign Minister McCully emphasizes the need for countries to mediate rising powers' interests through diplomacy and regional institutions, particularly with China. New Zealand must increase cooperation and transparency with China, meeting halfway to develop a more cooperative effort in the Pacific. There is growing sensitivity in New Zealand to China's economic influence, as seen in the 2012 debate over the sale of agricultural land to a Chinese corporation. The sale of New Zealand agricultural land to a Chinese corporation has raised concerns about China's economic influence in the region. Some in New Zealand and Australia believe that China is aiming to become a major power in the Asia-Pacific region, potentially replacing the United States. There are differing academic views on China's role, with some seeing China as filling a vacuum left by the West. China's \"Look South\" strategy has led Pacific Island countries to increasingly \"Look North\" to China rather than traditional Western partners. Some analysts note China's limited naval reach in the Pacific, with a less overtly assertive approach compared to its stance in the South China Sea. Chinese strategic perceptions and actions in the Pacific will impact U.S. and New Zealand views of its role, potentially affecting the dynamic between China and Western powers in the region. China's aid to the Pacific, with a focus on buildings and soft loans, differs from Western development assistance. The region was previously a battleground for Chinese and Taiwanese diplomatic rivalry, but this rivalry was suspended after President Ma Ying-jeou sought improved relations with China. China has increased its aid and engagement in the Pacific to gain diplomatic leverage, access resources, and extend its influence in the region. China's aid program to the Pacific is significant and growing, making it the third largest aid donor in the region. New Zealand is interested in collaborating with China on aid projects, potentially drawing China into a cooperative posture. China's expanding military capabilities, including the launch of its first aircraft carrier in 2011, suggest a closer military presence in the Pacific region. China's increasing military capability may lead to more direct involvement in the Pacific region in the future. China's relations with Fiji demonstrate the impact of its foreign assistance in the South Pacific, helping Fiji overcome political ostracism from Australia and New Zealand. Commodore Bainimarama of Fiji has aligned closer with China, stating that China does not concern itself with the nature of the regime. In January 2013, Bainimarama announced plans to scrap the draft constitution and create a new one. New Zealand's Foreign Minister McCully raised concerns about the upcoming 2014 elections and the possibility of them not being free and fair due to plans to create a new constitution in Fiji. The bilateral relations between the United States and New Zealand are influenced by identity, interests, and values, with New Zealand seeking independence in its external relations based on historical experiences. The relationship between the two countries has evolved from close allies to estranged ones and back again. The bilateral relationship between the United States and New Zealand has evolved from close allies to estranged ones and now back to increasingly close partners. Common values and shared interests are bringing the two democratic nations closer as security partners. Understanding the subtle differences in values can inform future policy decisions and strengthen the enduring Pacific partnership between the two nations. The relationship between New Zealand and the United States is deepened by shared values, partnership, and friendship. Both nations see themselves as important partners with common interests and values, working together to enhance global peace and security. Despite some distance in the past, the two countries are now increasingly close partners. Insights into the differences in values between the United States and New Zealand can be attributed to the timing of their founding. The US was founded during the First British Empire with a focus on freedom, while New Zealand was founded later during the Second British Empire with an emphasis on fairness. These values have shaped their national identities and can draw the two nations together or be at the core of differences of opinion. The importance of independence of action is a key value for New Zealand foreign policy, evident in its support for the U.N., close relations with the United States, FTA with China, leadership on climate change, and anti-nuclear policy. Value differences indirectly influence the bilateral relationship, leading to better understanding. Under Prime Minister John Key, New Zealand has consolidated a return to close security and defense relations with the United States. The Key government in New Zealand has strengthened ties with the United States, aligning with the Obama Administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. There is a debate within New Zealand regarding this decision, with some questioning the move towards closer relations with the U.S. Strategic positions in the debate are forming, with the government supporting closer ties with American power in the region. The dominant view in New Zealand is to establish closer political, security, and trade ties with the United States while maintaining trade relations with China. This position aligns with Australia's strategic posture and emphasizes shared values with the U.S. Another perspective focuses on New Zealand's economic closeness to China and fears having to choose between the U.S. and China, which could have negative economic consequences. This group would likely side with the United States if pushed by adverse strategic conditions. The third group in New Zealand prioritizes economic interests with China for economic security, while also not opposing enhanced cooperation with the United States as long as it doesn't harm the relationship with China. They highlight China's rising influence through trade with New Zealand and are cautious about deepening ties with the United States. Some in this group also point out the economic and potential military decline of the United States compared to China. New Zealand's trade relationship with China may be affected by potential trade agreements like the TPP. Understanding New Zealand's evolving international posture, focus on the South Pacific and Asia, and partnership with the United States is crucial. The country's strategic and economic geography differs from the United States, with a growing emphasis on the Pacific and Asia regions. New Zealand's strategic focus is on the South Pacific and Asia, with a growing emphasis on the region. The country's economic geography includes efforts to diversify trade relations, particularly with Asia and regional economic architectures like the TPP. China's increasing presence in the South Pacific is also of interest. New Zealand's strategic interests align with America's rebalancing towards Asia. The United States' shift in approach towards New Zealand, respecting its nuclear policy and independence in foreign affairs, has paved the way for closer security cooperation. This could lead to further deepening of linkages between the two countries, especially through economic and trade relations like the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement. The Trans Pacific Partnership agreement could enhance political and strategic ties between the United States and New Zealand, raising questions about the future course of the US rebalancing to Asia strategy and the balance between security and economic aspects of the relationship. Collaboration in coordinating humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime awareness, and regional posture in the South Pacific is also highlighted. In what ways can the United States and New Zealand cooperate in the Asia Pacific region? Lessons from bilateral relations with New Zealand for improving security relationships in the region."
