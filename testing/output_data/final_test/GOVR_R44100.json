    "content": "Congress is divided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since its enactment in 2010. The House, under Republican control, has passed numerous bills to repeal or amend the ACA, while the Senate, under Democratic control until 2014, has had less debate on the issue. Some bipartisan bills amending specific elements of the ACA have been signed into law. The Republican-controlled 115th Congress has made repealing core provisions of the ACA a legislative priority. Lawmakers have used both authorizing legislation and annual appropriations to address concerns with the ACA. Disagreements over ACA language in appropriations bills led to a government shutdown in 2013. This report summarizes ACA-related language in appropriations acts since the ACA became law. The report provides a summary of ACA-related legislation by congressional appropriators since the ACA was signed into law. It includes a brief overview of the ACA's core provisions and impact on federal spending. The report is updated to reflect key developments in the annual appropriations process. The ACA aims to increase access to affordable healthcare for the uninsured and underinsured through market reforms and health insurance exchanges. These exchanges allow individuals and small employers to compare and enroll in qualified health plans, with financial assistance available for those who qualify based on income. Individuals enrolling in exchange plans may receive financial assistance through refundable tax credits for incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. Eligible individuals can receive premium tax credits upon enrollment to help pay insurance premiums. Cost-sharing subsidies are available to reduce out-of-pocket costs for certain individuals and families. Small employers with fewer than 25 full-time equivalent employees can use exchanges to purchase insurance coverage and may qualify for a tax credit. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in King v. Burwell that premium tax credits are available to all qualified individuals regardless of state or federal exchange. The ACA's individual mandate requires most citizens to obtain coverage or face a penalty. Larger employers with 50 or more employees must offer health coverage that meets standards or face a tax penalty. The ACA's employer requirements aim to ensure larger firms provide affordable coverage for employees. Medicaid expansion under the ACA was made optional for states by the U.S. Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius. The ACA also includes provisions addressing health care access, costs, and quality. The ACA contains various provisions addressing health care access, costs, and quality, including new programs for delivering and paying for health care, taxes, fees, and adjustments to Medicare payments. These provisions aim to offset federal spending on exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion, impacting both mandatory and discretionary spending. Mandatory spending, controlled through authorizing laws, includes entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. Federal spending on ACA implementation can be categorized into three groups: mandatory spending on expanding insurance coverage, mandatory spending on other programs, and discretionary spending. This includes exchange subsidies, Medicaid expansion costs, and tax credits for small employers. The Congressional Budget Office projected that this mandatory spending accounts for most of the federal spending under the ACA. The ACA authorized new Medicare and Medicaid spending, including phasing out the Medicare prescription drug benefit \"donut hole\" and increasing Medicare payments for primary care services. The law also provided billions of dollars in mandatory funding for grant programs and other activities. The ACA provided funding for grants to states to establish health insurance exchanges and created special funds like the Community Health Center Fund and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund to support various healthcare programs. The ACA established funds like the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) and the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF) to support public health programs and administrative costs. It also created new discretionary grant programs, but few have received funding through annual appropriations acts. The Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have incurred significant costs administering and enforcing the ACA. They have requested funding increases in past budget submissions but have not received additional discretionary funds from Congress. CMS has relied on various funding sources for ACA implementation, including fund transfers, ACA mandatory funds, and user fees from health insurers on Healthcare.gov. The House Appropriations Committee has added ACA-related provisions to annual appropriations. The House Appropriations Committee has added ACA-related provisions to annual appropriations acts since the Republicans regained control of the House. Most provisions were included in the LHHS Appropriations Act, which funds CMS, while a few were in the Financial Services Appropriations Act, which funds the IRS. Senate appropriations bills remained largely free of ACA-related provisions during the 112th and 113th Congresses, except for instructions on PPHF funding allocation in the Senate LHHS appropriations bill. Disagreement between the House and Senate on including ACA provisions occurred during the 113th Congress. During the 113th Congress, the Democrat-led Senate debated including ACA provisions in the FY2014 continuing resolution, leading to a government shutdown in October 2013. In the 114th Congress, with Republicans in control, ACA-related provisions were included in appropriations bills. The House and Senate FY2016 and FY2017 LHHS appropriations bills contained overlapping ACA provisions and reporting requirements. Appropriators used various legislative options to defund, delay, or address ACA implementation, including denying new funding for CMS and the IRS administrative costs. The CMS and IRS have requested increased funding for ACA implementation in the past five budgets, but Congress has not provided the additional funds. House appropriators have added limitations to appropriations bills to restrict the use of funds for ACA-related activities. Appropriations measures restrict the use of funds by capping funding amounts or prohibiting specific purposes. House appropriators have added limitations to bills, such as prohibiting funds for ACA implementation. Limitation provisions can restrict fund availability for transfer. In FY2016 and FY2017, House appropriations bills included limitations on HHS and Labor Department using discretionary funds for ACA enforcement and other programs. House appropriators have added limitations to bills, such as prohibiting funds for ACA implementation. Unlike limitations, legislative provisions have the effect of making new law or changing existing law. For example, appropriators have included language to rescind certain mandatory funding provided by the ACA. The enacted FY2016 LHHS appropriations act included a temporary moratorium on the ACA's medical device tax and the annual fee on health insurance providers, as well as a two-year delay. The enacted FY2016 LHHS appropriations act included a temporary moratorium on the ACA's medical device tax, annual fee on health insurance providers, and a two-year delay of the Cadillac tax. House rules prohibit legislative provisions in appropriations acts, but special rules in the House and unanimous consent agreements in the Senate can set aside these rules. Appropriators have added reporting and administrative requirements for ACA implementation in recent LHHS appropriations acts. Table 1 summarizes ACA-related provisions in LHHS and Financial Services appropriations acts for FY2011-FY2017. It includes legislative actions by House and Senate Appropriations Committees, listing ACA language added to bills. None of the ACA limitations by House appropriators were included in enacted legislation."
