    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Temple Mount Preservation Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is of great religious significance to three major monotheistic religions, facing threats of violence, intolerance, and neglect. Judaism believes it is the site of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac and the future third Holy Temple. Christianity associates it with Jesus' dedication in the Second Temple. The Temple Mount in Jerusalem holds religious significance for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It is associated with Abraham's sacrifice, Jesus' dedication, and Prophet Mohammad's ascension. Jerusalem became a united city under Israel's sovereignty in 1967, with Israel respecting the religious practices of Jews, Christians, and Muslims at the site. The Israeli Government delegated oversight of the Temple Mount to the Temple Mount Waqf in cooperation with Jordan. After the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority asserted control over the Temple Mount by coercing Jordan-affiliated officials off the site and appointing an anti-Semitic Imam. In 1996, the Israeli Islamic Movement sponsored the expansion of the al-Marawani Mosque on the Temple Mount, converting an ancient underground structure into a mosque. In 1998, the Waqf, controlled by the Palestinian Authority, began further excavation, leading to the inauguration of a major underground mosque hall in 1999 with an emergency exit to the Temple Mount. Thousands of tons of ancient fills were dumped into the Kidron Valley during this process. In mid-2000, Arafat deployed security personnel onto the Temple Mount, violating agreements with Israel. This action consolidated his control and enabled the Intifadah. In February and March 2001, an ancient structure against the Eastern Wall was demolished to enlarge a mosque at the Stables of Solomon. In early May, Arafat ordered the unification of underground halls under the Temple Mount to create the largest mosque on Haram al-Sharif. The hasty excavation and construction work raise fears of severe damage to the Holy Mosques' foundations. Arafat's actions threaten to erase historical evidence of Jewish activity on the Temple Mount and challenge Israeli sovereignty claims. The destruction of artifacts within the Temple Mount is a threat to religious freedom and peace in the Middle East. It endangers sacred items and hinders Americans' understanding of their Judeo-Christian heritage. Prohibition on funds for Palestinian Authority and its instrumentalities. Prohibition on funds for Palestinian Authority or its instrumentalities unless President certifies no excavation on Temple Mount in Israel, with annual recertification required and national security waiver available."
