    "content": "Congressional interest in addressing elder abuse has been ongoing for over 25 years, leading to the enactment of the Elder Justice Act as part of the ACA. Prior to this, Congress had taken steps such as authorizing federal assistance to state Adult Protective Services programs and amendments to the Older Americans Act. Provisions for elder justice were also included in the OAA reauthorization of 2006. The Elder Justice Act was first introduced in 2002 by Senator John Breaux. The Elder Justice Act (S. 2933) was initially introduced by Senator John Breaux and re-introduced in subsequent Congresses. In the 111th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2009 (S. 795) addressing public health and social services. The Senate bill was incorporated into the ACA (P.L. 111-148) but did not achieve a multidisciplinary approach. The Elder Justice Act under the ACA focuses on public health and social services for elder abuse prevention, detection, and treatment under HHS, lacking criminal justice provisions. Earlier versions included a multidisciplinary approach with DOJ involvement, but separate legislation was later introduced for criminal justice response. In the 114th Congress, several bills were introduced to address elder abuse prevention and prosecution, including the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, the Elder Protection and Abuse Prevention Act, the Robert Matava Elder Abuse Victims Act, and the Elder Abuse Victims Act. Additionally, a bill to reauthorize the Elder Justice Act was introduced but not enacted into law. The Elder Justice Act provisions under the ACA focus on federal coordination of elder abuse efforts, grant activities, protections for long-term care facility residents, and specified studies. The Elder Justice provisions under the ACA amended the Social Security Act to incorporate Elder Justice into Title XX, establishing an Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Advisory Board. It also addresses research activities and awards grants for forensic centers. The Elder Justice Act established the Elder Justice Coordinating Council at HHS, with the HHS Secretary as chair and the U.S. Attorney General as a permanent member. The Council is required to submit reports to Congress every two years and make recommendations for legislation. Funding is authorized for the Council's functions. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council was established under the Elder Justice Act at HHS, with the HHS Secretary as chair. The Council meets twice a year and is supported by the Administration for Community Living. The Council has convened multiple times to discuss federal actions and steps for preventing elder abuse. The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation was established to develop a plan for elder justice and make recommendations to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. It consists of 27 members with expertise in preventing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The Board must submit reports to Congress regularly. The Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation was established to develop a plan for elder justice and make recommendations to Congress. HHS is required to provide information on elder justice activities and make recommendations. Funding is authorized for the Advisory Board's functions. HHS Secretary must create guidelines for researchers in elder abuse. The \"legally authorized representative\" is defined as an individual authorized to consent to medical treatment on behalf of another person. Funding of $6.5 million for FY2011 and $7.0 million for FY2012 through FY2014 is authorized for the Elder Justice Coordinating Council, Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation, and research protection guidelines for human subjects. Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities yet. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council has convened several times. SSA Elder Justice provisions added a section regarding establishment and support of elder abuse forensic centers, authorizing funding for FY2011 to FY2014. Congress has not provided discretionary funding for these activities yet. The Elder Justice Act establishes grant programs to promote elder justice through workforce enhancements, electronic health record technology, and training for long-term care ombudsman. It also provides incentives for individuals to train for direct care in long-term care facilities. Grants are awarded for continuing training and certification programs for direct care employees. Additionally, grants are provided to LTC facilities for activities to offset costs related to facility development. The section authorizes funding to assist entities in offsetting costs related to purchasing, leasing, and implementing certified electronic health records technology to improve patient safety and reduce medication errors. It also requires the adoption of electronic standards for data exchange by LTC facilities and provides funding for this purpose. Adult Protective Services (APS) programs are established in all 50 states to serve seniors and adults with disabilities by investigating abuse and providing social services. Prior to the Elder Justice Act, there was no federal funding for APS programs. Several states have used federal funding from the Older Americans Act (OAA) and the Social Services Block Grant program to support Adult Protective Services (APS) programs. The Social Security Administration (SSA) Elder Justice provisions allocate funding for state APS offices to investigate elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, collect data, provide training, conduct research, and offer technical assistance. The SSA authorizes $3.0 million for FY2011 and $4 million for each of FY2012 through FY2014 for these purposes. The HHS Secretary is required to establish two grant programs for Adult Protective Services (APS) programs. Congress has provided funding for these activities through the annual appropriations process. The Long-Term Care (LTC) Ombudsman Program aims to improve the quality of care for older adults. The LTC Ombudsman Program, established under the Older Americans Act, aims to improve care quality for residents in long-term care settings by investigating and resolving complaints. Administered by the Administration on Aging, there are 53 state programs and 578 local programs nationwide. Funding for FY2015 was $15.9 million. The program is part of the SSA Elder Justice provisions to address abuse and neglect in LTC facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of funding to improve state LTC ombudsman programs' capacity to address abuse and neglect complaints. It also mandates training programs for ombudsmen on elder abuse and exploitation. Congress has not allocated discretionary funding for these activities yet. The Elder Justice Act establishes provisions for training surveyors, reporting crimes in LTC facilities, and conducting surveys to ensure minimum care standards are met. State agencies inspect facilities participating in Medicare/Medicaid, conduct surveys, and provide training to surveyors. The Act also requires the HHS Secretary to establish a National Training Institute for Surveyors. The Elder Justice Act mandates the HHS Secretary to establish the National Training Institute for surveyors investigating abuse, neglect, and property misappropriation in Medicare/Medicaid facilities. It includes funding of $12 million for FY2011-FY2014 for training activities and $5 million for each of FY2011-FY2014 for state survey agencies to implement complaint investigation systems. Congress has not allocated discretionary funding for these activities. The Elder Justice Act amended SSA Title XI, Part A by adding Section 1150B, requiring reporting of crimes in LTC facilities receiving over $10,000 in federal funds. Covered individuals must report any suspicion of a crime against residents or individuals receiving care, failure to do so results in penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs. Non-compliance leads to loss of eligibility for federal funds. Section 1150B of the Elder Justice Act mandates LTC facilities to report any suspicion of a crime and prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting. Non-compliance can result in civil penalties or exclusion from federal health care programs. CMS issued guidance on this in 2011, and a 2014 report found that 61% of nursing facilities were not compliant. A 2014 report by the HHS Office of Inspector General found that 61% of nursing facilities had documentation to support meeting reporting requirements for notifying individuals of their obligation to report suspicion of crime and posting employee rights signs. Nurse aides provide direct care to residents in nursing facilities, including activities of daily living and health-related tasks. The scope of work for nurse aides can vary based on state licensing requirements and the provider. Nurse aides' scope of work can vary by state licensing requirements and providers. State nurse aide registries are required by federal regulations to include individuals who have completed training and are registered to work as nurse aides, as well as those prohibited from employment due to abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of property. LTC facilities use these registries for background checks on potential employees. The HHS Secretary must conduct consultations to ensure effective use of these databases. The Secretary is required to conduct a study on establishing a national nurse aide registry, with a report due to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. Congress has not provided funding for this activity yet. Funding for the study is not to exceed $500,000. In FY2012 and FY2013, some elder justice activities received funds transferred from mandatory appropriations to the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The PPHF has a permanent annual appropriation under the ACA, with funds available on October 1 each fiscal year. In FY2012, $6.0 million was transferred from the PPHF to ACL for new grants to states and tribes. In FY2013, HHS Secretary transferred $6.0 million from the PPHF to ACL for new grants to states and tribes to test elder abuse prevention strategies. ACL awarded grants for projects including using forensic accountants to prevent elder financial exploitation, increasing medication adherence to prevent elder self-neglect, and developing screening tools to identify elder abuse. Three tribal organizations also received grant funding for addressing elder abuse in Indian Country. In FY2013, $2.0 million was transferred to ACL from the PPHF for elder justice activities, funding the National Adult Maltreatment Report System. ACL also established the National Adult Protective Services Technical Assistance Resource Center and Voluntary Consensus Guidelines for State APS Systems to assist state APS programs. Additionally, funding was awarded to 24 state grantees in FY2015 and FY2016 for innovations and improvements in adult protective services. In FY2016, ACL launched the Elder Justice Innovation Grants program. In FY2016, ACL established the Elder Justice Innovation Grants program, funding various entities to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of older adults. The President's budget requested $10 million for Elder Justice/Adult Protective Services in FY2017 for a nationwide data system and research activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million for Elder Justice in FY2017. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $10.0 million for the Elder Justice Initiative in FY2017, while the House Appropriations Committee recommended $8.0 million. Funding for LHHS programs has been provided by two continuing resolutions since the start of the fiscal year. The ACA created new discretionary programs under the Elder Justice Act, but most programs have yet to receive funding. The Elder Justice Act programs have not received funding through the congressional appropriations process, limiting the administration's response to implementation. The ACA included health-related provisions like those under the Elder Justice Act, and a repeal of the law could impact federal authority to address elder abuse. Authorizations of appropriations for Elder Justice Act provisions expired in 2014. In the 114th Congress, Representative Peter King introduced the Elder Justice Reauthorization Act (H.R. 988) to extend authorizations of appropriations under the Elder Justice Act through FY2019. Congress must decide whether to extend funding for existing programs and activities, potentially modifying or adding new authorities. Consideration should also be given to the relationship between Elder Justice Act authorities and other similar statutes. The OAA and Elder Justice Act establish programs like the LTC Ombudsman Program. Congress allocated funding for Elder Justice activities in FY2015, aiding in APS data collection and program development. ACL has supported state APS systems with federal resources. Policymakers may focus on existing administrative activities for legislative priorities. The Elder Justice Act and OAA provide federal resources for state APS systems, but lack of full funding hampers federal government's role in addressing elder abuse. The EJA reaffirms federal leadership in elder justice activities, but funding remains limited. The Elder Justice Coordinating Committee has appointed members and convened several times. The Coordinating Committee has appointed members and convened several times. An Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation tasked to develop a plan has yet to be established. Federal efforts to address elder abuse may be limited by funding constraints and challenges in collecting national data due to state variations in definitions and reporting systems. The HHS Secretary was recommended to conduct a pilot study on APS administrative data, leading to the development of the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System (NAMRS) using Elder Justice Act funding. Policymakers may continue to show interest in this initiative. The Administration on Aging funded grants to states and tribal organizations to test interventions for preventing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. These models draw on strategies from family violence prevention programs and aim to build evidence for wider dissemination. The ACL is evaluating the effectiveness of these grants. The Administration on Aging funded grants to states and tribal organizations to test interventions for preventing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. ACL has invested in evaluating these grants, with findings suggesting broader dissemination through federally funded websites and further funding opportunities. The Elder Justice Act serves as a federal legislative response to elder abuse, aiming to catalyze federal coordination and action for greater public awareness and attention to the needs of the aging population. According to GAO, the Act provides a vehicle for setting national priorities and establishing a comprehensive elder justice system in the country. The elder justice system in the country requires a coordinated multidisciplinary, multi-agency, and multi-system response to address the complex cluster of issues related to elder abuse. Congressional oversight and interest are needed to oversee the range of elder justice issues. Congressional oversight is necessary for elder justice programs and activities across federal agencies. Further research is needed to address fragmented service delivery and lack of resources. Stakeholders highlight challenges in responding to elder abuse, including coordination, data, and resources. Addressing these challenges can lead to a strategic and coordinated federal response. Appendices provide details on Elder Justice Act provisions and resources for elder justice issues.
