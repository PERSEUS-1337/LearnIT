    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keeping Faith With the Greatest Generation Military Retirees Act of 2010\". Congress finds that prior to December 7, 1956, retired uniformed services members were led to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care, as stated in the Schism v. United States case. The court's judgment hopes Congress will fulfill promises made to retired officers of the World War II and Korean War era for free lifetime health care, as they served with the understanding of this benefit. However, since there was no authority to make such promises and Congress never ratified them, the retirees are left without the healthcare they were promised. The court upholds the judgment against retirees' breach-of-contract claim as Congress never ratified the promises made for free lifetime health care. Only Congress can address the moral claims raised by the plaintiffs and other affected retirees. SEC. 3. WAIVER OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM FOR CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act waives the monthly premium for eligible individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B, including retired military personnel and their spouses. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act exempts certain individuals from paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, including widows/widowers and military retirees. The amendments made by this section apply to premiums for months beginning 45 days after the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will use the rebate method from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to provide rebates to eligible individuals for premiums paid under Section 1839 of the Social Security Act."
