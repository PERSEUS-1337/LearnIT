    "content": "Emergency over-the-road bus security assistance is provided in Section 1. The Over-the-road Bus Security Grant Program establishes a fund for security measures with an initial appropriation of $200,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The Over-the-road Bus Security Grant Program provides direct grants for security upgrades to over-the-road bus operators, including emergency communication systems, driver protection, and passenger screening programs. The Over-the-road Bus Security Grant Program provides grants for security upgrades such as equipment, training, employee identification programs, and surveillance measures. The grant program requires applicants to submit an application with a project plan meeting specific requirements. Approval of the plan is necessary before funding for a security upgrade project is granted. Federal standards apply to the program. Federal standards under Section 5333 of title 49 apply to projects financed with grants under this section. The Secretary's responsibilities under this title remain unaffected by the application of these standards. Conforming amendments are made to the chapter analysis for chapter 311 of title 49. The over-the-road bus security grant program is established. Bus security recommendations are outlined in the legislation. The Secretary of Transportation can allocate $3-5 million from the Over-the-road Bus Security Fund for research on security recommendations for over-the-road buses, including reviewing current security measures, researching shut-off mechanisms and detection technology, and compiling industry best practices. The Secretary of Transportation will consult with industry, labor, and other groups, including over-the-road bus management and labor representatives, public safety officials, law enforcement, and the National Academy of Sciences."
