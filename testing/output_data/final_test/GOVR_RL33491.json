    "content": "The restructuring announced on January 19, 2006, is part of Secretary Rice's \"transformational development\" initiative to use foreign assistance for economic transformation in recipient countries, aiming to graduate them from U.S. aid dependency. Transformational development involves fundamental changes in governance, human capacity, and economic structure to enable sustainable progress without foreign aid. USAID's 2004 White Paper also highlights challenges like strengthening fragile states, providing humanitarian relief, supporting U.S. geostrategic interests, and addressing global issues. The concept of transformational development has been applied by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to reward \"best performing\" countries through a competitive process measuring achievements in governance, economic policies, and social programs. A related \"transformational diplomacy\" initiative will reposition diplomats to \"critical emerging areas,\" enhance language and regional skills, and emphasize outreach to foreign populations. Secretary Rice advocates for better coordination and policy coherence of U.S. assistance programs, focusing on short-term and long-term strategic goals at the country and global level. Secretary Rice advocates for better coordination and policy coherence of U.S. assistance programs to achieve short-term and long-term strategic goals at the country and global level. The DFA position aims to promote national security through foreign aid, viewing it as a tool to combat terrorism and criminal activities in countries with high poverty levels and undemocratic governments. The DFA is tasked with developing a coordinated U.S. foreign assistance strategy and directing a transformation of aid efforts. The USAID Administrator and DFA, Tobias, works to develop a coordinated U.S. foreign assistance strategy and transform aid efforts to achieve the President's goals. USAID remains independent but reports to the Secretary of State for foreign policy guidance. Administrator Tobias has identified challenges such as fragmented planning, program duplication, poor accountability, and a lack of linkage between objectives and implementation. The DFA has authority over foreign assistance programs managed by USAID and the State Department, providing guidance for assistance delivered through other government agencies. Various agencies are funded through different budget accounts, with State Department and USAID accounting for about 53% of the total U.S. foreign aid budget in 2005. In 2005, the Defense Department disbursed 24% of the total U.S. foreign aid budget for reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other agencies disbursed 22%, highlighting fragmentation and lack of coordination in aid programs. Critics argue for a coherent foreign aid policy strategy. USAID manages most economic assistance programs. In FY2006, USAID manages $4.347 billion for economic growth, health programs, and disaster assistance. State Department transfers funds to USAID for various programs, including narcotics and law enforcement. Economic Support Funds (ESF) of $2.621 billion are co-managed by State and USAID. State Department directly manages programs like Global HIV/AIDS Initiative and Foreign Military Financing. In FY2006, State-managed foreign aid programs, including Military Education and Training (IMET), totaled $19.6 billion. Other foreign policy-related agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps, Department of Treasury, and Trade and Development Agency also provide foreign assistance. Ambassador Tobias stated that the DFA would oversee foreign aid funding accounts under Secretary Rice's authority, but the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator may not be under DFA control. The DFA will not have control over the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator. Programs totaling $15 billion in FY2006 and $15.6 billion in FY2007 will be under his direction, while an additional $4 billion in FY2006 and $6.5 billion in FY2007 for State Department programs will remain outside his control. The challenge for the new Director will be coordinating programs outside the State Department and USAID. Ambassador Tobias aims to establish a formal process for achieving the DFA's coordination mandate. The Development Coordinating Council (DCC) was legislated in 1973 to coordinate government-wide foreign assistance activities but rarely met and is now an unimplemented provision. Various departments and agencies have foreign assistance programs, with disbursements totaling roughly $5.6 billion in 2005. In 2005, agencies disbursed around $5.6 billion, accounting for 22% of total foreign aid disbursements. The Department of Defense is increasingly involved in post-conflict situations, running programs similar to those of the State Department. It is unclear how much influence the DFA will have over DOD programs in strategic places like Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress has authorized DOD to carry out reconstruction and stabilization programs in these countries. The Iraq Freedom Fund, established in the FY2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriation, authorizes DOD to provide counter-terrorism training for foreign governments. In FY2006, Congress provided $4.66 billion in the Defense Appropriation Act. The Commanders' Emergency Response Program (CERP) allows U.S. military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction needs. Additionally, funds were allocated for training and equipping security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as repairing oil facilities and infrastructure in the region. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 109-163) authorizes programs to repair oil facilities in Iraq, transfer defense articles to Iraq and Afghanistan, and provide healthcare to Iraqi children injured in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Congress also authorized programs to train and equip foreign militaries for counterterrorist operations. The FY2006 Defense Appropriation Act (P.L. 109-148) provided funds for reimbursing key cooperating nations for logistical and military support in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism. The FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 109-163) authorizes programs for repairing oil facilities in Iraq, transferring defense articles to Iraq and Afghanistan, and providing healthcare to Iraqi children injured in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Congress also authorized programs to train and equip foreign militaries for counterterrorist operations. The FY2006 Defense Appropriation Act (P.L. 109-148) provided $805 million for reimbursing key cooperating nations for logistical and military support in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the global war on terrorism. Additionally, Congress authorized up to $100 million annually for services, defense articles, and funds to the Secretary of State for reconstruction, security, or stabilization assistance to foreign countries. DOD is also authorized to provide humanitarian assistance in response to military operations or natural disasters, with $61.5 million allocated for humanitarian and civic assistance activities in host nations in FY2006. DOD funding for counter-drug activities totaled $917.7 million in FY2006. Administrator Tobias aims to improve coordination of foreign assistance programs, focusing on USAID and State Department programs. The DFA Office was created to address fragmented planning and budgeting processes. The DFA Office, created to improve coordination of foreign assistance programs, draws staff from State and USAID to centralize planning and budgeting activities. The office aims to reduce duplication, ensure coherence, and facilitate tracking of foreign assistance. It oversees the development of FY2007 operational plans for USAID programs in 67 countries. The plan envisions operational plans for 67 countries with U.S. foreign assistance resources, including funding levels and performance measures. Plans will be reviewed in Washington for consistency with foreign policy goals before funds are allocated. Tobias' reforms include a Strategic Framework with objectives and performance indicators for recipient countries, linking development goals with funding sources and activities. The Framework serves as a roadmap to guide country teams in achieving goals. The Framework is used for integrated budget planning for State and USAID. It creates five categories of countries: Rebuilding Countries for post-conflict states, Transforming Countries for low and lower-middle income countries meeting MCC criteria, Sustaining Partnership Countries for higher income countries with ongoing relationships, Restrictive Countries for authoritarian governments, and Developing Countries for low and lower-middle income countries. Programs in Restrictive Countries operate through non-governmental organizations or entities outside the country. The Framework categorizes countries into five groups based on their income levels and development status. Each category represents common challenges aid programs would address. Some recipient countries may object to their categorization, especially if they face multiple development challenges. The framework outlines five aid objectives for program design: peace and security, governing justly and democratically, investing in people, economic growth, and humanitarian assistance. The Framework categorizes countries into five groups based on income levels and development status, with country teams making recommendations on aid programs. Critics fear unidimensional programs and neglect of poverty alleviation. The Administration argues the Framework is flexible and includes poverty reduction as an end goal, balancing short-term strategic goals with long-term development. The DFA is overseeing the development of the FY2008 foreign aid budget for the State Department and USAID, coordinating integrated teams to define program priorities and country-specific recommendations. The budget will be presented to Congress in February 2007 in an integrated format encompassing both State and USAID programs. No changes to the account structure are expected, with the budget structured around strategic objectives. The FY2008 budget and budget justifications will align with the new Framework's strategic objectives. A \"fast-track\" process for 67 countries is underway to develop operational plans reflecting the new framework. Funds will be reallocated based on the review, with a request for reprogramming expected after the FY2008 budget submission. Implementation of foreign aid reform initiatives has been challenging despite past discussions by various entities. Two senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee were tasked with leading a bipartisan effort to rewrite foreign aid laws in response to changing global conditions. This initiative aimed to redefine key objectives and streamline congressional processes. The House Foreign Affairs Committee endorsed legislation to redefine key American foreign aid objectives and streamline congressional restrictions on executive implementation. However, the initiative faced opposition from key members like Representative Gilman, leading to its failure. In 1993, Deputy Secretary of State Clifford Wharton led a review of U.S. foreign aid policy, which influenced the Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act submitted to Congress. In the mid-1990s, there were proposals to consolidate foreign aid programs under the Secretary of State's control by abolishing USIA, ACDA, and USAID. In 1998, USIA and ACDA were transferred to the State Department, while USAID remained independent. The restructuring initiative in the mid-1990s consolidated foreign aid programs under the Secretary of State's control by transferring USIA and ACDA into State, while retaining USAID as an independent agency. The legislation required the USAID Administrator to report to the Secretary of State. Some view this as a long overdue reform effort, while others believe it does not go far enough. Critics are concerned about potential aid politicization under the new initiative. The new initiative may lead to aid politicization and marginalize USAID in U.S. development policy. Congress will not have a direct role in the restructuring, but key committees will oversee the plan. Secretary Rice argues for more coordination in foreign assistance programs to meet development goals. The FY2008 budget will be reviewed by the 110th Congress in February 2007, with a request to reprogram FY2007 funds to reflect the new framework. Secretary Rice has highlighted the inefficiencies and redundancies in the U.S. foreign aid apparatus, with programs split between USAID and State. The creation of the DFA may improve coordination but questions remain about its authority and impact on funding levels. Efforts to streamline programs like counter-narcotics and democracy are underway, but the extent of efficiency gains is uncertain. The DFA's oversight over offices outside his portfolio, such as PEPFAR, also raises questions about coordination and effectiveness. The Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is not under the DFA's budgeting authority, reporting directly to the Secretary of State. While the Director of Foreign Assistance oversees State Department and USAID aid programs, other agencies like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps, and Treasury Department manage separate aid activities. Coordination with these programs remains unclear under the DFA's government-wide foreign assistance strategy. Some critics fear that a coordinated U.S. foreign assistance strategy may prioritize certain countries over others in need, potentially reducing aid for long-term development and poverty reduction goals. There are concerns that the State Department's focus on short-term strategic considerations could overshadow USAID's traditional objectives. Balancing these competing priorities will be challenging, especially as the State Department gains more authority over policy, diminishing USAID's influence. The State Department has gained significant authority over policy, shifting responsibilities from USAID to the Department in areas such as aid programs and HIV/AIDS initiatives. Concerns exist that USAID's role is diminishing in favor of a Washington-based planning process, raising uncertainty about its future. Some believe USAID may be reduced to solely implementing programs rather than shaping development policy, while others argue that the reconfiguration will strengthen its role and status. The State Department has gained authority over policy, shifting responsibilities from USAID. Concerns exist about USAID's diminishing role in favor of a Washington-based planning process. The DFA will serve as USAID Administrator, allowing for greater participation in policy and budget decisions. Previous difficulties in negotiating with State Department officials will be resolved with the DFA's authority. Other policy options, such as creating a Deputy Secretary of State for foreign aid, were considered but dropped. The current restructuring effort for foreign aid is seen as just the first step in a larger reform. Some observers believe that a more comprehensive approach should have been taken, consulting with Congress and presenting a complete legislative package for approval. Congressional earmarks are also seen as hindering the Administration's flexibility in responding to global events and prioritizing aid objectives. The Administration's flexibility in responding to global events and prioritizing aid objectives may be hindered by congressional directives in the annual foreign operations appropriation bills. Congressional priorities may not completely align with the strategic framework developed by the DFA, as seen in the FY2007 Foreign Operations bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The House-passed bill creates a Trade Capacity Enhancement Fund totaling $522 million, consolidating programs into a $1 billion Democracy Fund and health programs into the Child Survival and Health account. Congressional priorities in the framework and FY2008 appropriations bills will be a challenge for Congress and executive officials to address."
