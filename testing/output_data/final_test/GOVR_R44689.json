    "content": "The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) is a funding program created in 1978 by the National Science Foundation to provide competitive grant opportunities to states with historically low federal research funding. EPSCoR aims to increase research and infrastructure capacity in these states to improve their ability to compete for federal R&D funding. EPSCoR-like programs are active at various federal agencies including DOE, NASA, USDA, and NIH. The EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee was established in 1992 to improve coordination among these programs. NSF chairs the EICC, authorized by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. EPSCoR was initially meant to be a short-term catalyst for research capacity development but has evolved into a long-term program supporting education, diversity, and economic development goals. This report provides an overview of the active EPSCoR programs at various federal agencies, including eligibility criteria, operations, funding information, findings, and recommendations. EPSCoR eligibility criteria vary by agency, with DOE and NASA following NSF's determinations, while USDA and NIH have their own criteria. Table 1 lists FY2016 eligible jurisdictions for agencies with active programs. The EPSCoR program was established in 1978 by the National Science Board and formally established in statute in 1988 to assist states with limited federal R&D funding. The program's mission is to advance excellence in science and engineering research and education. The EPSCoR program aims to advance science and engineering research and education, increase research capacity and competitiveness, and promote engagement in areas supported by the NSF. It also focuses on broadening participation in diverse groups, establishing STEM education opportunities, and addressing research and workforce development needs. The NSF EPSCoR program requires eligible jurisdictions to form steering committees and develop specific science and technology plans to address development needs. Steering committees analyze strengths, barriers, and opportunities to build statewide networks with partners in academia, government, and the private sector. Funding awards structure has evolved since 1980 to support research competitiveness and establishment of state steering committees. The NSF EPSCoR program has evolved since 1980 to support research competitiveness by establishing state steering committees, identifying barriers, and suggesting remedies. Funding awards have increased over the years, with a focus on supporting research clusters and infrastructure development. In the 2000s, the program was moved to the Office of Integrative Activities and now includes three investment components: Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) awards, co-funding, and outreach/workshops. RII Track-2 awards provide funding for interjurisdictional teams working on NSF priority research topics like Understanding the Brain and Sustainable Food, Energy, and Water Systems. RII Track-3 awards support projects to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM. NSF introduced the RII Track-4 component in FY2017, offering up to $300,000 over two years for non-tenured investigators to enhance their research potential through collaborative visits to premier research centers. Fellows are expected to improve research competitiveness and enhance institutional research capacity. Specific criteria and requirements vary by track. EPSCoR proposal requirements vary by track, with cost-sharing required for RII Track-1 awards. RII Track-2 and -3 awards do not have a cost-sharing requirement and have less restrictive limits on proposal submissions. Eligibility is based on NSF research support funding levels, with jurisdictions becoming eligible if their funding is equal to or less than 0.75% of the total NSF RRA budget. Figure 1 displays EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions for FY2016, and Table A-1 shows NSF RRA funding received by each jurisdiction for FY2013-FY2015. The co-funding component is an internal joint funding mechanism between EPSCoR and another NSF office, providing support for proposals in EPSCoR jurisdictions. Co-funding awards assist proposals recommended for funding but unable to be funded due to budget constraints. States losing RII eligibility can still receive co-funding for three years. Additionally, the outreach/workshop component funds activities like workshops and conferences to explore new scientific areas. The outreach/workshop component of the EPSCoR program funds workshops, conferences, and community-based activities to explore new scientific areas and share best practices. It also supports travel costs for connecting NSF staff with research and education communities in EPSCoR jurisdictions. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed DOE to operate an EPSCoR program within its Office of Science, focusing on supporting energy-related research and development and increasing professionals in energy-related fields. The DOE EPSCoR program focuses on increasing professionals in energy-related fields and building relationships between professionals in EPSCoR jurisdictions and scientists from DOE facilities. Eligibility is based on recent funding received from NSF. Funding opportunities include Implementation Grants, State/National Laboratory Partnership Grants, and Early Career Awards. Implementation Grants do not require matching funds and have no limit on active grants per jurisdiction. The NASA EPSCoR program, established in 1992, aims to develop aerospace research capabilities in eligible states. It includes three award components with funding up to $750,000 for topic-specific projects. The program focuses on building relationships with NASA researchers and contributing to local economic viability. NASA EPSCoR program supports research and technology development needs, offering ISS Flight Opportunity awards. USDA's FASE grants program includes New Investigator Grants, Pre- and Post-doctoral Fellowships, and Strengthening Grants to enhance institutional capacity and competitiveness in research, education, and extension activities. Strengthening Grants aim to attract new scientists and educators to work in high-priority research areas. Strengthening Grants under USDA's FASE program aim to enhance institutional capacity and competitiveness in research, education, and extension activities. These grants can be awarded to small and mid-sized institutions with limited success in receiving Federal funds, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, or institutions eligible for USDA EPSCoR funding. There is no specific set-aside amount for EPSCoR-eligible states, and awards are provided directly to individual investigators based on NIFA's eligibility criteria each year. The NIH Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program, similar to EPSCoR, aims to provide research institute funding in states with historically low success rates. It consists of two main components: Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), supporting thematic, multidisciplinary centers run by junior faculty. The COBRE program supports thematic, multidisciplinary centers with related projects run by junior faculty and overseen by senior mentors. It provides up to 15 years of funding in three five-year phases, with funding in the second and third phases contingent upon previous success. The IDeA-CTR initiative supports the development of regional infrastructure and capacity for clinical and translational research. The INBRE program supports statewide systems of biomedical institutions and improves student access to biomedical training and resources. The IDeA program supports student access to biomedical training and resources in eligible states. It has a co-funding component for meritorious awards from other NIH institutes. An eligible jurisdiction may have one active INBRE grant and up to three active COBRE grants per institution. Cost-sharing is not required, but applicants are encouraged to provide matching funds. Strong institutional support and a commitment to building and sustaining the research program are important in the proposal review process. Eligibility is based on historic proposal success rates of institutions in each state. The NIH eligibility requirement for the IDeA program is based on proposal success rates of institutions in each state. In 2008, eligibility was frozen due to a decline in success rates, with 47 states and territories potentially eligible if not frozen. A proposal to revise eligibility criteria to \"aggregate NIH funding received by entities in the state at or below the median of all states\" has been suggested. Total EPSCoR funding has increased significantly since FY1999, driven by funding from NIH and NSF. Total EPSCoR program funding in FY2015 was $500.8 million, with NIH and NSF accounting for 88% of the funding. NSF's EPSCoR program received 2.3% of the agency's overall budget in FY2015. The RII component historically receives the largest proportion of NSF EPSCoR funding, with an estimated $128 million in FY2016. In 1992, federal agencies with EPSCoR programs formed the EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC) to integrate all programs for maximum taxpayer investment. The EICC, chaired by NSF, coordinates federal EPSCoR programs and reports to Congress annually. Member agencies include NSF, DOE, NASA, USDA, and NIH. The EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC) includes NSF, DOE, NASA, USDA, and NIH. It aims to coordinate federal EPSCoR programs, eliminate duplication, align agency objectives with state goals, develop metrics for assessing research quality, exchange information on legislation and policies, and address common concerns in S&T research and training. The EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC) works to coordinate federal EPSCoR programs and address common concerns in S&T research and training. The EICC's FY2015 report to Congress highlighted discussions on topics such as NSF eligibility criteria and the role of EPSCoR steering committees in helping states improve their R&D capacity. Congress and others are interested in assessing the success of the EPSCoR program in helping states compete for federal R&D funding. In 1999, an external evaluation of the EPSCoR program's impact on federal R&D funding showed a modest increase in funding for EPSCoR states. The program was believed to contribute to enhanced R&D competitiveness by improving research infrastructure and collaborations, although its effects on university-wide actions were limited. The report recommended periodic reassessments of eligibility criteria and continued support of research clusters to promote sustainable research efforts. An external evaluation of NIH's COBRE program in 2008 found that the program effectively strengthened institutional research infrastructure and training for junior investigators. Recommendations included rigorous assessments of research progress and increased mentorship for junior investigators. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 directed the NSF to conduct a study of all Federal agencies administering EPSCoR programs. The resulting study found challenges in assessing EPSCoR effectiveness due to broad program goals, inconsistent evaluation metrics, and competing objectives across agencies. The study found challenges in assessing EPSCoR effectiveness due to broad program goals and inconsistent evaluation metrics. Evaluators noted enhancements in infrastructure, training, and human capital in participating states, with positive changes in cultural attitudes towards science and engineering. Recommendations include promoting research capacity development in all states to ensure students nationwide have access to high-quality research opportunities. The EPSCoR program aims to enhance research and STEM training capacity at universities in every state. Recommendations include improving proposal evaluation processes, requiring matching funds for research awards, and developing a new eligibility framework. A 2014 report by the IDA/STPI assessed NSF-specific EPSCoR activities and found challenges in evaluating program effectiveness. The IDA/STPI report found that NSF's EPSCoR program has increased competitiveness for NSF funding overall, especially for state cohorts entering before 2000. Geographic concentration of NSF R&D funding has slightly decreased since 1980, with jurisdictions improving research bases and sustaining EPSCoR activities long term. The program aims to assist states historically receiving little federal R&D funding, but lacks a clear definition for eligibility. The IDA/STPI report recommended that NSF define \"undue concentration\" and encourage experimental strategies to enhance research capacity for EPSCoR funding. NSF responded by proposing stronger program evaluations, flexible mechanisms for research support, and collaboration with other agencies in the EICC to address eligibility issues. NSF has conducted workshops with stakeholders to recommend long-term program goals and strategies for EPSCoR, such as coordinating across federal agencies and developing cyberinfrastructure. The NSF Committee of Visitors completed a detailed program review in FY2015. The NSF Committee of Visitors conducted a program review in FY2015, providing recommendations for improving proposal review processes, expanding award components, and establishing an advisory committee. NSF plans to convene an advisory panel in FY2017 based on previous workshops. Challenges for the EPSCoR program include balancing research capacity development across states and supporting high-quality science. EPSCoR has faced issues due to its lengthening duration and evolving program focus. Critics argue that the program's continued existence after 30 years shows ineffectiveness. The program EPSCoR, established 30 years ago, is criticized for being ineffective and seen as a \"redistribution of wealth.\" Supporters argue for its necessity due to the program's long tenure. There is debate on the program's duration and effectiveness in building research capacity and competitiveness. EPSCoR's duration and program focus have evolved over time. Initially termed \"experimental,\" it is now considered \"established\" with a focus on innovative methods. Some compare EPSCoR state projects to small businesses, noting their agility and unique contributions to the national agenda. EPSCoR has also been recognized for its role in developing states' economies. EPSCoR has evolved into a program that fosters science-based economic development, emphasizing the importance of linking S&T plans with economic development plans in developing states' economies. The 2015-2016 NSF EPSCoR Workshop Series on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Translational Research led to a guide to help EPSCoR jurisdictions build connections for economic development. NIH's FY2017 budget request included plans to support small business and technology transfer activities in IDeA states, using funds from SBIR and STTR programs to establish biotechnology incubators in each IDeA region. The Senate Committee on Appropriations has shown support for these initiatives. The focus on innovation in small business research funding in IDeA States is part of the growth of EPSCoR objectives, which include supporting research projects, building networks, infrastructure, and capacity, broadening diversity in STEM, and connecting research to technology transfer and economic development. The eligibility criteria for NSF EPSCoR have changed over time, with no consensus on the preferred indicators for selecting EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions. The 2013 NAS assessment suggested EPSCoR eligibility factors including federal research funding, state commitment, proposal success rates, total research funding, progress, future opportunities, and financial need. NSF is exploring eligibility models and indicators of 'undue concentration' with other federal agencies to ensure program design and funding levels align with criteria. EICC is examining eligibility criteria across agencies to determine common federal EPSCoR eligibility. The EICC provided recommendations to NSF's Office of Integrative Activities regarding a common federal EPSCoR eligibility criterion. Developing such a criterion could address concerns about eligibility for EPSCoR funding at DOE. NIH has proposed a new criterion for eligibility based on aggregate funding received by entities in a state. This raises questions about the goal of state \"graduation\" from EPSCoR. The uncertainty of EPSCoR agencies developing common eligibility and graduation criteria raises questions about determining EPSCoR's success. Various metrics are being considered, such as increases in agency-specific R&D funding and grant proposal success rates. Academic studies have assessed EPSCoR's impact on university research, competitiveness in R&D awards funding, and economic development. The effectiveness of the EPSCoR program is measured by increased federal funding in participating states. Research shows that states in the program become more competitive for science and engineering funding over time. However, the impact is gradual, with some states reducing their contributions to academic institutions as they secure more federal R&D funding. University-industry research partnerships are comparable between EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR states. Research partnerships and funding in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR states were comparable between 1985 and 2000. Researchers emphasize the need for a more nuanced evaluation of capacity building to fully understand improvements in competitiveness. Studies have shown that EPSCoR positively impacts publication quality and capacity-related characteristics in participating states. EPSCoR studies emphasize the challenge of demonstrating direct contributions to success. Recommendations include more thorough data collection for improved evaluations. NSF EPSCoR stresses the importance of detailed, standardized data for assessing investments. The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, P.L. 114-329) revised program requirements for EPSCoR, now named the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. It directs agencies to consider modifications to award structures, harmonization of metrics, long-term investments, and support for innovative research models. H.Amdt. 317 in 2015 aimed to amend H.R. 2578. In 2015, H.Amdt. 317 aimed to amend H.R. 2578 by prohibiting funds for EPSCoR programs at NSF and NASA. Some Members expressed concerns about the program's funding distribution and growth from temporary to permanent. Opposition argued that EPSCoR supported strategic areas and balanced funding disparities. In 2016, a failed amendment aimed to prohibit funds for DOE's EPSCoR program, with concerns raised about program eligibility and research grant expenditures. Supporters suggested a per capita basis for funding allocation, while opponents were open to debating program details and formulas. The 2015 Senate bill introduced revisions to the IDeA program, including allowing NSF EPSCoR-eligible entities to apply for NIH INBRE awards. The FY2016 omnibus did not include these changes, but recognized the success of the IDeA program and requested updates to include EPSCoR eligible states. The EPSCoR program has evolved over three decades with input from stakeholders and academic research, leading to expanded funding and objectives. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about EPSCoR's structure and agency approaches. Questions have been raised about the federal government's role in scientific research and balancing innovation with accountability. Congress may consider providing additional oversight on EPSCoR's longevity, focus, and eligibility criteria. Congress may need to evaluate eligibility criteria and data collection for program graduation and future direction."
