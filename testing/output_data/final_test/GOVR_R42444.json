    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits can be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit (EB) program based on state economic conditions. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program, which provided additional weeks of benefits, expired in December 2013. This report details the legislative history of the EUC08 program and its benefits before expiration. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program was created in 2008 to extend unemployment benefits during economic slowdowns. It expired in December 2013, after being extended multiple times by Congress. The EUC08 program, which provided extended unemployment benefits, expired at the end of 2013. Congress made structural changes to the program during its existence, affecting the availability of benefits in states. Table 1 and Figure 1 outline the amendments and benefits provided under the EUC08 program from 2008 to 2013. The EUC08 program, which provided extended unemployment benefits, expired at the end of 2013. Changes were made to the program, including modifications to the number of weeks available in each tier and state unemployment rate requirements. Benefits ceased to be available in North Carolina in July 2013 due to state legislative action. North Carolina's legislation in February 2013 reduced UC weekly benefits, violating the \"nonreduction\" rule and ending the EUC08 agreement with the Department of Labor. Tiers of benefits were available based on state unemployment rates, with North Carolina losing access to Tier II and Tier III benefits. The EUC08 program provided temporary benefits in tiers based on state unemployment rates, with Tier IV offering up to 10 weeks of benefits to eligible individuals. All tiers expired by January 1, 2014, and the program ended on December 28, 2013. The benefit amount was equivalent to the individual's weekly regular UC benefit. The EUC08 program offered temporary benefits in tiers based on state unemployment rates. States determined UC benefit eligibility, amount, and duration through their own laws and regulations. Eligibility for EUC08 benefits required exhaustion of regular UC benefits. The EUC08 program provided temporary benefits based on state unemployment rates, with eligibility determined by earnings and employment history in a 12-month base period. Claimants needed at least 20 weeks of full-time insured employment or equivalent wages to qualify for benefits. States used different methods to calculate this requirement. The EUC08 program required claimants to have 20 weeks of full-time insured employment or meet specific earnings criteria to qualify for benefits. States had different methods to calculate this requirement, such as earnings in the base period equal to 1.5 times high-quarter wages or 40 times the most recent weekly benefit amount. The EUC08 program required claimants to have 20 weeks of full-time insured employment or meet specific earnings criteria to qualify for benefits. P.L. 112-96 amended EUC08 law to require states to provide reemployment and eligibility assessments to most EUC08 claimants. States were temporarily prohibited from actively reducing UC benefit amounts through changes to benefit calculation from February 2009 through December 2013. The \"nonreduction\" rule expired with the EUC08 program in December 2013. States reduced UC benefit duration to decrease total payments, leading to changes in state UC benefit duration as a response to financing shortfalls. States that reduced regular UC benefits also decreased EUC08 and EB benefits. Eight states decreased maximum UC durations after the \"nonreduction\" rule: Arkansas reduced from 26 to 25 weeks, effective March 30, 2011, and Florida decreased to a variable maximum duration. Florida reduced the maximum UC duration from 26 weeks to a variable duration based on the state's unemployment rate, ranging from 12 to 23 weeks. Georgia also decreased its UC maximum duration from 26 weeks to a variable duration between 14 and 20 weeks, depending on the state's unemployment rate. Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and North Carolina reduced their maximum UC benefit duration from 26 weeks to 20 weeks or less based on the state's unemployment rate. These changes were effective on different dates between 2011 and 2014. North Carolina and South Carolina reduced their maximum UC benefit duration from 26 weeks to 20 weeks based on the state's unemployment rate. The reduction in benefits took effect on different dates in 2011 and 2013. Additionally, the EUC08 program was federally financed from the extended unemployment compensation account within the Unemployment Trust Fund starting in February 2009. The EUC08 program, financed from the Unemployment Trust Fund, had five lapses in program authorization before its expiration in 2013. These lapses were addressed through legislation or program administration. The longest lapse was 49 days in 2010. The EUC08 program had multiple lapses in program authorization, with the longest being 49 days in 2010. The passage of P.L. 112-240 addressed the most recent lapse in 2012-2013 and retroactively restored program authorization. The EUC08 program should not be confused with the EB program, which is permanently authorized and applies only to certain states based on unemployment conditions. The EB program provides up to 13 or 20 weeks of extended benefits for unemployed workers in states with high unemployment. When a state no longer meets the criteria for extended benefits, the program becomes inactive, and payments stop immediately. The EB program is authorized by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 and is funded 50% by the federal government. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily provided 100% federal financing of EB benefits through December 31, 2013. States were required to pay EUC08 benefits before EB benefits after the enactment of P.L. 112-96."
