Defining the meta-training task distribution is challenging, as tasks need to be neither too similar nor too diverse for effective generalization. Introducing a teacher model to control the sequence of tasks for the meta-learner can help alleviate these issues. The teacher model starts with simple tasks and increases difficulty based on the student's progress, similar to how humans learn through experience. Meta-learning is crucial for developing AI that can learn continuously and generalize effectively. To address the challenge of task distribution in meta-training, a new approach called metateaching combines curriculum learning and meta learning. By teaching AI agents to start with easy tasks and gradually increase difficulty, we aim to move closer to achieving Artificial General Intelligence. This approach is currently under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning. Meta-learning is essential for AI development, focusing on continuous learning and effective generalization. Metateaching combines curriculum learning and meta-learning to address task distribution challenges in meta-training. It involves starting with easy tasks and progressively increasing difficulty to move towards Artificial General Intelligence. This approach is currently being reviewed by the International Conference on Machine Learning. Meta-learning involves using prior knowledge to solve new tasks. Different approaches like MAML, FOMAML, and REPTILE use gradient information for metalearning updates. Meta-learning approaches can be categorized into random search, gradient descent, and past information utilization. Curriculum learning is related but focuses on a different problem. Self-paced learning, also known as curriculum learning, involves using past experience to guide learning effectively. This approach aims to build systems that continuously learn and utilize past experiences. Various methods, including teacher-student curriculum learning, have been proposed to transfer information between tasks. The method involves training the student on N discrete tasks, updating task sampling probabilities based on learning progress. It draws from multi-arm bandit literature but lacks the ability to leverage progressive task knowledge or address core meta-learning problems. Another approach in BID7 focuses on unsupervised meta-learning using diversity but does not incorporate curriculum learning or policy transfer. The study follows the setup proposed in BID5 to learn initial model parameters across a task distribution. The meta-learning objective is to optimize a model for tasks sampled from a distribution, with parameters adapted to fit examples of the current task. Tasks have varying difficulties that can be compared, and the distribution's difficulty can be modulated. The meta-learner aims to navigate task difficulty by modulating task space parameters using a neural network metateacher model. This model updates task difficulty based on student progress in an unsupervised manner, different from traditional methods. The approach described involves curriculum learning in a meta-learning setting, where a \"static teacher\" defines progressively harder task distributions for the student model. This method relies on knowledge of task-space parameters and can fail if tasks become too difficult for the model to solve. The static teacher defines increasingly difficult tasks for the student model, but if tasks become too challenging, the model may not progress. To address this, an adaptive teacher is introduced to decrease student loss while increasing task complexity. The introduction of an adaptive teacher model aims to adjust task difficulty based on student performance, pushing them towards more challenging tasks. The teacher updates task parameters by estimating how changes affect task difficulty, using student progress to guide the process. The adaptive meta-teaching algorithm updates the teacher model based on student performance, adjusting task difficulty by penalizing high or low performance. It encourages exploration of more difficult tasks by incorporating the total change in task space parameters. During meta-training, the meta-learner samples from the task distribution parameterized by these parameters. The meta-learner samples from the task distribution parameterized by parameters and stores loss on meta-validation tasks. The teacher model is updated via gradient descent based on modified loss. Challenges include describing task space with continuous difficulty function. In more complex task spaces, defining task difficulty manually or through manual labeling is challenging. Learning a task difficulty space that captures relationships between tasks is ideal. Updating task space distribution using gradient descent requires bounding meta-teacher's outputs accurately. Adding meta-teaching complicates meta-optimization, which is already difficult to train. Addressing the underlying difficulty of current meta-learning algorithms is crucial for practical implementation. In the future, meta-learning algorithms will be applied to a wide variety of problems, including distributions that cannot be solved at once. This approach aims to unify meta-learning, curriculum learning, and lifelong learning, allowing past knowledge to guide future tasks and create lifelong agents in lifelong settings."
