    "content": "Three important themes support an understanding of public health and medical preparedness and response. Preparedness and response involve different leadership roles, legal authorities, organizational structures, and funding mechanisms at each level of government. States, not the federal government, have authority and responsibility for health care and emergency management oversight. Governors can order evacuations in emergency situations based on state laws. The federal government generally does not dictate health care or emergency management activities to state or local officials. The nation's health care system is primarily private and for-profit, operating in a competitive marketplace where emergency planning may not be a priority. In the event of a catastrophe, state and local governments lead response efforts, supported by legal authorities. The President can provide additional resources under the Stafford Act when state and local resources are overwhelmed. Recent incidents have highlighted limitations in existing funding mechanisms for public health and medical incident response. Major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act may not cover infectious disease threats like bioterrorism or pandemics. The Secretary of HHS can access a special fund for emergencies, but it is currently empty. There is a lack of a comprehensive mechanism for providing necessary support. There is currently no money in the fund for federal assistance in uninsured or uncompensated individual health care costs resulting from natural disasters or terrorist incidents. The report focuses on incident response activities, examining statutory authorities, coordinating mechanisms, and funding proposals for a coordinated federal response to public health and medical emergencies. The report discusses existing mechanisms, gaps, and funding proposals for a federal response to public health and medical emergencies. It includes a listing of federal public health emergency authorities and references other CRS Reports for more information on preparedness and response. The report discusses federal response to public health and medical emergencies, including mechanisms, gaps, and funding proposals. It references CRS Reports on preparedness and response for disasters like hurricanes, pandemics, and major disasters declared under the Stafford Act. The President can declare a major disaster in the United States due to fires, floods, or explosions causing severe damage. The Governor of the affected State must request this declaration when the disaster overwhelms the state and local governments' capabilities. Federal assistance is then provided to supplement their efforts. The Governor must request a major disaster declaration when the state and local governments are overwhelmed, and Federal assistance is needed. The state must commit resources and meet cost-sharing requirements to receive assistance. The President may declare a major disaster or emergency under the Stafford Act. An emergency declaration provides less assistance but gives the President broader discretion. The definition of \"emergency\" is more flexible and allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to save lives and protect public health during events like a flu pandemic. An emergency declaration under the Stafford Act allows the President to provide federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to save lives and protect public health. The President has wider discretion in declaring an emergency compared to a major disaster, and can act without a gubernatorial request if the situation primarily falls under federal responsibility. The President can declare an emergency under the Stafford Act based on a request from the Governor of the affected State, stating that the situation requires federal assistance beyond the State's capabilities. The Governor must outline State and local efforts, resources used, and the type of Federal aid needed. The President can also declare an emergency without a gubernatorial request for situations falling under federal responsibility. The President can declare an emergency under the Stafford Act based on federal responsibility, without a gubernatorial request, if the emergency involves a subject area where the United States has exclusive authority. The President's determination may be made without consulting the Governor of the affected State. The emergency declaration authority in the Stafford Act has been used in the past to respond to public health threats. In the fall of 2000, President Clinton issued emergency declarations for New York and New Jersey to contain the West Nile virus. State and local governments are responsible for public health activities, but the federal government can provide assistance in response to public health threats. The Secretary of HHS can offer help to states upon request, without a defined threshold or need demonstration like the Stafford Act. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can provide financial and technical assistance to states for outbreak investigation and disease control activities upon the request of a State Health Official. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority under the PHS Act to assist states in public health emergencies, including waiving administrative requirements and providing additional forms of assistance. The Secretary of HHS can waive administrative requirements and provide assistance to expand federal aid in public health emergencies. The Secretary has the authority to determine the existence of a public health emergency and take appropriate actions to respond, including making grants and entering into contracts. Notification to Congress is required within 48 hours, but publication in the Federal Register is not necessary. The Secretary of HHS can determine a public health emergency, enabling actions like drawing from an emergency fund, implementing Emergency Use Authorization, and waiving administrative requirements in conjunction with the Stafford Act or National Emergencies Act. The Secretary of HHS can waive administrative requirements through the Stafford Act or National Emergencies Act during a public health emergency, allowing for streamlined access to care for individuals. Bills introduced in Congress aim to provide coverage for individuals without health insurance. The Secretary of HHS can waive administrative requirements during a public health emergency to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals. This authority does not require a concurrent declaration under the Stafford Act and is different from Stafford Act major disaster assistance. The response to public health emergencies involves extensions of routine program activities, such as technical assistance, workforce support, and provision of special drugs or tests. Public health emergency determinations made since 2000 are less common than disaster declarations under the Stafford Act due to the Secretary of HHS's existing authority to provide aid without a formal determination. The Public Health Emergency Fund has not had a balance for many years, rendering the determinations issued since 2000 ineffective. The Public Health Emergency Fund has not had a balance for many years, rendering determinations since 2000 ineffective in mobilizing additional funds. Congress may need to review the discretion given to the HHS Secretary in making public health emergency determinations and the associated reporting requirements. Disaster and emergency authorities under the Stafford Act are generally separate from public health emergency authorities. Only one provision in current law requires a concurrent Section 319 public health emergency determination for certain waivers. The Department of Homeland Security released the National Response Plan in 2004 to coordinate federal resources during emergencies. It was replaced by the National Response Framework in 2008 after lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. The NRF is overseen by the Secretary of Homeland Security and implemented by FEMA. The National Response Framework (NRF) was implemented in 2008 to coordinate federal resources during emergencies. It outlines responsibilities and roles of federal agencies, without providing new authority or funding for incident response. The NRF serves as a national coordinating blueprint for state, local, territorial, tribal governments, and the private sector, in addition to federal agencies. Numerous federal planning documents for responding to a flu pandemic have been published, including the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza in 2005 and the Implementation Plan in 2006. These documents outline responsibilities for individuals, industry, governments, and agencies in preparing for and responding to a pandemic. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan, November 2005, provides guidance for national, state, and local policy makers and health departments on key roles and responsibilities during a pandemic. The HHS Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, Part I, November 2006, discusses department-wide activities for disease surveillance, public health interventions, medical response, vaccines, and communication. The Department of Defense Implementation Plan for Pandemic Influenza, August 2006, focuses on force health protection and readiness. The curr_chunk discusses priorities for pandemic response, including health protection, essential functions continuity, support to civil authorities, effective communications, and international partner support. It also mentions the VA Pandemic Influenza Plan, the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Guide for Critical Infrastructure, and state pandemic plans. The curr_chunk discusses state pandemic plans required for flu preparedness, with the NRF serving as a coordinating mechanism for a national response. The Disaster Relief Fund can be used for response activities during a Stafford Act emergency declaration. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for Stafford Act major disaster assistance in response to a flu pandemic, with FEMA issuing a Disaster Assistance Policy in 2007. This is important for determining funding availability for federal activities. The level of funding available for federal activities and assistance to state and local governments is greater after a major disaster declaration compared to an emergency declaration. The federal leadership structure for incident response varies based on whether a Stafford Act declaration is made, with a Federal Coordinating Officer appointed to oversee operations in the affected region. The NRF established the role of Principal Federal Official who reports directly to the Secretary of. The confusion surrounding the roles and authorities of the Principal Federal Official (PFO) and Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO) during incident response was highlighted after Hurricane Katrina. In December 2006, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated national and regional FCOs and PFOs for a flu pandemic response. The roles of these individuals in pandemic planning documents remain unclear, particularly regarding emergency assistance under the Stafford Act. Questions persist about the availability of major disaster assistance in a flu pandemic scenario. The availability of major disaster assistance in a flu pandemic scenario remains uncertain. A legal analysis suggests that Congress did not address this issue in the current definition of a major disaster. The Hurricane Katrina response and flu pandemic planning highlight the need for public health and medical activities in large-scale catastrophes. Successful public health responses involve monitoring food and water safety, injury prevention, infectious disease control, and other government-led activities. A successful medical response in large-scale catastrophes involves coordinating various activities and services among government and private entities. Key elements include patients needing rescue, treatment facilities, healthcare workforce, medical supplies, records system, and financing mechanism. The Secretary of HHS coordinates Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF-8) for public health and medical response. ESF-8 is a coordinating mechanism in the NRF for public health and medical response. A flu pandemic would primarily involve ESF-8, with potential staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions. State-to-state mutual aid may not be reliable, and a severe pandemic could impact multiple sectors. The Secretary of HHS coordinates response activities under ESF-8 for public health and medical needs during emergencies, engaging support agencies and the American Red Cross as needed. This includes assessment, surveillance, medical personnel, supplies, patient care, safety of drugs and biologics, food and agriculture safety, behavioral health care, and water safety. During emergencies, the Secretary of HHS coordinates public health and medical response activities under ESF-8, including vector control, water safety, and veterinary medical support. Coordination with other agencies may be necessary for activities like public safety and power restoration before ESF-8 activities can begin. Concerns about unclear federal responsibilities and leadership roles have been raised in the response to disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 reorganized FEMA programs and established the position of Chief Medical Officer at DHS to coordinate medical and public health aspects of disasters. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 designated the Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead federal public health and medical response to emergencies. The Government Accountability Office recommended rigorous testing and training for clear roles between the Department of Homeland Security and HHS. Concerns about the health and safety of disaster response workers persist in the National Response Framework. Following Hurricane Katrina, confusion about FEMA's role hindered response efforts. Disagreements between FEMA and OSHA delayed funding for OSHA's activities. Some wanted worker health and safety to be elevated in the NRF, but it only contains a revised Worker Safety and Health Support Annex. The SAFE Port Act of the 109th Congress allows for medical monitoring programs after disasters. The HHS has not implemented a plan to address hazardous exposures for responders during disasters. GAO recommended in 2008 that HHS develop a comprehensive plan to ensure responder health and safety, including registering all responders during disasters. The GAO recommended in 2008 that HHS develop a comprehensive plan to ensure responder health and safety during disasters, including implementing medical monitoring programs. The plan should also address individuals affected by disasters who are not responders. HHS is responsible for coordinating federal assistance for identifying victims and determining causes of death, but there is a lack of clear delegation of responsibility for retrieving human remains in mass fatality events. Federal Disaster Mortuary Assistance Teams (DMORTs) are not trained in safe retrieval of remains from hazardous sites, while other responders like Urban Search and Rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard are trained for such tasks. The Urban Search and Rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard are trained to rescue the living in dangerous conditions, not recover the dead. Mass fatality management is a concern during a flu pandemic, with a potential gap in response coordination between ESF-6 and ESF-8. The coordination of emergency shelter and feeding for affected populations falls under ESF-6, while ESF-8 handles medical care. The revised ESF-6 and ESF-8 annexes in the NRF provide more detailed coordination for these functions compared to the NRP. In the NRF, federal leadership for disaster mental health is split between ESF-6 and ESF-8, with FEMA and HHS playing key roles in coordinating mental and behavioral health services following a disaster. HHS assets were deployed extensively for evacuation and care of individuals with special needs during Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. FEMA, HHS, and the American Red Cross reviewed the hurricane response and subsequent preparedness planning, addressing the coordination of these functions in more detail than the NRP annexes. Federal leadership for disaster mental health in the NRF is delegated to FEMA and HHS, with the Department of Justice also involved in cases of terrorism or violence. The NRF addresses the gap in the NRP regarding federal responsibility for pets during disasters, ensuring that individuals with household pets and service animals are accounted for in evacuation planning and support for individuals with disabilities. The President is authorized to make Stafford Act declarations to provide assistance in such situations. The President is authorized to make Stafford Act assistance available for pet rescue and sheltering in disasters. The NRF addresses federal leadership for pets in disasters, ensuring their needs are accommodated during human sheltering services. FEMA issued a policy directive in 2007 for eligible costs related to pet evacuations and sheltering. Hurricane Katrina tested ESF-8 after the establishment of DHS and the NRP. The response to Hurricane Katrina tested ESF-8 after the establishment of DHS and the NRP. Various public health and medical activities were carried out during the hurricane response, with costs covered by multiple agencies and organizations. Private insurance helped with some costs, while Congress provided additional assistance through emergency appropriations. However, some costs, like rebuilding health care infrastructure in New Orleans, remain unmet. The response to Hurricane Katrina tested ESF-8 after the establishment of DHS and the NRP. Federal assistance for mass feeding, shelter, and other activities is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA. Mission assignments from FEMA to federal agencies are reimbursed through the DRF, supporting public health activities during disasters like Hurricane Katrina. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) supports public health activities during disasters, including ensuring food and water safety, monitoring population health, controlling infectious diseases, and evaluating health threats from chemical releases. The fund does not generally cover health care costs for affected individuals but may provide limited assistance. Congress established the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF) in 1983, allowing the HHS Secretary to access funds for public health emergencies. The Public Health Emergency Fund allows the Secretary to access funds for public health emergencies. The fund is available without fiscal year limitation if a public health emergency is declared. A report detailing expenditures and activities must be submitted to relevant committees annually. The fund was authorized for appropriations between 1988 and 2000. The Public Health Emergency Fund was authorized for annual appropriations between 1988 and 2000, but only received appropriations in response to specific public health threats. Since 2000, the fund has not received any appropriations, making it unavailable for subsequent public health emergency responses. The Public Health Emergency Fund was authorized for annual appropriations between 1988 and 2000, but only received appropriations in response to specific public health threats. Since 2000, the fund has not received any appropriations. For the purpose of supporting additional activities of the HHS Secretary, including NDMS deployments, there are authorized to be appropriated necessary sums for fiscal years 2002 through 2006. Legislation introduced in the 110th Congress proposed using the PHEF to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for uninsured individuals affected by public health emergencies. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) at HHS provides funding for public health activities during emergencies, such as flu pandemics and stockpile purchases. It is not a reserve fund for unexpected events and may or may not be designated as emergency spending. In FY2006, Congress appropriated funds previously provided through the PHSSEF to various agencies overseeing programs like the SNS and grants for public health capacity. Funding for hospital preparedness was transferred to the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Additionally, emergency supplemental appropriations bills provided $62.3 billion for response and recovery after Hurricane Katrina. In FY2006, Congress allocated $62.3 billion for emergency response and recovery needs, with additional funds reallocated for the restoration of damaged federal facilities. An extra $6 billion was provided in June 2006 for the DRF, supporting federal response activities to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. FEMA reported expenditures for mission assignments to HHS and CDC for hurricane responses. Multiple HHS agencies, including CDC, were involved in the hurricane response efforts. Multiple agencies, including CDC, were involved in hurricane response efforts and were reimbursed through the DRF. CDC issued guidance allowing states to redirect funds from various grant programs for hurricane relief efforts. Funds could be used for alternate activities or state-to-state mutual aid. CDC noted that no supplemental appropriations were provided for Katrina relief, so existing funds used for relief would reduce the overall amount available for non-relief grant issues. HHS received minimal direct supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Katrina response, with $8 million allocated to CDC for mosquito abatement and pest control activities. Information on the total funds redirected by HHS agencies for Katrina response and any alternate mechanisms to backfill accounts is not publicly available. The HHS received minimal direct supplemental appropriations for Hurricane Katrina response, with $8 million allocated to CDC for mosquito abatement and pest control activities, and $4 million to HRSA to re-establish communications capability in health departments and other entities providing health care in affected areas. Stafford major disaster assistance can support public health response activities under ESF-8, but it is limited in covering uninsured or uncompensated health care costs for disaster victims. There is no federal program specifically designed to cover these costs. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided $2.1 billion through the Medicaid program to assist states in providing for the health care needs of Katrina evacuees for five months following the storm. Policy debates suggest interest in exploring mechanisms to provide assistance for uninsured health care needs of disaster victims, especially in certain situations. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated $2.1 billion through Medicaid to help Katrina evacuees with health care for five months post-storm. Victims still face health issues and struggle to access care. Debate surrounds federal responsibility for health care costs of disaster victims, including those from terrorist attacks. Various federal programs offer limited coverage for health care costs during or after catastrophes. The federal government offers various programs to provide health care services during and after disasters, but these programs are not always well-coordinated or sufficient to meet the needs. Assistance may be provided under major disaster and emergency declarations to address health and safety measures. The FEMA Individuals and Households Program (IHP) offers cash assistance for uninsured medical expenses and other needs during disasters. The maximum amount available is $30,300, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. Certain medications and supplies can be provided from pre-paid stockpiles without reimbursement. Agencies' costs may be reimbursed from the DRF if needed. The CDC's Strategic National Stockpile allows agencies to be reimbursed from the DRF for costs incurred during incidents that result in a Stafford Act declaration. The Stafford Act authorizes financial assistance for mental health services for disaster victims. FEMA and SAMHSA jointly administer the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) with costs reimbursed from the DRF. Public Health Service agencies in HHS can provide support for managing health care needs during surges in specific populations. Some agencies have received supplemental appropriations for these activities. Certain federal compensation programs may cover health care costs for disaster victims, including workers' compensation for federal workers and benefits for public safety officers. Assistance to crime victims may also be available for victims of terrorism-related disasters. The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) was established by Congress to provide compensation for physical injury or death resulting from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Thousands of responders who worked at the site are now experiencing various health problems related to their exposures, including respiratory, psychological, and gastrointestinal issues. The World Trade Center Health Registry was established by Congress to track the health status of individuals exposed to asbestos, heavy metals, and other harmful substances at the site. Medical monitoring programs have identified people with serious health problems related to their exposures, with some receiving intermittent appropriations for medical treatment. The Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) helps individuals affected by the terrorist attack, but some may not qualify if symptoms arose after the fund's closing date. Health insurance coverage may be insufficient for needed treatments, especially for those who lost employer-based coverage due to illness. Workers may face challenges with coverage for prescription drugs or specialty care, and some may lack workers' compensation. Congressional focus is on financing, accountability, and treatment programs for affected individuals. H.R. 847 in the 111th Congress aims to establish programs to cover health care costs for individuals affected by the WTC incident. Hurricane Katrina resulted in many victims losing health insurance, leading to challenges in accessing care with uncertain financing mechanisms. After Hurricane Katrina, private entities retrofitted mechanisms for disaster response. HHS expanded programs to assist state and local agencies, healthcare providers, and storm victims with health needs. Congress granted HHS authority to waive administrative requirements for provider participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP during declared emergencies. This authority was utilized in affected states post-Katrina, improving healthcare access but not addressing financing challenges. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided funding through the Medicaid program to cover health care costs for displaced individuals. This included matching requirements for Medicaid and SCHIP programs, as well as uncompensated care for the uninsured, with up to $2 billion allocated for these activities. This funding was in addition to previous appropriations for disaster-related expenses. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated $100 million in supplemental appropriations to cover expenses related to the hurricane response. Most of this funding was transferred from FEMA to the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Eight states were able to reimburse providers for uncompensated care costs, and 32 states provided continuity of coverage for displaced low-income individuals through Medicaid enrollment. However, individuals, institutions, and providers affected by Hurricane Katrina still face challenges beyond the scope of current disaster assistance mechanisms. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress allocated $100 million in supplemental appropriations for hurricane response. Victims in the New Orleans area still struggle with health care access and infrastructure rebuilding. A severe flu pandemic may require a robust public health response, but funding needs may exceed available resources. Costs for workforce surge capacity and supplies could rise significantly. Surge of patients may impact non-urgent procedures in the health care system. During a pandemic, non-urgent procedures in the health care system could be postponed, raising concerns about revenue shifts for providers and insurers. The cost of providing health care services during a pandemic is a concern, especially for uninsured Americans. Some worry that disease control efforts could suffer if certain subgroups of the population are unwilling to seek care due to insurance status or other reasons. FEMA issued a Disaster Assistance Policy for pandemic flu in March 2007, outlining reimbursable health care services through the Disaster Relief Fund. The Disaster Assistance Policy outlines reimbursable health care services through the Disaster Relief Fund for eligible entities to support ESF-8 activities during a pandemic, including establishing temporary medical facilities and providing emergency medical care. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may not be clear on supporting extended critical medical care during a flu pandemic. After Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided $2.1 billion for Medicaid and SCHIP costs and uncompensated care, but it required legislative action and took six months to enact. It's uncertain if this could be a model for federal assistance during a flu pandemic. During a flu pandemic, Congress may debate expanding federal assistance for health care costs, using the model developed after Hurricane Katrina as a starting point. Legislation proposed establishing a program to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals affected by public health emergencies. The Secretary would determine coverage during a public health emergency, considering the potential strain on health care providers in the affected area. The proposed program aimed to provide emergency health care coverage for uninsured or underinsured individuals during public health emergencies. It would be financed through appropriations to the Public Health Emergency Fund and include outreach and education campaigns. The Secretary would also establish a program for medical monitoring and reporting on the health care needs of the affected population over time. These proposals were not enacted. The Secretaries of Homeland Security and HHS have authority to assist in response to catastrophes. Congress defined their roles after Hurricane Katrina. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority but lacks funding for public health emergencies. The President can use the Disaster Relief Fund for immediate response to disasters. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) provides immediate funds for emergencies and disasters, but Stafford Act assistance may not be suitable for public health threats like bioterrorism. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority under Section 319 of the PHS Act to respond to public health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority under Section 319 of the PHS Act to respond to public health emergencies, including making grants, providing awards for expenses, and conducting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of diseases. This authority allows for waiving administrative requirements and taking actions to prepare for non-routine threats to public health. Additionally, a public health emergency fund was reauthorized in 2000 for use during emergencies determined under this authority. The 'Public Health Emergency Fund' is established in the Treasury to be used by the Secretary during public health emergencies. The Fund can be appropriated with necessary sums, and the Secretary must report on expenditures and activities related to each emergency to specific committees. The Public Health Emergency Fund is used by the Secretary during public health emergencies, with expenditures and activities reported to specific committees. Congress expanded the emergency authority, specifying the duration of emergencies and notification requirements to Congress. The Secretary of HHS may grant extensions or waivers for data submission deadlines during public health emergencies, notifying Congress and publishing in the Federal Register. During a public health emergency, the Secretary of HHS must keep relevant agencies informed. The Secretary can declare an emergency for expedited use of medical countermeasures based on various determinations. The Emergency Use Authorization provision in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act allows for waiver of certain requirements during a public health emergency to ensure sufficient healthcare items and services are available. The Secretary may modify or waive statutory or regulatory requirements to meet the needs of individuals in an emergency. During a public health emergency, certain requirements can be waived or modified, including conditions of participation in healthcare programs, federal licensure requirements for health professionals, provisions of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, physician self-referral sanctions, deadlines for required activities, limitations on payments for Medicare + Choice plan enrollees, and sanctions and penalties. During a public health emergency, the Secretary may deploy officers from the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to address urgent healthcare needs. Additionally, an alternative Medicare drug reimbursement method may be used in situations where access to drugs is limited. During a public health emergency, the Secretary can deploy officers from the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to address urgent healthcare needs. Other authorities allow for additional actions during emergencies, such as assistance to states. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority to assist states in disease control efforts during health emergencies, with the ability to provide temporary assistance for up to six months. Reimbursement to the United States may be required, and the term \"health emergencies\" is not specifically defined. This authority supports various unanticipated activities. The Secretary of HHS has broad authority to assist states in disease control efforts during health emergencies, with the ability to provide temporary assistance for up to six months. This authority underpins unanticipated activities like CDC's deployment of Epidemic Intelligence Service officers to help states during outbreaks. The National Health Security Strategy mandates the preparation of a coordinated strategy for public health emergency preparedness and response every four years. The HHS Secretary can exempt individuals from \"Select Agent\" regulations for timely participation in response to public health emergencies. The USDA Secretary can also grant exemptions for biological agents and toxins during public health emergencies. The HHS Secretary can exempt individuals from \"Select Agent\" regulations for timely participation in response to public health emergencies. The Secretary may activate the National Disaster Medical System to provide health services in response to public health emergencies. The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security, maintains a stockpile of drugs and vaccines for emergencies. The Secretary shall maintain stockpiles of drugs, vaccines, and supplies for emergency health security in the US, including vulnerable populations, in case of bioterrorist attacks or public health emergencies. The Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals (ESAR-VHP) requires linking State verification systems to create a national network for verifying credentials of volunteer healthcare professionals. The Secretary has the authority to enforce regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases during a public health emergency. This includes apprehending and examining individuals infected with a communicable disease. Additionally, there is authority for the administration of smallpox countermeasures. Authority for the administration of smallpox countermeasures allows the Secretary to issue a declaration for the use of certain countermeasures in response to bioterrorist incidents or public health emergencies. Liability protection is provided for individuals involved in the manufacture, testing, distribution, and administration of these countermeasures during a public health emergency. The Assistant Secretary for Aging in HHS may provide reimbursements to States or tribal organizations for funds used for supportive services during a major disaster. Additionally, the Secretary has the authority to expedite research in consultation with the Director of NIH and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The Secretary of HHS, in consultation with relevant agencies, can expedite review procedures for research grants during a public health emergency. The Secretary of Commerce can also take measures for fisheries management in emergencies. The Administrator of ATSDR can provide assistance for exposure to toxic substances. The Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) provides medical care and testing for individuals exposed to toxic substances during public health emergencies. The Secretary has enhanced budget authority for responding to mosquito-borne diseases in public health emergencies. Other individuals have public health emergency authorities separate from the HHS Secretary. The Attending Physician to Congress has authority over medical assets during bioterrorism events and public health emergencies in the Capitol Buildings. They can enact quarantine and declare death in coordination with other health officials. The President, through the Secretary of HHS, can implement a program for health monitoring following disasters. The Stafford Act authorizes the President to provide crisis counseling assistance and training to individuals affected by major disasters. This program is jointly administered by FEMA and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services. The Secretary of DHS has the authority to deploy the Strategic National Stockpile in response to a terrorist attack or major disaster. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can provide care to individuals affected by declared disasters or emergencies. Notification protocols are in place for potential public health emergencies. In situations involving a potential public health emergency, relevant agencies must keep the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention informed. The federal public health emergency authorities were identified through a search of the U.S. Code for specific terms. The federal public health emergency authorities include requirements for disaster planning in health care facilities and certain routine activities in the event of a disaster."
