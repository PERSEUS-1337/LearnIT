It includes findings related to hate, assault, and threats to equality. Congress finds that hate crimes pose a serious national problem, disrupting community tranquility and safety. Such violence devastates victims, their families, and communities sharing similar traits. Data from the FBI shows an increase in hate crime incidents in 2015. The Hate Crimes Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act have helped Federal authorities investigate and prosecute hate crimes.

The term \"hate crime\" refers to criminal offenses motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
