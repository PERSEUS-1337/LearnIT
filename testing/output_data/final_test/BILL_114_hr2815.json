    "content": "The Act titled \"Assuring Quality Outcomes in Higher Education Act of 2015\" requires data analysis for using income- or employment-based metrics to measure quality in higher education. During a specified period, the Secretary of Education is prohibited from implementing any final rule related to income- or employment-based metrics in regulations for college ratings, teacher preparation, or gainful employment. This restriction is in place until a complete data analysis is conducted and publicly available, along with a review by the Comptroller General for data accuracy and completeness. The data analysis required for regulations or performance frameworks must analyze the impact of income- or employment-based outcome metrics on postsecondary education programs and students at institutions participating in Title IV programs. This includes assessing the impact on students receiving Federal Pell Grants. The analysis must evaluate the impact of income- or employment-based outcome metrics on various student groups, including minority, older, veteran, independent, and dependent students. It should also consider the potential abandonment of educational pursuits and alternatives for displaced students. The analysis should assess the impact of income- or employment-based outcome metrics on different student groups, including minorities, older individuals, veterans, independent, and dependent students. It should also examine the potential abandonment of educational pursuits and alternatives for displaced students, along with the effects on economic sectors with public or government service elements. The analysis should evaluate the correlation between variables affecting income and debt-to-income outcomes, including regional differences, economic conditions at graduation, discrimination patterns, family income, and chosen credential or program of study. It should also compare income and debt data sources used in the regulation or performance framework. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of data under a regulation or performance framework, focusing on differences between data sets, data availability, quality, completeness, student privacy issues, and data collection burden. It also specifies a period of prohibition until the enactment of a law extending the Higher Education Act of 1965. Definitions include \"independent student\" as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Higher Education Act of 1965, such as \"institution of higher education,\" \"veteran,\" and \"educational alternative.\" The curr_chunk excludes certain institutions from the definition of \"institution of higher education\" as outlined in the Higher Education Act of 1965."
