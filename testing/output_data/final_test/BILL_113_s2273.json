The Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2014 allows federal agencies to enter into contracts to reduce fuel supply, delivery, or transport costs for nonbuilding applications, including secondary savings. Amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act include definitions related to improved efficiency of fuel use. The Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2014 allows federal agencies to enter into contracts to reduce fuel supply, delivery, or transport costs for nonbuilding applications, including secondary savings. Amendments to the National Energy Conservation Policy Act include definitions related to improved efficiency of fuel use in nonbuilding applications. The Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2014 allows federal agencies to enter into contracts for energy efficiency improvements, including secondary savings from additional energy or cost savings resulting from the improvements. This includes transportation, controlled environments, and federally owned equipment used for electricity generation or water transport. The Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2014 allows federal agencies to enter into contracts for energy efficiency improvements, including savings from reduced fuel delivery and personnel costs, environmental benefits, and increased electricity production efficiency. SEC. 3 of the Department of Defense Energy Security Act of 2014 authorizes research to enhance fuel efficiency or reduce fuel consumption in military vehicles used in combat. The Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the Army and Navy, may conduct research to improve military vehicle technology for increased fuel economy or reduced fuel consumption in combat. The research will build upon the successes and lessons learned from previous programs to develop technologies that enhance fuel efficiency in light tactical vehicles while maintaining survivability. The Department of Defense is required to establish a repository for operational energy-related research and development efforts. The Department of Defense must establish a centralized repository for all operational energy-related research and development efforts by December 31, 2015. This repository will be accessible through a Department of Defense website for collaboration among employees and members of the Armed Forces involved in these efforts. The Department of Defense aims to enhance collaboration between military departments on research and development efforts, share best practices, and reduce redundancy in such endeavors. The Department of Defense will establish an executive agent for warrior power to coordinate efforts in developing tactical power generation systems for military equipment by September 31, 2014. Additionally, a Secure Energy Innovation Program will be implemented. SEC. 6. SECURE ENERGY INNOVATION PROGRAM. The Secretary of Defense will establish a program to develop secure and reliable energy sources for military installations, including advanced energy metering, renewable energy, energy storage, and redundant power systems. Metrics will be developed to assess costs and benefits of secure energy projects. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO USE ENERGY SAVINGS INVESTMENT FUND FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES. Section 2919(b)(2) of title 10, United States Code, is amended by striking ``, to the extent provided for in an appropriations Act,''. Establishment of Department of Defense Alternative Fueled Vehicle Infrastructure Fund. Establishment of the Department of Defense Alternative Fuel Vehicle Infrastructure Fund in the Treasury, consisting of appropriated amounts, investment earnings, and other available funds. The Secretary can invest excess funds in government-guaranteed obligations. Funds are available for use by the Secretary through the Under Secretary of Defense. The Secretary, through the Under Secretary of Defense, is authorized to set up and maintain alternative fuel dispensing stations for Department of Defense vehicles. These stations can also be used by Department employees and Armed Forces members for private use. Definitions for \"alternative fuel\" and \"alternative fueled vehicle\" are provided in the section."
