    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Promotion Funding Integrated Research, Synthesis, and Training Act\" or the \"Health Promotion FIRST Act\". Congress finds that lifestyle factors contribute significantly to premature deaths in developed and developing nations, including the leading causes of death in the United States such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Health disparities in the US are also linked to lifestyle factors, with epidemics of diabetes and obesity exacerbated by sedentary behavior and unhealthy diets among the population. Per capita medical care costs in the United States are high, ranking 42nd in life expectancy. Lifestyle factors contribute to employer's medical care costs and national obesity costs. Tobacco-related deaths and chronic conditions are significant. Tobacco-related medical expenditures amount to $96 billion. Gaps exist in health promotion research for reaching diverse populations and creating long-term health improvements. Better synthesis and dissemination of health promotion programs can reduce these gaps. Health promotion aims to motivate lifestyle changes for complete health. Health promotion programs focus on practices like regular exercise, a nutritious diet, stress management, and avoiding harmful substances. Effective programs combine strategies to increase awareness, motivation, behavior change, and create supportive environments for healthy lifestyles. Programs can be implemented in various settings such as family, clinical, school, and workplace. People living in rural areas face unique challenges such as high-risk work environments and limited access to educational, medical, fitness, and grocery facilities. Physical disabilities can be effectively treated with exercise, but more research and efforts to disseminate information are needed. SEC. 3. HEALTH PROMOTION RESEARCH AND DISSEMINATION. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include TITLE XXXI--HEALTH PROMOTION RESEARCH AND DISSEMINATION, focusing on coordinating health promotion programs under the Department of Health and Human Services. This includes a plan for health promotion programs. The Secretary is required to develop a plan for health promotion activities within the Department of Health and Human Services, including formulating national goals, analyzing resources, and supporting necessary activities. The Secretary is mandated to develop a plan for health promotion activities within the Department of Health and Human Services, including integrating health promotion concepts into society, increasing the application of health knowledge, and supporting research programs on health information and promotion. The plan developed under subsection (a) focuses on developing basic and applied science of health promotion, including research agenda, identifying resources, promoting cooperation among agencies, and budgetary requirements. It also addresses synthesizing and disseminating health promotion research findings to scientists, professionals, and the public. The plan developed focuses on health promotion research, including ongoing monitoring, systematic reviews, practice guidelines, educational curriculum, communication to policy makers, and coordination among government agencies. The plan developed under subsection (a) includes strategies to meet health promotion needs in rural and low-income areas, support for the professional community, and integration of health promotion into all sectors of society within the Department of Health and Human Services. The plan developed under subsection (a) includes strategies to integrate health promotion into all sectors of society and modify Federal Government policies to make health promoting opportunities available to all individuals. Additionally, the Secretary will request other Federal agencies to align their strategic plans with health promotion goals. The Secretaries of Treasury, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development are tasked with developing strategic plans to enhance the health and well-being of the American people by promoting physical activity, access to nutritious foods, and reducing exposure to toxic substances. Expert advice will be sought to address the limitations of traditional approaches in motivating health behavior changes. The curr_chunk provides perspectives from individuals in various disciplines such as agriculture, anthropology, child development, city planning, commerce, economics, and more. Subtitle B--Science Programs Through National Institutes of Health: SEC. 3111. SCIENCE OF HEALTH PROMOTION. The Director of the National Institutes of Health, through the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, is required to develop a plan for advancing the science of health promotion. This plan includes a research agenda, funding recommendations, and suggestions for collaboration between NIH agencies and non-Federal entities for research implementation. The plan developed by the Director of the National Institutes of Health through the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research includes allocating resources for research on health promotion relative to other health areas, considering lifestyle factors' impact on morbidity and mortality, the progress in advancing health promotion science, and the cost of conducting research in this area compared to others. The Director of NIH, through the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, conducts early research programs on health promotion. The Secretary, via the Director of CDC, develops a research agenda for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on health promotion. The Director of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion will expand eligibility for Prevention Research Centers grants to include institutions of higher education, public and private research institutions, and departments or schools of business, city planning, and education. The Center retains the authority to specify important qualities for Centers and judge which organizations possess them. The eligibility for Prevention Research Centers grants has been expanded to include institutions of higher education, research institutions, and departments/schools in various fields such as city planning, education, nursing, psychology, public policy, transportation, social work, agriculture, nutrition, engineering, architecture, exercise science, health promotion, population health, preventive medicine, public health, and other relevant programs. The Secretary will modify the awards application process to attract the most qualified individuals and organizations for grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. Programs under this title will prioritize developing health promotion infrastructure among universities, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit organizations."
