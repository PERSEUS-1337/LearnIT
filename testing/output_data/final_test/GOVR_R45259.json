    "content": "Nearly half of the U.S. population relies on groundwater for their everyday water needs, with about 149 million people (46% of the population) using it for domestic purposes in 2015. The majority of citizens (87%) relied on public water supplies, with 107 million people using groundwater from public sources and 42 million people pumping water from private wells. The largest use of groundwater is for agriculture, mainly for irrigation. In 2015, irrigation accounted for over 69% of all fresh groundwater withdrawals in the United States, with California leading in groundwater usage for irrigation at 13.9 bgpd. Groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in 2015 made up 48% of total water withdrawn for irrigation, showing an increase compared to 2010. Groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in the United States increased by about 8% from 2010. Western states use the most groundwater for irrigation due to hydrology and surface water constraints. Federal agencies like USGS, NASA, NOAA, and USDA monitor groundwater directly and remotely to inform state and local management. Congress has authorized federal agencies to provide water from or stored at sources. Federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, along with federal land management agencies and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are involved in water rights issues. The federal government reserves water rights for specific purposes, including surface water and increasingly for groundwater. In recent years, congressional interest in groundwater has focused on aquifer storage, recharge, recovery, groundwater rights, and supply monitoring. Bills introduced in the 115th Congress address various groundwater-related topics such as aquifer storage, groundwater-surface water interaction, tribal water rights, water recycling programs, drought relief, groundwater studies, and monitoring. In the 115th Congress, bills focused on groundwater issues like aquifer storage, recovery, and supply monitoring. The federal government has historically played a larger role in surface water infrastructure compared to groundwater storage. In recent years, there has been increased public and congressional focus on groundwater storage, particularly in response to major drought events. Congressional interest has grown in assisting with state, local, and private groundwater management efforts, including using surface water to recharge aquifers and recover stored groundwater when needed. Some view aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery as complementary to existing storage methods. Some see aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery projects as alternatives to building new surface water reservoirs. Federal authorities exist to promote these efforts, with no general federal restrictions on nonfederal use of water for these purposes. Congressional guidance in this area is limited. Under the WIIN Act, Congress provided authority for Reclamation to support new groundwater storage projects. Several bills address groundwater recharge, storage, and recovery, with S. 2563 providing detailed authorities for aquifer recharge activities. Several bills aim to expand the authority of the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture to improve water storage through aquifer recharge and groundwater replenishment projects. Additionally, there are proposals to amend existing programs to promote groundwater storage and recovery, as well as authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to address groundwater recharge activities. S. 2800 and H.R. 5596 authorize grants for groundwater recharge projects. S. 2563 aims to enhance aquifer recharge activities for drought relief. S. 1012 provides financial assistance for emergency drought relief. The bill H.R. 5127 proposes financial assistance for projects addressing groundwater depletion and promoting recharge. It also increases funding for Title XVI projects from $50 million to $500 million. Other legislative proposals focus on individual groundwater storage projects and water rights for the Hualapai Tribe in Arizona. H.R. 4723 would impact the water rights of the Hualapai Tribe in Arizona, allowing them to store Colorado River water underground and transfer or lease their entitlement. The bill also addresses the tribe's ability to store Central Arizona Project water underground. Additionally, legislation like H.R. 5895 aims to use Reclamation water diversion structures to recharge the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer. Other bills seek to clarify standards for nonfederal aquifer storage projects, such as amending the California Desert Protection Act of 1994. The provision in S. 32 restricts the federal government's rights to authorize the use of groundwater in the Mojave National Preserve that exceeds safe yield. This relates to the Cadiz Project in southern California, which requires federal permitting. Safe yield refers to the amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn annually without harming the aquifer permanently. The evolution of legal frameworks for groundwater and surface water in most states was influenced by a lack of understanding of groundwater occurrence and movement in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Groundwater was considered mysterious and different from surface water, leading to the development of groundwater common law steeped in ignorance. Groundwater science has advanced, showing the interconnected nature of surface water and groundwater. However, groundwater law has not always kept pace due to the reluctance of courts to disrupt established common law principles. Any new legislation affecting groundwater resources could lead to legal chaos. Federal legislation impacting groundwater resources may disrupt state and local management regimes. Conjunctive management, which combines groundwater and surface water management, is effective for shallow aquifers. Federal reserved water rights doctrine asserts the government's right to water for reserved lands. The federal reserved water rights doctrine, established in 1908, has traditionally applied to surface waters. However, a 2017 Ninth Circuit decision expanded the doctrine to include groundwater. Congress is currently involved in Indian water rights settlements, with a focus on tribal rights to surface water and groundwater. Ongoing litigation surrounds tribal rights to groundwater, with six bills addressing groundwater rights, four of which aim to prohibit the federal government from requiring the transfer of water rights to the United States. The bills aim to prohibit the federal government from requiring the transfer of water rights to the United States, including groundwater rights. They also address the groundwater-surface water connection, preserving state water laws' recognition of subterranean streams subject to prior appropriation doctrine. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) monitors groundwater conditions in the United States, providing forecasts and assessments. They develop models and tools for aquifer characterization and offer long- and short-term forecasts for groundwater studies. The US Geological Survey (USGS) provides forecasts and assessments of changing groundwater conditions for federal, state, and local decision-makers. They collaborate with various partners and make data available from a distributed water database with over 850,000 groundwater measurement sites. Other agencies like NASA and NOAA also collect relevant data for groundwater monitoring, including observations from Earth-observing satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey collaborates with partners to provide forecasts and assessments of changing groundwater conditions. NOAA estimates drought severity and its effects on groundwater supplies. The USDA collects irrigation data, including information on wells and aquifers. Several bills include provisions for groundwater monitoring and studies, such as S. 714 authorizing feasibility analyses for water supply projects. H.R. 23 would authorize a geophysical survey to characterize aquifer systems and groundwater. H.R. 3275 would require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study on the potential impacts of Reclamation projects on groundwater resources. The legislation also mandates the determination of groundwater levels at Reclamation projects over the past 10 years and the establishment of a groundwater information program by the USGS. This program aims to advance the availability and use of groundwater data for management, education, research, assessment, and monitoring purposes. Groundwater science has evolved significantly, and this primer introduces fundamental concepts related to groundwater use, management, and recharge in aquifers. An aquifer is a permeable layer of rock or sediment that can transmit economic quantities of water to wells or springs. There are two types of aquifers: unconfined and confined. Unconfined aquifers have a freely moving water table. A confined aquifer is overlain by impermeable layers, causing water to be under pressure. Wells in confined aquifers can result in water rising above the aquifer, known as an artesian aquifer. The distinction between unconfined and confined aquifers is crucial for groundwater recharge techniques. The connection between surface water and groundwater is less direct in confined aquifers due to the presence of confining layers. The degree of connection between surface water and groundwater is not as direct for confined aquifers. Groundwater recharge can occur naturally in both confined and unconfined aquifers from various sources. Managed artificial recharge involves deliberate addition of water to aquifers through different methods. The distinction between confined and unconfined aquifers is important for understanding groundwater recharge techniques. The distinction between unconfined and confined aquifers is crucial for understanding the connection between surface water and groundwater. In a confined aquifer, changes in river flow do not directly affect groundwater, while in an unconfined aquifer, groundwater flows towards and feeds the stream. Excessive pumping can stress aquifers, causing the water table to slope away from the stream. Excessive pumping can stress aquifers, causing the water table to drop significantly. This has led to land subsidence in regions like the Ogallala aquifer and California's Central Valley, impacting surface structures. The federal government plays a significant role in managing groundwater in the United States through various agencies like USGS, NASA, NOAA, and USDA. Congress has authorized federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to make water from federal projects available for groundwater recharge and storage. The federal government, through agencies like USGS, plays a key role in managing groundwater in the United States. Federal reserved water rights doctrine applies to surface water and is now being considered for groundwater. Federal agencies collect data and provide information to support groundwater management at state and local levels, with USGS being a primary source of groundwater information. The federal government, including agencies like USGS, provides support for groundwater management by collecting data and distributing relevant information. NASA, NOAA, and USDA also play roles in groundwater-related activities. USGS funds the Groundwater and Streamflow Information Program, which includes the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN) to monitor groundwater wells nationwide. USGS administers the National Groundwater Monitoring Network funded by Congress. The USGS Groundwater Watch database contains data from over 850,000 wells collected over 100 years, valuable for tracking regional groundwater trends. USGS also conducts regional and national groundwater studies, such as assessing groundwater availability in the Central Valley aquifer in California. Earth-observing satellites like NASA's GRACE and SMAP provide data to analyze groundwater and soil moisture levels, reflecting drought conditions across the United States. This information is crucial for monitoring changes in aquifers beyond local or state boundaries. Data from the GRACE satellite shows changes in groundwater storage in large aquifers like the Central Valley and High Plains aquifers. Scientists use radar data to track water table movements, such as in the Santa Clara Valley, where aquifers recovered after conservation measures were implemented. Measures to limit groundwater pumping were implemented using radar data from Italian satellites. NASA plans a joint mission with the Indian Space Research Organisation in 2021 to collect radar imagery of major aquifers worldwide. NOAA coordinates drought research and forecasting, creating drought maps and indicators, including impacts on groundwater resources. NOAA's weather satellites monitor drought effects on hydrology, including groundwater resources. NOAA's weather satellites provide real-time data for understanding the hydrologic cycle and forecasting precipitation, which can inform groundwater models. Satellite data also contribute to climate forecasts and models to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater supplies. The Census of Agriculture includes questions on irrigation and water use, conducted every five years. The Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS) is a detailed national assessment of irrigated agriculture in the United States conducted every five years by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in USDA. Interest in recharging groundwater artificially with surface water is growing at local, state, and federal levels due to various reasons such as drought, regulatory constraints, and increased demand for water supplies. Groundwater recharge is used to replenish aquifers and prevent saltwater intrusion along coastlines. It is part of a conjunctive water management strategy that involves injecting water into wells or allowing it to recharge from impoundments or spreading basins. This helps create a freshwater barrier and meet increasing demand for water supplies. Groundwater recharge involves storing water in aquifers through basins or wells for later extraction. Over 1,000 recharge wells and storage facilities have been built nationwide. Federal water projects like those managed by Reclamation and USACE are potential water sources for recharge activities. The Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency, operates numerous dams and water infrastructure. The Bureau of Reclamation, a federal agency under the Department of the Interior, owns and operates dams and water projects in 17 western states. Created in 1902 by Congress, Reclamation provides water supply, flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. It has authority to deliver project and excess water for groundwater recharge without federal restrictions. The Bureau of Reclamation, under the Department of the Interior, can deliver project and excess water for groundwater recharge without special approvals. However, more specific authorities for groundwater use may be beneficial. State restrictions can impact the use of water for groundwater activities. Reclamation does not closely monitor the use of water for groundwater recharge, but it is allowed under the Reclamation Project Act of 1939. Section 215 of the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 allows Reclamation to enter temporary water service contracts for un-storable or excess flood flows, with no restrictions on using the water for groundwater recharge. Various acts authorize Reclamation to participate in state water banks, bank CVP water, and provide financial assistance for groundwater projects through the WaterSMART program. Reclamation is authorized to participate in state-led storage projects, including groundwater storage facilities, under the WIIN Act. The Act also allows Reclamation to provide financial support for desalination projects involving brackish groundwater. Additionally, Reclamation's Title XVI program enables the implementation of water recycling and reuse projects, including those involving impaired groundwater. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for military and civil works, is directed by Congress through authorizations and appropriations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is directed by Congress to oversee civil works activities, including water resource projects for navigation, flood control, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. While projects may have additional benefits like water supply and recreation, these are secondary to the primary purposes. Groundwater recharge may be supported by USACE projects, but it is not the main focus. USACE projects primarily focus on navigation, flood control, and aquatic ecosystem restoration, with secondary benefits like water supply and recreation. Groundwater recharge may be indirectly supported by USACE activities, but nonfederal entities are responsible for securing water rights for water supply purposes, including groundwater recharge. USACE provides storage at reservoirs for nonconsumptive water uses, and does not deliver water under contract like Reclamation. USACE provides storage at its reservoirs as a nonconsumptive service, supporting groundwater recharge. USACE projects can be operated to benefit water conservation and supply storage, with some flexibility. Before the WIIN Act in 2016, USACE lacked general authority for seasonal operations benefiting municipal and industrial water supply. However, projects with specific authorization for water conservation could support groundwater replenishment. The WIIN Act of 2016 authorized the Secretary of the Army to evaluate water supply conservation measures during drought emergencies, including groundwater replenishment and aquifer storage. USACE has general authorities for M&I water supply, such as surplus water authority and water supply authority for storage reallocations. The WIIN Act of 2016 authorized the Secretary of the Army to prioritize updating water control manuals for control structures in the state, incorporating seasonal operations for water conservation and supply. The Secretary may review proposals to increase water supplies at federal projects by modifying project management or accessing released water for groundwater recharge. The USDA supports groundwater research, conservation, and education for agriculture, providing financial and technical assistance to producers for on-farm water conservation. Various USDA agencies offer education, outreach, and research, along with federal assistance for adopting irrigation best practices. For more information on irrigation in the United States, refer to CRS Report R44158. Financial assistance for irrigation conservation practice adoption is primarily authorized through omnibus farm bills, such as the 2014 Agricultural Act. Programs provide cost-share assistance to private farm and ranch land owners for water conserving practices. Technical assistance, including planning and design of on-farm water conservation measures, is administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. USDA conducts research on irrigation technologies and plant water use efficiency. The federal government primarily conducts research on groundwater-related areas such as irrigation technologies and plant water use efficiency. States typically allocate water resources, except on federal reservations where water rights are regulated under the Winters doctrine. The Supreme Court recognized Indian reserved water rights in non-Indian contexts in 1976, stating that the federal government reserves water for federal purposes when withdrawing land from the public domain. While the Winters doctrine has been applied to federal reserved water rights, tribal rights to groundwater are less established compared to surface water rights. An ongoing legal case involving a Southern California Indian tribe's groundwater rights may clarify this issue. Changes in climate, such as rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns, could impact groundwater availability in the future. Natural recharge is a key factor influencing groundwater supply, with irrigation return flow playing a significant role in aquifers like the Central Valley aquifer in California. Changes in irrigation practices and technology could significantly alter irrigation return flow in the Central Valley, impacting groundwater supply. Policies enabling greater artificial recharge may also affect groundwater availability. Data from various agencies will likely improve understanding of long-term trends in groundwater storage and use. The USDA aims to enhance understanding of long-term groundwater trends and their relationship to climate change. Studies have shown the complexities of forecasting climate change impacts on groundwater, particularly in the western United States. Studies in 2016 and 2017 focused on major aquifers in the region. The study focused on groundwater in the western United States, highlighting potential changes in water availability. It suggests a \"wet gets wetter, dry gets drier\" scenario, with the arid southwest becoming drier and the northern region getting wetter. However, higher temperatures could offset some gains due to increased evaporation. The study highlights potential changes in water availability in the western United States due to climate change. Mountain systems may provide less water due to lower precipitation and a shift from snow to rain. Uncertainty exists in predicting changes to groundwater recharge. Figure 10 shows possible broad changes under a greenhouse gas-induced global warming scenario. The study by Smerdon (2017) summarizes six review articles on groundwater and climate change, highlighting uncertainties in predicting future recharge due to variability in precipitation trends from climate change models. Vegetation plays a crucial role in the recharge process, accommodating changes in precipitation. The study by Smerdon (2017) highlights uncertainties in predicting future groundwater recharge due to variability in precipitation trends from climate change models. Vegetation's role in the recharge process is crucial, as changes in precipitation could affect evapotranspiration. Groundwater recharge is not directly modeled in GCMs, making it challenging to forecast future groundwater supplies. Improved long-term groundwater observations are needed to understand the relationship between climate change and groundwater recharge. The direction and magnitude of change in groundwater recharge due to climate change are uncertain, with some models suggesting a decrease while others suggest the opposite. Mountainous regions are expected to be most sensitive to climate changes. Factors like changing land use, urbanization, and irrigation practices will also impact groundwater recharge and supply. Increasing aridity may lead to a decrease in surface water supplies, potentially increasing reliance on groundwater. Groundwater resources in the United States may be affected by climate change, with potential shifts in demand depending on regional conditions. More efficient irrigation practices could reduce overall water demand, lessening stress on groundwater. Congress typically leaves groundwater management to the states, with bills in the 115th Congress emphasizing state water laws over federal involvement. Several bills in the 115th Congress address groundwater management, emphasizing state water laws over federal involvement. These bills prohibit the federal government from requiring the transfer of water rights to the United States and address the effects of drought by authorizing activities to artificially recharge aquifers. Severe droughts in California, the Midwest, and Texas have led to increased congressional focus on groundwater depletion. Legislation in the 115th Congress aims to support water supply augmentation through aquifer recharge and storage. Proposed bills like S. 2563 seek to enhance federal authorities for groundwater enhancement. The Central Arizona Project and California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act aim to enhance groundwater resources through federal water projects. Other western states with Reclamation water infrastructure may also benefit from aquifer recharge. Technological advancements in desalination could further expand domestic water supplies. The USGS assessment report in 2017 found that deeper wells contain more brackish groundwater than shallower wells, with 70% of wells between 1,500 and 3,000 feet deep being brackish. Many water providers are turning to brackish groundwater for various uses like drinking water, power generation, and irrigation. Further evaluations of specific aquifers are needed for greater use of this resource. Further technological and economic analyses are required to determine the potential for using brackish groundwater from deeper wells on a larger scale in the future."
