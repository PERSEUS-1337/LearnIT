    "content": "The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the main source of flood insurance for residential properties in the US, covering over five million policies in 22,000 communities. It generates $4.6 billion in annual revenue and provides $1.3 trillion in coverage. Established in 1968, the NFIP aims to offer primary flood insurance, reduce flood risk through floodplain management, and decrease federal spending on disaster assistance. FEMA is planning Risk Rating 2.0 to change how flood insurance premiums are calculated. The NFIP is implementing the biggest change in flood insurance premium calculations since its inception, with new rates effective from October 1, 2021. Premiums are based on average annual loss, risk, and expenses to cover expected losses. The methodologies for estimating these components have evolved over the years. Risk Rating 2.0 will introduce changes to how risks are rated and premiums are set. The NFIP follows general insurance practices established in the 1970s, using flood zone, occupancy type, and elevation relative to Base Flood Elevation to classify properties. Premiums include expenses for servicing policies. FEMA uses a nationwide rating system that groups structures with similar flood risk and assigns the same rate to all policies in a group. FEMA's NFIP rates properties based on similar flood risk factors, regardless of location differences. Risk is modeled for coastal storm surge and river flooding. Flood risk is expressed in terms of expected economic loss and probability. Flood hazard info comes from NFIP studies, structure vulnerability, and flood protection performance. The insurance rate for properties under NFIP is determined by assessing the vulnerability of the structure, flood protection measures, and average annual loss. Inland areas focus on river watershed, topography, and hydraulic characteristics, while coastal areas consider storm surge and wave action. Models of physical processes and weather events are used to predict flood depths and velocities, summarized in reports and portrayed on FIRMs. The Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) on FIRMs shows flood zones, including A zones and V zones subject to wave action. Properties in SFHA require flood insurance for federally backed mortgages. Premiums are calculated based on flood zone, building details, occupancy type, and elevation. Flood insurance rates in the NFIP are determined based on property details like primary residence status, prior claims, and elevation relative to the BFE. Coverage amount, deductible, and true flood risk also impact premiums. FEMA calculates full-risk rates using flood probability, damage estimates, and actuarial principles. Congress directs FEMA to offer subsidies for certain properties to make flood insurance affordable. Properties eligible for reduced flood insurance rates include those built or improved before FEMA's first flood insurance rate map, properties newly mapped into a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) after April 1, 2015, and properties with prior flood insurance coverage that complied with a previous rate map. Pre-FIRM structures, built before December 31, 1974, may also qualify for lower premiums. The pre-FIRM subsidy allows older floodplain properties to contribute to their recovery from flood disasters. Approximately 13% of NFIP policies receive this subsidy. The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 established a new subsidy for properties newly mapped into a SFHA after April 1, 2015. The FEMA allows owners of properties built in compliance with the FIRM to maintain their old flood insurance rate class if remapped. Newly mapped properties receive a subsidy for the first year, transitioning to a full-risk rate with annual increases of 15%. About 4% of NFIP policies receive this subsidy as of September 2018. Grandfathering in flood insurance allows property owners to maintain their old rate class if their property is remapped into a new flood zone or BFE. This can be due to a change in flood zone or BFE. Zone grandfathering is common, where property owners can pay premiums based on the prior mapped zone if they have continuous NFIP coverage. Elevation grandfathering occurs when the BFE increases but the property remains in the same flood zone. Under the revised FIRM, properties previously mapped four feet above BFE now only one foot above BFE can still pay the premium for being four feet above. Grandfathering in flood insurance allows policyholders to maintain their old rate class, with about 9% of NFIP policies being grandfathered as of September 2018. The discount provided to grandfathered policyholders is cross-subsidized by others in the same rate class. Additionally, NFIP policyholders pay various fees and surcharges, including the Federal Policy Fee (FPF) authorized by Congress in 1990. The Federal Policy Fee (FPF) was authorized by Congress in 1990 to help pay for administrative expenses of the NFIP program. The amount of the FPF is set by FEMA and can vary yearly. Since October 2017, the FPF has been $50 for Standard Flood Insurance Policies (SFIPs), $25 for Preferred Risk Policies (PRPs), and $25 for contents-only policies. A reserve fund assessment, established by the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, charges every NFIP policy 15% of the premium to cover future claim and debt expenses. Additionally, all NFIP policies are assessed a surcharge following the passage of HFIAA, with the amount dependent on the type of property insured. The HFIAA surcharge amount varies based on the type of property insured. Primary residences are charged $25, while all other properties are charged $250. Most policyholders are required to purchase Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) coverage, which provides up to $30,000 for eligible expenses related to building code standards. FEMA also charges a Severe Repetitive Loss premium of 5% on certain properties. ICC coverage is capped at $75 and not required for condominium units or content-only policies. NFIP policyholders in communities on probation will be charged a $50 surcharge for a year, regardless of compliance. Risk Rating 2.0 will calculate premiums based on individual flood risk, using a wider range of variables than the current system. It will consider various flood sources like pluvial flooding and coastal erosion. Risk Rating 2.0 will use a multi-model approach to develop new rates, incorporating data from NFIP map data, policy and claims data, USGS 3-D elevation data, NOAA SLOSH storm surge data, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data sets. It will also utilize three commercial catastrophe models to estimate future loss potential for events like hurricane wind, storm surge, inland flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes, and wildfires. Catastrophe models are a standard risk management practice in the insurance industry. The shortcomings of using historical data to project losses from severe events impacting properties, not geographically diverse. Catastrophe models simulate event probabilities, intensity, damage, and loss allocation. Stochastic event sets are generated to model future scenarios based on historical data and realistic parameters. Catastrophe models quantify the severity of events in a geographical area, generating event footprints to represent hazard intensity. Property vulnerability is assessed using mean damage ratios, while a financial module calculates the financial consequences of each event. Policy terms like deductibles and reinsurance are applied to insured property damage for allocation. FEMA uses Risk Rating 2.0 modeling to analyze flood risk by assigning probabilities of flood impact to structures and comparing results with commercial catastrophe models. The analysis includes geographical variables like distance to water, elevation, and stream order to generate average annual loss values for specific areas. The FEMA Risk Rating 2.0 identifies structural variables for flood risk assessment, including foundation type, floor height relative to BFE, and replacement cost. NFIP rates are based on insurance purchased, with higher rates for coverage below basic limits and lower rates for additional coverage. Rates are weighted to reflect average tendency to underinsure compared to replacement value. The NFIP uses a two-tiered rating structure to ensure premiums cover typical claims and encourage full insurance coverage. This structure charges a high rate for coverage up to $60,000 and a low additional rate for coverage over $60,000. The NFIP's two-tiered rating structure operated with minimal inequity, but as replacement values widened, inequity grew due to rating based on coverage instead of structure value. Structures closer to the $60,000 limit pay more, while those above $250,000 pay less. High-valued structures can result in much higher claims than lower-valued structures with the same damage intensity. Using replacement cost value in setting NFIP premium rates could address these issues. Risk Rating 2.0 aims to adjust NFIP premium rates based on replacement costs of structures, with higher costs paying more and lower costs paying less. Credits for mitigation actions include installing flood openings, elevating structures, and elevating machinery. FEMA has not specified how these credits will affect individual property premiums. Flood zones will no longer be used in calculating flood insurance premiums. Following the introduction of Risk Rating 2.0, flood zones will no longer be used to calculate flood insurance premiums. Premiums will now be based on individual property features. Flood zones will still be required for floodplain management purposes, such as construction requirements in Zone V. The FIRM map appeal process will remain, but appeals will not affect premiums under Risk Rating 2.0. FEMA has not provided details on how grandfathered properties will be affected, but all properties will transition to actuarial rates. The implication of Risk Rating 2.0 is that flood zones will no longer be used to set premiums, with FEMA having statutory authority to set premium rates. Annual premium increases are limited by statute, with maximum rate increases for primary residences set at 5-18% per year. Individual property increases are capped at 18%, while rate class increases are limited to 15% per year. Other property categories must have their premiums increased by 25% per year until reaching full risk-based rates. FEMA requires certain property categories to have their premiums increased by 25% per year until they reach full risk-based rates. Premium rates are calculated based on building and contents coverage, Increased Cost of Compliance coverage, and reserve fund assessment, excluding other fees and surcharges. The effects of a maximum statutory increase on the national average premium for a Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) are shown in Table 1. The total premium for an SFIP with Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) coverage would be $880, with an 18% increase leading to a new premium of $1038.40 for a primary residence. For a non-primary residence, the premium would increase to $1100 after a 25% increase. Additional fees and surcharges would apply, such as the Federal Policy Fee (FPF) and HFIAA surcharge. The new rating system for flood insurance will tie premiums to actual flood risk rather than flood zone, with subsidies phased out based on the date the structure was built relative to the FIRM adoption date. Premiums for non-primary residences will increase to $1100 after a 25% increase, with additional fees totaling $1400 to the NFIP. The rate changes will not be uniform within each category, but the phasing out of subsidies will continue to be constrained by law. The new flood insurance rating system will phase out subsidies based on the structure's build date relative to the FIRM adoption date. Premiums for non-primary residences will increase to $1100 with additional fees totaling $1400. The Risk Rating 2.0 aims to reduce cross-subsidies between NFIP policyholders and eventually eliminate premium subsidies. NFIP's non-insurance activities are funded by cross-subsidies, such as the Community Rating System offering discounts on flood insurance premiums for participating communities. The Community Rating System (CRS) program provides an average 11.4% discount on SFIP premiums across the NFIP, which is cross-subsidized into the program. This discount is shared across all NFIP communities through a 13.4% increase in overall premiums. Risk Rating 2.0's impact on CRS cross-subsidy and funding for floodplain management is uncertain. Additionally, 42% of flood mapping and management funding comes from NFIP policyholders through the Flood Protection Fund (FPF), with 66% allocated to flood mapping and 19% to floodplain management. Risk Rating 2.0's impact on funding for floodplain management and flood risk mapping is uncertain. FEMA believes it will improve flood insurance pricing transparency and communication. The new rating system is not meant to increase or decrease NFIP revenue and will be adjusted if there is a shortfall. FEMA is conducting an actuarial analysis to determine how many properties will see premium changes under Risk Rating 2.0, with certain property types more likely to be affected. Under Risk Rating 2.0, all types of properties may face higher premium increases than before. For instance, premiums for pre-FIRM properties rose by 7.3%, newly mapped properties by 15%, post-FIRM V zone properties by 6%, post-FIRM A zones by 4%, and X zone properties by 1%. The use of distance to water, rather than flood zone, could lead to varying premium changes for properties at different boundaries of flood zones. Under Risk Rating 2.0, premiums for various types of properties may increase, with pre-FIRM properties seeing a 7.3% rise, newly mapped properties facing a 15% increase, post-FIRM V zone properties increasing by 6%, post-FIRM A zones by 4%, and X zone properties by 1%. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of insurance for some policyholders under Risk Rating 2.0, similar to the issues raised with the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. FEMA lacks authority for an affordability program due to insufficient funding from current rate structure. Affordability provisions are included in bills for NFIP reauthorization in Congress. The central question is who should bear floodplain occupancy costs and how to address concerns over rising insurance premiums."
