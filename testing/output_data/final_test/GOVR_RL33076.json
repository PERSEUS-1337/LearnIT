    "content": "The Appalachian Regional Commission, established in 1965, is the oldest of the four regional commissions chartered by Congress to address economic distress in multi-state regions. Governors of nine states formed the Council of Appalachian Governors in 1960 to advocate for federal involvement. President Kennedy appointed Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. as chairman of the President's Appalachian Regional Commission in 1963 to develop a comprehensive development program for the region. The resulting report expanded the region to include selected counties in Ohio. The Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 expanded the region to include selected counties in Ohio. It addressed issues like low income, high employment, and poor infrastructure, with a focus on regional infrastructure, water management, natural resources, and human resources development. President Johnson signed the act into law, creating the Appalachian Regional Development Commission to assist the region in addressing its special problems. The 1965 Appalachian Regional Development Act authorized new programs to address the region's pressing issues, including the Appalachian Development Highway System, a health facilities demonstration program, and land conservation agreements with private landowners. The 1965 Appalachian Regional Development Act authorized programs for land conservation, timber management, mining restoration, water resource control, and sewage treatment grants. It prioritized projects based on growth potential, per capita income, and long-term employment outlook. The 1967 Amendments expanded the program to include counties in New York and Mississippi. The ARC Act was amended in 1975 to require the governor of each member state to serve as a member of the ARC, with decisions requiring a quorum of state members present. The amendments also directed the ARC to publish regulations for public participation, required states to consult with local development districts and units of government, and authorized federal grants to strengthen state development planning. The ARC Act was amended in 1975 to strengthen state development planning for the region, including coordination with the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. Funds could not be used for reclaiming strip-mined areas unless for public use. The Department of Housing and Urban Development could provide grants and loans for housing and community development. The 1975 amendments to the ARC Act authorized grants and loans for housing construction and rehabilitation projects for low- and moderate-income families. It also allowed grants for education projects focusing on vocational and technical education. States were required to submit development plans reflecting regional goals and priorities. The ARC was tasked with studying Appalachian migrants and migration patterns. The Appalachian Regional Development Reform Act of 1998 directed the ARC to designate distressed, competitive, and attainment counties based on economic status. Annual reviews were required for county designations, with special consideration given to distressed counties. The ARC's contribution was limited to 30% of project costs for projects in competitive counties. The 1998 amendments to the Appalachian Regional Development Reform Act limited the ARC's contribution to 30% of project costs for projects in competitive counties. Administrative and programmatic changes included requiring the ARC to meet annually, allowing electronic meetings, obtaining a quorum of state members for certain decisions, extending authorization of appropriations for administrative expenses, and reducing the federal share of program costs. The 2002 amendments to the Appalachian Regional Development Act reduced the federal share of program costs for research and development projects and repealed various programs and provisions under the act. The amendments also called for the ARC to support local development districts, promote eco-industrial development technologies, and coordinate economic development activities. The 2002 amendments to the Appalachian Regional Development Act reduced federal share of program costs for projects and repealed various programs. It allowed ARC to cover up to 75% of administrative expenses for local development districts in distressed counties and directed the establishment of the Interagency Coordinating Council on Appalachia. The amendments also authorized ARC to undertake new initiatives in telecommunications, technology, entrepreneurship, and regional skills partnership. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is directed to provide technical assistance, grants, and contracts for projects related to advanced telecommunications, electronic commerce, and support for homegrown businesses. The 2002 amendments expanded ARC's support for entrepreneurial training, access to capital, development strategies, and business incubators. The 2002 amendments authorized the Appalachian Regional Commission to establish regional skill partnerships and business incubators, providing technical assistance and grants to improve job skills in specified industries. Grant assistance is limited to 50% of eligible activities, with a potential increase to 80% for distressed communities. Additionally, no more than 10% of regional skill partnership grants can be used for administrative activities. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) added four new counties and outlined the roles of federal and state members. The ARC is responsible for developing plans, establishing priorities, and coordinating programs for the region. Compensation for members varies, with federal co-chair paid by the government and state members compensated by their respective states. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is responsible for developing plans, establishing priorities, conducting research, reviewing programs, recommending modifications, encouraging cooperation, advising on grant applications, promoting private investment, and providing a forum for problem resolution in the region. The federal government covers 100% of the ARC's administrative expenses. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has the power to amend bylaws, appoint employees, request personnel details, enter contracts with states, accept gifts, maintain an office in DC, and request information for its mission execution. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has the authority to hold hearings, request information from agencies, and provide assistance to counties based on their economic status. Distressed Counties have high poverty and unemployment rates, while At-Risk Counties have slightly lower rates but still qualify for support. In 2006, ARC formally implemented these criteria for assistance. In 2006, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) designated communities as at-risk for the first time, a category not mentioned in the statute authorizing the ARC. Transitional Counties do not meet distressed or at-risk thresholds but have worse economic indicators than the national average. Competitive Counties have poverty and unemployment rates equal to or less than national averages, with per capita incomes between 80% and 100% of the national average. Attainment Counties have economic indicators above the national average. In 2006, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) designated communities as at-risk for the first time. There are 410 counties within the 13 member states of the ARC, divided into 72 Local Development Districts (LDDs) to identify development needs. 77 counties meet the requirements for distressed county designation in FY2006, with federal funding remaining at $65 million annually for the past two years. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) receives funding from state, federal, and private sources to support its strategic goals. Federal agencies that partner with ARC include the Economic Development Administration, Rural Development Administration, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Education. Funds are allocated for non-highway program activities and the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). Funding for ADHS was authorized through the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), with an annual appropriation of $450 million from FY1999 to FY2003. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) receives funding from various sources to support its strategic goals, including the construction of the Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). The ARC and its 13 governors have programmatic control over ADHS funding, allowing each state governor to determine its use. Funds are apportioned based on each state's share of completing the ADHS, with grants awarded for projects in five goal areas outlined in the ARC strategic plan. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) receives funding to support its strategic goals, including developing local economies and improving access to healthcare. ARC funds are allocated based on a formula agreed upon by member states. The statute requires 50% of funds to target distressed communities and limits funds in attainment areas. The Administration's budget for FY2007 requests $65 million for ARC activities, while the House recommended $35.5 million. The House recommended $35.5 million for ARC activities, $30 million below the Administration's request and FY2006 appropriations. The Senate approved $65.5 million for ARC activities, with a $30 million reduction noted due to budget constraints. ARC must allocate at least 50% of funds to distressed counties and cannot award funds to attainment counties. Many ARC counties do not meet the distressed county criteria. The ARC defines at-risk counties as those with poverty and unemployment rates at least 125% of the national averages and per capita income no more than 67% of the national average. 81 counties meet the requirements to be designated at-risk. This designation was formalized in 2006, marking the first year communities were designated as at-risk by the ARC. These counties face serious challenges and should receive preferential treatment to avoid distress designation. Senator George Voinovich introduced the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of 2006, S. 2832, to create a new category of eligible county - at-risk counties. This bill aims to increase the federal match requirement from 50% to no more than 70% for projects in at-risk counties across various ARC program areas. 81 counties meet the criteria for designation as at-risk, with West Virginia, Alabama, and Kentucky having the highest number. President Reagan signed the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Act into law on October 1, 1988, authorizing the creation of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission (LMDDC) with a $2 million appropriation. The Commission's mandate was to identify economic needs and priorities in the region and develop a 10-year economic development plan. The administrative structure included two presidential appointees and seven appointed by governors of seven states. The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Act defined the region as areas near the Mississippi River in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee with common economic ties and challenges. Specific communities meeting the criteria were included, with the Commission able to add adjoining counties as needed. The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission (LMDDC) was chaired by then-Arkansas Governor William J. Clinton and operated until September 30, 1990. Its final report included around 400 recommendations to improve the economic conditions of the region, leading to increased federal involvement during the Clinton Administration. Several cabinet departments conducted studies and initiatives to address issues and opportunities in the region. President Clinton signed the Lower Mississippi Delta Region Heritage Study Act in 1994, following recommendations from the LMDDC. The Act directed a study of significant natural, historical, and cultural sites in the Delta region. In 1996, the Department of Transportation published a report on transportation recommendations, noting their implementation between 1990 and 1995. The Commission's transportation recommendations were implemented, leading to improved access to intermodal terminals in the Delta region. In 1998, federal agencies signed an MOU for economic revitalization initiatives, and in 1999, a progress report was published. In 2000, improvements in housing and infrastructure conditions were highlighted in a joint publication by the Department of Agriculture and the Housing Assistance Council. The Assistance Council published a report on improving housing and infrastructure in the Lower Mississippi Delta. Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001, amending the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Act to include Alabama and creating the Delta Regional Authority. The Delta Development Act of 1988, as amended by the Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000, established the DRA to promote economic development in the region. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 further amended the voting procedures for DRA member states and provided federal grants for Delta projects. The DRA's administrative structure is similar to the ARC, with federal and state co-chairs overseeing its duties and responsibilities. Administrative expenses are shared between federal and state entities. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) was established to promote economic development in the region, with administrative expenses split between the federal government and member states. The DRA has the authority to enter contracts, establish compensation for personnel, and request temporary details from other agencies. Table 6 lists the counties and parishes in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region, with some communities included by statute but not meeting distressed designation requirements. Counties and parishes in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region designated as distressed are eligible for DRA assistance. Some communities not identified in statute as designated Mississippi Delta counties were also designated as distressed by the DRA under specific criteria. The DRA is directed to establish criteria for distressed county or parish designation under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Counties and parishes in the Lower Mississippi Delta Region must be severely distressed and underdeveloped with high rates of poverty or unemployment to qualify for assistance from the DRA. Isolated areas of distress in non-distressed counties may also qualify if they meet specific criteria. The DRA uses the EDA's definition of a \"distressed county\" to determine eligibility for funding, which includes criteria such as having an unemployment rate at least one percent higher than the national average. The Lower Mississippi Delta Region counties and parishes must be severely distressed with high poverty or unemployment rates to qualify for assistance from the DRA. Specific criteria include having an unemployment rate at least one percent higher than the national average, per capita income 80% or less of the national average, and special needs arising from severe economic conditions like outmigration, underemployment, military base closures, natural disasters, or foreign trade impacts. The Delta Regional Authority (DRA) identifies distressed counties based on criteria like high poverty or unemployment rates. The region served by the DRA is one of the most distressed in the country, with the majority of counties having incomes below the national poverty level. Funding for the DRA has decreased significantly over the years, from $20 million in FY2001 to $6 million in FY2005. Funding for the Delta Regional Authority (DRA) has decreased from $20 million in FY2001 to $6 million in FY2005. In FY2006, Congress doubled the Administration's request, allocating $12 million for DRA activities to support Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. President Clinton signed the Northern Great Plains Rural Development Act in 1994, establishing the NGPRDC to improve economic development in rural Northern Great Plains communities. The Northern Great Plains Rural Development Act of 1994 established a 10-member Commission to develop a 10-year economic development plan for the region, addressing various needs and priorities with collaboration from different entities. The Northern Great Plains Rural Development Act of 1994 empowered the NGPRDC to hire experts, submit reports to key government officials, and make recommendations in areas like regional collaboration, business development, and education. The NGPRDC was required to complete its work by September 30, 1997. The NGPRDC completed its work in 1997, with findings and recommendations included in the Final Report of the Northern Great Plains Rural Development Commission. The Commission identified six themes and recommended 75 actions for regional concerns. The Northern Great Plains Initiative for Rural Development was established in September 1997 to continue the work, governed by a Board of Directors and a management team from each of the five states in the region. President George W. Bush signed the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act into law on May 13, 2002. President George W. Bush signed the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 into law, which created the Northern Great Plains Regional Authority (NGPRA) with a $30 million appropriation for fiscal years 2002-2007. The NGPRA is a federal-state partnership tasked with implementing recommendations for the five-state region and developing multi-year plans. The Northern Great Plains Regional Authority (NGPRA) was created under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 with a $30 million appropriation for fiscal years 2002-2007. It includes a state co-chair from Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa, as well as a representative of Native American tribes. The federal government funded administrative costs at 100% in FY2002, 75% in FY2003, and 50% in FY2004. A non-profit entity, Northern Great Plains, Inc., was designated to assist in implementing recommendations and supporting research, education, and training in the region. The NGPRA, like the ARC and DRA, utilizes EDA-designated economic development districts to coordinate efforts at the local level. Certified local development districts can receive grants to cover administrative costs and serve as liaisons between various entities. They assist in developing regional economic strategies, providing technical assistance, and supporting leadership programs. The NGPRA is directed to establish distress criteria standards based on unemployment and population. The NGPRA was directed to develop distress criteria standards using unemployment, population outmigration, and poverty data. 75% of funds must go to the most distressed counties in each state, with 50% reserved for transportation, telecommunications, and basic infrastructure improvements. The Denali Commission, created in 1998, focuses on providing job training and economic development assistance to distressed rural areas in Alaska. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, is responsible for rural power generation, communication systems, water and sewer infrastructure, and other needs in remote areas of Alaska. The seven-member Commission includes representatives from various organizations and appointees from federal and state authorities. The federal co-chair is nominated by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate. The Commission develops an annual work plan for the state. The Denali Commission, established in 1998, develops an annual work plan for the state, including infrastructure development and job training funding priorities. The work plan is subject to public input and comment, with the federal co-chair having the authority to approve, disapprove, or partially approve it. The Denali Commission develops an annual work plan for infrastructure development and job training funding priorities, subject to public input. The Commission promotes rural development, including infrastructure improvements in power generation, telecommunications, and water facilities. It defines a \"rural area\" as lacking public infrastructure or being remote with additional costs for import/export, travel, and communication. The Denali Commission identifies distressed rural communities based on criteria such as low per capita income, high poverty rates, and elevated unemployment rates. Job training and economic development services are provided to residents in these areas with significant economic challenges. The Denali Commission identifies distressed rural communities based on criteria such as low per capita income, high poverty rates, and elevated unemployment rates. In May 2005, the Commission introduced an alternative method called the \"surrogate standard\" to identify distressed communities using annual data from the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. To qualify under this standard, a community must have an average market income not exceeding $14,872, at least 70% of residents earning no more than $14,872 in 2003, and fewer than 30% of residents employed during all quarters. In 2005, the Denali Commission introduced the \"surrogate standard\" to identify distressed communities based on income and employment criteria. A community must meet two of three criteria to be classified as distressed: average market income below $15,318, at least 67% of residents earning less than $15,318, and fewer than 33% employed during all quarters. Distressed counties are listed in Table 10, and communities can appeal their non-distress designation by meeting the surrogate standard criteria. The Denali Commission introduced the \"surrogate standard\" in 2005 to identify distressed communities based on income and employment criteria. To appeal a non-distress designation, a community must meet two of three criteria: average market income below $15,318, at least 67% of residents earning less than $15,318, and fewer than 33% employed during all quarters. The only single-state federal regional development authority has seen an increase in annual allocation from 2001 to 2005, comparable to the ARC, but received $49.5 million for FY2006. The Denali Commission received $49.5 million for FY2006, $17 million less than FY2005. For FY2007, the Administration requested $2.5 million, the House approved $7.5 million, and the Senate recommended $50 million."
