This tragedy highlighted issues in the global supply chain and raised concerns about improving working conditions for lower-wage workers in developing countries. Workers were forced to continue working despite noticing cracks in the building, which ultimately led to its collapse. This incident, labeled as the deadliest in the garment industry, occurred shortly after a fire at another Bangladesh apparel factory. After the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in April 2013, which killed over 1,100 workers, another fire at Tazreen Fashions Limited resulted in 112 deaths. Survivors mentioned locked exit routes and false fire alarms delaying evacuation. The total death toll in the garment sector reached 1,200 in six months. Following the tragedies, workers protested, leading to the closure of several apparel factories due to safety concerns. Bangladesh's main export, apparel, accounted for over 80% of the country's exports in 2012. Following the tragedies at Rana Plaza and Tazreen Fashions Limited in Bangladesh in 2013, concerns over safety in the apparel sector arose. The collapse of Rana Plaza led to the death of over 1,100 workers, prompting some companies like Disney to consider sourcing production elsewhere. This shift could impact the 80% of female workers in the sector, many of whom are primary breadwinners for their families. The economic structure of Bangladesh, already labor-intensive and reliant on apparel exports, faces challenges amidst a struggle between secular and Islamic identities. Bangladesh's densely populated country attracts lower-wage and lower-skilled industries like apparel. The Rana Plaza tragedy highlighted illegal construction and poor working conditions in the apparel sector. Various regulations and commitments aim to address labor issues in Bangladesh. Since 1972, Bangladesh has been a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO), which promotes \"decent work\" globally. Under the 1998 ILO Declaration, Bangladesh is obligated to uphold core labor principles, having ratified seven of the eight ILO conventions. These principles align with internationally recognized worker rights, including freedom of association, collective bargaining, and the elimination of forced labor. The International Labor Organization (ILO) promotes decent work globally and requires countries to uphold core labor principles, including the elimination of forced labor, child labor, and discrimination in employment. The ILO lacks enforcement powers but provides technical assistance and support programs like the Better Work Program in Bangladesh. Many U.S. trade and investment laws align with ILO principles. The U.S. trade and investment laws, including the Generalized System of Preferences program, support internationally recognized worker rights. The program provides tariff preferences for developing countries to aid in their economic development. The President is restricted from designating certain countries as eligible for benefits based on specific criteria. The Generalized System of Preferences program provides tariff preferences for developing countries to aid in their economic development. Countries must meet criteria related to internationally recognized worker rights to be eligible for benefits. The Obama Administration suspended GSP status for Bangladesh in 2013 but later outlined a plan for possible reinstatement. Since the 1980s and 1990s, corporations have increasingly adopted and publicized corporate codes of conduct regarding worker rights conditions in factories. Multinational corporations sourcing apparel from Bangladesh have posted these codes on their websites, specifying worker rights protections and safety standards. Some groups are concerned that corporations may have limited knowledge of the conditions under which their products are made. The Rana Plaza collapse has raised concerns about worker conditions in Bangladesh and the impact on its role as a major apparel supplier. Corporate codes of conduct are voluntary, and there are calls for U.S. and European companies to work together to address the issues. Response to the Bangladesh tragedy has come from Congress, the Administration, the Bangladesh government, the ILO, and the private sector, with a focus on improving worker conditions and supply chain viability. Congressional interest in the Rana Plaza collapse is driven by trade responsibilities and concerns over brand reputation. Members of Congress have urged businesses to collaborate for worker welfare in Bangladesh. In response to the Bangladesh tragedy, Congress and the Administration have urged collaboration between European and American retailers, the Bangladesh garment industry, the government, the ILO, and NGOs to develop an action plan for improving working conditions. Senators and Representatives have also encouraged major retailers to join efforts to enhance fire and building safety in Bangladesh apparel factories. This has led to the signing of the \"Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh\" by predominantly European stakeholders. The US government has interests in Bangladesh related to trade oversight, investment, and worker protections. After the Rana Plaza tragedy, they signed a Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement to prevent future disasters in the garment sector. The State Department, USTR, and Labor Department responded to the collapse by taking action. After the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh, the US government urged major corporations to coordinate efforts with the government, BGMEA, civil society, and labor groups to improve safety and labor conditions. A $2.5 million grant was announced to strengthen labor standards in Bangladesh. A $2.5 million grant was awarded to improve fire and building safety standards in Bangladesh's ready-made garment sector. The GSP status for Bangladesh was suspended in 2013, affecting 92% of Bangladesh's exports to the US. The implications of the suspension are still uncertain. The US decision to suspend Bangladesh's GSP status in 2013 may lead to businesses pulling out due to concerns about reputation. This could reduce Bangladesh's apparel-making labor force and impact its economy. The USTR's \"Bangladesh Action Plan 2013\" outlined a basis for possible reinstatement of GSP status, focusing on fire and building safety standards in the garment sector. The USTR Action Plan for Bangladesh outlined guidelines for labor law reforms, union protection, and extending collective bargaining rights. The Bangladesh government collaborated with the ILO to improve worker protection after a tragedy. The NTPA, a consolidation of two previous plans, focuses on safety in apparel factories through legislation, policy, and practical activities. Changes to labor laws in July 2013 aimed to facilitate union formation, increase worker benefits, and equalize welfare payments. The Bangladeshi government plans to improve worker protection by adding factory inspectors and conducting safety assessments in garment factories. They have raised the minimum wage for garment workers in response to protests, but it falls short of protesters' demands for a higher wage. The government has also made amendments to labor laws to address concerns raised by the ILO. The ILO is working on bringing Bangladeshi labor laws in line with international standards, focusing on issues like union membership requirements and collective bargaining rights in export processing zones. They are involved in programs to improve working conditions in the garment sector and have established a \"Better Work Program\" in collaboration with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has launched a \"Better Work Program\" in the ready-made garment sector in Bangladesh to improve working conditions and enhance long-term competitiveness. Private sector responses to the Bangladesh tragedy vary, with some companies considering leaving the country while others are committed to staying and addressing labor issues. Disney is among the companies contemplating not sourcing from Bangladesh due to concerns about their business reputation. Many corporations in Europe are also responding to the situation. After the building collapse in Bangladesh, European corporations joined forces to support change. Retailers and apparel companies negotiated a plan with the German government for safety improvements in garment factories. The \"Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh\" was agreed upon by major apparel companies, requiring safety inspections and financial contributions for improvements. Over 100 European corporations, including H&M and Inditex, have signed onto the accord. Several international companies have signed onto the five-year plan for safety improvements in garment factories in Bangladesh, including Inditex, C&A, Primark, Tesco, PVH, and Abercrombie and Fitch. Some U.S. companies have formed the \"Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety\" instead, objecting to the legally binding nature of the agreement. The Alliance has pledged over $100 million for factory remediation, with a tiered fee structure based on apparel exports from Bangladesh. The group of North American apparel retailers and brands, including Gap, J.C. Penney, Macy's, and others, founded a plan for safety improvements in garment factories in Bangladesh. Congressional options for addressing the Rana Plaza collapse may involve oversight and support for change in Bangladesh. Key questions for Congress include the effectiveness of the ILO/World Bank Better Work program and reconsidering GSP eligibility for Bangladesh. Tariff benefits for apparel could be extended to support Bangladesh in improving worker safety conditions. The U.S. government is considering steps to improve safety conditions for workers in Bangladesh, including monitoring changes to labor laws and potential unintended consequences for apparel workers. A provision in the 2014 National Defense Authorization Act would have required compliance with the Bangladesh Accord and preferences for Accord signatories in purchases by the defense commissary system and exchange store system. The final agreement did not include provisions to require compliance with the Bangladesh Accord for garments sold in defense commissaries or exchanges. House sponsors raised concerns about U.S. military purchasing garments from factories in Bangladesh after the Tazreen Fire incident. The sponsors argued that the U.S. military should not support factories putting Bangladesh workers at risk. The Bangladesh Accord and Bangladesh Alliance are compared in this appendix, both building on Bangladesh's National Tripartite Action Plan on Fire Safety for the Ready-Made Garment Sector. The 2013 plan in Bangladesh, supported by various organizations, aims to improve safety in apparel factories through legislation, policy, and practical activities. Similar to the Accord, the Alliance plan requires health and safety committees, inspections, and training, but differs in worker protections. Accord signatories must ensure certain rights for workers, including the right to refuse unsafe work and maintain employment and income. The Alliance plan in Bangladesh focuses on improving safety in apparel factories through legislation, policy, and practical activities. Workers are \"empowered\" to report safety hazards, and a fund is reserved to support workers temporarily displaced during factory remediation. Stakeholders for the Accord emphasize its legally binding agreement with a central role for workers and trade unions, while the Alliance is not legally binding. The Alliance in Bangladesh lacks union participation in factory training and is criticized for not being legally binding or involving trade unions and worker representatives."
