    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the prohibition of animal crush videos. The Congress finds that the United States has a history of prohibiting obscene material and speech, as well as preventing intentional acts of extreme animal cruelty. States criminalize acts such as crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, or impaling animals for no redeeming purpose. Certain extreme acts of animal cruelty are filmed as \"animal crush videos\" for specific sexual fetishes. The Congress deems animal crush videos as obscene due to their prurient, offensive, and lacking value nature. These videos involve extreme animal cruelty and are integral to their creation and distribution. The creation, sale, distribution, advertising, marketing, and exchange of animal crush videos incentivize and perpetuate demand for extreme animal cruelty. Perpetrators remain anonymous, making it difficult to establish jurisdiction and prove the criminal acts. The difficulties described in paragraph (9) seriously frustrate and impede State authorities' ability to enforce criminal statutes prohibiting such behavior, often hindering proof that criminal acts occurred within the statute of limitations. SEC. 3. ANIMAL CRUSH VIDEOS. Section 48 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to define 'animal crush videos' as recordings depicting intentional harm to non-human animals, which is prohibited by law. It is illegal to create, distribute, sell, market, advertise, or exchange animal crush videos in interstate or foreign commerce. This law also applies extraterritorially. Creating or distributing animal crush videos outside the US with intent to transport them into the country is illegal and punishable by fines, imprisonment for up to 7 years, or both. Exceptions include videos depicting normal veterinary practices or animal slaughter for food. The section prohibits the distribution of animal crush videos, except for sharing with law enforcement for analysis. It does not preempt state or local laws protecting animals. Section 48 of title 18, United States Code prohibits animal crush videos. If any provision of this section is found unconstitutional, it will not affect the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances."
