A civil forfeiture statute refers to any federal law allowing property forfeiture. A claimant under subsection (j) can get immediate release of seized property.\" To request release of seized property, a claimant must prove possession, demonstrate substantial hardship if possession is not returned, and show that the risk of property damage is outweighed by the hardship.
