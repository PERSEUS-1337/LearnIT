    "title": "AB 144",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 374.3 of the Penal Code is amended to prohibit dumping waste on public highways, roads, private property accessible to the public, public parks, or other public property not designated for waste disposal by the governing body. It is illegal to dump rocks, concrete, asphalt, or dirt on private highways, roads, or property without consent. Violators are guilty of an infraction, with each day of violation considered a separate offense. Private property owners are not restricted in their use of their property unless waste disposal creates a public health or safety hazard, public nuisance, or fire hazard, as determined by local authorities. A person convicted of violating waste disposal laws faces fines ranging from $250 to $3,000, with higher penalties for repeat offenses. If the waste includes used tires, the fine is doubled. The court may require a person convicted of waste dumping to remove or pay for the removal of the waste as a condition of probation. Additionally, the court may also require the convicted person to pick up waste for at least 12 hours as a probation condition. A person who dumps waste in commercial quantities may face imprisonment for up to six months and fines ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 depending on the number of convictions. \"Commercial quantities\" refer to waste generated in a trade or business, not household waste. A person who unlawfully deposits waste on private property without consent faces fines ranging from $250 to $3,000, with potential imprisonment for repeat offenses. If waste includes used tires, the fine is doubled. A separate fine accrues for each day waste remains unabated. For the fourth violation, no additional fines accrue. \"Person\" includes various entities. Minimum fines shall not be waived or reduced, except in unusual cases. The act does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
