The reduction will be based on estimates of necessary funds and revenue raised by the Act. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund will reduce trade adjustment allowances for workers if funds are insufficient, ensuring all eligible workers receive some assistance without exceeding available funds. No reduction can be made for workers who previously received allowances. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund may adjust or modify pro rata reductions at the beginning of a fiscal year based on estimates of necessary funds for workers described in section 222(c) and revenue raised by the NAFTA Worker Adjustment Assistance Act. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Trust Fund may cease pro rata reductions if funds expended on chapter 2 for workers in section 222(c) do not exceed funds collected under the NAFTA Worker Adjustment Assistance Act in a 1-year period, or if the Secretaries determine Trust Fund funds are sufficient for chapter 2.
