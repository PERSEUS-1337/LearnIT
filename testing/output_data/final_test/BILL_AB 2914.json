    "title": "AB 2914",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 12012.75 of the Government Code is amended to create the \"Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund\" in the State Treasury for receiving and distributing money from Indian tribes based on gaming compacts. The California Gambling Control Commission can use the funds to make distributions to eligible recipient Indian tribes. Section 12012.90 is also amended to apply for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17. The California Gambling Control Commission determines shortfalls in the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for each fiscal year starting from 2016-17 and estimates the amount needed to transfer from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to backfill the Trust Fund. The anticipated number of eligible recipient Indian tribes for the next fiscal year will receive payments, calculated by multiplying the number of tribes by $1,100,000 and subtracting the amount expected to be paid into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund. Eligible recipient Indian tribes are defined as noncompact, nongaming, or limited-gaming tribes as per tribal-state gaming compacts ratified in the California Constitution. The amount allocated to eligible recipient Indian tribes for the next fiscal year is based on actual payments received into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund the previous year, adjusted for changes in tribal-state gaming compacts. The Legislature will transfer funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund for eligible recipient Indian tribes to receive up to $275,000 per quarter, totaling $1,100,000 for the fiscal year. Quarterly payments will be made within 45 days by the California Gambling Control Commission. If there is a surplus in the transfer of funds from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, the surplus will remain in the Trust Fund for future disbursement. Adjustments may be made to future distributions if necessary. If the appropriated amount for the fiscal year is insufficient for each eligible recipient tribe to receive $275,000 per quarter, the Department of Finance will request a budget augmentation from the Legislature with an explanation for the shortfall. At the end of each fiscal quarter, the California Gambling Control Commission's report will identify eligible recipient Indian tribes, the amount paid into the Indian Gaming Revenue Sharing Trust Fund by each tribe, and the shortfall needed from the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund to ensure each tribe receives $275,000 for the quarter."
