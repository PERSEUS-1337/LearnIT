These policies offer tax advantages such as tax-free death benefits and tax-free growth of funds invested in COLI plans. This tax treatment explains why COLI policies are commonly used by corporations. The tax advantages of COLI policies make them a popular choice for corporations. Companies can deduct interest expenses for loans from COLI policies, which can be used to pay for premiums, enhancing the benefits of these transactions. However, Congress has limited the tax deductibility of this interest. While federal tax preferences for life insurance are set by Congress, the ability to purchase such insurance is regulated by states. The regulation of life insurance policies for tax purposes involves both state and federal governments. States require policyholders to demonstrate an insurable interest in the insured, often justified by potential financial costs. Some states allow companies to maintain life insurance policies on former employees, enjoying tax advantages. COLI can be acquired individually or as a group, with the employer typically being the applicant, owner, and premium payer. COLI, or corporate-owned life insurance, is typically acquired on an individual or group basis by the employer. The corporation pays all premiums and receives all benefits, with neither the insured individuals nor their heirs receiving any death benefits. This type of insurance is not an employee benefit and is different from group life insurance provided by employers. COLI can take various forms, including \"key man insurance\" for top executives and financing for stock redemption agreements or deferred compensation plans for key employees. Some companies have also used broad-based COLI programs. Some companies have utilized broad-based COLI programs to fund various corporate purposes, such as executive benefits, supplemental pensions, and retiree medical plans, in response to FASB 106 regulations. This allows for the recognition of post-retirement benefits as they are earned, preventing a growing balance sheet liability. The benefits from COLI include death payouts on employees and tax-free advantages. The benefits of using COLI to finance post-retirement benefits include death payouts on employees and tax-free inside buildup in policy value. Advocates argue it helps companies offset liabilities and continue offering voluntary retirement health benefits. Critics oppose profiting from employee deaths and lack of regulation compared to ERISA plans. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued guidelines in 1996 for national banks to purchase bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies to fund employee benefits. The OCC determined that purchasing life insurance is legally permissible if it is incidental to banking and convenient for the bank's business. National banks can use COLI as a financing or cost recovery vehicle for employee benefits, with the value of COLI being a corporate asset even after the employer/employee relationship ends. Employees have no interest in the insurance other than their claim against corporate assets for stated benefits. The Wall Street Journal and other major newspapers have criticized COLI plans, with reports on major corporations investing millions in policies insuring employees. In 2008, banks reported $122.8 billion in COLI. The practice was also criticized in the film \"Capitalism: A Love Story.\" Representative Gene Green introduced H.R. 130 related to COLI. H.R. 130, introduced by Representative Gene Green, would require employee notice of COLI details, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. Similar to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, it adds requirements for tax advantages of life insurance policies. Since 1986, legislation has limited the tax benefits of COLI, including capping deductible interest for indebtedness exceeding $50,000 per individual contract. Companies must notify and obtain written consent from insured employees, with \"highly compensated\" employees defined as those in the top 35% of the company. Annual returns detailing COLI usage must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury, with the information kept confidential. Congressional focus on COLI has increased in recent years. In 1996, Congress approved legislation that eliminated interest deduction for loans on policies covering employees or officers, except for key persons. Congress also capped deductible interest rates on key persons and pre-1986 contracts. In response, businesses proposed expanding life insurance coverage and tax-advantaged loans to policies covering customers. Congress further restricted interest expense deductions for life insurance loans in 1997. The 1996 legislation eliminated interest deductions for loans on policies covering employees or officers, except for key persons. Congress also capped deductible interest rates on key persons and pre-1986 contracts. In 1997, further restrictions were imposed on interest expense deductions for life insurance loans. Deductions can be reduced based on the cash value of a corporation's life insurance policies to total assets ratio, excluding policies for employees, directors, officers, and specified owners. The IRS litigated cases of abuse and offered a settlement initiative to disclose questionable transactions. Interest deductions on debt related to COLI remain for policies purchased on or before June 20, 1986, and policies covering key persons. President Clinton proposed expanding the pro rata limitation for interest expense deductions in his FY1999, FY2000, and FY2001 budget proposals. This would have made it difficult to distinguish debt used to finance COLI from other purposes. The budget proposals aimed to expand the mechanical pro rata approach by eliminating exceptions, but were not adopted. Disallowing interest deductions for assets invested in COLI could have generated additional revenue. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for 150 years, with varying insurable interest requirements for purchasing COLI. Statutes state that an insurable interest exists if employees benefit from an employee benefit plan or if the corporation suffers a loss if the insured dies. States require notification or consent from employees before a COLI policy can be issued, with some states requiring actual consent and others assuming consent if the employee does not object. In 1993, state insurance regulators adopted model guidelines explaining that COLI is typically used to provide employee benefits. The NAIC revised guidelines for COLI in 2002, recommending that states include elements like recognizing employers' economic interest in key employees and obtaining written consent for insurance participation. The NAIC revised guidelines for COLI in 2002, recommending that states include elements like obtaining written consent for insurance participation and ensuring coverage is reasonably related to benefits for non-key employees. The revisions become effective on a state-by-state basis as legislatures enact laws following the guidelines. As of January 2010, 43 states have adopted NAIC guidelines for COLI policies. Life insurance policies offer tax advantages with investment income not taxed until paid out, potentially escaping taxation if received as a death benefit. Tax efficiency and arbitrage opportunities are key considerations in the tax-favored nature of life insurance. The tax treatment of inside buildup in life insurance policies is a key consideration for economic efficiency and tax arbitrage opportunities. Inside buildup, the increase in cash value, is currently not taxed, making investments in life insurance policies virtually tax-free. Proponents argue that this tax treatment is justified by market failure arguments, as individuals may not adequately plan for the financial impact of their death. Additionally, corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) can serve as a hedge against future lost productivity. Proponents argue that information asymmetries lead to adverse selection in insurance pricing, causing market failure. The current tax treatment of inside buildup in life insurance policies is justified by the principle of constructive receipt. However, these market failure arguments are less compelling in the context of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI). The corporate structure and reporting help corporations understand the economic value of each employee, reducing the likelihood of underinsuring key employees. The purchase of COLI is based on the employee's value to the corporation, not the probability of death. The tax benefits of inside buildup do not offset adverse selection. There is no strong evidence that current tax treatment reduces underinsurance. COLI is seen as a way for companies to prefund certain business expenditures. The current tax treatment of COLI makes it a cost-effective funding method for post-employment obligations, but it distorts investment decisions by favoring COLI over other investment options. This tax treatment may lead to overinvestment in COLI and an increase in the value of benefits. Additionally, COLI policies may not directly relate to the employee benefits provided. The tax arbitrage opportunities in COLI transactions lead to the misallocation of corporate resources towards life insurance, undermining economic efficiency and horizontal equity in the tax code. The tax arbitrage opportunities in COLI transactions lead to different tax liabilities for taxpayers with the same economic income. Legislative proposals aim to restrict these arbitrage opportunities, such as reducing companies' ability to claim interest expense deductions from COLI. H.R. 251, the Life Insurance Employee Notification Act, proposed deeming nondisclosure of employer-owned life insurance coverage an unfair trade practice. It required written notice to employees with COLI policies. H.R. 3669, the Employer-Owned Life Insurance Limitation Act, aimed to prohibit COLI policies on employees with lower salaries. The Life Insurance Employee Notification Act aimed to prohibit COLI policies on employees earning less than $1 million per year. Employers would have been required to disclose these policies to insured employees, with enforcement through civil and criminal penalties. Representative Gene Green introduced similar legislation in previous Congresses. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, H.R. 4, included requirements for COLI policies to receive tax advantages, such as notification and written consent from insured employees. Companies had to file yearly returns detailing their COLI policy usage. This language stemmed from Finance Committee activity during the 108th Congress. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, H.R. 4, included requirements for COLI policies to receive tax advantages, such as notification and written consent from insured employees. The Joint Tax Committee's revenue estimates from the 108th Congress found that the proposed language would not raise appreciable revenue, suggesting it would not substantially change the total amount of COLI policies purchased. H.R. 2830, originally introduced by Representative John Boehner, was amended by the Senate and became the Pension Security and Transparency Act of 2005. The Senate added COLI language from S. 1783 during bill negotiations. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, H.R. 4, included COLI language similar to S. 1783 and S. 219 from previous Congresses. Senator Chuck Grassley introduced S. 1783 with identical COLI language to S. 219 and S. 2424. H.R. 107, the Life Insurance Employee Notification, was also part of the discussion. H.R. 107, the Life Insurance Employee Notification Act, introduced by Representative Gene Green in 2005, aimed to deem nondisclosure of employer-owned life insurance coverage as an unfair trade practice. It required detailed written notices to employees with COLI policies. H.R. 2251, the COLI Best Practices Act of 2005, introduced by Representative Tom Reynolds, included requirements for tax-advantaged COLI policies to cover only directors and highly compensated employees, with notification and written consent needed, along with yearly returns detailing COLI use. Legislation in the 108th Congress introduced bills such as H.R. 414, the Life Insurance Employee Notification Act, requiring detailed written notices to employees with COLI policies. H.R. 2127, the Taxpayer Savings and Employee Notification Act of 2003, aimed to repeal tax benefits related to COLI and include the policy proceeds in a company's taxable income. In the 108th Congress, bills were introduced to address company-owned life insurance (COLI) policies. Representative Emanuel and Senator John Edwards proposed amendments to eliminate tax benefits of COLI, but they were defeated. Senator John Kyl made a point of order against the amendment by Senator Edwards, McCain, and Graham, ruling it not germane to the underlying reconciliation measure. Senator Chuck Grassley introduced S. 2424, the National Employee Savings and Trust Equity Guarantee Act, which included requirements for COLI policies to receive tax advantages. These policies must be on directors or highly compensated individuals, with insured employees needing to provide written consent. Companies must also file a return detailing their COLI policy usage. S. 2424 was reported by the Finance Committee but not acted upon by the full Senate in the 108th Congress. Consideration began on the bill that would become S. 2424 in draft form several months earlier. Senator Jeff Bingaman offered an amendment to remove tax-preferred nature of COLI policies, which was adopted by the Finance Committee. Senator Bingaman re-filed his amendment before the next Finance Committee markup on S. 1637. Senator Kent Conrad also filed an amendment regarding tax advantages of COLI. Chairman Grassley scheduled a hearing to consider the issue, but neither amendment was offered at the markup of S. 1637. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on COLI on October 23, 2003, followed by a markup of draft S. 2424 on February 2, 2004. An amendment by Senator Bingaman was replaced with a modification supported by the life insurance industry, retaining the tax-preferred nature of COLI for \"highly compensated\" employees. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated a negligible revenue impact from this amendment. Additionally, a report recommended repealing pre-1986 COLI grandfather rules. Taxation recommended repealing pre-1986 COLI grandfather rules due to federal tax issues surrounding Enron."
