    "content": "The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules to ensure they align with congressional intent. Enacted in 1996 as part of SBREFA, the CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect. Members of Congress then have a specified time to review and act on the rule. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules by submitting a joint resolution disapproving the rule. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto. The CRA establishes special procedures for considering the resolution, including a process to bypass filibustering in the Senate after 20 days. The CRA process allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules by submitting a joint resolution disapproving the rule. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto. The second advantage of the CRA process is that it can invalidate a rule and prevent the agency from issuing a similar rule without authorization. Additionally, the CRA can expedite the implementation of major rules by requiring agencies to delay the effective date by at least 60 days. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules by submitting a joint resolution disapproving the rule. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto. The CRA can expedite the implementation of major rules by requiring agencies to delay the effective date by at least 60 days. Additionally, the CRA provides Congress with oversight of agency rulemaking and increases awareness of federal agency actions. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn federal agency rules through a joint resolution disapproving the rule. This process serves as a notification mechanism for committees and Members to be aware of rulemaking activity. The threat of a disapproval resolution can pressure agencies for a particular outcome. However, the successful use of the CRA in 2001 suggests agencies may not consider its use. The successful use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) in 2001 suggests that agencies may not view it as a credible threat. Members of Congress may need to explore other options to influence agency actions. The biggest obstacle to enacting a CRA resolution is the likelihood of a presidential veto, especially if the rule is issued by the President's own administration. However, Presidents may be more inclined to sign a resolution disapproving a rule from an independent regulatory agency, over which they have less control. Independent regulatory agencies were created by Congress to operate independently from the President and sometimes even from Congress itself. Independent regulatory agencies, also known as independent regulatory commissions, have limited presidential control. They can remove officials independently, submit budget requests directly to Congress, and receive funding outside the annual appropriations process. Unlike executive agencies, they do not submit regulations to the Office of Management and Budget for review, making their rules less influenced by the President's policy preferences. This independence can lead to regulations that are incongruent with the President's views. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove rules from independent agencies that may not align with the President's policy preferences. It provides a straightforward process for Members of Congress to oppose a rule and allows for expedited procedures in the Senate for minority consideration. This gives Congress a method to draw attention to specific rules and assert their position on regulatory matters. The CRA has increased transparency in the federal rulemaking process by creating a database of rules submitted by agencies. This database allows for easy access to information on final rules, including title, issuing agency, publication date, type of rule, and effective date. However, using the CRA mechanism may also present procedural disadvantages, such as the potential for a presidential veto acting as a de facto supermajority requirement. The CRA does not have \"fast track\" procedures for House consideration, and Senate can only use the disapproval mechanism during specific time periods. Calculating submission and action periods can be challenging, and each resolution can only target one agency rule entirely. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) does not have \"fast track\" procedures for House consideration, and the Senate can only use the disapproval mechanism during specific time periods. Each resolution can only target one agency rule entirely, and if rejected, it could put a regulation in force sooner than expected. Unlike the regular legislative process, the CRA can only invalidate an agency final rule in its entirety, not modify or restructure it. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules, but regular legislation does not have the same expedited procedures in the Senate. The CRA has only been used to overturn one rule due to the President's expected veto of a resolution attempting to overturn a rule proposed by his own Administration. Congress would need a two-thirds majority to override the President's veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn agency rules, with a de facto supermajority requirement for enactment. The CRA is more likely to be successful during a new President's transition. There may be a period at the beginning of each new Administration where rules from the previous Administration are eligible for CRA consideration. The CRA has been used once to overturn a rule in the early days of the George W. Bush Administration. In 2000, the Clinton Administration's OSHA issued an ergonomics standards rule. The CRA resolution was passed by the Senate and House in 2001, signed into law by President George W. Bush, overturning the rule. OSHA has not attempted to re-issue the rule. Five CRA resolutions have been vetoed by President Obama. The CRA adopts the definition of a \"rule\" from the APA with three exceptions, including rules of particular applicability. The CRA adopts the APA definition of a \"rule\" with exceptions, including rules of particular applicability. The definition includes regulations that impact rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, and accounting practices. Notably, the CRA's definition is broader than the APA's, encompassing agency actions not subject to notice and comment rulemaking. Interim final rules are considered final rules under the CRA and are subject to its provisions. Agencies must have a valid \"good cause\" to issue interim final rules, which carry the force of law. The CRA does not apply to proposed rules as they do not meet the definition of a \"rule\" under the CRA. Proposed rules are drafts created by agencies for public input. Proposed rules are not considered final rules under the CRA and do not have future effect until comments are received and a final rule is published. GAO advises agencies not to submit proposed rules to Congress or GAO under the CRA. The GAO does not require agencies to submit proposed rules for review under the CRA. Proposed rules are not considered final and do not trigger the CRA's expedited review process. The decision on whether the CRA applies to a resolution disapproving a proposed rule lies with Congress. The Office of Management and Budget [OMB] finds that a rule is major if it has a significant impact on the economy, costs, prices, competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete globally. The term does not include rules under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. A previous report noted that 100 major rules issued in 2010 had significant economic effects beyond compliance costs. The Office of Management and Budget defines a major rule as having a significant impact on the economy, costs, prices, competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or global competitiveness of U.S. enterprises. Major rules involve transfers of funds, consumer spending prompts, or establishment of fees for federal functions. Rules with over $100 million in annual compliance costs or regulatory benefits are also considered major. Such rules are subject to additional requirements under the CRA, including a report by the Comptroller General assessing the agency's procedural compliance within 15 days of submission or publication. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires an assessment of an agency's compliance with procedural steps for rules, including cost-benefit analysis. It also allows for delays in the effective dates of major rules, giving Congress time to consider overturning them. The CRA allows for delays in major rule effective dates, giving Congress time to consider overturning them. The Administrator of OIRA determines if a rule is major, but agencies are not required to submit rules for this determination. Executive agencies must submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review. The CRA allows for delays in major rule effective dates, giving Congress time to consider overturning them. Agencies and OIRA determine if a rule is major, with independent regulatory agencies not submitting their rules for review under Executive Order 12866. It is unclear how rules issued by independent regulatory agencies should be designated as major under the CRA. OIRA designed a process to determine if final rules from independent regulatory agencies are \"major\" under the statute. Agencies started sending summaries of upcoming regulations for OIRA to assess. Some agencies no longer seem to involve OIRA in this process. The independent regulatory agencies are no longer involving OIRA in determining rules as major, leading to inconsistencies in classification. The CRA can overturn any final rule, regardless of its significance, but agencies must submit rules before they become effective. Agencies typically submit rules when they are finalized and published. The receipt and referral of rules by each chamber are recorded in the Congressional Record and searchable in the Legislative Information System. The GAO also maintains a database tracking rules submitted under the CRA, including links to reports on major rules. The date of receipt in the GAO database may differ from the date received by the House and Senate for calculation purposes. The Congressional Record and GAO track rules submitted under the CRA, with discrepancies in dates. The CRA disapproval mechanism can still be used even if an agency fails to submit a rule to Congress. Members of Congress can seek GAO opinions on whether specific actions qualify as \"rules\" under the CRA. The GAO has issued opinions on whether agency actions qualify as \"rules\" under the CRA. Members of Congress have submitted CRA resolutions of disapproval based on these opinions. The Senate considers the publication of GAO opinions in the Congressional Record as the trigger date for initiating disapproval procedures. The GAO opinions trigger the initiation period for submitting a disapproval resolution under the CRA. Judicial review is unlikely for agency failures to submit rules to Congress. Introducing a CRA resolution is similar to any other bill, with a specific time period for action. The Congressional Review Act allows for a 60-day period for submitting a joint resolution to disapprove a rule, with specific criteria for the resolution to qualify for special parliamentary procedures. The Congressional Review Act mandates a 60-day period for submitting a joint resolution to disapprove a rule, with specific criteria outlined for the resolution. The text of a CRA joint disapproval resolution is specified under Section 802(a) of the act, stating that it must include a resolving clause disapproving the rule submitted by the agency and rendering it ineffective. The inclusion of a preamble in the resolution raises questions about House and Senate consideration, particularly regarding the privileged status of the measure. The inclusion of a preamble in a CRA joint disapproval resolution raises questions about House and Senate consideration, particularly regarding the privileged status of the measure. Members are advised to consult with Parliamentarians for guidance on this issue. The CRA joint resolution of disapproval can invalidate one final rule entirely. It includes expedited procedures for Senate consideration but not for initial consideration in the House. Disapproval resolutions in the House would likely be considered under special rules. Expedited procedures also govern consideration by either chamber of a resolution received from the other. Senate committees can be discharged from further consideration after a 20-day period following publication in the Federal Register. The CRA joint resolution of disapproval can invalidate a final rule entirely through expedited procedures in the Senate. A committee can be discharged from further consideration by filing a petition signed by at least 30 Senators on the Senate floor. The text of a CRA discharge petition resembles a cloture petition. After a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is reported or discharged from Senate committee, any Senator can make a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider it, requiring a simple majority. The resolution is subject to up to 10 hours of debate, with a nondebatable motion to limit debate below 10 hours allowed. No amendments are permitted, and a simple majority is needed for passage. The Senate must act within 60 days of receiving the rule to use \"fast track\" procedures; otherwise, normal rules apply. The House has no deadline for consideration. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for a joint resolution of disapproval to be passed by both the House and Senate. There is no deadline for House consideration, but the Senate must act within 60 days to use \"fast track\" procedures. The CRA does not require companion resolutions in both chambers, but it may be advisable. The \"fast track\" procedure ensures both chambers are acting on the same resolution, allowing it to be sent directly to the President for approval. When the House passes a joint resolution of disapproval, the Senate must first consider its own resolution before taking up the House measure under fast track procedures. To ensure the Senate can use fast track procedures, House sponsors should submit a companion Senate resolution within the 60-day initiation period. If the Senate acts first, the House can consider the measure using normal parliamentary mechanisms without a companion resolution. If Congress adjourns within 60 days of receiving a rule, the periods for submitting and acting on a disapproval resolution reset in the next session. The reset periods start on the 15th day of session in the Senate and the House. If the dates do not coincide, the initiation period will begin on the later date for both chambers. If it's the second session of the same Congress, a disapproval resolution from the first session can still be expedited in the Senate. The \"carryover\" provision allows for expedited action in the Senate within a 60-day session period. CRS can provide unofficial estimates for submitting a joint resolution of disapproval under the CRA. Enactment of a CRA resolution would prevent a rule from taking effect. It is important to consult the House and Senate Parliamentarians for authoritative guidance on the CRA parliamentary mechanism. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows for the disapproval of a rule, preventing it from taking effect or continuing in effect. If a rule is disapproved, the agency cannot reissue it in substantially the same form unless authorized by a new law. The definition of \"substantially the same\" is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation based on various factors like scope, penalty level, and administrative policy. The ambiguity of what constitutes a rule being \"substantially the same\" as a disapproved rule under the Congressional Review Act raises questions about how changes to a rule would be evaluated. The determination of whether an amended or new rule is substantially similar is not clearly defined, leaving room for interpretation. Congress could potentially intervene if it deems a reissued or new rule to be substantially the same as a disapproved rule, as any new rule would also be subject to the CRA. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) precludes judicial review of any determination, finding, action, or omission under it. Evaluating violations of the \"substantially the same\" prohibition may be left to Congress. Agencies can amend rules, which if substantive, fall under the CRA. A joint resolution of disapproval can prevent an amendment from taking effect, but does not affect the original rule being amended. The CRA requires federal agencies to follow a process for congressional disapproval. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit their rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect. Major rules under the CRA have an extended waiting period before taking effect, with specific criteria for determining the effective date. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires federal agencies to submit their rules to Congress and GAO before they can take effect. Non-major rules have specific effective date requirements, but certain types of rules may have exceptions. The CRA allows rules related to hunting, fishing, camping, or rules deemed impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest to take effect on the date chosen by the agency. If a rule has already taken effect, the CRA states that it shall not continue in effect. The CRA provides that rules not in effect shall be treated as if they never took effect. Section 805 prohibits judicial review of any determination under the CRA. Some courts have ruled that judicial review is prohibited, while others have allowed review based on noncompliance with the CRA. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the CRA prohibits judicial review of agency actions based on noncompliance with the submission requirements. Only one federal district court in Indiana has found the Section 805 language ambiguous regarding court review. The court in Indiana ruled that Section 805 language is ambiguous, allowing for judicial review of claims under the CRA. The court concluded that the statute could be interpreted in two ways, ultimately rejecting the interpretation that would allow agencies to evade CRA requirements. The court in Indiana ruled that the CRA allows for judicial review of agency rules to prevent evasion of reporting requirements. This view is not widely held among federal courts, but Congress has other oversight tools available, such as legislative powers, hearings, meetings with agencies, and appropriations language. Congress has the power to oversee agency rules and can use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal a rule by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. The CRA provides procedures that make it easier to repeal a rule compared to passing a regular bill. Members must act on a CRA resolution within a specific time frame after a rule is issued. Congress can oversee agency rules through the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows for the repeal of a rule by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within a specific time frame after the rule is issued. Oversight hearings and meetings with rulemaking agencies or the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) can also provide opportunities for Members of Congress to communicate their views on rules. During the review process, OIRA can influence the content of a rule. Congress can restrict agency funds through appropriations legislation, but this does not nullify existing regulations. Appropriations restrictions only apply for a specific period. The Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act proposes amending the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to require Congressional approval for major rules before they can take effect. This would involve a resolution of approval in each chamber. Earlier versions of the REINS Act have been passed by the House in previous Congresses. H.R. 5982, the Midnight Rules Relief Act, aims to make it easier for a new Congress to disapprove multiple rules issued in the final months of an outgoing President's Administration. It would allow a disapproval resolution to contain more than one rule for late-issued rules finalized by an outgoing Administration. The Midnight Rules Relief Act aims to facilitate the disapproval of multiple rules issued by an outgoing Administration in the final months before adjournment."
